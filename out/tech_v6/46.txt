best possible way to remove dependencies of working with different languages is to use a message queuing library like rabbitmq or activemq

5500030
post	get
will the http endpoint only understand http commands get post etc where as the nettcp end point understands something different

5500046
width	height
on the other hands iframe is more powerful you could have stack frames especially with the transparent background and not worrying about its width or height and it will appear exact like the same page without frames

5500075
button	checkbox
for example it is not a problem to do things like create oddly-shaped button starburst round etc create dropdowns w checkbox to filter data create datagrids which have different uis for different rows based on the data popups that make the background semitransparent or blurry or draggable objects that actually show the object being dragged

5500153
width	height
both the resolutions are considered under the layout-long so you have to set the layout as per the device s height and width manually

5500178
ubuntu	debian
such as ubuntu debian install via apt-get

5500189
children	parent
selectively is possible as overflow is applied to the parent not it s children so it s like having color red and color blue on the same element at the same time

5500189
put	get
they just don t make sense when put together bad example but you get the idea

5500212
yslow	pagespeed
it provides filter tag servlet components to apply various client side performance practices resulting in higher performance rating against pagespeed yslow

5500270
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear

queue	fifo
it is started as soon as a swing top-level component is displayed and it s bascially a worker thread that has a fifo queue of event objects that it executes one after another

5500400
getter	setter
silpa probably remove that parameter as below and use getter setter methods

5500478
portrait	landscape
my video is rendered to the landscape resolution of the device but all of the content in the video is sideways so its still meant to be viewed while the device is in the portrait position even though i have to set my activity to in my manifest i have to do that or else the video doesn t take up the full screen

5500478
portrait	landscape
my question is is it possible for me to set a parameter on my video view that tells it to use landscape mode but have everything else that happens in my app be oriented for portrait mode

5500502

i ve set the document.domain-value for both documents to server-a.de - so far so good works well in all tested browsers firefox google-chrome opera

5500548
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
that still works in firefox and google-chrome but opera gives me a security error attempted to read protected variable xy when trying to call my ajax function from the outer document

5500548
google-chrome	firefox
my conclusion so far i can t violate the same domain policy because then firefox and google-chrome wouldn t communicate with the inner document from outside either

5500548
pop-up	dialog
if you go to this site you ll see it works even with opera a dialog pop-up with test called after a few seconds

5500548
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
now if you copy the outer frame files operatest.html and jquery to another server - so it has to work in my case - you ll see that firefox and google-chrome don t have a problem but opera has

5500560
pull	push
you cannot pull and push files into the sdcard over usb from an activity

5500566
free	malloc
flynn_p4 7171 malloc error for object 0x7fff5fc00760 pointer being free was not allocated

there is a many-to-many relationship between interfaces and files hence the junction table files_interfaces and the only hierarchical relationships are to client there is a one-to-many relationship from clients to files and interfaces

5500842
.htaccess	httpd.conf
apache installed ok loadmodule mod_rewrite is already uncommented in etc apache2 httpd.conf we ve uncommented allowoverrides and followed standard procedure for what is quite a simple install but .htaccess files are still taking no effect - are there any specific requirements for the setup above that would mean the mod_rewrite isn t working

5500844
margin	height
you can do this by using a very high height value and then setting a negative bottom margin

5500846
post	get
records in a database it is a very good idea to use post instead of get like a clickable link so you would have to add a form around every entry that post the data to the server

5500878
bash	zsh
and whats the diffrents between zsh and bash

5500883
folder	directory
a virtual folder or virtual directory is just a link to a physical folder somewhere on the server

5500883
folder	directory
this folder becomes part of the website structure and you can use the virtual directory in the path part of urls

5500883
folder	directory
applications can also behave like virtual directory and you can point an application folder at a physical folder elsewhere on the server

5500978
x86	64bit
if not it s fine to compile it as x86 and run it with a 64bit mono runtime

5500986
filtering	grouping
so we keep all good tags and then we grouping them together and count how many there are for every document grouping is the usual way to count rows in sql. then we just have to keep documents that passed both filtering

5501451
feof	fread
fread and feof works

5501467

the processing and counting of the result may very well have been successful but the actual serialization of the result -- which requires the customer type to have both a setter and getter -- is not

5501467
getter	setter
are you sure the customer type has both a getter and setter

5501505
inherited	properties
how can i specify the usage of this properties to only be used with items that inherited from ienumerabe

5501516
children	parent
i would expect the delete for any children to be executed prior to the parent

5501576
getter	setter
if you use a the getter and setter are defined for you

5501598
integer	unsigned
assuming you have an int overload you also need to add overloads for the remaining integer types and if available and you use it long long and unsigned long long

5501609
serializable	deserialization
you can use a custom wcf error handler and set the fault exception s detail field to whatever you d like without any serializable or deserialization involved in the assignment process in the handlefault or providefault methods

5501644
sorting	filtering
like i wrote before see here entity framework ef allows to use sorting paging and filtering searching without any addons like linq dynamic query library in form system.linq.dynamic

5501662
comparator	comparable
the benefit of using a comparator over implementing comparable is that you can make the comparator specific to the situation that you want with the map and it doesn t effect your object in general

5501691
fflush	gets
i could just fflush it periodically if it hits a certain size or keep a cross reference queue and remove things oldest first when it gets to a certain size

5501697
for-loop	loops
if you ve got multiple conditions to exit your loops then a for-loop isn t the one you should be looking for

5501827
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome firefox and safari

5501844
maven	pom.xml

equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
only shows tostring equals gethashcode and gettype

5501892
strtod	strtok	strtol	strtod	strtol	strtok
strtol and strtod can be of help here but strtok should be used with care especially in a multithreaded environment.

5501922
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried it in google-chrome and firefox on mac and firefox on win

5501942
short	base
in short i am looking for styling for html elements as a base for customization to include in style.css file right after the comment line that begins with primary styles

5501953
int	chars
we want to concatenate these msb and lsb chars values and finally we need one int value for our further processing

5501953
int	chars
but in unsigned chars type concatenate it and the finally the concatenated value must be converted to usable int format

5502002
post	get
but this isn t a get it should be treated as a post and i was under the impression that jquery.ajax was designed to unless otherwise instructed not generate 304 responses

5502032
google-chrome	firefox
the exact same tests work just fine in ie8 firefox 3 and any version of google-chrome

5502056
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
in addition to what has already been said here which are all good answers try looping through the arrays via two separate for loops one for-loop for the first dimension and another for the second dimension

key-value-coding	kvc
you would implement this kind of behavior by using key-value-coding kvc and key-value-observing kvo

5502404
filtering	grouping
the results can be grouping after so you get counters for each search filtering

5502410
ready	each
you still have to ask for a connection but instead of the driver provider creating a whole new connection each time you create a connection it maintains a pool of ready made warmed up objects and hands you one of them

5502418
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
which browsers and their versions ie firefox google-chrome opera for example firefox 2.0 3.0 support the mark element

5502473
width	height
you can position the popup using point object.set the titlewindow s width and height to fit the contents

5502492
client-side	server-side
i think you may be confusing the server-side usage of the api and the client-side usage

5502529
google-chrome	firefox
this is happening in both firefox and google-chrome

5502579
firefox	safari
i have seen both firefox and safari acting differently between win mac and linux systems

5502597
fadein	hide
in other words the first thing fadein does is to hide the element so that it can actually fade in to view

5502598
google-chrome	firefox
it works a treat in firefox google-chrome - the value of loc changing when i scroll the mousewheel - but in ie it remains at -2

5502623
move	drag
what you can do to make the panning effect is to hide the scrollbars and attach some events so that when the user drag anywhere over the document you actually programatically move the scrollbars

5502638
width	height
for a canvas with html height 73px and width 720px

5502661

u have use memcmp instead of strcmp but as benoit said u need to know the length before u do a cmp

5502727
tabcontrol	tabitem
in tabcontrol no tabitem there

5502768
hash	md5
pass the normal md5 hash to this function

5502778
width	height
what values is drawrect getting for width and height

5502799
width	height
you will also need to set the column width to force the text to wrap and you ll probably need to set the header height since the default isn t tall enough to fit two lines of text

5502829
put	get
i put into ecx null it s a caller but i don t get what s really is

5502832
hash	salt
we are having to authenticate against a legacy system where the hash were password + salt and not salt+password

5502845
public	protected
it insists on that because your class is public and the c# destructor ends up overriding a protected method which is visible from outside your assembly

5502852
put	get
anyway although that makes it work it s much better to put the ascii art in a text file or a resource and get at it that way â that avoids all these pitfalls

5502857
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however i believe that prevents jquery from loading in safari google-chrome firefox etc

5502865
versioning	upgrade
alternately if you re able to upgrade to a newer copy of apache poi more recent versioning provide a way to query the functions with implementations at runtime

5502890
post	get
would using post instead of get be out of the question because that wouldn t show anything in the url

5502897
swt	swing
i m integrating a swing application into an bioclipse eclipse plug-in and since eclipse uses swt i have to use the swt_awt bridge somehow

5502897
awt	swing
which can be filled with awt components but the situation is that the swing application contains much of it s functionality in it s main jframe component

5502897
awt	swing
now a swing jframe can not be integrated as is into an awt frame

5502956
jtable	jeditorpane

5502987
hash	md5
we get an md5 hash of

5503007
inherited	properties
for example there is an abstractperson class with standard properties and methods for a person class while another project will implement a person class which will inherited from the abstractperson class to add project specific functionality

5503023
post	get
readline once to get check if the method is indeed post otherwise the content-length header might not be there and the path is correct

5503024
ati	nvidia
and sub-navigation with intel amd --- ati nvidia --- ddr2 dd3

5503083
int	chars	int	double
t should only be of type int chars or double

5503083
int	chars	int	double
is there a better way to define a collection of these and is there a way to enforce t being either int chars or double

5503174
ready	each
then once you re ready to commit to db insert each item from the dataset similar to the examples in the other answers here

5503175
width	height
this creates an image view and places it at 0 0 in the scrollview with a width and height of 50

5503191
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly on firefox google-chrome osx safari and opera

5503248
post	get
i m only interested in handling get or post requests so i designed this abstract class to determine which request has been made and to subsequently call the appropriate function

5503248
post	get
i will only be handling one or the other get or post never both at the same time

5503248
post	get
either an html form will be submitted via post or a redirect will be made with a query string which will be a get request

5503248
post	get
i am not familiar with how a mixed request could be made both get and post but since this is a personal project i have control over whether it happens or not

5503252
try-catch	exception-handling
look at the stacktrace property of the exception-handling in your try-catch block

5503347
children	parent
after going further with my code i realize that it does actually work to capture all the system calls that are coming from the parent and its children

5503427
getter	setter
note the addition of getter and setter to each property

5503448
hide	show
the uiprogressview is correctly set in interfacebuilder and show hide setprogress works fine but setprogress doesn t work through notification

5503459
int	chars	int	double
there is no way to create a subclass of foo whose t is not one of int chars double

5503463
put	get
depending on what format you need the value to be in before you put it in a database then you might just want to take the numeric value and multiple by 24 to get the hours and fractional hours eg

5503468
button	checkbox
if i have a checkbox go away one of the button s methods is that on success of the checkbox removal it .load s the new set of checkbox without page refresh

5503487
httpconnection	downloading
i am downloading file by httpconnection - i am not asking actually on the code it is fully working so i am not posting it here

5503516
postgresql	mysql

it compares thin unicorn passenger torquebox glassfish and trinidad

5503534
getter	setter
it handles is getter for boolean types and getter which take an argument and setter with none or two arguments and other edge cases

5503534
getter	setter
edit to get the getter or setter and its name

5503543
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you re curious about this sort of stuff you should play around with google-chrome developer tools the firefox firebug addon or the safari s developer menu

5503570
express	node.js
i feel that using express now backbone allows you a lot of stable control with node.js

5503604
put	get
they give you a get link and api key i know that you re supposed to put the api key inside the request link

5503636
regasm	regsvr32
also try to register the com file using regsvr32 and regasm method

5503683
width	height
i actually trying to make menu for various size screens but when images are adapted to the width of the screen and when the images are reduced main linearlayout remains the same in height it s like it has size of images with initial height

5503685
min	max
i needed either the first or last item in a collection and a subquery with min max aggregate functions came to the rescue

5503698
uitableview	nsindexpath
void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

5503702
typemock	moles
use moles or typemock to hijack the function call

5503702
typemock	moles
my opinion is that if moles or typemock is used to hijack the clr in order to mock your own code then this is an indicator that some refactoring needs to be done to decouple the objects

5503706
put	get
the bad part about it is that i need to put the site in maintenance mode because of some site errors and im not able to because i can t get into the admin

5503720
min	max
the filter makes sure that only business days are consider for the min max

5503723
post	put
we reproduced this issue with both post and put and raw gae servlets so this isn t restlet related

5503732
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
you either need to omit all other properties except for t_session_datetime from the select clause or add them to the groupby clause or apply aggregate-functions - for instance count min max sum etc

5503740
cvs	svn
we re migrating to svn but once we do our code history won t be available without looking separately at the old cvs codebase

5503740
cvs	svn
i was wondering if there is a fairly easy way to extract individual changes made in cvs one at a time and apply them to svn so we effectively migrate the entire project history onto the new version system

5503741
stdout	fflush
in c you can use fflush stdout after each output statement or setvbuf to change the buffering mode of the standard output

5503776
extjs	ext.net
i know it is a wrapper on top of extjs but my question is is ext.net usable by server code and not via complicated javascript client side code

5503777
interpreted-language	compiled-language
interpreted-language like this is getting closer to compiled-language

5503806
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox the code in option 1 does run correctly

5503962
onmouseover	onmousedown	onmouseover	onclick	onclick	onmousedown
if you want to fire the function with user interaction use one of the many events such as onclick or onmouseover or onmousedown

5503982
width	height
calculate the factors for the transform based on the image width height relative to the target width height

5504012
quicksort	heapsort
one of the classes on the course advanced programming techniques covers a number of sorting algorithms implemented in c++ namely quicksort heapsort and bubblesort

5504035
iprincipal	iidentity
all that remains is to implement simple iidentity and iprincipal classes to store your authorization state

5504071
switching	screens
can this storing into static reference cause any memory leaks after screens rotation on switching other activities

5504074
quicksort	heapsort
quicksort heapsort and buublesort

5504074
quicksort	heapsort
you will see quicksort in the wild and likely even heapsort

5504080
jobs	cron
i can t do cron jobs or task queues since then i would have to run this cron job every second millisecond since the now variable equals the current time

5504097
quicksort	heapsort
merge sort heapsort works o n log n in worst case but it s a bit more difficult to implement than quicksort

5504156
quicksort	heapsort
heapsort is a reliable and theoretically from a complexity theory point of view fast algorithm that - in practice - turns out to be slower than other algorithms with the same degree of complexity like quicksort

5504156
quicksort	heapsort
you might see introsort which uses quicksort + heapsort to reduce the worst-case scenario or even an insertion sort for small inputs

5504183
stdout	stderr
ideally the process would just write something to stdout or stderr for jenkins to record

5504210
getter	setter
if you want to send different javascript objects and dont want to declare getter setter for them in the action class use the following method

5504210
getter	setter
then declare this varible and its getter setter

5504213
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
so far my solution is to display an transparent iframe behind the div which works for firefox safari and ie8 however google-chrome doesn t appear to follow suit

5504246
pop-up	dialog
when i run the above code on the browser it creates the desired file and the browser pop-up a dialog box to save as the file

5504255

equals	gethashcode
instead you should provide a proper implementation of gethashcode and equals in your object that allows you to compare two objects based on their values - if two objects are equals their hash codes have to match

5504907
hash	md5
if you just want to compare custom fields within an object and a full comparison might be too expensive a large binary array it might make sense to generate an md5 hash with md5cryptoserviceprovider.computehash on the field and store that within the object itself it will then be serialized just like any other object property

5505870

i don t see any reason to think that the specification pattern is better than the patterns established by the linq framework so your approach isn t necessarily wrong. however keep in mind that your method will only work on iqueryable objects and not on ienumerable objects

5505884
put	get
half-split works well put var_dumps halfway through your code put a die at the end find which half is going wrong split that in half etc until you get to a point that you can logically guess where the error is and start debugging the syntax etc

free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
for the array to persist in memory it either needs to be declared static or it should be explicitly allocated using malloc or calloc each solution has functionality implications-- the static version will be overwritten the next time the function is called and the allocated version needs to be explicitly free later to avoid memory leaks

5506115

for basic grid-type updating i ve had decent luck with either a linqdatasource or an entitydatasource assuming you re using l2s or ef but again for large applications you re going to want to stay away from things like this separation of concerns and all that

5506827
getter	setter
first you need to understand that properties are just getter and setter methods or functions to speak more generically only that they have a special syntax aimed to make the code that uses them more readable

5506827
getter	setter
the typical way to do this is to define a backing field for the property a member variable where the value will actually be stored and then from your setter and getter you set or return that field respectively

5506827
getter	setter
normally setter are useful to perform sanity checks for example you could check that the passed value is not null but there are many situations when there is no need for checks on neither the setter nor the getter and having to define the backing fields and the setter getter themselves becomes boring bloated redundant and error-prone

5506827
accessor	properties
for this reason c# supports auto-implemented properties if you replace both accessor with get

there s one more thing i wanna to say a basic pattern of oop use getter setter don t use public properties if you use public properties you just graved it to rock

5518626
getter	setter
there re several less or more deep similar topics in oop this getter setter is probably the most important of the basic ones

foo bar actually works that is i don t think you can have both post and get parameters at the same time

5519035
free	strcpy	free	malloc	strcpy	malloc	strcpy	strtok	strtok	malloc
either declare your structure with static storage to store the string arrays and then use strcpy to copy the data from strtok into those arrays or use malloc and allocate memory for your pointers just remember you ll have to free those pointers later unless you want memory leaks

5519035
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
and again if you use pointers with malloc calloc etc. be sure to free that storage afterwards by a call to free

subtraction	add
because if every subtraction had to be two instructions negate and add then you d waste a lot of memory traffic because code would become larger cache space because code would be larger and instruction decode time because there would be more instructions to decode for a tiny gain in cpu simplicity

5519660
implements	extends
i ve implements some validation in my form by extends the form.vtypes class to include another vtype that i personally made

5520569
put	get
if yes you will just get it from cache if no you will really execute functionality of executing part and then put it to cache

5520578
post	get
your best bet would be to actually do a response.redirect however if the request was a post and not a get then you have problems as the post data will be lost.

5520591
free	malloc
using malloc and free it is easy to allocate structures with extra data beyond the end

the problem with redirecting from https to http is that the browser is still going to initiate an ssl connection first to the https url before it can get the redirect so it s somewhat pointless

5520813
free	malloc
it s better to sidestep the c++ object model with malloc free than to twist it to avoid dealing with data as objects

5520830
free	malloc
you can do this without resorting to malloc free or undefined behavior i m not sure about the reinterpret_cast but at least construction destruction can be done just fine

5520832

udp	tcp
if you have a 2mb link you set the tcp traffic to say 1.5mb and leave the remainder for udp traffic for gaming

5522775
udp	tcp
if you are developing a split protocol game you would define a upper bandwidth limit say 25kb s per client for the total traffic and then define separate limits for tcp and udp traffic within that limit 15kb s for tcp and 10kb s for udp

5522775
udp	tcp
generally games tend to use http tcp for downloading game content outside of the game and then switch to udp inside the game to remove the issue completely

5524701
cos	sin
as i know the users position and i am only going to be placing markers that are 1km away from the user at the most can i treat the area as flat rather than ellipsoidal and so then just could take the user s longitude and latitude and + - from them to plot a marker around them using some basic trigonometry such as x cos radius and y sin radius to keep it within the radius-sized circle around the player

subtract	add
btw most simple operations add subtract on integers should map to a single machine instruction in case you are worried

5525069

by the way element s can t have a set width or height so setting their width and height does you no good

5525074
getter	setter
also added a setter and getter in collisionobject so section before the edit

5525111

most all of the rules in the boilerplate s .htaccess can be moved to httpd.conf and in fact this will give a small performance boost because the httpd.conf file only needs to be loaded once by apache whereas it needs to read the .htaccess on every page load

5525270

qtabwidget	qtabbar
in fact the qtabwidget uses a qtabbar internally for its tab bar. so putting a qtabbar within a qtabwidget gives you tabs within tabs

by comparison when using a non-generic ienumerator it s necessary to test whether it is idisposable and call dispose on it if so

5531219
ienumerable	ienumerator
note that use of the non-generic form of ienumerable ienumerator does not relieve one of the requirement to call dispose

5531234

you can give items in the wrappanel a width and height and they re stacked together like a 2d stackpanel

5532478
lxml	beautifulsoup
lxml is many times faster than beautifulsoup so you might want to use that

5532539
stdout	stderr
in short you re going to read from child-process stdout and maybe stderr and write to child-process stdin

5532547
calloc	malloc
calloc 3 and malloc 3 do interact with the kernel to get memory if necessary

5532547
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
but most implementations of free 3 do not return memory to the kernel 1 they just add it to a free list that calloc and malloc will consult later in order to reuse the released blocks

5532547
free	malloc
malloc and free cooperate to maintain a directory

5532547
free	malloc
the alternative is a bit more shared-memory and paging-friendly and it involves allocating memory specifically for the directory. malloc and free have little if any ability to enforce access to individual blocks even when special and optional debugging code is compiled into the program

5532547
free	malloc
finally the few programs that do return large amounts of memory are likely to bypass malloc and simply allocate and free pages anyway

5532559
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this with both google-chrome and firefox

5532587
post	get
you can just get the post variable and connect to your sql database

5532651
switching	screens
the problem when i m running into is when a user views the home screens which is cached clicks log in logs in and then returns to the home screens the login logout button doesn t know to switching

5532696
width	height
so this is why i need to define the height and width of my table-cell div too

5532696
width	height
i m at a loss as to why i cant set the height or width of this table-cell

5532714
stdout	stderr
also i want any messages printed straight to the terminal so i have stdout and stderr be none which causes them to not go to my python program

5532715
gif	png
how can i tranform this regex to search only in src and not all the links that start with http and end with jpg png gif

5532728
width	height
when i apply the resize transformation with smaller width and smaller height the size of the transformed image in bytes is larger than the orig image

5532728
width	height
the funny or sad part is even when i invoke the resize with the same width and height as the orig dimensions are not changed the size transformed image is larger than the orig

5532746
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
there you try parsing the morse code letters into a file but the problem is the for-loop is in the first iteration and then the whole while loops is executed therefore you re always placing the morsecode in the first position of the arrays

5532755
width	margin
#hornav can be whatever width you want 80 as it is now and if you want it to be centred you can reintroduce the margin 0 auto

5532888
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
for a text file create an inputstreamreader around your fileinputstream remembering to specify the encoding and then a bufferedreader so that you can read by lines

5532921
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop does not terminate before the arrays is exhausted

5532932
children	parent
what s happening is that you re matching any file element then applying templates to its parent dir which is matched by the default template for elements which applies templates to all of its children resulting in another match of the same file and starting an infinite recursion

5532951
hash	md5
set the password field to the md5 hash of some random input

5532960
outputstream	inputstream
the main part that s causing problems is code to tunnel an inputstream and an outputstream across a set of http connections so that each read and write turns into a separate post request

5532974
put	get
put it all together and you get

5532993
ant	maven
in the java world use maven or ant or maven and ant

5533012
children	parent
even better than applying an adaptive sort would be to sort the new children first using an adaptive sort as you are breeding the fittest parent first and so would expect to have on average the fittest children appear first then to merge them into the already-sorted list of parent

5533012
children	parent
you can merge them straightforwardly in o n time by walking the parent and child arrays in parallel and inserting children where needed

5533053
google-chrome	firefox
the method i am using works great in google-chrome but is slow in firefox and doesn t work in ie

5533087
jlist	jlabel
the above code gets an item in a jlist when you double click on it and sets a jlabel with settext and item.tostring

5533100
google-chrome	firefox
when i use colors there are not white edges either in google-chrome or firefox so it appears to be strictly a texturing problem

5533123
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
the problems i run into is trying to change the width padding margin etc of the cells to create a spacing generally warps the height width of the thumbnail

5533149
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
note that if you use google-chrome there will be some banding around an equator that in my opinion is a bug in math.random or just a low quality random generator works fine on firefox or safari but the same problem is visible also on android browser

5533154
dictionary	map
1 dictionary map lambda x x a x b

5533226
inherited	properties
the hasownproperty is there to make sure that you re only counting properties from the object literal and not properties it inherited from its prototype

5533259
ssl	https
use ssl encryption https

5533294
int	chars	int	boolean
which means everything except the primitive types int chars boolean etc.

5533294
int	chars	int	boolean
if you want to store them you have to wrap them in their corresponding object wrapper classes int chars boolean etc. so like

5533300
post	get
i didn t explicitly mark the action method as get or post so i assume by default it s post - hence the error

5533324
opera	firefox
however object.keys is not supported in ie8 and below opera and firefox 3.6 and below

5533333
post	get
indeed you would get send back to the edit page in this case what you could do if you don t want anyone to see querystrings is assuming you are using html.form to post the data

5533420
integer	fractions
doing this chops away the fractions part leaving you with just an integer left behind

5533431
octal	binary
this character set is very different from what we re used to using for binary octal base 10 and hexadecimal where the first character is 0 which represents the value 0 etc

5533448
int	chars
i wanted to know if there was a way to cast an array of int into an array of chars in java

5533461
imagemagick	mogrify
i have done some experimentation and found that you can get higher-quality images by using ghostscript to output a high-quality jpeg and then using imagemagick s mogrify command to resize and compress the image though that may be due to my limited knowledge of ghostscript rather than limitations of it

5533517
folder	directory
i want to keep the whole directory structure but want to move them to a different folder

5533521
wcffacility	castle-windsor
my project references the same versions of castle-windsor and castle.core that the wcffacility demo references

5533551
jobs	cron
since you mentioned cron jobs i m assuming you have ssh access to your server which means you don t need a browser

5533551
jobs	cron
these cron jobs can be executed via the command line as such

5533603
trac	bugzilla
the other is a bug tracking database like trac or bugzilla

5533604
children	parent
i suppose i could add every single field to the parent class and leave most of them null in my children but that seems really ugly

5533605
int	chars
with basic types like int and chars you don t have to explicitly allocate memory for them

5533660
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if this is for an iphone app then viewdidappear or possibly viewwillappear will get called when the child view goes away

5533702
subclass	abstract-class
i don t want to make a new instance of the actual abstract-class you can t do that anyway but of the implementing subclass

5533704
ubuntu	linux
update i am using ubuntu linux 10.04

5533717
getter	setter
you could also implement getter and setter in the code below by synthesizing theaudio and using self.theaudio

5533726
implements	extends
you could make an abstract method that extends classes have to implements to construct a new instance

5533750
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
chances are that the uiscrollview methods that pass on the delegate messages use the private ivar to access the delegate rather than using the properties accessor each time

5533776
min	max
work out the difference between the max and the min datetime for the messages

5533796
post	get
either way as you can see i have no idea how to get that post_id in there from the post that the form is being submitted from

5533798
post	get
i m not sure how you got off the ui thread but to get back on you can use post

5533800
int	chars
i wanted to know if there was a way to cast an array of int into an array of chars in java

5533815
post	get
you will need to get the content of that page first extract the token value and include that in your post response

5533816
width	height
all points will be between 0 and screen width height origin is obviously width height 2

5533821
apache	nginx
if you don t want to use apache try using nginx lightweight easy to change etc

5533822
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the piece of code that i pasted above will display a checked box when the document is opened with a variant of ie it will render something else when the document is opened with firefox safari or google-chrome

5533883
cout	cin
the crucial thing is that std cout and std cin are tied see - this means that streaming operations on std cin will first trigger a flush on std cout

5533932
subtract	add
so wouldn t it work its way down to zero doing by subtract 1 then add 3 to each 0 3 6 etc

5533965
versioning	upgrade
i started on the free versioning integrates great with paypal and have since upgrade to the pro for other features

5533988
vbscript	jscript
the suggestion from microsoft is to update your applications to use the outlook object model instead but i can t find any examples at all of how i might use the outlook object model to open a compose window from either vbscript or jscript

5533988
vbscript	jscript
can anyone point me to any short examples demonstrating how to interface with outlook 2010 using either vbscript or jscript

5533991
hash	md5
i m working under the assumption that when you say hash you re refering to a cryptographic one like md5 or sha1 if you re talking about something else.

5533992
3des	aes
you should be able to use 3des in place of aes

5534031
post	get
you have a post with image uploads dependent on the post and you should get them deleted when a post is deleted

5534041
pull	push
the configuration variable eliminates the need for the option to git fetch and git pull in the same way that eliminates the need to specify with git push

5534075
nstimer	nsoperation
is it a correct approach to use an nstimer inside the main method of the nsoperation so that the operation will loop once a minute indefinitely

5534099
hide	show
if i hide divs 1 to 4 but show div 5 then div 5 should appear at the top of the page

5534105
getter	setter
i used property and synthesize to define my getter and setter methods for fillcolor and shapebounds

5534123
versioning	upgrade
this will only upgrade minor versioning of rails 3.0.5 3.0.6 ...

5534136
hide	show
think about it the other way round - hide all your divs by default and then use the javascript to show them as needed

5534149
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it is working in firefox 3.6 but it not working in google-chrome opera or ie8

5534151
post	get
btw why didn t you make rssurl a parameter if it is assigning by post or get

5534160
children	parent
the way we do it is to use lxml and determine the parent and children of every element

5534160
children	parent
if there is no text content difference in the parent and children then we have a set of rules that we follow to retain certain children while tossing the parent

5534178
post	get
the most straightforward way is to use nsmutableurlrequest to create the get or post request and then nsurlconnection to asynchronously send the data and receive the result

5534178
post	get
as for the server side of things you would have it accept a get or post just as you would with a web-based app and output data in an appropriate format

5534219
put	get
if i put name text and alt text in the html for the specific image i get no tool-tip popup

5534231
nstimer	nsoperation
but if you insist on polling you may as well use the nstimer directly rather than messing with a timer inside an nsoperation

5534267
mongoid	mongomapper
for the same reason i very much like mongoid over mongomapper because it leaves the developer the chance to use inheritance as a way of modelling something meaningful in the problem domain

5534274
requestfactory	gwt
i am using gwt 2.2 with requestfactory

5534285
mongoid	mongomapper
for the same reason i very much like mongoid over mongomapper because it leaves the developer the chance to use inheritance as a way of modelling something meaningful in the problem domain

5534315
uitableview	nsindexpath
- bool tableview uitableview tableview shouldindentwhileeditingrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

5534340
sorting	filtering
using this method should also provide things like sorting and filtering for free as well as easier maintenance depending on your viewpoint

5534348
hash	hmac
if you have placed any data in that cookie that would permit a third party monitoring the connection access to the site as your user such as say a simple un-salted hash of the user s password then the hmac is utterly useless

5534363
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this in the latest versions of google-chrome and firefox using jquery 1.4 and 1.5

5534460
getter	setter
actionname paramvalue and paramname all have appropriately named getter setter inside the objectaction

5534496
single-quotes	double-quotes
this is because you re passing the split method a string double-quotes rather than a character single-quotes

5534507
hash	md5
that explains why this will get very slow on big files and probably is not feasible as a solution - i don t have any perfect alternative but an idea would be to only generate the md5 hash on the first 5 kb of data and additionally compare the file size - if both match assume they are identical

5534571
button	checkbox
i have a bunch of form inputs textboxex radio button checkbox etc

5534591
punctuation	words
the official question write a console application that inputs a sentence from the user assume no punctuation then determines and displays the non-duplicate words in alphabetical order

5534591
spaces	delimiter
by default split uses spaces as delimiter

5534597
junit	testng
and junit testng

5534662
folder	directory
simply copy your project on your server and set the domain directory pointer to the public folder

5534680
hide	show
i was only using the mapi.session stuff to hide image attachments so they can be show inline in the message body and not as files attached to the e-mail but this now seems to be incorporated automatically

5534685
udp	tcp
the wikipedia pages on tcp and udp are pretty good sources for learning more about the details

5534688
mouse	keyboard
override the wndproc with setwindowlongptr gwlp_wndproc ... so that the designer code can intercept mouse and keyboard input and use it to initiate a move for example instead of having the mouse input go through to the actual button code which would instead interpret it as a click event

5534688
min	max
but i think the designer is doing a bit of cheating here because usually windows only draws frames like - with titlebar and min max buttons that for actual top-level windows

5534688
move	drag
as the user clicks from control to control just move the drag handle windows to the currently active control

5534689
children	parent
the problem tends is much easier if you have pointers to parent nodes and not just to children mirko s code uses this

5534692
cos	sin
cos radians lng - radians -122 + sin radians 37 sin radians

5534866
mouseout	mouseleave
to do something when a user s mouseleave and element use the mouseout event

5534872
int	boolean
how would i create a list of elements in vb.net save it to a .dat file and make ruby re-create such list as an array with such elements they will be strings boolean and int

5534885
put	get
if you put the hover above the normal style it will get overwritten

5534907
gridview	detailsview
i have two pages the first it s a gridview that bind to dataset the second one have detailsview that bind to dataset that is used for editing and inserting

5534907
gridview	detailsview
upon insertion on detailsview page i want to redirect to gridview page

5534907
gridview	detailsview
with ms_ticket being the gridview page but the insert continue to return the blank detailsview

5534915
junit	testng
surefire has a few problems when you tell it to run both testng and junit tests

5534934
postgresql	mysql
is there any library that given a sqlite mysql postgresql database generates an admin panel to manage data ã la django

5534965
width	height
you can use the plugin found here which contains the calculatespacing function albeit it works on width not height so some modification may be necessary

5534979
dbcontext	objectcontext
it is related to efv4 and objectcontext api but efv4.1 with dbcontext api is just wrapper around efv4

5535068
junit	testng
as cedric said above surefire has some problems with testng and junit tests in the same project

5535068
junit	testng
i found that when running mvn test -x surefire was using the testng plugin instead of junit even though the actual test was a junit one

5535093
google-chrome	firefox
ps im using firefox 4 google-chrome 10.0.648.204 and ie8

5535098
submit	submission
instead of constantly changing the form s submit handler why not check for the question mark when submission

5535116
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
to find the product sub-array just substitute multiplication division for addition subtraction in the above algorithm

5535118
folder	directory
now this page has tag for the files and folder within this directory

5535118
folder	directory
so is there a way to get a list of all the sub files in the folder under this directory

5535130
onresume	onpause
when your app goes to the background looses focus for any reason you get onpause called and when it goes back your onresume will be called

5535165
opera	firefox
it works great in opera opera-mini iphone and a bunch of handhelds n70 motorola but it refuses to work with konqueror and firefox

5535183
google-chrome	firefox
currently indexeddb is only supported by firefox and google-chrome

5535199
serializable	deserialization
basically that s it you just need to create your datacontractserializer instance with that surrogate and use it for deserialization for serializable it won t matter for example

5535304
for-loop	loops
i have for-loop and within that loops i have used insert into command for 75000+ values

5535435
versioning	upgrade
indeed the best solution is to upgrade to a newer versioning

5535582
versioning	upgrade
these changes will not upgrade your store to a complete v2.3 versioning

5535582
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
if you wish to upgrade to a full v2.3 versioning perform only sql database changes and use the database with a new v2.3 installation

5535636
yacc	bison
they are the closest thing that c# has to lex and yacc or flex and bison if you prefer which are the proper tools for this job

5535640
put	get
if you run that transform in your input document assuming you ve put it into an actual stylesheet you should get a simple list of all of the package names as the output

5535643
avro	thrift
apache avro is a data serialization tool similar to protocol buffers and thrift

5535681
cassini	iis
when testing locally on cassini or local iis even with fiddler limiting speed on localhost to simulate network latency there is no problem in ie

5535681
width	margin
i ve added negative -1px margin for ie7 and width 1 for li elements of the menu fixed the ie6 menu jumping out problem but this problem makes no sense to me .

5535709
firefox	safari
it supports a hosts of features to make sure you re getting the page you want aka different agent headers to pretend it s an ie firefox safari android or iphone browser

5535761
put	get
well if you want to try to get information back from the script then don t put the on the end otherwise if you don t want to output to a file but don t need any info from the script then instead of a file

5535773
plesk	mediatemple
i upgraded to a dv server on mediatemple and they use plesk 10.1.1

5535784
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
same works on when user logged in and click to log out link and destroy all session data and reaches to login page that state to click browser forward button no works disable .firefox google-chrome and ie works well on after log out forward and backward disable and fulfill my wants but opera safari and other browser have problem

5535796
chown	chmod
you can set the setuid bit on the script file and chown it to root so it runs as root chmod u+s file.php

5535864
xna	spritebatch
i may be a bit out of date with my xna knowledge but can t you only change blend rasterizer state if the spritebatch is set to spritesortmode.immediate

5535931
int	double
now when you pass it to textview you can pass it as follows assuming that you are interested only in the int part of a double

5535932
udp	rtp
if you want to use multicast and you can switch to udp protocol then i ll suggest you to take in consideration rtp protocol

5536105
disk	ram
there are efforts to allow on disk storage rather than in ram

5536135
int	chars
translate the initial chars in a utf-8 sequence to an int

5536144
pop-up	dialog
but somewhere behind the scenes it was being given an attribute that meant that my pop-up suggestions from the autocompleteextender always rendered behind the dialog couldn t see this however until i returned enough results to get the suggestions apepar from beneath the dialog

5536144
autocompleteextender	modalpopupextender
in the end i had to override the z-index of the panel used as a dialog by the modalpopupextender and the completionlistcssclass of the autocompleteextender thus

5536156
distance	polygons
in practical terms i have an arbitrary area defined as a simple polygons that i wish to know the distance through think of it as a polygons representing a trail - i want to estimate how long the trail is

5536160
hide	show
the parameterless call hide this information so you should make the call where you show which culture information it is that you want to use in the call

5536199
children	parent
with them your example schema would work too you d only need on delete for the parent table to get rid of all the children

5536220
mp3	ogg
i have froyo 2.2 on milestone and the page says audio-element yes but no to pcm mp3 aac ogg webm

i need touchesbegan and touchesended or tap gesture

5536305
portrait	landscape
in my application i used landscape and portrait mode orientation

5536328
post	get
the problem is everytime i submit the form and i get on the active page the post are empty

5536347
width	height
notice that you don t have width or height attributes

5536347
width	height
the image data won t be loaded so the width and height will be zero and so imgwn and imghn will also be zero

5536347
width	height
i d put width and height attributes on #main-back-imghome and

5536347
width	height
the width and height attributes should give you useful imgwn and imghn values even when the image data hasn t loaded

5536379
min	max
just change the min and max times as desired

5536380
free	malloc
and sometimes i get an error malloc error for object 0x68d4ba4 incorrect checksum for free object - object was probably modified after being free

5536382
children	parent
and then run a query like assuming the parent entity set is called parent and that parent entity has a navigation property called children

5536382
children	parent
this will get you feed of parent where each parent will have an inline feed of its children

5536397
firefox	safari
when i change my css and save it nothing is changing in my browser both firefox and safari

5536409
ucfirst	capitalize
ucfirst capitalize the first letter in a string

5536419
cart	oscommerce
i d also recommend looking at either oscommerce or zen cart for an idea of how they do it as they support the same kind of thing

5536519
profiling	instrumentation
sophisticated debuggers and profiling like valgrind or pin use it to instrumentation your code while it is being executed

5536533
serializable	deserialization
you may want to look at serializable and deserialization

5536559
moq	mspec
first you can avoid the conflict between moq and mspec by declaring

5536559
moq	mspec
i ve been trying out your sample code and i think it s got more to do with mspec than moq

5536559
moq	mspec
fyi i m using moq v4.0.10827.0 and mspec v0.4.9.0

5536583
superclass	subclassing
i am abit worried about what happens to my transactionattributes in the superclass can i trust a required to actually use transactions when called from the subclassing when the subclassing has not_supported as class default

5536616

ogv plays in firefox but don t want in opera

5536616
gif	png
q 0.9 application xhtml+xml image png image jpeg image gif image x-xbitmap

5536644
freemarker	velocity
if you have a defined file layout with different content you should consider to use a template engine like freemarker or velocity to generate your files

5536644
serializable	deserialization
if you realy want to map your files to objects than it would be a serializable deserialization as angelom mentions

5536644
gson	jackson
json jackson gson

5536659
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome and firefox but ie it s a big mess up

5536706

post	get
i don t have any code to show you right now reply back and when i m home tonight i can post something that should help but yuo will probably get better results placing your rotate code in an asynctask see the painless threading area of the dev site for more info

5541189
rss	feed
i m trying to parse an rss feed using javascript

5541220
int	boolean
that includes all int types + boolean

5541224

you can use a query similar to the following to post a record then get the id

5541234
sorting	filtering
i want to create a service that has many parameters for sorting and filtering over 50

5541235
versioning	upgrade
we ll probably refuse from unicode support for now and will upgrade to the 1.0 versioning later

5541249
yesod	hamlet
in the yesod web framework we have taken the haml concept but used normal html syntax made dry- we call it hamlet

5541325
post	get
you can now post a keyword or a set of keywords to lucene get an id of document and retrieve the document from berkley db

5541335
post	get
i m guessing i would get the uitabbaritem view and drill down the subviews until i find it and then do the same thing as in the post above to get the icon out

5541335
post	get
i m hoping to get direct input from yonel as well to say thank you can t post a comment on that thread for the images from the map

5541340
hash	md5
i ve seen other approaches that attach a version number or md5 hash to a js src querystring

5541340
google-chrome	firefox
however my javascript is still getting cached in multiple browsers google-chrome firefox when i push a new version of my site

5541365
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
the question is how to configure ntlm in safari opera google-chrome

5541446
children	parent
could you just put an exit listener in the parent process that signals the children

5541449
alarmmanager	appwidgetprovider
just set an alarm with an intent that your appwidgetprovider receives using the alarmmanager

5541456
bazaar	git
however with as much git experience as you have i think you would find bazaar limiting

5541456
pull	push
i would recommend starting them out without any branching just pull commit and push from master to origin

5541522
min	max
your min is 00 00 and your max is 24 00 not inclusive

5541522
min	max
if you require that lower upper you can represent 21 00 24 00 but you are still unable to represent 21 00 02 00 an interval that wraps across the min max boundary

5541529
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
so do i use argumentexception here or something like invalidoperationexception because there s more than one parameter causing the problem

5541532
pthreads	ucontext
note that the ucontext functions are listed as obsolescent in the two most recent editions of pthreads

5541548
client-side	server-side
also you can move server-side functionality to the client by the use of page methods which basically creates a javascript function out of your server-side method and allows you to use it client-side

5541560
integer	unsigned
refuses to compile because integer constant is too large for long type even though it should be well within the size limits of an unsigned long long

5541587
pthreads	ucontext
setjmp is portable iso c89 and c99 and ucontext obsolescent in susv3 and removed from susv4 pthreads 2008 is not

5541587
ucontext	longjmp
in practice if you used nasty hacks with setjmp longjmp and signal handlers and alternate signal handling stacks you could make these just about as powerful as ucontext but they were not portable

5541588
textview	imageview
you may add a couple textview and an imageview but if the horizontal space gets too small the two textview are going to start wrapping around independently wich is going to look weird

5541615
ubuntu	linux
i have a network of 100 machines all running ubuntu linux

5541636
temp	tmp
especially since windows automatically initializes the tmp and temp environment variables for you

5541660
accelerometer	gyroscope
i never really understand the applications of the gyroscope on the iphone ipad does it serve the similar function as the accelerometer but like an improvement to the accelerometer

5541667
post	get
i stumbled across this post which describes using a linked server to get around the problem without having to code a custom parsing routine

5541669
hide	show
instead of using separate show and hide calls use .toggle showorhide

5541760
ubuntu	linux
does anyone have suggestions for a c++ graphics rendering library that works well with linux ubuntu in particular for now

5541783
google-chrome	firefox
for dose who are using document.write is not a valid dom procedure so in firefox and google-chrome if you use it in an xml xhtml strict with content-type as text xml don t work

5541790
pop-up	dialog
i want to have the keyboard show automatically once the dialog pop-up

5541790
pop-up	dialog
this opens the keyboards once the dialog pop-up and also closes the keyboard once i press the ok button

5541790
pop-up	dialog
dr i want the soft keyboard to be shown when my dialog with an edittext and a button pop-up focus on edittext

5541811
tcplistener	tcpclient
the tcpclient objects come from a tcplistener

5541837
uitabbaritem	uibaritem
uitabbaritem inherits from uibaritem which inherits from nsobject

5541837
inherited	properties
since it doesn t inherited from uiview i don t know that you re going to be able to get the information you want just with a properties

5541838
accelerometer	gyroscope
gyroscope measures orientation where accelerometer measures movement

5541852
int	double
javascript has no concept of int according to the standard all numbers are ieee double which means they have 52 bits of mantissa

5541887
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox 4.0 google-chrome 10.0

5541907
int	boolean
if for example default values would also be sufficient such as 0 for int false for boolean etc. then you can omit the null check and simply utilize

5541917
pull	push
what this means is that basic git pull and git push operations won t work since git assumes that without a workspace you don t intend to commit any changes to the bare repository

5541965
public	protected
the best approach for accessing package-level fields in legacy java code would be to write a class in java that wraps the existing class and which exposes the package protected methods and fields from that class with public methods

5542009
versioning	upgrade
if you can t upgrade to a newer versioning the workaround is to disable partial state saving as below in web.xml see also jstl in jsf2 facelets.

5542009
versioning	upgrade
solution is to upgrade to a newer versioning

5542018
internationalization	localization
reading your posting i think you are looking at internationalization i18 and localization l10n which are kind of separate

5542019
cout	cin
but given that a c++ solution is acceptable i d recommend cin string getline and cout for i o

5542030
cout	cin
but you can also use cin cout in place of the scanf printf you have there

5542034
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
json is supported on firefox google-chrome and safari i believe

5542064
direct3d	directx
there are better options - slimdx for example wraps all of the directx direct3d types including the dx10 11 interfaces

5542105
mouse	trackpad
using the trackpad on os x yields very similar effects to using a mouse wheel yet gives very different event values and yet the device difference cannot be detected by js

5542105
google-chrome	firefox
it has two flaws on os x firefox on os x will produce values 1 3 what they should be and google-chrome on os x will produce values 1 40 what they should be

5542105
google-chrome	firefox
suggestions for detecting and improving the behavior on firefox and google-chrome on os x are welcome

5542112
width	height
you could use a background image with the height of one line of text plus margin-bottom and width 1 pixel

5542116
subtract	add
in essence to get the subpaths to subtract when you add them together you need to draw them or rather construct them in opposite directions one clockwise and the other anti-clockwise

5542121
int	chars
try to log int and you will see that there are chars inside you cannot put in a url

5542129
post	get
using fiddler i was able to see that when items are being added to a marketing list it s done as a post not a get request

5542165
hash	salt
#1 do not store the password - store a salt hash

5542175
children	parent
i am teaching myself to program by making a simple core-data drill-down app with a uinavigationcontroller where you select a grandparent entity to see a uitableview of parent and then select a parent to see children

5542197
win32com	pythoncom
i am using win32com and pythoncom but the documentation for both is rather vague and i cannot figure out how to implement this

5542276
implements	extends
no you ll probably be better off by writing a base class that implements nsfetchedresultscontrollerdelegate which would probably be a uitableviewcontroller subclass and contains a nsfetchedresultscontroller instance and then extends your base class wherever you need it

5542282
put	get
when you put your code to make the ajax call you can get the url from the form s action but that depends on you

5542289
min	max
for a group by query you can have only those columns in the select clause which are either present in the group by clause or are aggregate functions such as min max avg count

5542292
hide	show
if i now click on widget 2 widget 1 s menu gets a hide event and widget 2 s menu gets a show event and comes up

5542311
toolbar	docking
otherwise i d suggest docking the toolbar on a separate line to the other tool bars or break things up a little with some popupmenu tools

5542344
maven	m2e
i m using eclipse helios with maven plugins m2e and maven integration for eclipse wtp

5542376
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it also has native border-radius rounding in browsers that support it opera 10.5+ firefox safari and google-chrome

5542378
profiling	debugging
try using the same profiling for debugging and build and run as debugging not release with the target set to your device

5542411
flot	fusioncharts
you could use fusioncharts or flot

5542421
hide	show
instead of a linklabelplayername1 and textboxplayername1 you will have a linklabeltextboxplayername1 and none of the show hide focus stuff will clutter your form code

5542425
bash	zsh
bash and zsh have array extensions

5542425
bash	zsh
but if you find yourself thinking that a bash or a zsh extension would be helpful for a script the correct choice is instead to rewrite in perl or python

5542435
boost	eigen	eigen	ublas
i haven t looked that much at boost ublas but eigen sure is nice and has good performance as well

5542448
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu is completely utf-8 based aware for some time now

5542468
hash	md5
the php session id is an md5 hash which makes it 128 bits in length

5542586
google-chrome	firefox
it worked for me using firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 10 but i have one test user who said it didn t work for him and he didn t even get to the allow and not allow screen and yes he was using firefox as well

5542610
folder	directory
i have to access one of the image in images folder in root directory

5542637
hash	md5
i set up an endpoint and printed out the request objects from a silent post as well as the _server superglobal - it does not seem that they send any identification other than the md5 hash set in the cp

5542654
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
as of jquery 1.5 the success callback function receives a jqxhr object in jquery 1.4 it received the xmlhttprequest object

5542654
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
however since jsonp and cross-domain get requests do not use xmlhttprequest in those cases the jqxhr and textstatus parameters passed to the success callback are undefined

5542664
client-side	server-side
the preceding code illustrates conversion from a server-side data type to a string which can be parsed and thus converted to a client-side object

5542665
width	height
each section fills the browser window with 100 width and height so when you click a menu link it looks as though you re sliding into the next page but it s really just one long page

5542665
width	height
in section 3 i have embedded a google map as the background with 100 width and height and a z-index of 1

5542686
versioning	upgrade
i never had the problem before but i recently upgrade to versioning 9.03 and also os x lion preview release 2

5542711
disk	ram
a ram disk is not always faster make sure you test different products with different

5542711
disk	ram
a solid state drive may even be faster than a ram disk which surprised me

5542793
awt	swing
bear in mind however that awt swing support amongst many other things is pretty much dead

5542822
hash	md5
the md5 hash returned in the silent post is a hash of a string that includes an md5 hash value set in security settings that presumably only authorize and you know

5542831
implements	extends
create class that extends observable and implements runnable

5542837
hide	show
and than use that to show or hide your item

5542844
folder	directory
but it doesn t find these dlls because the dll search path doesn t contain the test folder it looks for the dlls in the gac and the vstesthost directory

5542856
gif	png
is your new icon in the same format as the other ones jpeg png gif

5542865
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in performing some cross-browser testing i noticed that my images flicker when the page is refreshed - but just with google-chrome safari - not with firefox or ie

5542865
google-chrome	safari
when rails serves the page it flickers in google-chrome safari

5542865
google-chrome	firefox
basecamphq.com flickers on refresh with google-chrome but doesn t or at least it does much less with firefox

5542873
put	get
if i put the ab.c in there and gcc ab.c i get bunch of errors because it cannot find the headers etc

5542901
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
i m using ajax to make a user control which contains a panel that contains label and radiobuttonlist or checkboxlist according to a condition

5542951
post	get
whenever the user requests a new page he needs to post or get this key as http parameter if the user wants to be identified as logged in

5542951
ssl	https
if you do it over ssl https it is probably more secure

5542961
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the demos now need a minimum of google-chrome 15 safari 6 firefox 15 ie 11 or opera 15

5542961
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
note if you need earlier browser support please ask as a previous version of my answer did work with google-chrome 12 safari 5.0.3 firefox 4 and opera 10 but i have updated it now that new browsers support prefix-free css3

5542965
codeigniter	yii	codeigniter	kohana	kohana	yii	versioning	upgrade
coming from codeigniter and seeing how compatibility between 1.7.x and 2.x was fairly pain free only renaming a few classes and also knowing that there is no compatibility between major versioning of kohana i m wondering if yii is considered a friendly framework for people like myself who like to upgrade to newest versioning as they come out or will i be stuck with the choice of either staying on an old versioning or rewriting large parts of my existing code to be able to upgrade

5542988
ftgl	freetype
i use ftgl which builds on top of freetype

5542994
put	get
as the developer you should probably put on your waders and get involved asap.

5542996
bash	zsh
ctrl + s to forward search works in zsh for me but not bash

5542998
textarea	textbox
when i set the disabled property of an asp.net textbox control to false the final rendered html textarea tag sent to the browser includes an class aspnetdisabled attribute in addition to the disabled disabled attribute

5543092
administration	activation
after talking with some people on #couchdb irc it seems that they can t figure out out a way to do something administration like activation users that click on a email link with out using a backend process like a node.js server which keeps track of the _changes feed

5543138
post	get
--- snip to get post length under max chars...---

5543168
int	chars	int	double
if you specify other atomic vectors int double logical complex along with chars vector they will get coerced to chars

5543219
serializable	deserialization
makes json serializable and deserialization of complex types

5543355
ubuntu	debian
alternativly i could start django on startup but i would need a start stop script for ubuntu debian

5543363
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for browsers like firefox google-chrome safari etc

5543366
dictionary	map
i m trying to load all my categories from the database and then map them to a map dictionary

5543428
for-loop	loops
actually java automatically translates the first for-loop in something that looks like the while loops

5543472
google-chrome	firefox
where firefox and google-chrome treats elements with z-index document-wide in ie as you likely know z-index is based upon the parent s z-index first

5543472
google-chrome	firefox
the element its index is being compared with is not the parent div as it would be in firefox or google-chrome but the content inside the div the p element

5543582
hide	show
is it possible to hide the tab bar so that it normally doesn t show until the user touches the screen then the tab bar will with animation show up at the bottom

5543600
implements	extends
but there is one thing which named classes can do and anonymous classes can t implements more than one interface or extends a class and interfaces too

5543603
octal	decimal
others have covered the immediate problem â that you re accidentally treating a number as octal rather than decimal â but the deeper problem is that you re storing numbers as strings

5543624
client-side	server-side
it s not quite ideal because your server-side javascript probably has features that you can t guarantee will exist on the client-side unless you limit your users to say recent versions of firefox

5543624
client-side	server-side
if you re like me you don t want to limit your server code to js that happens to run in every browser so your server-side js and client-side js will be subtlety different

5543624
client-side	server-side
i m often frustrated when having to use a server-side language that s completely different from my client-side language javascript

5543626
dictionary	map
use a mutable dictionary or another relevant collection type instead of a map

5543641
folder	directory
now if i create the dated directory in the uploads folder and chmod the folder to 755 the upload works fine but if i try to chmod the uploads folder without creating the dated sub folder which i need django to do i am getting a permissions error

5543665
chown	chgrp
you ll need to either chgrp or chown the media directory to the same group as your python process and ensure you have at least g+rwx on directories and g+rw on files

5543667
webclient	webrequest
this is a limitation of silverlight which requires asynchronous network access wcf proxy calls webclient webrequest etc.

5543667
webclient	webrequest
i do not know if webclient webrequest in silverlight share this behavior

5543668
width	height
this removes the layout_height of your tablelayout to wrap_content and it removes the height and width settings of your tablerow because the children of a tablerow do not need to specify the layout_width and layout_height attributes in the xml file

5543677
put	get
is there a way i can get the image stored in the front buffer and put it onto a surface in video memory

5543690
int	double
because -1 and 9 are int so -1 9 is an int division with the result 0 which when cast to double is 0.0

5543700
width	height
you dont need the height and the width

5543700
width	height
create one class that has only the height and the width

5543704
folder	directory
in the directory list below if does not exist create it by right-clicking on target folder and choosing add system folder

5543707
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the solution provided on the jscrollpane demo site doesn t work for me either and i have tested in firefox google-chrome and safari

5543719
next	except
i works perfectly except it loads all the page layout with the next results not only the box div in my _user partial

5543720
margin	haslayout
this is a haslayout -related ie bug and a thorough treatment of it can be found at has layout negative margin bug

5543720
width	height
like position height and width -- yikes

5543763
ccscene	cclayer
have either a separate ccscene instance for each of your levels or a separate cclayer for each of your levels

5543782
post	get
question related to this post i think he is offline tho so i cant get any feedback atm

5543785
button	checkbox
after the user click on the checkbox to select the download files on the treeview then they can click the submit button

5543806
pull	push
i ve done this because i want programmers to be able to do a hg pull from the main repository but not an hg push any changes get pulled by an hg serve from their work and checked first before going back into the main repository

5543862
versioning	upgrade
i even upgrade jquery ui to the latest versioning 1.8.11 but that did not help

5543892
min	max
is it possible to get min max values of the x axis timeaxis after the data was loaded into the chart s store

5543900
post	get
make a index action method in the post controller and then your app get your index view

5543929
selecteditem	selectedindex
nowadays selecteditem will be null at the same time as selectedindex is -1

5543942
google-chrome	firefox
this works -- i tested it in google-chrome ie8 firefox 4

5543984
dictionary	map
then read each language dictionary into your hash map

5543994
post	get
more likely it s looking at the -tag and determining based on that where if should make a post get request

5544032
versioning	upgrade
issue i see some sort of an artifact on chrome ever since i upgrade to the latest versioning 10.0.648.204 - the background on the video is no longer white the video used have white background

opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
there is no problem with firefox safari opera

5544057
ssl	https
if i make a special for the login page requiring ssl and one without for the rest of the pages and i use form authentication with pointing to the login page i configured before to use ssl when the user requests a protected page the url in the bar isn t login.page it s the page requested but the body is login form and i can login without using https

5544068
ssl	https
of course there is an area to specify what url my facebook app should serve when an https connection is used but i don t really have the option of using this since there s no ssl on the host

5544068
ssl	https
it seems like more work than it is worth to set up the client with a free ssl cert just for a simple fb landing page but i m wondering if there is a way to force a user with an https session to be served http convent via facebook

5544155
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox

maven	m2e
i was developing my gwt 2.2.0 application using maven m2e in eclipse j2se 3.6 with google eclipse plugin the newest version as of april 2011 and it mostly worked fine until bang

5544176
dbcontext	objectcontext
dbcontext api doesn t offer any function import like edmx and objectcontext api

5544178
getter	setter
2 the original setter is invoked because nhibernate just creates a proxy which calls the underlying getter setter

5544184
width	height
use double qoutes around your height and width values and it is just a number the px does not have to be declared

5544221
min	max
i went to manage fields for this specific content type and removed the max min resolution for this content type and it worked

5544266
postgresql	mysql
if you re working with a decent database eg oracle or postgresql but not mysql the database will have a pretty good idea when it is going to be worse to use an index than it is to do a mergesort and will choose to do the right thing

5544296
ilist	icollection
do not implement ilist icollection or c# restriction only

5544296
ienumerable	icollection
in this case bitarray implements both ienumerable and icollection

5544297
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

i ve ready some posts regarding the heroku or engineyard for rails3

5544338
int	chars
for c something like this would work or roll your own using int or chars arrays with a spot in the array representing a digit

5544343
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox do a nice job of not making elements that remain unchanged between navigation stay on the screen

5544356
put	get
i made the same for backend in apps backend lib myuser.class.php but using is_admin untill now everything is perfect just that in the backend when i m going to edit a job the sfguardsecurityuser in the session get lost why because the isauthenticated function that is called in this page is the located in apps frontend lib myuser.class.php so when i try to change the page i get logged out cuz isauthenticated function called is the located in apps backend lib myuser.class.php sounds rare but it only happens in the edit page of the jobs now i m stuck here hope you all understand me and to be more specific when i go to the job edit page and in the action i put a print_r _session i can see this piece

5544360
multiplication	exponent
to calculate powers use dihotomic algorithm which uses binary representation of exponent and reduces resulting number of multiplication

5544428
hide	show
so if the dynamic array changes it show the divs present in the dynamic array and hide the divs not present

5544430
button	checkbox
the intended behavior is that when the user clicks in the status textarea the div under the status textarea slides out revealing the submit button as well as some other checkbox

5544430
button	checkbox
if the user clicks anywhere else on the page except a link or any element that has the class prevent_slideup the div slides up hiding the submit button and any checkbox

5544430
google-chrome	firefox
this code works as expected in google-chrome and firefox however in ie when a link is clicked for the first time it seems that the element stored in var target is actually a div instead of an anchor

versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade to one of them or to any following versioning like xe

5544504

opera	firefox
also i tested this on opera 11 ie8 and firefox 3.6

5544566
ireport	subreports
i need to create a report where the number of columns changes based on the data being passed to ireport just like with a subreports

5544569
int	chars
reads when you dereference f and call it with a int you get a chars ie

5544569
int	chars
f is a pointer to a function which takes int and returns chars

5544593
inherited	properties
another solution im thinking about is making a superclass that holds a list of properties and then have factory and store inherited from this class that should make them share the index i think..

5544606
dbcontext	objectcontext
i m working with a framework however that still uses objectcontext instead of dbcontext so i would like to know if the above solution can be used in combination with objectcontext

5544614
mouseup	mousedown
inside a mouse event handler mousedown mouseup mousemoved etc. you can ask the event for its locationinwindow

not only that but the same design has been chosen by windows forms .net gtk motif and various others

5544715
google-chrome	safari
i m using jscrollpane and i had some issues in google-chrome and safari with the height of the scrollable area

5544715
width	height
to make jscrollpane work i have to set height and width for any image inside the scrollable area

5544715
width	height
to avoid setting width and height manually i realized.

5544715
opera	safari
now calculates correctly the images styles and finally jscrollpane works in safari and opera

5544719
prepare	execute	prepare	pdostatement
in 2 you can use pdo to prepare pdostatement object and execute it passing arguments securely in second you can probably prepare this query and pass arguments but must read documentation how do this

5544721
google-chrome	firefox
ie-6-8 may not be liking the dangling comma at dataindex open_amount and any other syntax errors that firefox google-chrome would forgive

5544721
google-chrome	firefox
can you post a screenshot of what you are seeing in firefox google-chrome

5544725
cpython	pypy
if so see panda3d numpy cpython and pypy

5544725
pyopengl	pyglet
use pyglet pyopengl with pyglet panda3d although you are writing in 2d you can still use a 3d engine or perhaps some other library

5544732
width	height
it won t solve your problem because width and height is calculated when the event is fired

5544732
width	height
if images are not loaded you re screwed width and height 0 or some pixels in ie

5544742
hide	show
call setlistvisible false to hide the list and setlistvisible true to show the list

webclient	webrequest
do webrequest and webclient have this behavior

5544862
nsimage	nscursor
if one of the built-in cursors doesn t look how you need it to you can initialize a new nscursor with an nsimage and -set it to be the active cursor

5544864
post	get	post	put	put	get
also the content-type header is for specifying the media type of data sent to the server in a post or put request so you should just leave that one away for get requests

5544878
width	margin
i just noticed that you have the dropdowns wrapped in a div...you could modify that div the one with the class dropdown giving it a specific width 240px ish and that should center them since you ve already applied margin auto to that class

5544884
hash	md5
i am having a hell of a time trying to md5 hash this with php.

5544898
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
i would recommend avaudioplayer in the avfoundation

5544909
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
for example i ran into an issue using the tag - google-chrome and firefox worked like a charm but opera borked

5544920
uibaritem	uiresponder
if you look at each of their superclasses you will find that uibarbuttonitem inherits from uibaritem which inherits from nsobject not related at all to uibutton which from uiview and conforms to the uiresponder protocol

5544931
mp3	aiff
also - you don t want to use an mp3 for a sound you want to use a non-compressed file format i suggest aiff from experience because there isn t dedicated decoding hardware to support the sound decoding you re trying to do

5544964
width	height
if i remove display block - the caption shrinks to appropriate height but to small width

5544993
uiview	calayer
the uiview and the calayer s dealloc are both called but i can t tell for sure what order since the app using this has dozens and dozens of these cells - i guess i could change the nslog to display the cell s address in the console and match up a uiview dealloc and a calayer dealloc but i haven t bothered to do this

5545011
min	max
as to the second part of your question take the end value and use it as the start value of another slider you ll want to set that in the min and max values make the second start at the end of the first slider s max value

5545064
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is the same in firefox and google-chrome

5545076
uiactivityindicatorview	viewdidload
in your rootviewcontroller viewdidload method create and display a uiactivityindicatorview a spinner

django	web.py
just really looking to develop a good build deployment strategy for python web applications written in mostly django web.py

5545230
implements	extends
the type parameter t of class bst is expected to extends actually implements -- thank you generics

5545253
int	chars
type casting will not change them in the slightest unless you change them to a narrower int type chars short

5545275
portrait	landscape
i am trying to give my uilabel dynamic height so that my layout of other labels looks correct in both landscape and portrait

5545275
portrait	landscape
in portrait my text wraps to the second line in landscape it does not

5545275
portrait	landscape
how can i get the height of my uilabel when it has two lines of text or more portrait and get the new height which is one line when in landscape

5545279
onchange	onkeyup
judging from your submitted code i m gonna assume it works but not for every key pressed because you need to use either onkeyup or onchange

5545296
onkeyup	onblur
unfocus is also not a valid event you are thinking of onblur but what you want is onkeyup

5545331
execvp	fork
i think i m doing all right using strtok to parse input and fork and execvp to run the processes but i m not doing all right implementing ncurses correctly

5545331
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
also i ve been trying to use a char for the input buffer and a char for the command history but i have no experience in c so despite reading up on malloc calloc and realloc i m not sure of the best way to store commands in the buffer and the history

5545351
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
on each page i have a uinavigationbar with a uinavigationitem on set up through interface builder and set to take me back to my main view using the following code

5545376
post	get
i even tried changing post to get in insertdata and passing in the data manually

5545379
mp3	flv
don t get me wrong if you wanted to there are plenty of half-completed or basic mp3 encoding solutions out there as well as flv as referenced above but it s going to take invested time and effort to learn these file formats learn how these existing classes frameworks work learning to extend them and then stabilize and debug them

5545393
width	height
in your code as it is now in either orientation you will get the same width and height since you always pass a width of 300 to the sizewithfont method

5545399
accessor	properties
the reason works is that it is ruby s special syntax for properties accessor

5545431
free	malloc
just like you have one free statement for each element in the array plus a free for the array as a whole you should have one malloc for each element plus one malloc for the array as a whole

5545437
width	height
as far as i know you don t need to know the height and width of the final excel worksheet when populating a worksheet using php excel

5545466
width	height
does the transform happen after it applies the other attributes so should i switch height and width around

5545508
children	parent
your treenode class keeps both a reference to its parent and its children

5545512
ubuntu	linux
the linux machine is running on ubuntu 10.04

5545533
for-loop	arrays
also if an exception is caught the next file in your arrays will be skipped because you have i++ in the catch block - you don t need that there because i will just get incremented again when execution returns to the top of the for-loop

5545565
min	max
is there a way i can return the banner information by num times viewed max or min

5545565
min	max
i have been playing with min max array_values array_keys array_multisort

5545566
twos-complement	ones-complement
there are number of ways of doing that and the terms sign-magnitude twos-complement ones-complement and excess-n all refer to different way of doing that

5545596
prepare	execute
the first might be more commonly used because the documentation states that the typical method call sequence for a select statement is prepare execute fetch fetch .

5545599
atomic	compare-and-swap
iorefs and strefs are only safe in a multi-threaded setting when using atomicmodifyioref a compare-and-swap atomic operation

5545629
printf	fgets
look up fgets printf strings in c etc

5545634
children	parent
for this i started studying the van emde boas layout in a binary heap which led me to a blocked version of a binary heap where the trick is to calculate the children and parent indices

5545639
cvs	svn
which version control system cvs svn git is recommended for managing a web app it s environment is php mysql apache 2 ubuntu 10.10 64-bit server

5545681
put	get
i could put all phone numbers in a listview and get the user to pick one

5545682
textarea	textbox
i have been successfully using onkeypress to determine whether or not enter was hit in a textbox or textarea but after adding a searchbar on me website i discovered that events like onkeypress are global ie

5545690
hash	md5
a simple method would be to use the md5 hash of all the sets of data for the record as your unique key

5545745
post	get
you should look at post redirect get to stop the resending of post data

5545752
content-disposition	content-type
i ve set the content-type to application vnd.ms-word and the content-disposition to attachment and specified the filename but no luck

5545767
hide	show
making the menu appear on hover is much harder because of the way popups steal focus you can show the menu but you can t easily hide it if they mouse over another menu

5545821
profiling	debugging
a good tool to debugging ef is the ef profiling

5545827
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the sites works and looks fine in ie safari and google-chrome but not in firefox and opera

5545827
opera	firefox
specifically in firefox and opera clicking the thumbnail picture or the title of the albums doesn t load the pictures in the left box as it should

5545837
filtering	grouping
in the project file we grouping the c++ files not only by h cpp but also by user-defined filtering so our project might look something like this

5545837
put	get
since our filters are always determined by the first part of the class name i was hoping to get away with only creating the .vcxproj file with message generation tool and modifying the .filters file to use wildcards to put the files in the correct filter

5545866
children	parent
the idea is to provide something similar to this caption bar across the top so the user can always see and interact with the currently selected object and immediate parent or children which may not always be obvious from the current view especially in 3d

5545880
folder	directory
if you go to the folder for default notebook location in windows explorer and create a directory it will automatically put a file open notebook.onetoc2 in the directory

5545889
children	parent
the parent will see that in an instant while it wasn t running both children died

5545904
integer	unsigned
the syntax to change the value of group_concat_max_len at runtime is as follows where val is an unsigned integer

5545917
swt	swing
while swt is nice gui its load time takes considerably a long period of time compared to netbeans swing

5545917
ubuntu	linux
apparently swing in linux at least on ubuntu 10.10 blows

5545934
cpu	processors
in order for the computer to tell the difference it has to be able to check the running process table at a point where a has terminated and b has not - if the os schedules removing process b from the process table immediately after process a then it could very easily be that no such code gets a chance to execute and so by some definitions it isn t possible for the computer to tell the difference - this sutation holds true even on a single core cpu processors

5545937
hide	show
simply hide all the child elements and trigger their show when the parent of an item is clicked

5545954
express	node.js
it is not a good idea to try to use express before learning node.js basics

5545956
post	get
if the view is supposed to be bookmarkable pass the person id as a get request parameter instead of a post request parameter

5545969
hide	show
you could by using jquery show and hide these links

5546056
client-side	server-side
that usually means that your client-side code actually is triggering all those individual requests but only the last one is completing possibly due to how your server-side handles simultaneous requests from the same session

5546083
versioning	upgrade
i m writing a c# application that upgrade client machines from one application versioning to another

5546118
folder	directory
how can i handle this error and verify if the folder exists before open the directory

5546121
post	get
but that is get not post and ppl think thats really bad practice - php open another webpage with post data why

5546132
ucfirst	capitalize
ucfirst simply capitalize the first letter of the string

5546139
uploadify	swfupload
i don t want to deal with flash sessions using swfupload and uploadify because i need to do uploads that only authenticated users can do

5546141
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade placed the new versioning in the usr local bin directory

5546159
folder	directory
rather than ask him to update his library version this is a software customer so i can t assume they ll be willing or able to change system files i would like to ship the appropriate version of libstdc++.so placed in a lib folder with the directory location of my code

5546203
width	height
set the viewbox attribute to encompass the area of the content in local svg coordinates you want to display but set the height and width attributes of the svg to the number of pixels you want it to be displayed as on the web page

5546257
firefox	safari
because we can t see the source code enable the developer tools in safari - preferences advanced show develop menu in menu bar - or use firebug with firefox or as standalone and use the error console to find what js is loading what s conflicting and the errors

5546270
width	height
this is not acceptable to the compiler to do a release it throws errors saying it can t parse the width height values

5546270
width	height
my flash files are being embedded on the web and i just need the width and height attributes defining the bounds of the flash content to be respected by the swf

5546270
width	height
so the width and height attributes are being explicitly set to numbers here

5546270
width	height
and to be clear it will work as expected if i set the swf meta tag to have width 100 and height 100 .

5546288
post	get
i ve seen several post related to this issue but still can t get the following to work

5546296
children	parent
this also means that if all the children of the same parent are of the same element type for example in the case of a table body whose only children are tr elements or a list element whose only children are li elements then nth-child and nth-of-type will behave identically for every value of an+b nth-child an+b and nth-of-type an+b will match the same set of elements

5546299
sudo	passwd
i am assuming this is because my script is using sudo which requires a passwd

5546344
getattr	subclassing
if swig s_ getattr _ functions for myclass could be customized then perhaps unknown attributes could be stored and loaded from an internal pyobject either by having swig subclassing myclass automatically or by having such an object already present in myclass

5546346
width	height
there doesn t seem to be width and height for text elements

5546368
implements	extends
in java each class can only extends 1 other class but it can implements as many interfaces as it want

5546376
for-loop	arrays
and perhaps it would be better to use the following expression in for-loop as it will guard you from possible different lengths of arrays

5546377
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
i have a spring project using log4j on linux debian ubuntu and rhel

5546397
google-chrome	firefox
i m having a strange problem where my div background is not displayed in firefox and google-chrome but appears perfectly fine in ie

5546397
google-chrome	firefox
not sure if this is vital information but i also apply the area class on another div calling a different background image and that background image is displayed fine on all ie firefox and google-chrome

5546408
serializable	deserialization
my guess is that this doesn t handle the serializable and deserialization correctly

5546408
serializable	deserialization
if this is the case you ll have to handle the serializable and deserialization yourself

5546450
google-chrome	firefox
my problem now is it work only on google-chrome and firefox then when run in ie has this unknown runtime error

5546450
google-chrome	firefox
so when i click the link this content will load new data it works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie inside the loaddata i have this

5546454
google-chrome	firefox
it does not appear in firefox or google-chrome

5546473

i d like something that works in at least ie7 8 firefox 2 3 google-chrome and safari

5546487
jobs	cron
currently i do it in a really messy fashion by just scheduling two cron jobs like this

5546490
children	parent
there is no natural way for the parent container to resize dynamically to your absolutely positioned children because the children are outside of the flow

5546490
children	parent
if you insist on doing absolute positioning and need the parent container to match the height of the children you will have to resort to javascript

5546507
post	get
try this code on for size i might get some references wrong with those parent prev if you can t figure it out post the errors

5546516
super	abstract
these methods are defined as abstract methods in the abstract super class

5546516
implements	extends
if the parent class is abstract the extends class must implements any of those abstract methods in the parent

5546526
margin	height
after the read more is clicked you can calculate the height of the surrounding and add or animate the top margin of #barino_left_body to half the surrounding height plus half the height of #barino_left_body

5546588
g++	gcc
error is so g++ gcc 4.x treats the string as const void but how that msvc treats it

5546601
int	double
note the thresholding done above accounts for the possibility that the black-and-white image could be of type double with values of either 0 or 1 logical also with values of either 0 or 1 or an unsigned 8-bit int with values of either 0 or 255

5546631
g++	gcc
i have cygwin installed with make gcc g++ gdb

coff	omf
they are normally in the common object file format coff but they can be in the object module format omf too for older compilers

mouseover	mousemove
however i m not able to use the mouseover with the iphone and mousemove doesn t seem to work either

5546675
put	get
edit well im just trying to get the hash from a url via javascript then put that in a php script

5546687
notepad++	textpad
the easiest would be to do this with grep in linux or some program in windows that has a good search replace function like notepad++ or textpad

5546696
post	get
the parameters will be encoded into the url no post only a get for a script

5546733
width	height
if it doesn t you could switch to using a relativelayout and make the first element a button with this selector as the background and fill_parent for its layout width and height

5546759
google-chrome	firefox
to fix the problem i played with some relative positioning inside the containing div but this is causing positioning discrepancies between firefox and google-chrome

5546773
phpmyadmin	sqlbuddy
try installing an older version of phpmyadmin or try the sqlbuddy

5546815
folder	dir
note you will also need the markers found here and here - and place in a folder in the same dir as code called mapicons

5546843
google-chrome	safari
curl is able to post the request successfully and safari and google-chrome both run the application fine

5546855
post	get
i ll try and touch up the recursive functions and post what i get

5546913
int	chars
note that getchar returns an int and not a chars

5546928
width	height
full answer as metadata the width and height that get compiled into a swf are essentially suggestions

5546928
width	height
but when you display the swf embedded in a web page the width height metadata gets ignored entirely and the swf s size is determined similarly to all the other elements in your page by the embedding html css and so on

5546928
width	height
the height width metadata we ve been talking about is used as that size

5546958
width	height
set your swf tag to the proper aspect ratio in pixels and then use 100 as your width and height in the embed code on your page

5546984
uitableview	reloaddata
you could call the reloaddata method on the uitableview within that tableviewcontroller

5546996
acs	adfs
also just a small detail there s no synching between adfs v2 and acs just a trust relationship

5547011
fontfamily	font-size
it is likely geoserver not support tag because event i try to change font-size fontfamily or

5547014
jar	war
the project is one war and 2 jar projects

5547030
jsf	stripes
if you are actually up to it i suggest you to look into any of these frameworks prettyfaces for jsf and stripes

5547062
width	height
set your a tags as block give them a width float them then on page load iterate through them to find the tallest one then iterate through them a second time adding the necessary top and bottom padding to get them all to look the same height visually

5547073
super	extends
the nicer way extends djangotestsuiterunner and override setup_test_environment to call super and then create your legacy table manually in the test db

5547082
firefox	safari
i get the following error in firefox firebug but not in safari

5547091
organization	naming
sure it has integrated support for subversion but it s still just a svn client and the user still needs to know how to branch how to merge how to resolve conflicts what the conventions are for creating branches and naming tags and such in your organization etc

5547109

google-chrome	safari
it looks like webkit is the only reliable engine that supports it google-chrome and safari

5547621
width	height
how should i go about getting the x y coordinates and width and height for the anchors

5547622
width	height
but it is true -- try moving all the width and height border attributes into css -- that s where they belong

5547649
super	self
it seems as though self within initwithframe of subclassview is still set to the super someclassview

5547673
google-chrome	firefox
i don t see any discrepencies between firefox and google-chrome

5547743
chown	chmod
chown can be used only by a superuser so if it s convenient you can use it but servers don t normally run as superusers so i would go for chmod

internationalization	localization
how can i achieve this using the internationalization and localization properties files

i was thinking about int.parse and double.parse but is there anyway to check if the string representation is an int or double

5548801
width	margin
that s simple margin adds to the final rendered width of the element that s 160 x 2 + 100 of parent s width so it is overflow so you may want to make it for example for the outer div that width is 79 and the left and right margin is 10 each so total is 99 1 less to allow some room for borders etc.

width	height
however any attempt to load the images results in non-null bitmaps with width and height of -1

5549085
opera	firefox
there s a patch you can apply quite hard to do though to enable it but i would advice you to download opera or mozilla firefox for android via market which also supports svg quite well i tested ff4 with raphael js

5549089
portrait	landscape
if the app starts in portrait then i rotate to landscape then it is fine

5549170

that code just prints the custom field names of the parent rather than the children how can i show the children s custom fields

5549978

i have a very unusual problem please read this fully it s important code blocks compiler windows vista home no replicable code with the c file reading functions fread fgetc

5550036
printf	fgetc
perplexed given it s an fgetc loop i added a printf to display each char as a d so i could spot the -1 eof at every step so i could see what it was doing and modified it so it was a single char

5550036
printf	fgetc
so basically i have a bug that is affected by the observer effect out of quantum physics when i try to observe the chars i get from fgetc via printf the problem early eof termination at 24 disappears but when i stop viewing it the error-catch statement reports early termination

5550036
fgetc	fread
fread had a similar problem and i was unable to figure out why and replaced it with the fgetc loop

nsscanner	nsstring
you initialize the nsstring with your xml source and then you create an nsscanner object with that string to scan the string in a while loop

5550465
int	chars
means you are adding the eof value into your array - i m pretty sure you don t want to do that especially as your array is presumably chars and eof is int so you ll actually end up with some other value in there which could mess up later loops etc

5550514
jquery	scriptaculous
make sure you import the jquery script after scriptaculous and call noconflict before making any scriptaculous calls

button	checkbox
i works fine on checkboxpreference but i only need a button not the checkbox

5550696

5550855
post	get
turns out the remote server was not handling post requests correctly but it was handling get ok

5550855
post	get
the browser uses get so this is why the browser was able to set up a connection when my web service using post couldn t

5552004
subtract	add
shaders would allow a slightly circuitous route around that because you can add or subtract or do whatever you want and can split up the results

5552026
sorting	grouping
i m afraid you have the same constraint for select distinct as for grouping by clauses namely you cannot make use of a field that s not declared in the fields list because it simply doesn t know which curdate to use when sorting in case there are several rows with different curdate values for the same category

5552026

5552694
post	get
if i change code lower in post containment data to containment parent i m able to stay in the certain area i ve zoomed in and zoomed out from but i still get the white empty area when i m down into a corner but i m able to drag in the picture again and with the cost that it s not the smooth panorama-feeling anymore more like it snaps to the edges

onchange	keyup	keydown	keyup
you could keep the current page name action identifier in a session variable then use a javascript onchange load keyup keydown to request the current state of the user from the server

5557023
inherited	properties
i have create a class that inherited from bindinglist of t and i added a properties

5557031

put	get
with text what you put may not be what you get out

5557046
postgresql	mysql
i run mysql on my local dev machine and have spent a little while updating some of my scopes to work in postgresql

5557046
postgresql	mysql
does anyone have a better way of implementing a fix that will work with both mysql and postgresql

5557057
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this can be done because uinavigationcontroller is a subclass of uiviewcontroller

5557159
post	put
i have seen on other stackoverflow post where they had a large amount of dashes before some number then the put their form data

5557169
button	checkbox
i have to do a listview with checkbox and then display the checked and unchecked items when user presses the button

5557175
post	get
it seems to work ie i get separate comment thread per post

5557186
ironruby	ironpython
i think you would do better using .net compatible dynamic language like ironpython or ironruby

5557192
listview	gridview
for example choose listview instead of gridview

5557308
pop-up	dialog
don t try to pop-up a big dialog when your app is not in the foreground that would be utterly intrusive

5557462
udp	rtp
with rtp or live streams this happens a lot since udp will drop packets

5557486
postgresql	mysql
i was wondering if postgresql had a feature like sql_cache in mysql

5557486
postgresql	mysql
for example in mysql i can do a query like select sql_cache product_id product_name product_sku from products i want to know if i can do something similar in postgresql

5557497
portrait	landscape
in portrait i want to show four columns with six rows and in landscape i want six columns with four rows

5557497
portrait	landscape
so i was wondering if my best solution is to attempt to load a separate view for landscape and one for portrait

5557547
put	get
but i don t know how to get the name field from the related table to put in the dropdown so i have the vendorid as the value and text

5557581
typedef	struct
in the struct vplist you have a pointer to a vpptr - one more reason to distrust such pointer typedef

5557592
min	max
if you want to limit it you can use min and max

5557628
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
if you define an array of embedded types int chars boolean double .

5557656
memcpy	memset
so second memcpy should be replaced with memset instead

5557689
versioning	upgrade
upgrade are in separate sql files which can upgrade existing dbs from a specific versioning to a newer one run sequentially

5557720
apache	nginx	thin	unicorn
to achieve that level of flexibility you may need to look into some kind of reverse-proxy setup involving a stand-alone app server like thin unicorn or mongrel running behind apache or nginx

5557729
post	put
if none of this works post some additional code or put the website public somewhere where we can take a closer look

5557747
apache	nginx
basically what it is saying is that you should use apache using mod_wsgi to serve your django application and use a more lightweight web server like nginx to serve up your static content

5557747
apache	nginx
by separating your concerns you can configure your apache instance to be your dump truck handing the heavy processing and your nginx server to be light and fast like a racecar serving lots of little static files

5557747
apache	nginx
if you configure nginx so that it handles all web traffic you can reverse proxy all django requests to apache behind it and intercept all of the static files and serve those strait from nginx

5557785
hide	show
when the form gets successfully submitted just hide the form element and show the message which is initially hidden

5557785
hide	show
and then later just show the form element and hide the message

5557812
rss	feed
i m using asmx web services in sharepoint and had a need for an asmx method to correctly respond to a head request apparently the itunes store does a head request to your rss feed url before doing a get request to download the feed

5557823
google-chrome	firefox
this may force it to only show at that particular size in firefox as well as google-chrome and internet explorer

5557832
hide	show
i can hide show move and resize columns without triggering an alert

5557878
min	max
i tested on a table with exactly one blank row and specific orders that i could verify both an auto-increment field and a value that i checked by using min and max and access chose to return some other value as last

5557921
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this prevents the page from loading in a frame in ie8+ and newer versions of firefox opera and google-chrome the exact version numbers escape me at the moment

5557934
richfaces	icefaces
ajax is optional or if you could use a variant of jsf like icefaces or richfaces then the framework will do most of the heavy lifting for you

5557958
mvp	presenter
another good example is mvp - model view presenter

5557990
paradox	dbase
.idx could be paradox dbase iv or foxpro among probably others if it s an actual vendor s extension for an index

5557990
paradox	dbase
it s not access dbase paradox or dataflex just a check because it used .dat for an extension

5558000
min	max
if you set the min and max the same as the width normal wms will disallow resizing

5558005
distance	pdist
should i add 0s to the end and then calculate the distance with pdist

5558018
post	get
when a movie is clicked i have a jquery live event to get the click post to the action get the data and then a callback function to take the data and place it in a modal pop-up

google-chrome	firefox
this looks fine in ie7 google-chrome firefox but not in ie6

5558118
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox 4 among other applications now put some of their user interface in the title bar

5558118
google-chrome	firefox
by what mechanism do apps like google-chrome and firefox share the title bar with the os put custom elements in the title bar while keeping the original os visual theme

5558132
post	get
i was using the httpwebrequest s defualt method value which is get and i should be using post for a few reasons including the conquering the length of the request issue

5558132
post	get
the alternative to the get method is the post method

5558141
spaces	linefeed
this will check to make sure the string isn t empty then runs a simple loop to remove the left-most character as long as it is either a cr chr 13 linefeed chr 10 or a spaces

5558141
spaces	linefeed
once the loop hits the first character that doesn t match the criteria it stops and you have the desired result of trimming all extra cr linefeed and spaces characters only from the beginning of the string

5558151
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

5558176
post	get
how can i send post and get data to a perl cgi script via the command line

5558188

5558190
subtract	add
determine whether to add or subtract

5558195
width	height
solved the problem by adding a spinner in my xml with height and width set to zero

5558199
int	double
how do i go about using compareto for a double and i want to turn it into an int

5558263
int	double
if you want to compare double and int it may be tough

5558263
int	double
one cast the double to an int and compare

5558263
int	double
two cast the int to a double and compare

5558332
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for some reason the animation looks smooth in firefox and google-chrome but not safari

5558343
post	get
then in the blackberry use standard http requests to send get post requests to the proxy page

5558374
int	chars
for example field user name is 32 chars or less age must be an int greater than 21 etc

5558391
junit	jsunit	put	get
as far as the actual testing library i would like it to be similar to n junit i know there is jsunit but it doesnt seem like it can be used in the way i want i did find a different version of jsunit 1.3 which can be used with ant but it seemed to be an awful lot of work to get it put into nant

5558399
typedef	struct
when one uses typedef struct within a source file and an external system will need to connect to this class via an interface what is the correct way to handle the input

5558399
typedef	struct
should the function take arguments of type gpslocation thus forcing the external system to #include the source file with the struct present not so external now or is it better to keep all typedef struct used within the sub-system and thus having an interface function as follows

5558429
georss	kml
a kmllayer adds geographic markup to the map from a kml kmz or georss file that is hosted on a publicly accessible web server

5558464
jax-ws	jax-rs
it is unclear to me if it is better to create a mule translator for the service which understands the protocol and delegates to generate an appropriate response or just create two class interfaces using jax-rs jax-ws annotations to the service

5558485
typedef	struct
there is nothing wrong with also defining your struct in that header file complete with typedef

5558492
integer	unsigned	multiplying	addition	multiplying	subtraction	subtraction	addition
is it possible to divide an unsigned integer by 10 by using pure bit shifts addition subtraction and maybe multiplying

5558549
post	get
however when i execute the ajax post method i get the following error

5558549
post	put
and i put a special flag in params to identify post from the ajax call

5558569
folder	directory
i wish to keep my resources in a folder within my project directory

5558591
google-chrome	firefox
i m too lazy to go looking at google-chrome and firefox s source to find out exactly what they did but it most likely includes custom handling for wm_ncpaint and wm_nchittest

5558592
google-chrome	firefox
it has to work in ie8 firefox google-chrome no ie7 or earlier

5558592
google-chrome	firefox
but i can not get rid of the horizontal scrollbar in firefox or google-chrome ie8 is ok

5558597
division	subtraction
well division is subtraction so yes

5558604
portrait	landscape
you may also want to put some buttons on the right in landscape mode and in the bottom of your layout in portrait

5558646
int	double
i would like to calculate 1.0-p n where p is a double between 0 and 1 often very close to 0 and n is a positive int that might be on the order of hundreds or thousands perhaps larger

5558667
portrait	landscape
when you click the button to open the same page in a new tab the orientation is wrong if you are not in the default mode android 2.2 the default mode or 0 angle is portrait in android 3.0 the 0 angle is landscape but once you rotate to the other mode and then back the orientation works

5558677
serializable	deserialization
however function serializable deserialization is unreliable because it is implementation-dependent

5558685
arraylist	treeset
i know i could just store the objects in an arraylist and use binary search to find the object but this wouldn t be as fast as just searching the treeset

5558695
passenger	thin	passenger	unicorn	thin	unicorn
you can also use passenger standalone as a replacement for the thin mongrel unicorn reverse proxy setup that bioneuralnet has mentioned

5558698
uitabbaritem	uibaritem
changing the title of a uibaritem superclass of uitabbaritem needs to be done before the item is added to a bar per apple docs

5558741
comparator	comparable
you should either implement comparable on your object or create a separate comparator class that you pass in at the time treeset is constructed

5558761
comparator	comparable
you got the answer about using comparable comparator but i thought i would add that you are right that contains does a binary search though you shouldn t need to know those details

5558773
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is not in my monitor s clear type settings since ie 9 in compatibility mode firefox and google-chrome all render text nicely

5558848
safariwatir	firewatir
watir has different many different drivers watir firewatir safariwatir chromewatir operawatir and now watir-webdriver

5558864
puts	gets
processor gets items from unprocessed messages processes them via a lambda function argument and puts them into a queue processed messages

5558871
portrait	landscape
i have an android application i would like to know if i can have 1 layout 1 layout xml file for both landscape and portrait mode

5558874
inline-functions	inlining
when there are pointers to an inline-functions internally by the compiler or externally by the programmer the inlining may not be used

5558880
folder	directory
in the case described in your comment you are including files under xfolder and only excluding files under the current directory since your exclude doesn t also specify xfolder so basically unless xfolder happens to be the current folder you aren t excluding anything

5558940
tostring	gethashcode
otherwise without these flags you will get all methods defined on the type like tostring gethashcode and even printmethodnames

5558945
ant	maven
a task to build and deploy your war file locally ant maven etc.

5558945
profiling	debugging
to debugging your project in intellij ce you ll need to spend some time setting up a run profiling to launch your application server

5558945
getter	setter
even with that stuff set-up you ll still be missing any convenience features specific to web development beans won t automatically show links to relevant xml configurations getter setter used for dependency injection will probably show unused method warnings etc.

5558951
ccscene	cclayer
yes create the menu in the - id init of ccscene subclass or cclayer subclass as the following tutorials

5558954
post	get
a get or post parameter named next by default though it is possible to customize

5559027
typedef	struct
in the second example the huffcode_ isn t even necessary since the struct type is already named by the typedef

5559027
typedef	struct
in very old compilers it may be useful to give the struct a different name than is used in the typedef

5559036
portrait	landscape
with this method you would use the same layout for both landscape and portrait

5559054
typedef	struct
a lot of the time in straight c people like to typedef their struct so that they don t look so ugly

5559054
typedef	struct
so they name the struct itself something ugly and the typedef something clean

5559069
integer	unsigned
in this case i m simply writing long unsigned integer sequence into a sequence of arrays and loading each array sequence into hdf5 as they are created

5559092
haskell	ocaml
most real-world implementation of probability dsl however use a more concrete representation such as a list of pair haskell probability library and ocaml hansei

5559132
des	aes
aes is the successor of des as standard symmetric encryption algorithm for us federal organizations and as standard for pretty much everybody else too

5559132
3des	aes
using a block cipher properly is not easy and it is more important than selecting between aes or 3des

5559146
min	max
so i want to find min and max values from these points set

5559183
pop-up	dialog
so i would like to check the ajax call from the tab and see if it is a validation error json response and if has validation errors stop loading the tab and pop-up a dialog box

5559188
rvm	bundler
in this type of environment not all ruby processes run under the same user so i think that s where things get unclear as far as rvm and bundler are concerned

5559202
int	chars	int	double
also among native types only the ones that are common the word common may not be correct here. to .net double int chars chars not chars etc

5559242
allocator	stl
of course in c++ the point quickly becomes moot for the actual storage volumes since stl containers vector list map et friends do their element allocator dynamically anyway 1

5559247
hide	show
clicking hide the others and show the new one

5559277
disk	ram
you then want to test with real world operation it s difficult to predict what combination of ram disk and network activity will slow you down

5559286
postgresql	mysql
both postgresql and mysql support it

5559289
hide	show
you could hide the non-target divs manually show below but i think hiding them all is a good approach

5559311
rss	feed
i was transforming an rss feed which uses the following date format mon 04 apr 2011 23 18 00 -0700

5559344
put	get
if you put in the listview either focusable or clickable views then the your onitemclicklistener won t get called

5559344
implements	extends
what you can do in this case is to implements a custom adapter just extends arrayadapter and add an onclicklistener to every view you provide for the listview

5559387
minimum	max
if the definition of order is the minimum number of keys of a non-root node then the answer to the max is unknown

5559407
pop-up	dialog
when a picture is selected a custom dialog pop-up

5559439
width	height
these methods work pretty much by giving the font a size of 0 so it occupies no height or width

5559465
lisp	scheme
i don t really use common lisp but i d do it like this in scheme

5559500
wordpress	joomla
and it can be argued that most of the cmss you will be connecting with wordpress joomla allow arbitrary execution of php code in the back-end anyway

5559520
trie	dawg
i would suggest that given your desire to also search through the stored string values you should consider whether either a trie structure such as a patricia trie or for even better memory amortisation a directed acyclic word graph refered to affctionalty as a dawg would work better

5559520
trie	dawg
if you specifically wish to retain an ordering of the strings with some lexicographical manner so you need only consider one character or code point at a time then the patricia trie is likely to be the preferable option implementing the ordering on top of the dawg would be problematic

5559526
width	height
basically you would start with a font height smaller than the height of your textview and then iterate or do a binary search through fonts of varying sizes until you find one that measures to smaller than the width of your textview

5559535
folder	directory
4 with everything you ve done you re head is back at and your index is as well but in your working directory you now have the changes from repo a that you ve been looking for as well as the potential for files outside of the wireless_dir folder

5559589
profiling	instrumentation
with the time profiling instrumentation make sure it s set to all sample counts rather than running sample times under sample perspective

5559612
valgrind	memcheck
have you tried using valgrind memcheck or rational purify against this

5559703
opera	google-chrome
bug does not appear in my google-chrome or opera testing

5559710
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
otherwise i would need to write a for-loop to check each arrays indice and then somehow make a decision statement whether to go through loops and print take input

5559734
winpcap	pcap.net
in terms of winpcap the choice seems to be between pcap.net and sharppcap

5559773
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
on mousedown record your mouse position and line position and register a mousemove handler closed around those starting positions and register a mouseup handler to remove the mousemove handler

5559843
width	height
scale the image while preserving its intrinsic aspect ratio if any to the largest size such that both its width and its height can fit inside the background positioning area

5559843
width	height
scale the image while preserving its intrinsic aspect ratio if any to the smallest size such that both its width and its height can completely cover the background positioning area

5559844
post	get
my guess is that you are using a wcf rest service and you can pull the get parameters but you are unable to read raw post data

5559925
printf	strcmp
did you try printf ing the contents of data i .hash and the value returned by md5fromstring password right before strcmp

5559927
cos	sin
so you want sin and cos not cos and tan

5559928
cos	sin
firstly you want cos and sin not cos and tan

5559948
maven	pom.xml
the maven release plugin is defined at the company level of pom.xml file which is parent of mywebproduct

5560008
pull	push
well i used to be able to push and pull with heroku but it just asked me to upgrade taps so i did

5560009
for-loop	arrays
which would work best initializer list or for-loop initialization since when an arrays is created each element of that arrays is automatically initialized to the default value

5560034
portrait	landscape
my app currently displays the launch image in portrait mode then switches to landscape so the image is on its side then launches the app

5560034
portrait	landscape
make it display it in landscape mode not portrait

5560056
apache	nginx
see how that all goes and only when apache itself looks not to be enough then look to using another server to handle media the preferred arrangement being to use nginx to handle static media with nginx also acting as proxy through to apache mod_wsgi

5560056
apache	nginx
using nginx in front actually allows apache mod_wsgi to perform better which using nginx on a separate domain will not

5560155
oncreate	ondestroy
only when you use oncreate to create a service you should worry about ondestroy

5560166
try-catch	exception-handling
tha catch keywork stands for the second way when you write some code that can maybe cause unexpected behaviour you can surround this code with a try-catch block just like the example above if the method call throw an exception-handling object of the type inside the catch clause all the remaining code in the try block will be skipped and the code in the catch block will be executed

5560173
width	height
and the reason i didnt get anything appearing on the screen was because the values for width and height werent actually set so when it set the projection it set it to 0 by 0 or something strange like that

5560198
uiview	subviews
maybe this isn t the most elegant answer but my solution was to make a uiview which is the size i want for the table view and then add the table view as a subviews

5560202
sorting	grouping
i then added a sort on the grouping on this calculated field which isn t shown in the report and gives the impression that those items with a date get ordered and the rest are left to the other layers of sorting which is correct

5560213
ubuntu	debian
in the debian and hence ubuntu package the directory usr local lib r site-library is created by the file var lib dpkg info r-base-core.postinst script -- and the relevant code is

5560213
ubuntu	debian
the r-sig-debian list is a friendly place for debian ubuntu questions like this and i recommend it

5560213
ubuntu	debian
edit also a fair number of more complicated packages are part of ubuntu debian so to get xml you can just to sudo apt-get install r-cran-xml

5560214
dictionary	map
i m not very familiar with hashmaps but i want to read the files from the dictionary into a hash map

5560224
apache	nginx
because this is heroku you cannot use apache or nginx configs

5560250
int	chars
your other hurdle is that the first chars of the serial is a string not an int so you would want to take the int of the first chars

5560283
strcpy	memmove
if you need this string at the beginning of the char array itself you can use memmove after the above code to shift the string over strcpy won t work since the ranges overlap

5560292
squash	branch	git-rebase	amend
you have free reign to amend commits squash them git-rebase branch around all of those ways that git provide to fix the inevitable oversights we make while developing

5560328
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this in firefox 3+ and ie8+ works but doesn t appear to work in google-chrome 5+

5560384
tablelayoutpanel	picturebox
assuming this is winforms and you have a bunch of picturebox es in cells of a tablelayoutpanel set each one s dock to fill and sizemode to stretchimage

5560394
disk	ram
in order to build these systems i am given 60 duo-core machines each with 1gb of ram 1.5tb disk

5560403
express	node.js
you can certainly do the exact same the other way around using standard node.js routing or something like express and an http client for ruby such as typhoeus

5560413
getter	setter
this creates getter and setter for you automatically making the class more extensible if you decide to change the way a property works perhaps you want to change it to always be calculated on the fly the public interface of the class does not need to change

5560414
google-chrome	firefox
although if we are discussing css there is a syntax for specifying hsl hsla for ie9 google-chrome firefox

5560424
post	get
when i request the get post method the response is 200 ok

5560445
getter	setter
that will make the synthesized setter and getter methods for your latitude property change your _latitude ivar

5560481
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have tested it in safari firefox and google-chrome as well as firefox on windows all of these work fine i hover over the links menu and it drops down

5560516
getter	setter
but if you misstated your request and want the latitude property to access the coordinate s latitude rather than the _latitude ivar it s a simple matter of writing custom getter and setter methods

5560522
accessor	properties
there is no magical bind in objective-c what you could do instead of synthesizing properties is writing accessor which is what synthesize really do at compilation in fact something like that

5560523
disk	ram
i am using a network of 60 core-duo machines each with 1gb ram and 1.5tb disk

5560525
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql can certainly handle the load and table partitioning might be desirable in this scenario as well since your dealing with time ranges

5560574
inline	inlining
the exception is if you have any anti-piracy code inlining that or even using macros to ensure it s inline can help remove a single point of failure

5560615
hide	show
so i wanted to hide the contents in div#content when search button is clicked and show again when reset button is clicked

5560625
listview	gridview
i have a listview gridview with multiple columns and so far i can sort it by column alphabetically but when i m sorting a-z empty strings show up at the top

5560655
spaces	delimiter
i am developing an application which requires a text box with auto-complete suggestions drop down for multiple words separated by a delimiter like spaces like the tags text box here in stackoverflow

int as if they are type signed chars by

5566318
fgets	getline
it s possible to implement getline but not the more powerful getdelim as a very fast efficient wrapper around fgets so if you re willing to do that as a fallback using getline doesn t really make your program any less portable

5566318
fgetc	getline
also of course both getline and getdelim can simply be implemented on top of flockfile funlockfile and fgetc

i am trying to show and hide rows dynamically on my page.firstly i tryed to make it on .zul page but i could not refresh component with annotadedatabinder

5567062
spaces	delimiter
for question 1 can you split the name string based on the _ spaces delimiter and then sort based on the array element

5567062
spaces	delimiter
since the requirement is to sort based on the last name this splits the string based on the spaces delimiter flips the resulting name sorts the array and then reforms by re-flipping confused yet

at first i thought it would be an easy task to get the width and height

5567278
versioning	upgrade
have you recently upgrade from an older versioning

5567300
children	parent
one way to avoid using extra memory much extra anyway is to manipulate the tree as you traverse it -- as you traverse downward through nodes you make a copy of its pointer to one of the children then reverse that to point back to the parent

5567300
children	parent
when you ve gotten to the bottom you follow the links back up to the parent and as you go you reverse them to point back to the children

5567307
width	margin
if i shrink the width of the select it cuts off the selected option but leaves the margin

5567309

5567454

i need to hide or show a div that have a slideshow inside

the idea is to give to the users a link for them to hide or show the div

5567454
hide	show
after the user clicks on the link to hide show the div i will like to call a second file

5567457
folder	directory
also it would have to be done recursively because the directory tree is somewhat deep and can also be subject to change at the lower branches so i would have to monitor the following at every folder level or alternatively monitor the modified time of the folder and then scan to find out what happened

5567457
folder	directory
it seems clear to me that keeping a database of the relevant file and folder information is the appropriate course of action on the query side of things but keeping that database synchronized with the actual state of the file system under the directory of concern will be the challenge

5567471
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode	tostring	referenceequals	referenceequals	gethashcode

would realloc do memcpy in this case

5567865
hash	md5
there are also other hash functions but some are cryptographically broken md5 so depending on your situation you may or may not want to try them

5567901
switching	screens
on the first pass you draw to a and then switching the view to the a buffer which is painted on the screens

5567901
switching	screens
on the second pass since a is now the screens view you draw to b and then switching the view to the b buffer

5567901
switching	screens
you switching buffers because otherwise you would actually need a b and a screens buffer that is copied to from a or b

5567910
x86	64bit
it defaults to x86 so you ll run in 32-bit mode even on a 64bit operating system

5567919
memcpy	realloc
it wouldn t do a memcpy -- that s only necessary when the realloc size is larger and there s no room to expand

5567924
avd	galaxy
you can actually download a samsung component via avd that contains a configuration for galaxy tabs

5567931

5568177
versioning	upgrade
third it will automatically get upgrade whenever the next versioning of windows comes out

5568179

5568230
post	put
define and create page callback function in it put the post code you want using http post from php example

yo dont need to post or get or anything enough a simple request

5568358
mouse	keyboard
maybe checking for whether it is locked or can a winform application tell when the mouse and keyboard is being used even when the winform is not the active window

5568358
mouse	keyboard
addendum i will assume that if the mouse and keyboard are not being used a person is not using that particular box so this would cause a false positive if the user is watching a movie on their computer this program will be used in an office setting so the possibility of this happening on a particular day is nearly zero

5568384
button	checkbox
my code for the checkbox button image like

5568388
auto-generate	edmx
the reason for this is that the xml formatted edmx file is always completely auto-generate when the model is updated or created from the database

5568391
onkeyup	onkeydown
use the onkeydown events to trigger each response and onkeyup events to finish them

5568400
oncreate	findviewbyid
in your oncreate method use findviewbyid r.id.my_fragment to locate the fragment placeholder

5568412
memcached	apc
caching isn t really an option because most of the servers don t have neither memcached nor apc installed

5568415
mouse	keyboard
you can set up global hooks for the mouse and keyboard - wh_keyboard_ll and wh_mouse_ll - which will allow you to monitor user activity - as long as your user is not say watching a film and not touching mouse or keyboard

5568421
range	min	range	max	min	max
integer in the range min max

5568422
mouse	keyboard
the way i d think about doing it would be to write an application that sits in the background and listens for mouse and keyboard messages using the user32.dll and assumes that the user is no longer using the computer if it doesn t hear any after a certain amount of time

5568484
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox

even better to use calloc instead of malloc

5568578
move	drag
but when i drag the clone the original div is move instead

5568590
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql have many features in common but different ways of using those features

5568590
postgresql	mysql
for one example postgresql and mysql both support auto-incrementing id numbers but they use different reserved words and technologies to implement those id numbers

5568590
postgresql	mysql
if the postgresql file uses any of mysql s reserved words as a table or column name you ll need to guard it with backticks

5568635

adfs has more powerful claims transformation capabilities than acs

5568668
acs	adfs
adfs supports samlp acs not yet

5568695
versioning	upgrade
installing rather than upgrading an earlier versioning is successful however if i upgrade i get the following entries in a verbose log

folder	directory
that includes the windows directory as well as the program files folder and any of the folder it contains

5568749
width	margin

put	get
my question is in the requestcode function when i get the text returned from my web service how do i put that text into a field on my configuration gui

5568766
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
savefiledialog and openfiledialog always uses last saved opened folder

5568784
mouse	keyboard

any idea if there is an app like django-registration or django-userena which allows calling such methods without any hacking in the code

5569031
unsigned	short
using unsigned char saves on space in the design shown though it might conceivably save space if you kept track of the allocated length separately from the length in use but even then i d probably use unsigned short rather than unsigned char

5569031
calloc	malloc	memset	malloc	memset	calloc
the initialization loop for the allocated memory could perhaps be replaced with a memset operation or you could use calloc instead of malloc

5569062
client-side	server-side
you ll need some server-side code php in your case that serves as a proxy between the db and the client-side code

5569067
versioning	upgrade
in that case the answer to your question is upgrade to the latest versioning and use a place

5569127

probably i am putting too much effort in it while i could just use a textview button edittext imageview that i can click on to create a datepick dialog

5569319
pull	push
i think option 2 sounds most sensible but i m not sure why you would need to set up a pull operation as well as a push

5569435
google-chrome	firefox
this is not required in google-chrome or firefox or even ie 9

5569465
gridview	entitydatasource

it can build swing or swt gui

5570027
hash	salt
because this is a salt hash it s even more difficult

5570037
swt	swing
you can create guis in both swing and swt

5570110
hash	salt
because you can t retrieve a password from a one-way hash like sha-512 the closest we can get is being able to generate the same hash from the same password and salt

5570110

put a few debug statements in there until you get it working right

5570446
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
putting aside concerns about how to sign the requests without leaking the shared access key silverlight won t access the table endpoint because neither clientaccesspolicy.xml nor crossdomain.xml are present at the root of the table uri

5570471
hide	show
i would suggest having two selects that you show and hide

5570471
hide	show
show and hide of options sounds risky

5570471
hide	show
if show hide works in all browsers go for it

5570477
postgresql	mysql
i don t have a mysql installation and pas.plugins.sqlalchemy works fine on postgresql for me but it would seem that the authors have made an assumption about varchars

ideally i would like something that could handle all polyhedra including concave shapes at which point triangular faces are not sufficient but i would be very happy to find something that could handle convex polyhedra

5570513
vsto	add-in
with more time and effort you could write an office vsto add-in that could automate the process for your endusers

5570542
memcached	apc
after that nothing prevents you from putting some caching mecanism in place using apc or memcached typically -- or even a reverse-proxy like varnish to avoid hitting the database too often with the same requests

5570597
int	boolean
there is still type checking though if you enter the value 1 you get the error message that an int cannot be converted into a boolean

5570647

if you re looking for a game development library there s a pretty good one that recently came out -- the shaven puppy game library spgl that uses lwjgl lightweight java game library - uses sdl opengl made by the creators of revenge of the titans a successful 2d game coded in java using hardware acceleration

i have a radiobuttonlist in the dataitemtemplate of the aspx gridview

5570969
post	get
you can not detect f5 but instead should detect if the request is get or post

5570969
post	get
if you fill out a form and click submit and then do an f5 after that you will typically get a warning from your browser because it will do another post

5570969
post	get
thus an f5 might be either a get or post and you need to be able to deal with either

5570969
post	get
one way to keep your users from getting this message from their browser is to use the post redirect get idiom

5571006
hash	salt
might be entirely unrelated but the parameters are encrypted and i have to get the salt and hash from the database entity framework and wcf ria services before i call htmlpage.window.invoke..

5571334

nltk	lingpipe
instead of using tools like nltk or lingpipe i want to build my own tool

5571740
factors	matrix
the eigenvalues give the corresponding lengths of the major minor axis of the ellipse and so scaling the ellipse or the eigenvalues to the 95 tile is equivalent to multiplying the covariance matrix with the scaling factors

5571775
apk	dex
the problem was that the classes were not being compiled and translated to the dex file this is obvious to find because the apk just shrinks

5571784
google-chrome	safari

5571894
sorting	filtering
applying sorting or filtering on the aspxgridview causes the page to refresh

5571905
getter	setter
there s no reason that you have to use the objective-c 2 style setter getter to manage your instance variables - as long as the instance variable is released within the dealloc method if indeed it s a alloced inited object etc. then there s nothing to worry about

5571905
getter	setter
bear in mind that prior to objective-c such properties and the whole property synthesize syntax simply didn t exist so you had to create your own getter setter if you deemed it necessary convenient

5571909
accessor	properties
so objective-c 2.0 came along and gave us the ability to declare properties with the language syntax and even generate the accessor for us-- lots of time and boilerplate code was saved

5571909
accessor	properties
the public ones appear in the .h file as properties but you can also create a private interface to your object in the .m file that declare your private properties so you can use the accessor inside your class

5571923
accessor	properties
in fact prior to v2.0 of objective-c there was no such thing as properties -- you had to write your own accessor and mutators for instance variables if you wanted to access them outside of the class

5571934

5572306
mouseup	mousedown
call myrectangle.capturemouse in the mousedown event that way mouseup will be fired even if the mouse moves outside the rectangle check for ismousecaptured in the mouseup event to see if the mousedown actually occurred inside the rectangle and release it via myrectangle.releasemousecapture

5572331

5572755
int	double
if you want to compare an int with a double you will need to convert the int to a double

5572755
int	double
please be aware that this won t work the other way round as an int couldn t hold all the values a double can values will be round down

5572755
int	double
and double can hold values way bigger and small than int could

5572755
int	double
so please always convert the int to a double to prevent this to happen

5572755
int	double
but keep in mind that double differs from double as double is an object and not a primitive type so there will be more overhead when handling a double compared to using a double or int

5572768
put	get
i need to get the values from array b and put in array a in key k3 i am using this function to do this

5572783

exponent	modulo
if you can obtain the complete private key then you just have to pick the public fields modulo and public exponent which constitute together the public key

5586525
mspec	nspec
mspec vs nspec

5586525
mspec	nspec
you ll find that the simplest mspec tests are simpler in nspec

5586525
mspec	nspec
here is a more complex test suite written both in mspec and nspec

5586525
mspec	nspec
a comparison of xunit mspec and nspec

5586574

the stdout stream is buffered so if you immediately want your results you need to fflush that buffer with fflush

5586575
inherited	subclassing
i have a class which has a bunch of subclassing that inherited from it

5586580
super	self
use isinstance to check your objects to see if they re instances of host and use super super hostlist self .insert ... to use the functionality of list rather than reimplementing it yourself

5586581
width	height
my question is is there any way when that button is pressed in program a i can access program b in memory and change its forms width and height properties or any properties for that matter

5586600
apache	nginx
you can either use static.abc.com and put everything in there but then you have to use absolute urls in your css files or you may be able to make use of depending on your web host a symlink to the shared directory and serve the static files using nginx apache

5586616
width	height
at first sight there is no width height values for your textview

5586637
post	get
my questions is it possible to post this form using jquery but still using this format that s mean with the model and not get one value by one value like the sample below

5586652
ceil	floor
this implies a size limit of floor n 8 -2 ceil h 8 -2 still for a 1024-bit rsa key with sha-256 as hash function h 256 this means binary messages up to 60 bytes

5586667
post	get
your code is performing a get request and not a post request

5586683
draggable	droppable
i am using jquery draggable and droppable

5586712
put	get
20 instructions mov two forms add sub cmp and or not je jne jb jbe ja jae jmp brk iret halt get and put

uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
i have created a uinavigationcontroller with a uinavigationbar that has a uibarbuttonitem in the right position entirely in code there is no ib .xib file

5586729
maven	pom.xml
if your projects are built with maven then all you need to do is run mvn sonar sonar on your project root folder where your pom.xml is located and the report will get pushed to your sonar instance

5586739
awt	swing
you can t use multiple threads with swing awt and you can t wait on the thread which is running the gui or it will stop working

5586758
client-side	server-side
i don t see what ruby has to do with this as that d be a server-side operation and you re talking about client-side preparing

5586781
capitalize	uppercase
hence what you want is called uppercase not capitalize

5586782
children	parent
a parent item contains all of its children

portrait	landscape
what happens here is that the view controller which contains labels and buttons loads in landscape mode while its components load in portrait mode.

5586875
serializable	deserialization
but you cannot tell the serializable to serializable the interface because it wouldn t know which concrete class to instantiate on deserialization

5586933
mkmapview	mapkit
mapkit is good at drawing region shapes on an mkmapview and corelocation is good at telling you straight distance from cllocation to cllocation but neither is exactly what i need

5586957
post	get
my guess would be that when the website gets the post and logs the user in it sets cookies on the response to indicate that the user is logged in and then requires those cookies on subsequent get s

5586957
post	get
this sets up a cookie store within the http context and you then use that context on get s and post s

5586973
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
i was just wondering how images size when drawn on a view using canvas.drawbitmap do they stay the same as the raw bitmap in the relevant drawable folder ldpi mdpi hdpi or do they scale relative to the screens size

i was trying to use some regex pattern but even with the help of many post on stackoverlow i cannot get i to work as i want it

5587030

also using the usual margin trick on the center element doesn t work because the height of the header footer is unknown because it is dynamic

5587030
google-chrome	safari
must work in ie7+ ff3+ google-chrome and safari

5587069
datamodel	relational-model
with plain relational-model the datamodel more readily apparent in the database physical schema

5587075
apache	nginx
if you really want to fail fast in that case you should prevent large uploads on the apache nginx level

mkmapview	mkannotationview
depends of zoom level of mkmapview i need to redraw my custom mkannotationview

5587111

the box information will be int the part information will be int but the measurement will be double

5587324
versioning	upgrade
this will allow any existing users to upgrade to the new versioning while new users will automatically get the newest versioning

5587339
factors	matrix
if you read the docs it says that you can also specify the zoom factors independently for the two axes which means you can upscale non-square matrix as well

5587339
interpolation	splines
by default it uses third order splines interpolation which i am not sure is best

5587369
expression-blend	silverlight
but while many third-party libraries provide extmap.xml files with their assemblies for instance telerik thankfully does the blend sdk doesn t looking in my c program files x86 microsoft sdks expression-blend silverlight v4.0 libraries

nhibernate	queryover
i need the fallowing query do with nhibernate queryover

5587482
children	parent
i have a parent entity and it has a set ... of some children entities

5587544
public	protected
maybe you could use protected instead of public

5587547
put	get
the system i have in place currently follows this design but it just dawned on me how stupid it is to put all that crap in every url especially when you get web indexers google analytics involved

5587552
google-chrome	firefox
while it displays alternating colors in firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 10 it does not work in ie 8

5587581
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
here are the three important major discrepancies between ie and other browsers such as google-chrome firefox and opera

5587582
superclass	subclassing
values of instance variables of superclass persist across instances of subclassing

5587613
equals	tostring
it doesn t make any sense to declare the equals and tostring method in the interface because every object already has them

5587639
post	get
how should i get and post the data back and forth

5587645
serializable	deserialization
for example you could serializable the x and y components separately and create a new foo instance from them in your deserialization code

5587647
post	get
if sometext is coming from get post

5587654
hide	show
if i want to dynamically show or hide several user controls

5587654

would it be better to use panels that load the user controls and then show or hide the panels visible true false or would it be better to use a placeholder and load add or unlaod clear them at runtime loadcontrol

5587690
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works completely fine if this font is installed on the machine i have 3 machines here one has the font installed and it works the other two do not and it renders a different font. it only renders incorrectly in firefox and google-chrome safari is able to render it just fine

5587690
google-chrome	firefox
both google-chrome and firefox render it like this

i load the pthread library in my program using dlopen and fetch handlers to pthread_create and pthread_join using dlsym

5587756

5587761
google-chrome	safari
its fine in ff3 safari google-chrome ie 7 and 8 for sure

5587774
google-chrome	firefox
this must work in ie7+ firefox google-chrome

5587790

5587820
width	height
4 adjacent objects of width height 25 for example starting at one edge

5587825
passenger	thin	passenger	webrick	thin	webrick
in my instance webrick was taking 40 seconds for a page load whereas passenger on apache and thin had no problems

5587825
thin	webrick
i recommend trying an alternate web server easy to test from the command line with thin and webrick in particular to see if the problem goes away

5587915
onresume	onpause
if you re using a mylocationoverlay on the map be sure to call disablemylocation in your activity s onpause and enable it with enablemylocation in onresume

5587942
folder	directory
replace text in files namespace test copy files including their directory with cp -p don t want to write over folder but renaming each directory file with as above namespace test

5587956
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome it works perfectly but in ie9 i get

5587959
.htaccess	httpd.conf
otherwise there s a mod_rewrite option to check in either httpd.conf or in .htaccess called maxredirects which prevents redirects from going into infinite loops

5587979
rss	feed
when a user clicks on a summary of an rss feed item i create an almost-full screen web view with just a single close button

5588019
cairngorm	mate
i m more familiar with mate than cairngorm but what i do in this situation is to back up my pop up with a model and dispatch the events off of the model

5588024
zlib	libpng
their site clearly says lã ve is licensed under the liberal zlib libpng license

5588041
qsort	malloc
normally i would just malloc a buffer to use as an array and call qsort but four million 8 bytes is one huge chunk of contiguous memory

5588171
mp3	wav
i just figured our how to use ffmpeg with php to convert audio files from wav to mp3 on the fly

5588194
put	get
how to get one column data of a table and it can be put into a column of another table

5588242
couchbase	couchdb	membase	couchbase	membase	couchdb
membase has recently merged with couchbase and they will have a version of membase that will offer couchdb s map reduce and query index ability in the next major release scheduled around early 2011

i want to write a batch job that when executed will grab all the files in the c test log folder and move them to a new directory in the c test

5588302
membase	couchdb
membase has recently merged with couchdb and will be updating it s disk persisting layer from sqllite to couchdb giving membase the ability to do map reduce and querying indexing

5588311
filesystems	ntfs
scan ntfs mft directly figure out ntfs filesystems structures there are open source implementations available

5588353
listview	gridview
i have a listview gridview that i want to sort by 2 columns so if 2+ items have the same value in column 1 it sorts by column 2

5588353
comparator	icomparer
i made a comparator icomparer that takes care of this but i m not sure how to use it

5588358
int	double
casting a 64 bit double to a 16 bit int is completely different code from casting a decimal to a float and so on

5588453
stdout	fflush
either end your output with a n or fflush stdout

5588533
octal	decimal
the non-ascii character 255 is just being shown in decimal not octal

5588533
octal	decimal
confirming according to od the first 4 bytes are indeed in octal ascii or 1 byte decimal

5588533
octal	decimal
so just remember that 255 in decimal is 377 in octal

5588539
udp	tcp
i have the port 27017 enabled for tcp and udp for both incoming and outgoing on both server a and server b

5588556
post	get
what matters is the get and post requests can be forged

5588556
post	get
the whole point of having a csrf token is that a 3rd party can t create an exact get post request without knowing somthing about the site and a simple token written as a hidden value works because of same-origin policy

5588591
visualvm	jprofiler	visualvm	yourkit	yourkit	jprofiler
you can use jprofiler yourkit visualvm hpjmeter

5588594
put	get
if you have mastertable changetable and datatable and you re querying for user if you put userid as a field in each table then you could do a join on that user id and this would allow you to get all your records without creating multiple queries

5588611
firefox	safari
i ve tried this both in firefox and safari with no luck

5588612
inherited	properties
some architectures will treat nodes much like object-oriented classes where you have different classes of nodes that can inherited various characteristics of parent nodes - every type of node inherited the basic properties of its parent - an essay node might inherited the properties of a text-document node which in turn inherited the properties of the base node

5588630
client-side	server-side
php is all server-side so in order to keep them from submitting you ll need client-side validation

5588651
comparator	icomparer
you just need to customize your icomparer to support multiple column sorting i googled and found this comparator implementation that you can feed it several property paths separated by commas and suffixed with asc desc like this

5588694
range	median
i have to aggregate of course with a categorical break variable a quite big data table containing some continuous variables by resulting the mean median standard deviation and interquartile range iqr of the required variables

5588710
put	get
no matter what address i put in i get the messages

5588710
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried on firefox and google-chrome have tried running it locally and hosted nothing seems to work

5588770
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
i have a uinavigationcontroller w three views and associated buttons in the uinavigationbar for each view

5588781
folder	directory
then i would have 100 s of folder in my users directory on my server not to mention duplicate files all over the place taking up space

5588815
submit	submission
and is a strong indicator that your submit handler doesn t prevent normal submission of the form

5588825
superclass	subclassing
by adding the parentheses instead of declaring the superclass - nsobject in this case you have declared a class extension which is probably not visible to the subclassing via inclusion

5588847
pop-up	dialog
sure using signed certificates will solve the problem but i was curious if it is even possible via appscript to accept or click on the pop-up dialog boxes on safari

5588861
junit	testng
you ll definitely want to read the documentation on testng here as there are some differences from junit

5588887
post	get
the only problem i m having is i can t find any documentation on how to distinguish between data sent via get and via post

5588894
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the forum renders correctly in ie8+ firefox google-chrome and safari but not ie 7

5588947
client-side	server-side
so my question is as a sitecore developer have you ever used sitecore as purely a content data provider on the client-side and or server-side

5588953
post	get
i m new to web development so i don t totally understand get and post but i got some stuff working

5588976
post	get
a string containing the http method such as get or post

5589009
stdout	stderr
a kind user here gave me some code to work with for a command line shell but i want it to output to stdout and stderr instead of using a screen or whatever it is doing right now

5589009
stdout	stderr
part of the credit is for using stderr correctly anyways so it would definitely help to take the stdin stdout stderr approach

5589031
folder	directory
so now with that information i d like to be able to read my .txt file match the directory copy all the files that start with for that directory also i d like to be able to copy the folder listed in the .txt file

5589034
google-chrome	firefox
i experience this same behavior in current version of google-chrome and firefox 4

5589045
folder	directory
so - i gave the ms sql server user permissions to read starting from the first directory it was denied from my user folder

5589096
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested as working in firefox 4 google-chrome 4 opera 11 safari 4 ie 8 + quirks and ie 7 + quirks

5589118
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
here s some test code that runs smoothly in about half a second in latest firefox google-chrome safari on os x winxp and win7 plus ie7 8 on winxp for simplicity i removed the tweak that makes it work in ie6

5589127
width	height
the width and height configuration are not respected

5589137
draggable	droppable
yes that s a problem when you mixing sortables draggable droppable etc

5589148
post	get
your access token is encoded in that signed_request variable you get from the post

5589171
jdom	xerces
jdom is not an xml parser like xerces

5589230
ant	maven
yes i m aware i could use ant maven or even phing but i d rather use something implemented in python

5589255
google-chrome	firefox
now when i click on an input button in ie7 ie8 ie9 firefox and google-chrome the page redirects properly without displaying the exit popup

5589268
width	height
i have a calayer subclass that is constrained to the width of the parent layer but a fixed height

5589278
put	get
this is code we put on uitableviewcell items to get a similar effect

5589289
mousemove	mouseup
i have got this script working from how to get mouseup to fire once mousemove complete working within the jquery document scope

5589289
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
and when i click on the flash object the mousedown event fired mousemove event fired but not the mouseup event which where i want to unbind the mousemove

5589289
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
but when i click on non flash area mousedown works mousemove works and mouseup also works

5589289
google-chrome	firefox
it works like i wanted it to in google-chrome but not in firefox

5589330
codeigniter	kohana
i m familiar with kohana but not codeigniter so much so i m guessing a bit to what you mean by constants. i believe the closest thing to this is indeed kohana s config api

5589330
folder	directory
to accomplish this you ll need to create a config file under your config folder probably in the application directory

5589356
int	double
out of the box web2py does server-side validation client side js pre-validation of int double and calendar popup for date time datetime

5589356
postgresql	mysql
it can partially do the latter for mysql and postgresql but only partially because its goal is the the opposite have users write no sql but use the database abstraction layer for creating tables

5589364
clang	icc
clang and icc have adopted this gcc extension but msvc has not

5589366
jar	war
this modification can be done before the classes are put into a jar war or can happen dynamically while the code is being loaded

5589383
int	double
i m looking to take an ieee double and remove any int part of it in the most efficient manner possible

5589388
int	double
this just subtracts the int portion of the double from the value itself the remainder should be the fractions component

5589446
lxml	elementtree
you ll be much happier if you use a more modern xml api like elementtree in the standard library or lxml more advanced

5589446
lxml	elementtree
in elementtree or lxml you get access to xpath or something close which allows for a much more flexible syntax in finding elements and attributes in xml documents

5589478
post	get
why is it that when i call this method inside a servlet either get or post

5589496
mouse	keyboard
this means any mouse or keyboard events are within the flash object

5589503
keystore	jks
but it only generate jks keystore so you again need protecle to convert it to bks format

5589515
atomic	interlocked
edit april 2017 i recently learned that when .net is running in 32-bit mode or in the wow subsystem the 64-bit interlocked operations are not guaranteed to be atomic with respect to non- interlocked external views of the same memory locations

5589515
atomic	interlocked
in 32-bit mode the atomic guarantee only applies globablly across qword accesses which use the interlocked and perhaps or tbd

5589515
atomic	interlocked
in other words to obtain 64-bit atomic operations in 32-bit mode all accesses to qword locations must occur through interlocked in order to preserve the guarantees and you can t get cute assuming that direct reads are protected just because you always use interlocked functions for writing

5589525
mongoid	mongomapper
i just wanted to confirm that mongoid and mongomapper can not be used in an eventmachine environment because they are blocking and thus defeat the point of using eventmachine in the first place and that i m not wasting my time writing these mappers

5589534
bindparam	bindvalue
another consideration and this is purely subjective use bindparam instead of bindvalue

5589572
youtube	vimeo
example youtube vimeo video i play and software store audio for them

5589637
folder	directory
and you have to create a .svc file in the root directory or in the services folder with the service endpoint services mysite-web-models-mydomainservice.svc with the following code inside

5589639
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
is there any way to pass the reference of current viewmodel to the view which user is navigating to in caliburn.micro

5589662
inherited	properties	public	protected
it makes no difference if you ad-hoc inject a new undeclared properties so it becomes public or if you declare a protected properties in an inherited class

5589703
apache	nginx
i remember there is option in php or nginx apache to allow symbolic link you need to check that

5589708
dlsym	dlopen
i was going to use dlopen and dlsym on linux to make these two source files work

5589710
for-loop	loops
my first aim was to parallelize almost all the for loops in the code i have even parallelized for within for-loop and right now having done that i get some speedup.i am looking for more places ideas options to parallelize...i know this might sound a bit vague without having much reference to the problem but i am looking for generic ideas here which i can explore in my code

5589710
width	height
overview of algo the following algo is run over all levels of the image starting with shortest and increasing width and height by 2 each time till you reach actual height and width

5589725
wxruby	shoes	wxruby	fxruby	shoes	fxruby
other standard gui toolkits for ruby are wxruby fxruby ruby qt shoes etc. but i am not sure which of them has a pdf renderer

5589740
ubuntu	linux
from the linux machine ubuntu 10.10 write to parallel port

5589780
html5lib	beautifulsoup
as i know there are not any parsing libraries that parse wordpress html specially but general-purpose html parsing libraries such as html5lib beautifulsoup

5589807
rss	feed
alright so i m currently working on parsing an rss feed

5589829
put	get
in your case you should put the methods that are specific to character in the character class and only get your helloworld to trigger those methods

5589829
ccscene	cclayer
normally people implement the update or tick method at the cclayer or ccscene level where the purpose is to check all the actors sprites menus nested layers etc for collision interaction and update their attributes

5589849
pull	push
both ends of each of those two interfaces might wish to initiate a transaction which i can easily do if i roll my own protocol so should i use push pull long-poll or what

5589886
int	double
i m looking for the bare minimum classes from one or the other project to encode strings or numbers int int16 in64 double float decimal etc.

5589937
width	height
the image shown above has a width and height of 300 pixels

5589937
width	height
this corresponds to 10 of the width and height

5589974
rss	feed
before i ask my question let me just say that i know very little about rss feed

5589974
rss	feed
i have been asked to implement rss feed into it

5589974
rss	feed
specifically i have been asked to create an rss feed for each support agent s tickets

5589974
rss	feed
so let s say that john doe and jane doe both subscribe to their respective rss feed to be notified whenever a ticket gets assigned to them

5590013
rss	feed
manually create a file containing the rss xml referencing the pages from your site that you want in your feed

5590018
width	margin
when you using float for both sidebar and contain inside the wrapper you must make sure that the width of sidebar and contain including margin and padding equal or less than 600px

5590049
rss	feed
maintaining lots and lots of rss feed might get quite cumbersome

5590052
temp	tmp
puzzling over this and i m guessing here it looks like the compiler is taking temp fixed pointer to the tmp array then indexing that with 33

5590054
rss	feed
rss feed are generally available to public without restrictions if they know the url

5590075
rss	feed
just update the rss feed and if they are subscribed the change will propagate through to the end-user

and remember to validate on the server-side even if you validate on client-side

5594710
client-side	server-side

the one case i can think of where you might want to use settimeout instead of setinterval would be when the work you re doing in the function called on timeout updatemessagecount in my example below takes longer than the timeout interval which would cause the next timeout when using setinterval to appear to be instantaneous since the timer is going to fire every n seconds irrespective of whether the function called by the previous timeout is still executing

i am trying to determing if the tunnel is tcp or udp

5601305
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	heapsort
then you can implement various algorithms such as quicksort mergesort heapsort in subclasses

5601305
quicksort	mergesort
one concrete advantage is that if at some point you want a different sorting algorithm then you can change quicksort to say mergesort in this single line without having to change it anywhere else

5601327
post	get	post	put	put	get
since most browsers do not support http methods other than get and post we mimic other methods like put and delete as follows

5601327
post	put
we send a normal post request and add a parameter _method put or _method delete take care of the underscore

5601375
jobs	cron
if you add jobs to a job queue and then have a cron clear that queue your not really doing it asynchronously

5601637
put	get
question 1 is is there a resource for me to get some examples of how it s all put together for things like

5601652
hash	md5
then you can use following to get md5 hash

5601735
children	parent
the child object query using the future would be completely optional as you re fetching the children with the parent

5601776
public	protected
the private and protected methods of a class aren t part of the public interface so they don t expose public behavior

5601783
public	protected
protected methods form a different contract between your class and its future children so you should really be testing it to a similar extent as your public interface to ensure that the contract is well defined and exercised

5601828
post	put
lastly you could also put out regular updates for the game and only the latest version should be able to post the records etc

specify a width on the elements and then apply a text-align center

5601995
post	get
i have two controllers for the view one for get requests and one for post

5601995

5602081
put	get
put the following code in your iframe and you will get the logged in user id then check constraint on it

5602103
mpfr	mpc
using instead gmp-5.0.1 the configure script appears to correctly guess cc gcc -std gnu99 cflags -o2 -pedantic -m64 -mtune core2 -march core2 and passes that on to mpfr 3.0.1 and mpc 0.9 so anyone using these or more recent versions shouldn t get this error

5602115
submit	submission
if you aren t submission your form strictly through script using submit buttons etc it still allows users to submit invalid data such as script tags etc.

5602138
folder	directory
now .htaccess file considering my image folder as catgory directory and images as pagetitle and does not display images

5602151
hash	md5
i am able to find and replace but i want to replace the current context with a md5 hash version of itself

5602151
hash	md5
obviously that is a random string but i need to replace the node with the md5 hash version of itself

5602216
width	height
if you want to know the size of the visible masked area why not give the movieclip that is the mask an instance name and use its width height and position for your layout purposes

5602229
hide	show
for that we implement a library for common tasks like show hide write and such things

5602232
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
you need to implement inotifypropertychanged on the class you re binding to and the list of items should implement inotifycollectionchanged like observablecollection

5602239
width	height
the height and width have been hardcoded for testing purposes but these are the actual image size

5602243
webkit	gecko
options for replacing it seem to be seems to be either packaging webkit gecko or build my own browser ontop of a html rendering component

5602243
webkit	gecko
i didn t like webkit gecko much because of the extra size it adds to the program

5602244
button	checkbox
these inputs may include text fields checkbox radio-buttons submit button hidden inputs hidden from the agent filling the form and more

5602244
post	get
a web form element also is characterized by the action that will be undertaken on submit and the method used to make the request http get or post

5602244
button	checkbox
forms contain special elements called controls like inputbox checkbox radio-buttons submit button etc

5602247
width	height
if the dimensions of the image are fixed say width 200 height 300 then something like this should work

5602250
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if you use an objectoutputstream on one side you ll have to use an objectinputstream at the other side

5602263
folder	directory
so the static files are located for now in the directory named static right outside the project folder

5602301

5602318
octal	decimal	octal	hex
non-printable characters in a field are sometimes escaped using one of several c style character escape sequences ### and o### octal x## hex d### decimal and u#### unicode

5602346
google-chrome	firefox
as you can see it works in google-chrome but doesn t work in firefox nor in ie they just behave as if there was no overflow scroll at all

5602371
post	get
my question is - is there a way to limit the number of post that get retrieved

5602386
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
how does one create a website where the element style attributes padding margin height width etc are appropriate for the users screen resolution

5602465

the height and width of the final cropped bitmap image are both larger than those of the screen

5602570
realloc	malloc
for an assignment part of what i have to do involves the use of malloc and realloc

5602629
pexpect	telnetlib
imho you re normally better-off with a currently-maintained library like exscript or telnetlib but the efficient incantation in pexpect is

5602676

i then tried to persuade my dos-based users to upgrade to unix-based systems in order to work with supported versioning of isql but only a few opted to migrate

5602718
onresume	onpause
however it might be simplest to toggle a value in sharedpreferences within the activity onpause onresume callbacks

5602725
webclient	httpwebrequest
use the .net classes that allow for retrieval of http information without ui controls namely httpwebrequest or the simpler webclient

5602805
mvp	presenter
the only benefit that i can think of that is specific to the mvvm pattern over mvp of which it is a variant is that in mvvm you do not need to explicitly attach a view to a viewmodel presenter as you would in an mvp implementation

5602805
mvp	presenter
bindingexpressions most importantly in mvp you would define an interface that represents how the presenter can interact with the view ixxxxview is a conventional naming pattern and when you create your presenter you pass in the view interface to it which is attached to the view instance

5602839
centos	linux
also i do not know what other operating systems this works on other than redhat centos linux so it may not be that portable

5602874
for-loop	loops
after that a for-loop is ran to add values into their respective hashmap and then the hashmaps are ran through another loops used for packet creation

5602878
hide	show
next on the hover or click event of item.name you ll use jquery to show or hide the popup

5602893
webclient	httpwebrequest
if you really need a browser control for example you re doing a web scraper requiring execution of javascript which you can t implement with a webclient or httpwebrequest try geckofx an open-source component which makes it easy to embed mozilla gecko firefox into any .net application

5602903
post	get
if your code varies from the example you will have to post it to get precise help

5602903
width	height
bitmap file size is a function of pixel width times height - they get bigger fast

5602906
post	get
i was going to create a script to get the data from the 3 textboxes and populate the hidden field ready for the http post

5602914
post	get
the way you may want to get around this is to do the full post back in an iframe or simply create a direct link to the download file even if that might be a ashx handler where you can continue to have similar logic to what you are already using

5602948
google-chrome	safari
for most browsers the button renders correctly but in google-chrome and safari the value submit displays in front of the button

5602950
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
java.util.calendar java.util.date

5602950
getter	setter
so if you don t specify column it derives column value from getter setter

5602958
atof	strtod
if not it might be assuming atof or strtod should return an int and reading from whatever location functions that return integers normally return which will result in nonsense answers

5602971
udp	tcp
you correctly specify tcp or udp might break things if it s the wrong one

5602991
accessor	properties
but accessor methods are mostly boilerplate too so we use properties declarations to create them automagically rather than writing them by hand

5602991
accessor	properties
edit apple s memory management guide provides a lot of detail about what the accessor methods generated by properties do behind the scenes

5602999

you may have to create it and chmod chown it accordingly before running your script

5603128
qitemdelegate	qabstractitemview
have a look at the qabstractitemview setitemdelegate method and the qitemdelegate class

5603136
coldfusion	railo
haven t tested this on railo but it should work on coldfusion 9 at least

5603144
accessor	properties
the properties s properties also give instructions to the compiler as to how to synthesize an accessor

5603144
ivar	subclassing
in init and dealloc access the ivar directly - you are interested in initialization and cleanup of the object s ivars and do not care about subclassing

5603144
accessor	ivar	ivar	subclassing
if a subclassing overrides an accessor direct access of the ivar could break designs

5603174
dbcontext	objectcontext
i also read articles about the solution of efproviderwrapper on jaroslaw kowalski s blog but it is based on objectcontext does not work for dbcontext

5603193
jobs	cron
cron_info display information about cron jobs

5603197
int	chars
given that your input expects chars you should be using a chars or int type ignoring possible utf-16 keyboard codes which given that you re on windows is likely

5603218
powerpc	i386
you can choose other... and then explicitly enter a list of architectures like powerpc i386 x86_64

5603250
super	implements
android also has longclicks longpress built in which work a lot like this minus controlling the exact duration of pressing but are super easy to implements

5603275
debian	linux
my linux distribution debian gnu linux 6.0 is been installed with openjdk which does not contain the sun packages

5603285
verilog	vhdl
for all that dont know them they take c code then translate it into some hardware description language like vhdl or verilog which then can be used to generate hardware usually it gets mapped to an fpga - but i am not limited to that asic as target would be fine too

5603289
width	height
and then you can set set contentsize cgsizemake width height

5603324
client-side	server-side
first of all we need to distinguish server-side and client-side certificates

5603328
button	checkbox
validate elements except checkbox radio button on blur

5603448
post	put
now when you submit the form you will expect that the value in the textbox changes to bar as that s what you ve put in your post action but the value doesn t change

5603494
for-loop	arrays
in a lot of programming languages and their micro-optimizations i ve seen that declaring the length of an arrays within a for-loop has performance implications especially in php and javascript

5603526
pop-up	dialog
now what i would wish is to have the dialog pop-up after say 2 seconds insterad of immediately

5603564
filesystems	ntfs
how allocation is done depends entirely on the filesystems type fat32 ntfs jfs reiser etc

5603590
punctuation	words
i thought this would separate each words w and the specified punctuation

5603636
punctuation	words
if you want to be more permissive you should use unicode character classes instead allows letters numbers combining marks dash characters and the apostrophe for words and punctuation for punctuation

5603643
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

5603655
filesystems	ntfs
the behavior of an ntfs filesystems in windows may be nothing like the behavior of an ext3 filesystems in ubuntu for the same set of logical operations

5603672
for-loop	arrays
you don t need the second for-loop you just need to add the last number at the last position of the arrays

5603673
regression	least-squares
the obvious route would be to do a least-squares linear regression through the points

5603690
portrait	landscape
but its giving width as 668.0 in portrait as well as landscape

5603704
hide	show
then use jquery s toggle to show and hide again

5603705
width	height
it has a width of 300px and height 100px

5603705
width	height
is it possible to use each portion having width height 100px with different id so that the image can be used as a button with different functions to each portion

5603732
oncreate	setcontentview
and add this line to the oncreate method right after setcontentview ...

5603803
getter	setter
in fact specifying getter setter like this is not really what tdd is for

5603803
getter	setter
the idea is to let a requirement drive the setter getter into existence

5603820
put	get
right now after i put the file in the folder i start with a loop until i get that file back so i can read the result

5603822
subtract	add
this basically says take the value from the cell above then add the value of the cell 2 to the left and subtract the value in the cell directly to the left

5603886
instances	transient
i am thinking of making it transient and caching the instances inside the viewbase so essentially inside a usercontrol instance.

5603892
folder	directory
which directory should i have installed the ruby and rubygems folder into

5603900
rss	feed
the webcal protocol prefix is used to trigger an external protocol handler which is passed the url of the .ics file rather than being passed the downloaded contents of the file in much the same way feed is sometimes used to trigger external rss readers

5603936
inherited	subclassing
protected inherited means only derived and its subclassing knows it also is-a base

5603994
wordpress	joomla
there are lots of cmss available out there and most of them are good also but the three that always stand out are drupal joomla and wordpress

5603994
wordpress	joomla
joomla and wordpress are easier to configure but not as customizable as drupal is

5604019
width	height
example width height or left can be

5604019
width	height
specifically for example width height or left can be animated but background-color cannot be

expression-blend	silverlight
i developped a silverlight 3 application in visual studio 2008 and expression-blend 3

5604193
expression-blend	silverlight
some weeks ago i ported the app to silverlight 4 and upgraded my tools to expression-blend 4 and visual studio 2010

5604199
width	height
a way to just get the scale values might be to remove any transforms measure the computed width height of the element and then add them back and measure again

5604202
post	put
proposed solutions still did not work for me django 1.2.3 piston 0.2.2 so i ve tweaked joekrell solution and this finally works i m only using post and put but presumably you can add other verbs to the list

5604204
stdout	stderr
i discovered the bufsize argument but it doesn t say which of the 3 stdin stdout stderr files it s actually applied to

5604258
google-chrome	firefox
however in google-chrome and firefox 4 facebook is using something different and rewriting to

5604288
cos	sin
if you mean 1 cos 1 sin and 1 tan implementing these functions is a trivial exercise but dealing with error checking sin

5604368
client-side	server-side
that way it is automatically sent to your server with every user request so no need to build out a custom server-side api for receiving the state after a lost connection and no need to have any custom client-side code for sending the data to the server and still updateable even if the user has lost internet connectivity

5604368
client-side	server-side
note that because the state is always available client-side and sent to the server on every request there is no need to maintain any explicit copy of the state server-side unless you want to be able to remember the user s place even when they manually delete their cookies which is overkill in my opinion

5604374
wav	riff
riff wav files use little-endian byte order

5604439
floating-point	integer
you can check this by inspecting the underlying representation either in a debugger or by trace output you can access it by placing it in a union of the floating-point type and an integer of the same size

5604440
sml	scheme
this is entirely different from scheme or sml

5604440
haskell	scheme
in scheme the file is interpreted as being executed form-by-form but haskell s top level is only declarations

5604441
stdout	stderr
i discovered the bufsize argument but it applies to all of the stdin stdout and stderr files

5604442
g++	gcc
you ll need to compile that as c++ so rename your file to .cpp and make sure g++ is called to drive the compile link rather than gcc

5604481

5604615
post	get
i did my homework and i read the spring reference guides googled for tutorials etc but it seems that converters are primarily a tool for converting data from get parameters and post queries

5604619
width	height
if yes just pass the data to the above function you will also need the width and height of your image to be converted correctly

5604692
google-chrome	safari
the following question s answer contains a code example distinguish google-chrome from safari using jquery.browser

do not rely on settimeout setinterval or any other built-in utility for scheduling a function invocation to provide a high degree of accuracy or precision particularly when you are executing custom rendering code

5604780
coalesce	isnull
the coalesce or isnull function is require for count first nullable columns

5604845
cassini	iis
i reread and see that you are using iis instead of cassini

5604970
unsigned	short
utf8 is stored as a variable-amount of chars whereas utf16 is stored using surrogate pairs - and thus inside a wchar_t or unsigned short though incidentally sizeof wchar_t on windows is only 2 vs 4 on nix and thus you ll often need 2 wchar_t types to store the 1 character if a surrogate pair encoding is used - which it will be in many cases

5604980
many-to-many	many-to-one
in the relational model tables can be related as any of many-to-many many-to-one rev

entity-relationship	diagram
it includes a tool that creates entity-relationship diagram from the database schema

5605064
lemmatization	stemming
the purpose of both stemming and lemmatization is to reduce morphological variation

5605064
lemmatization	stemming
the real difference between stemming and lemmatization is threefold

5605064
lemmatization	stemming
stemming reduces word-forms to pseudo stems whereas lemmatization reduces the word-forms to linguistically valid lemmas

5605064
lemmatization	stemming
lemmatization deals only with inflectional variance whereas stemming may also deal with derivational variance

5605074
width	height
its resize the height and width depends upon the max width

5605131
jobs	cron
as of now i am running only one beanstalk worker thread for my project which handles both cron based jobs and real time jobs

5605131
jobs	cron
one worker is used to track the cron based jobs and one more to track the real time asynchronous jobs

5605142
min	max
i just noticed that the new standard defines min a b and max a b without constexpr

5605143
persistent	transient
use memcache to store newly added user urls and the task queue to periodically write that transient data to the persistent datastore

5605186

can one of the popular java mocking frameworks like easymock or mockito be used to mock clojure protocols defined with defprotocol

5605226
width	height
let s consider i only want to allow 4 lines in the following example you can t go higher than a height of 84 pixels with the given font in a given uitextview with a width of 200

5605239
translation	localization
it also makes it hard for the calling context to provide localization something i believe has no place in an exception - i hate attempting to translation before googling

5605268
width	height
is there any reason why the css above would change the width height of a textbox when i have it in focus

5605270
punctuation	words
the issue is that i m trying to take an array of words remove any punctuation from the array and place the new words into a separate array

sometimes functions allocate memory you have to free after using them strdup

5605392
express	node.js
i ve got a node.js express server running with the jade template engine

5605402
portrait	landscape
what i have learned indicates that a portrait class must contain a property which keeps an instance of the landscape class

5605402
portrait	landscape
and when the device is rotated the portrait view instance must present the landscape view instance over it has a modal view

5605402
portrait	landscape
when the landscape view is the frontmost view over the window it will receive those rotate event methods and can resend to the portrait view which will continue managing it.

5605432
post	get
problem is that this works perfetly fine with get requests but not with post requests

ant	maven
bundler is a gem which package all your project gem dependencies think of it as maven or ant if you are coming from java background

5605554
archetypes	dexterity
dexterity has gone this route but its not available for archetypes based content types or general classes like tools

5605605
children	parent
this can be achieved by having the view pass both the parent and the children to the list function in a particular order

5605605
children	parent
for the simpler case of only one parent the view may emit the parent entity followed by its children and the list function may go along the lines of

5605612
opera	firefox
this works on both firefox 4 and chromium 10.x but fails on opera 11.01 all running on ubuntu 10.10

5605612
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i don t have access to either mac or windows so i can t say how safari or ie will handle the display block on tr elements or even firefox and google-chrome running on different platforms

5605652
width	height
i ve set each of the imageviews layout width and layout height properties to 100dp and 50dp respectively i ve also tried px instead of dp and i ve tried changing the imageviews max size but the imageviews continue to scale rather than staying at this fixed size

5605660
keydown	keyup
yes you can fire the keydown or keyup event on a textbox

5605694
width	margin
you should either 1 adjust the width you use in sizewithfont to respect the text view s margin or 2 use an auxiliary uitextview object to accurately compute the content size

5605710
memcached	apc
apc is primarily used for storing the bytecode into an os managed shared-memory segment but it also has an api for sharing anything you want between processes like a local version of memcached

5605714
for-loop	loops
i am trying to parallelize a for-loop operation which is sandwiched between two for loops

5605720
width	margin
i don t know about pure css solution but you can use javascript to dynamically count and adjust correct width of left margin while making the right margin a bit thinner - by size of scrollbar

5605726
apache	nginx
ssl is handled at the apache nginx whatever level

5605792
width	margin
if you insist on fixing something people have learned to live with it s going to have to be a dynamic javascript solution where you calculate your left margin and add the width of the scrollbar

5605819
matplotlib	scipy
here s an implementation with scipy matplotlib

5605824
int	chars
since the unicode range u+0080 to u+00ff is identical to the iso-8859-1 byte range 0x80-0xff the non-ascii chars can be encoded by casting them to int values

5605844
int	chars
where s is chars number is a variable int

5605950
richtextbox	textblock
i then have two controls in the ui a textblock and a richtextbox

5605950
richtextbox	textblock
the textblock is bound to the count property of the datasource whilst the richtextbox appends each new data value to its text string ie

5605950
richtextbox	textblock
if i disable the richtextbox binding the textblock updates very quickly cycling through the count

5605950
richtextbox	textblock
i understand the richtextbox may well be slow but why does it have to slow down the otherwise lightening fast textblock

5605969
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is working in firefox google-chrome and safari as it should but as you can guess not in that great pieace of microsoft software called internet explorer

5605985
aptana	radrails
i have installed the aptana aptana radrails version 2.0.5.1278709071-7k7w97fdk_sbcjt_y-tkcz0v4cxb

5606018
for-loop	loops
the index loops variable used in a generate for-loop

5606021
width	height
if you want a pure css option i believe an absolute positioned div inside the body with width and height of 100 overflow auto and right padding larger than the width of a scroll bar will replace the normal scrollbar without shifting the content to the left on long pages

5606043
onclick	onchange
i would suggest changing your event from onchange to a different event onclick

5606058
db4o	eloquera
which should i consider eloquera or db4o

5606074
versioning	upgrade
but when i upgrade my visual studio versioning to 2010 sql server stops working

5606083
put	get
i need to get the cookies from a http response sent by a server and put it in the next request s header

5606084
getchar	getline
but getchar only consumed the y and leaves the buffered which your first getline call reads

5606158
sigkill	multitasking
i was experimenting with my app in the ios simulator when i found that it produces the sigkill signal when i delete it from the multitasking bar and then rerun it

5606174
width	height
since it will vary in size height and width of the items must fit the contents i can t use a fixed graphic

5606174
width	height
use a single background image bigger than any of the boxes will be in height and width using css to position them in the corners

5606190
opera	firefox
works in ie 7 to 9 firefox and opera tested by me .

5606190
google-chrome	safari
author says it supports google-chrome and safari too

5606193
awt	swing
since you are just learning applets why don t you start by creating a swing applet instead of an awt applet

5606246
getter	setter
it automatically adds setter getter to your code at compile

5606296
google-chrome	firefox
it does in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie8

5606296
google-chrome	firefox
it has to work in ie8 firefox any google-chrome ie7 and older is not important

5606334
hide	show
basically i m detecting the presence of css that hide ads and if i find it i d like to show a little message

5606337
memcached	apc
you can also think about splitting the big array into slices and then always retrieve the part you currently need from an apc or memcached

5606342
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
i use vim because i can go fast and well in vim whether i am writing c++ or any other language on windows linux solaris mac os x or freebsd

5606360
hide	show
alternately show and hide the chosen axis as the shape changes direction at the limits of its travel

5606376
fltk	glui
cegui fltk glui so flat and gray

5606376
sdl	freeglut
the other possibility is developing from scratch my custom toolkit using sdl or freeglut in this case which could be the best solution

5606382
implements	extends
public class billingservice extends service implements serviceconnection

5606400
public	protected
if you add methods public protected or private because they make a failing test pass then you ve more or less achieved the goal of tdd

5606400
public	protected
if you add methods public protected or private because you just decide to violating tdd then your code coverage should catch these and you should be able to improve your process

5606412
firefox	safari
this works in firefox but not ie or safari

5606458
width	height
so a uiscrollview is designed to display content of an arbitrary width height and a uitableview provides an interface through which you can display a table of arbitrary length

5606459
inherited	properties
the beauty of wpf using the icommand interface is that you should be able to favor a more compositional approach rather an an inherited model and use an interface to share common properties

5606460
gif	png
now i want to know if there is any image format like png gif where such gradients could be stored in a more compressed way

5606460
gif	png
problem is converting from jpeg to png gif is not the right way and actually increases the size because the noise has to be losslesly encoded

5606473
post	get	post	put	put	get
the point is that http forms can only use methods get and post not put or delete

5606473
put	get
first if you get a put or delete there is nowhere to put the protect_from_forgery token

5606473
post	get	post	put	put	get
second since html forms can only use post and get if the request is a put or delete the attacker cannot use a html form to force or trick the user into submitting the request

5606481
portrait	landscape
however when i add the navigation controller it is added in portrait mode ipad is still in landscape but the navigation controller is flipped

5606526
serializable	deserialization
now serializable deserialization of enums works different than with other objects

5606538
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the animation seems to work fine in firefox and safari but when i ve tested it in google-chrome the text duplicates across the screen and just generally messes up in a weird way

5606543
apache	nginx
having apache as a reverse proxy wouldn t be much efficient and that s why nginx is popular in this scenario

5606543
apache	nginx
other alternative than nginx based reverse proxy can be as khez suggested mapping your subdomain to different ip address which will node.js program listen to or maybe use node.js itself as a reverse proxy for apache

5606549
maven	pom.xml
maven configuration files are typically named pom.xml and contain among other things all the dependencies for a project

5606566
backgrounding	multitasking
if you have pending network activity such as trying to logout you might want to use the multitasking call beginbackgroundtaskwithexpirationhandler to request a bit of additional time in the backgrounding to finish the log out process such as handshake with any network callbacks required

5606651
portrait	landscape
1 when the activity starts if the device is in portrait orientation i want to display a view that asks the user to please rotate the device into landscape orientation

5606651
portrait	landscape
i thought i could set my requested orientation to either landscape or sensor landscape but that doesn t work in the first case i get an upside-down screen depending on the original orientation and in the second i always get portrait orientation for some reason

5606665
super	self
super connection self .__init__ args kwargs2

5606737

asterisk external ivr interface

5606794
config	ini
i was reading an article on php config files and xml files were the fastest outside the ini

5606795
gif	png
you can usually experience some good savings this way if you use png gif and force limits on the color palette

5606821
vmware	bootcamp
how can i port my windows installation from vmware fusion to bootcamp

5606844
int	boolean
you can use sharedpreferences to save any primitive data boolean floats int longs and strings

5606882
django-cms	mezzanine
coming from the django world i d recommend using a third party app such as django-cms and mezzanine

5606907
multiplying	division
finally the last division by r is redundant as written since you multiplying by r at the same level just before

5606954
wordpress	joomla
if you are using any cms like wordpress or joomla or se then you have option to do that else you need to have an .htaccess file where you can write the code refer this links

5606975
joptionpane	jdialog
thus it should be a dialog type of window either a joptionpane or a modal jdialog and not a jframe

5606975
joptionpane	jdialog
regarding extracting the animal type information from the second window dialog if you call the second window as a modal jdialog or joptionpane which is really a specialized modal jdialog you will know exactly when the user has completed his work with the second window since your main window s code will start up right after the spot where you called setvisible true on the second window or called joptionpane.showxxxx

5606978
implements	extends
does anyone know any ways to clarify exactly how i should implements this and what sort of script is required to extends the plugin to have this sort of functionality for more than just one scroll pane

5607003
inherited	subclassing
finally the util module provides an inherited method to subclassing another constructor and inherited from its prototypes

5607011
qstring	qlist
in the qtcreator change signals slots context menu i can t insert neither signals nor slots that have parameterized arguments such as qlist qstring etc

5607015
range	min	range	max	min	max
for the following input types number range date datetime datetime-local month time and week which aren t fully supported yet use the min and max attributes

5607016
post	get
i wonder what happens if i have two machines that are load-balanced and one will receive the initial post and the other a subsequent get

5607061
min	max
secondly as a general tip if you want to find the min or max value in the entire matrix instead of calling it twice use min ima and max ima

5607073
mdpi	hdpi
android uses the three folders for hdpi mdpi ldpi

5607073
mdpi	hdpi
just drawable no hdpi mdpi ldpi

5607087
urllib	cookielib
you should use the cookielib module with urllib

5607096
folder	directory
on the iphone once it is installed you can t change this folder hence why you save it to the documents directory

5607096
folder	directory
nsbundle mainbundle doesn t give you the documents directory it gives you i think the .app folder though it might be the folder that contains the app documents and other folder

5607111
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
that s actually more like sorteddictionary than sortedlist given that it s a tree rather than just a list but it s probably the closest available option

5607129
implements	extends
i had the same problem but i managed to solve it when reading the source code of animationdrawable by implements my own animationdrawable class that extends animationdrawable and override the run method and add setduration method which allows me to set the duration as follow

5607177
firefox	safari
final question on this hi folks i may need to start a new question but just in case any of the people who helped originally can tell me any idea why this wouldn t be working in safari mac + pc or firefox pc only

5607192
py2app	platypus
for scripts that just print to stdout you might try platypus though it doesn t do the dependency-packaging stuff of py2app

5607207
calloc	malloc
i chose calloc because it zeros the memory which makes all those pointers null but you could use malloc and null them yourself

5607207
calloc	malloc
nb every call to malloc or calloc ought to be accompanied by a check to insure that the allocation worked

5607218
for-loop	while-loop
you should simply need a single for-loop or while-loop where you match the first variable in command against the rest of the values and check if their sums equal the target

5607236
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
of course transitions only work in firefox safari and i think google-chrome

5607240
ienumerable	iqueryable	ienumerable	icollection	icollection	iqueryable
much like we have linq providers for ienumerable iqueryable and iobservable it feels like we could should have a provider for something like iobservablecollection where iobservablecollection icollection inotifycollectionchanged or something similar

5607263
verilog	hdl
you have verilog hdl tags so assuming this is for synthesizable logic

5607340
post	get
since the get and post will propagate the cookie the queries for one user will always go to the same server

5607340
apache	nginx
apache s mod_proxy is a common choice though nginx is up and coming

5607352
ubuntu	centos
i m using small-footprint versions of ubuntu 904 and centos 5.5

5607364
vim	emacs
vi vim and emacs have somewhat of a learning curve but both are worth the invested time

5607373
implements	extends
you could extends it to take a message - but if you use the method as i do that is as a reminder that there is still something to be implements then usually there is no need for additional messages

5607383
firefox	safari
works perfectly in firefox safari and chrome.

5607396
gif	png
does anyone know of any free script that compresses jpg gif and png files as much as possible

5607407
onchange	onfocus
jquery onchange onfocus select box to display an image

5607415
haskell	scheme
haskell doesn t readily give you ways to introspect or execute call stacks so i wouldn t worry too much about that particular bizarre scheme

5607425
google-chrome	firefox
tested it in ie google-chrome firefox

5607466
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
if successful calloc malloc realloc reallocf and valloc functions return a pointer to allocated memory

5607479
gitolite	gitosis
when trying to set up either gitosis i understand this is deprecated for the git community per or gitolite it seems as though as soon as i set it up i have to be extremely careful because it seems everything is balancing on toothpicks

5607584
haskell	ocaml	ocaml	ada
finally with a strongly statically typed language like java ada ocaml haskell ... some mistakes can be uncovered at compile time and hence reduce the risk to provide an bugged program

5607589
spaces	delimiter
delimiter is spaces or comma

5607606
equals	gethashcode
the problem is that doesn t override equals and gethashcode which is what will use when trying to find an item

5607606
equals	gethashcode
in fact it will use the default equality comparer which means it ll use the implementation if the object implements it and fall back to equals gethashcode if necessary

5607607
starttls	smtps
i have been using email sender with email sender transport smtps tls send email using a starttls enabled relay

5607617
hide	show
that is i want to hide the contact_person and list nodes.deleting the nodes from the dataprovider cannot be done.so what i did was to create a custom tree data descriptor by extending defaultdatadescriptor.then override the getchildren method and applied a filterfunction to the collection returned by super.getchildren.the problem is when i hide the list node i cannot have the child nodes to show up.so is there any way i can hide list but show the children of node

5607620
put	get
i also tried to catch the notification with my tableviewcontroller and put in some other solutions but no chance the uiprogressview doesn t get updated live

5607653
put	get
use queue to put your images then use few threads to connect and get file sizes

5607701
subtract	add
then add the value of the call argument and subtract the value of address as shown on the left

5607723
ant	maven
currently i am not using any build tools maven or ant but develop and run unit tests solely from within eclipse

5607763
webrat	cucumber
if you re using webrat matchers with cucumber

5607823
gif	png
- any picture format gif jpg png svg etc

5607836
ant	maven
like you alluded to that s a job for maven or ant

5607880
weka	mallet
some links point to weka however mallet seems to be a better fit for this task but nobody links to this tool

5607880
weka	mallet
i was able to quickly train some classifiers with mallet and test them whereas with weka i run into a problem with my labels disappearing after using filters to transform my textfiles in maps named with the category of the texts within it

5607912
width	height
for your linearlayout give it layoutparams with fill_parent for width and height

5607935
post	get
you may want to use the methods for getting post or get values because it also checks whether a submitted value is a string or not

5607953
x86	64bit
64bit code is not actually faster it is usually a bit slower than x86 code

5607971
google-chrome	firefox
you could use hunspell the spell checker of openoffice mozilla firefox and google-chrome

5608005
boost	stl
thanks all but i ve heard about the stl and boost

5608019
width	height
i m trying to obtain the dimensions width height of a remote image from its url

5608039
boost	stl
you can use the stl algorithms and the boost library

5608056
post	get
you can implement the post redirect get pattern as detailed here on wikipedia to remove the refresh and double postback

5608061
hide	show	mouseover	mouseleave
i have a mouseover and mouseleave on an image that will hide or show a div

5608061
hide	show
all the images are in a class imgmouse and all the div s are in a class tri-bottom how can i write this jquery so the first tri-img will show and hide the first tri-bottom div and so on

5608068
min	max
2 furthermore the algorithms may take custom delegates such as max min expected cost hueristics see astarshortestpathalgorithm

5608076
button	checkbox
if i have three controls a checkbox label and button i see this code in the .designer.cs file

5608104
jar	war
i have an ear which contains ejb module jar and web module war

5608137
postorder	inorder
you can t derive an inorder listing from a postorder listing because postorder listing does not provide enough information about the shape of the tree

5608137
preorder	postorder
you need two listings postorder and preorder in order to uniquely reconstruct the tree

5608166
folder	directory
to be able to keep your directory structure you need to run gcov once inside each source file folder but use the -o option to tell gcov where the data files are

5608209
onfocus	onblur
well if i get you right you can use onblur and onfocus events with the toggleclass function

5608229
rspec	capybara
it describes database cleaner besides rspec and capybara

5608233
firefox	safari
i have a dynamic website www.lamanscanada.com it appears fine in firefox and safari and almost perfect in ie7

5608247
autocomplete	omnicomplete
autocomplete of vim omnicomplete is powerful tool of vim

5608267
equals	gethashcode
if the equals method does a good job at handling my custom equality why do i have to override the gethashcode method as well

5608267
equals	gethashcode
when comparing something like below which comparer is used the equals or the gethashcode

5608269
hide	show
so hide the #feedback else show #feedback

5608278
express	node.js
i m working on my first node.js express mongoose app and i m facing a problem due to asynchronisation mechanism of node.js

5608292
cos	sin
compute a series of nodes around the edges of the face using a parametric equation for a circle x r cos t y r sin t

5608293
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode and equals are two very different things

5608299
opera	google-chrome
however if i use alert to check the position width where it s been placed just after throwing the alert function with details of width position from left it works fine in opera ffâ but not in google-chrome example here

5608300
equals	gethashcode
if the equals method does a good job at handling my custom equality why do i have to override the gethashcode method as well

5608300
equals	gethashcode
when comparing something like below which comparer is used the equals or the gethashcode

5608303
fancybox	thickbox
what i want to do is instead of an alert have something like fancybox thickbox etc.

5608304
implements	extends
i ve implements a dbhelper class extends sqliteopenhelper and i have made method such as

5608377
perl	tcl
look at this site for an inventory of how to do that in delphi gnu linux groovy java javascript .net pcre c c++ perl php posix powershell python r realbasic ruby tcl vbscript visual basic 6 wxwidgets xml schema xquery xpath

5608381
ggplot2	lattice
compute the tesselation outside of the plotting function so that the resulting polygons may be plotted with either ggplot2 lattice or base graphics

5608392
vim	textmate	macvim	textmate
you can also see what s in command - r like functionality in macvim and vim - displaying code output in a new window ã la textmate

5608393
width	height
set it to a certain width and height

5608396
hex	binary
how do i visualize the fixed-point data in binary or hex format using simulink

5608402
unsigned	short
if you are using ieee-754 why not access the float or double as a unsigned short or unsigned long and save the floating point data as a series of bytes then re-convert the specialized unsigned short or unsigned long back to a float or double on the other side of the transmission .

5608411
jquery	simplemodal
since simplemodal is a plugin it depends on jquery try including jquery in your manifest before the other scripts

5608455
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
if you instead use a second uinavigationbar set with a uinavigationitem that has a title of nil and the desired buttons you can add more buttons and have a bar that visually matches the original

5608466
division	multiplication
the division multiplication with int_max may loose a bit of precision during conversion but that s a compromise one can live with

5608559
division	modulo
i was trying to come up with inline assembly for gcc to get both division and modulo using single divl instruction

5608567
post	put
this allows user agents to represent other methods such as post put and delete in a special way so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested

5608628
post	get
implement post redirect get as per daz lewis s link to ensure that hitting refresh on the browser won t resubmit the form

5608628
post	get
finally add a hidden field session variable etc. as per matt greer and alison s suggestion so if something does get through - connection times out in between the post and redirect and user hits refresh on browser - you don t double-process it at your back end

5608656
g++	gcc
the showcommands make target will display the gcc g++ command line

5608671
pop-up	dialog
when i create a test that uses uikit and try to run the tests in the bundle on the device xcode 4 pop-up a dialog saying

5608683
move	drag
i was searching jquery and found a script to drag and drop stuff on the screen basicly i just want to move some divs around thats the easy part the script i found has a callback function that writes onto the div that you just move dropped this is exactly what i need but instead of writting dropped i want to save the 2 postion variables into a database mysql this is so that if i close the browser and open it again the div s will be on the last place i dropped them

5608702
post	get
i couldn t find another answer when i wanted this so i thought i would post my own solution for anyone else and also get corrections if i ve done something wrong

5608736
temp	tmp
were they speak of temp and tmp variables

5608764
client-side	server-side
i understand the server-side and client-side storage differences but i cant see how they differentiate and in what circumstances would each be appropriate for

5608783
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i am convinced my performance testing code is flawed since the code without attributes is roughly 100 times faster on google-chrome and firefox 12 times faster on opera and 4 times faster on ie9

5608798
folder	directory
i want to add new files to my svn working directory that is trunk folder

5608850
quicksort	mergesort
mergesort is slightly slower than quicksort but it does not have quicksort s susceptibility to pathological cases

5608857
nhibernate	automapper
with fluent nhibernate automapper one quickly realizes that the out-of-the-box behavior for varchar columns is less than ideal

5608860
pull	push
using push and then pull as a means of merging is silly

5608861
getter	setter
other options are es5 object.defineproperty or custom getter setter

5608912
min	max
also wondering if there s a simpler way to get the min and max dates than this

5608924
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	binary
the reason i m asking this is because i m converting from binary to hex and binary to octal

5608984
children	parent
the only thing children processes do is to increase a counter and exit whereas a parent process waits for each of them

5608984

the owner class must be the class that calls registerattached and must also define the static accessor methods get and set so that the xaml parser knows what to do when you try to set the attached properties on a dependencyobject instance

5610015
accessor	properties
so it s a little different because for an attached properties there usually isn t a wrapper any code access just uses the get and set accessor

just like a clr property if you ask does this object have a total property you know it cannot be a double now but an int later

5612411
filtering	grouping
or you can also select the row style as table and then select the field taxonomy-terms all you can filtering by vocabulary also from the taxonomy grouping and then sort the table based on that field

5612463
children	parent
i have a collection of parent types that contains a list of children types

5612467
readonly	temporary
when you call a method on a readonly struct we make a temporary variable copy the struct to the temporary variable pass a ref to the temporary as this on the method call and then discard the temporary

5612542
profiling	debugging
you cant debugging start from xcode an application signed with a distribution profiling if i remember well.

5612561
fgets	strtok
and depending on how you want to process it you may need another fgets call to read the next line after strtok returns null

5612568
width	height
image and mask should have same size width and height and most probably this is problem type

5612570
imperative	declarative
as for commands it has to do with the imperative vs declarative binding in flex vs silverlight

5612571
folder	directory
do not confuse this directory with the desktop folder itself which is a virtual folder

5612579
folder	directory
but in your sample it says there is a styles folder not in root inside current directory based on current url

5612601
installation	upgrade
the solution for me was to simply perform an upgrade installation of sql server 2008 r2

5612602
youtube	vimeo
i ve made a function in javascript that takes an url from either youtube or vimeo

5612602
youtube	vimeo
3 are there any youtube or vimeo url s that would fail being parsed

5612617
put	get
when you put the - replacement last which seems to be the solution at a first glance you get an example for the latter case n - n

5612650
folder	directory
a directory is a kind of folder

5612650
folder	directory
a virtual folder is not necessarily backed by a directory

5612669
google-chrome	safari
update concerning m4a format which is aac as far as i know safari and google-chrome should support it maybe even ie9 but no others

5612672
put	get
to get this world clock effect i ve set a background image for the uitableview background and put the table background color to clearcolor via

5612696
profiling	debugging
then you add debugging as one of your defines to your debugging profiling

5612747
pull	push
right now my method of using git is to develop a website locally and when it s looking good to git push origin master and then ssh into the server and git pull origin master

5612757
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
such behavior is observed in opera only in firefox and google-chrome behavior is normal - buttons aren t pressed

5612767
activemq	rabbitmq
any distributed queue like rabbitmq activemq e.t.c

5612782
awt	swing
i imported these jar files into the new library i created swingx using tools- library and after that went to tools- palette- swing awt components and added a new palette group called swingx and added the created library swingx into it

5612801
superclass	subclassing
the last step is to either insert the interface from the subclassing into the superclass s view hierarchy or insert the interface from the superclass into the subclassing s view hierarchy whichever makes sense in your situation

5612813
google-chrome	firefox
put position relative on the table and firefox google-chrome and ie will all recognize that element as the container for the absolutely positioned div within the td

5612850
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my inclination however is as noted in my comment effect the appearance in the modern browsers ie9 and 8 so far as possible firefox google-chrome safari opera... and then make the point that supporting ie 8 requires a lot more work and greater time

5613019
google-chrome	firefox
if you re on firefox firebug or google-chrome you can do

5613122
opera	firefox
tested it in firefox opera konqueror worked fine.

5613154
implements	extends
otherwise you would in fact have to implements all methods of ifacade as java does not allow you to use multiple inheritance so you could not extends both one and two

5613161
button	checkbox
i d probably rewrite it to accommodate setting button visibility both for check all and when any checkbox is clicked sharing the same code

5613174
pull	push
all you need is push pull of git+ssh protocol

5613179
getter	setter
so i initially thought it would be mapped as two many relationships but as far as i can tell the name of the constant i am passing to the many method is used to create the getter setter which wouldn t work for me if i had two many relationships for the same type

5613179
getter	setter
then it s my understanding that i will then have getter and setter generated for the users property

5613199
width	height
is there any way to dynamically tell what this will resolve to for width x height

5613239
put	get
placeholders and the remaining elements are values to bind to those placeholders and dbic will make sure to reorder everything internally so that those values get put into the right place in the bind list when the query runs

5613278
button	checkbox
i need to reliably detect the state change of radio button checkbox on my page in order to watch if the form was modified or not

5613278
textarea	textbox
onchange event handler which helps with textbox textarea and selects but is not fired for checkboxes radiobuttons

5613290
margin	height
i want to stick div b on div a s bottom with some -ve margin or padding and i want to remain its position like that when div a s height changes

5613300
width	height
i would probably need code but i am assuming you know the width and height x and y position of your objects and that they are rectangular

5613300
width	height
check if object 1 s y + height is greater than object 2 s y + height and that object 1 s x + width is greater that object 2 s x

5613330
getter	setter
you will have to use an explicit backing field you cannot change the getter or setter for auto-properties

5613368
width	height
this returns a cgrect object which basically has your buttons x-coord y-coord width and height

5613409
box2d	physics-engine
use a physics-engine like box2d included in cocos2d sdk

5613414
youtube	vimeo
you will get the match under different positions 1st and 2nd matches if vimeo 3rd and 4th matches if youtube so you just need to handle that

5613459
folder	directory
you might simply run the shutdown.sh script in the bin directory in your tomcat installation folder

5613464
memcpy	strcpy
store data into buffer until full strcpy strcat memcpy ...

5613470
portrait	landscape
i can get the initial view to be landscape but if remove the initial view and replace it with a new view going from main menu to game screen the new view is now in portrait mode

5613474
accessor	properties
it would seem that what i really want is to be able to create special properties accessor which are only executed by xmlserialize

5613487
ant	maven
i ll also be interested to know about ant maven related benefits if there are - although my prime motives are to know if i can benefit from things like quicker development code generation templates auto complete etc. easier aut simpler java ee application deployment during development for ut etc

5613511
width	height
you can use or here to get something with a certain width or height for example

5613523
width	height
if the type of your height and width field is numeric so i would save the width and height as int range -2.147.483.648 - 2.147.483.647 should be enough because it is not usually that resolutions have got any decimals then try to take the 1600 not as string as you do because here the 1600 is set in single quotianion marks but as number and delete the quotation marks

5613577
profiling	instrumentation
use time profiling in instrumentation to see which is the offending code

5613599
children	parent
a child know it s parent but the parent doesn t know it s children i think

5613661
implements	extends
public class tabs extends mapactivity implements ontabchangelistener

5613676
children	parent
this way the parent class does not need to know its children

5613692
udp	tcp
udp is useful when you can afford transmission loss and the overhead of tcp is too great to justify the reliability

5613704
python-mode	ropemacs
emacs + python-mode + flymake + ropemacs

5613741
width	height
problem when i run it in localhost my header disappear sometimes when i m changing some code in #header it appears in design view but when run on localhost it s appearing as a big image and not following the correct height and width that i declare

5613746
udp	tcp
the udp vs tcp decision will probably i say probably as i am not a professional game dev just a hobby dev boil down to the amount of traffic you expect to send receive the networking conditions the durability of the program in case of packet loss and the expected number of concurrent users

5613746
udp	tcp
then again some games might even use a combination of tcp and udp for tasks with different requirements in speed and reliability

5613796
ssl	https	udp	tcp
use an rpc protocol over tcp to setup a subscription authentication service it may be useful to read up on xmpp - do a one time authentication your best bet is probably x509 ssl https via wcf which would work like a passive ftp...connect to me server then i ll give you a new port to connect to where i ll as in me the server will be broadcasting media - then use udp as your transport mechanism for your video audio assuming that s what you re trying to do

5613809
versioning	upgrade
as always make sure to the read the change log and upgrade instructions when updating to a new versioning

5613820
portrait	landscape
but consider that this device can be easily changed from portrait to landscape modes and applications are expected to respond to that change

5613820
portrait	landscape
each of those recall would need to describe fonts differently in portrait mode and landscape mode

5613820
subpixel	retina
i m guessing that this is not too different from the thought process that led apple to eschew subpixel font rendering in favor of hoping that display technology increases pixel density to the point where it is no longer necessary the retina display on the iphone 4 being the first step in that direction.

5613884
profiling	debugging
each line of the debugging output both in the output window when running in a simulator and in the debugging console screen when viewed on a device will contain your debugging message the thread number on which the call was made useful for thread ui debugging and the date time of the log statement with a millisecond timestamp for performance profiling

5613906
min	max
when i load up the function though it doesn t plot any points when the min and max are set

5613906
min	max
i also tried widening the min max to include several days and still no luck

5613906
min	max
i also tried assigning the min max when the chart data changes like so

5613948
hash	md5
my servlet encrypts and sends a hashmap and its md5 hash

5613948
hash	md5
it doesn t work - the two md5 hash are different

5613969
post	put
if you need more help please post the exact string you put in there

5613976
free	malloc
during runtime the request will fail malloc returning null if there is not a continuous block of free memory of the requested size

5614007
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
am using uinavigationcontroller for navigation between uiviewcontroller

5614013
put	get
anything else that wants something drawn will put data describing what needs to be drawn into the document object and then call updateallviews to get the new data drawn

5614024
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you could use the viewdidappear or viewwillappear methods of the first view controller and put your reload code there

5614028
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox and ie the fancybox loads fine

5614054
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
within both of those methods you could call the viewwillappear and viewdidappear manually

5614086
queue	fifo
so i guess what my question is abiding by the normal queue thinking fifo how do i get it to stop

5614191
ssl	https
i have created web services based on jersey so now i try to secure it with ssl protocol so what i did i created a pair keys client and server and i changed the file configuration server.xml by adding definition the web service can be deployed with https url but when i try to access to some resources e.g it give me nothing while when i deployed by http url it works fine so please if any one has yet secured rest jersey andtomcat please tell me the steps to follow it thanks in advance

5614198
feedback	review
client review changes and accepts them or provides feedback

5614210
updatepanel	scriptmanager
problem with scriptmanager in webcontrol nested in updatepanel

5614259
dreamweaver	aptana
aptana is probably what you want nvu dreamweaver also

5614263
post	get
there s an additional wrinkle however because the request is post and not get

5614274
eventlet	gevent
are gevent and eventlet in the same category as twisted

5614290
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine for me using safari firefox and google-chrome

5614318
for-loop	arrays
if the api doesn t expose a way to count the total number of records including to get an arrays of the remaining records and count that you could use the php output buffering functions ob_start etc. to cache the data inside a for-loop counting to 8 and only print the results if the count reached 8 or more

5614322
tiff	png	png	tga
advise me an image loader library which could load such formats as jpg png tiff tga

5614351
hash	md5
i want to then send the bytes of a md5 hash of the file over the response stream

5614365
hash	md5
send the md5 hash first since it has a known length

5614373
hash	md5
assuming you can rely on the file not to change i would read the file once and compute the md5 hash set that as a header and then write the file out as the complete body

5614388
cfstring	nsstring
abmutablemultivalueref is a cftyperef so perhaps casting the result of abrecordcopyvalue to cfstring instead of nsstring would be the simple solution

5614405
int	chars
a c string is simply a null-terminated sequence of chars 8-bit signed int on most systems

5614405
int	chars
a wide string with chars of type wchar_t typically 16-bit int can also be used to hold larger chars values

5614420
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
the exact warning is naming conflict imagetitle conflicts with a method already on nsobject or nsmanagedobject

5614442
hash	md5
you can make the md5 hash a separate resource in your servlet namespace

5614442
hash	md5
your code that computes the md5 can do so while the file is being downloaded and write to the file system or store the hash in a cache possibly persistent.

5614452
xstream	jackson
you re using xstream to serialize xml responses and jackson json to serialize json responses

5614469
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is not commercial and there a lot of tools to migrate mysql to it

5614531
ubuntu	debian
i wrote a patch for solving this problem and it has been merged in ubuntu and debian

5614531
ubuntu	debian
if you are running an older version of ubuntu then you can simply download the latest version of tomcat6-user package from the debian ftp

5614534
gif	png
it handles various formats including gif png and jpeg all lower case or all upper case but not mixed

5614548
facebook	fbconnect
i am building an iphone app that will include the fbconnect project to allow users to post data from the app to their wall on facebook

5614548
folder	directory
the name of my project is myprojectfolder and i have moved the src directory directly inside the myprojectfolder directory such that it is a sibling folder to build and classes

5614548
folder	directory
how do i include the facebook sdk project folder inside my app directory and call it in xcode

5614556
hide	show
you ll need icons to show hide add css and javascript jquery in this example

5614556
hide	show
it show hide a menu but could be anything inside hide div

5614594
ubuntu	debian
i wrote a patch for solving this problem and it has been merged in ubuntu and debian

5614594
ubuntu	debian
if you are running an older version of ubuntu then you can simply download the latest version of tomcat6-user package from the debian ftp

5614601
rss	feed
i have a custom module which displays rss feed items based on user taxonomy

5614645
implements	extends
for the regular nouns i would make three classes for the three declensions and make them all implements a declensable or however the word is in english interface firstdeclension extends regular implements declensable

5614660
client-side	server-side
instead of running the code server-side run it client-side with skuplt

5614685
trac	bugzilla
it does this by making tasks a first class part of eclipse and integrating rich and offline editing for repositories such as bugzilla trac and jira

5614696
gif	png
please let me know how can i do this maybe with a javascript alert box on submit or my best solution is to let the browsing window to show only jpg gif and png images instead of the default all files

5614713
getter	setter
you can use getter and setter

5614736
pop-up	dialog
one thing to note here is that if you donâ t provide a css class then the modal pop-up will not function like a modal dialog one will be able to interact with the controls in the back of the pop-up control so its imperative to provide a valid css class name value to the backgroundcssclass property

5614767
viewdidload	viewdidappear
also i m using viewdidload for doing everything tried viewdidappear as well but that didn t seem to work out as well

5614839
width	height
you need to wrap the image in a containing element and assign the width height and overflow to that

5614849
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux 10.04 and a pentium r t4300 processer if it matters

5614891
folder	directory
it might be better to add the eclipse folder should contain the eclipse executable eclipse.ini the plugins directory and the features directory

5614901
integer	unsigned
since the algorithm uses only the binary representation not the numeric value you can just cast to an unsigned integer of equal size it will have identical representation use the algorithm and cast back to signed

5614903
free	malloc
no special cleanup needed except free if our struct was created with malloc

5614910
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	realloc	strdup	free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	strdup	calloc	malloc	strdup	malloc	strdup	calloc
if you didn t malloc or calloc strdup realloc it you don t need to free it

5614914
xdebug	xhprof
you should also look at running some form of profiler such as xhprof 2 or xdebug 3 on the code so you can see where the bottlenecks are

5614914
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
you might also want to think about using a different web server such as nginx lighttpd apache or fine tuning its configuration

5614918
sorting	filtering
for example in the updated part of the answer you could find full demo project which demonstrate how to use jqgrid in asp.mvc 2.0 inclusive paging sorting and filtering advanced searching

5614920
hash	md5
i try to calculate md5 hash on a certain value but i get a weird result

5614967
freebsd	linux
your best but unfortunately os-specific approach would be to use whatever framework is available in your platform to monitor filesystem events inotify on linux and kqueue on freebsd and macos x.

5614969
mouseover	mouseenter
use mouseenter instead of mouseover

5614980
mouseover	mouseenter
try to replace mouseover with mouseenter

5615018
onkeyup	onkeydown
you can set some global variable on onkeydown trigger and remove this setting in onkeyup

5615088
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
is there anything similar in google-chrome opera safari or even ie

5615135
post	get
i also am struggling to get the error or success messages to post into the view

5615177
printf	strlen
when trying to compute how much memory is needed to concat two strings to a new block of memory it was said that using printf was preferred over strlen as shown below

5615181
printf	strcpy	printf	strlen	strlen	strcpy
one advantage would be that the input strings are only scanned once inside the printf instead of twice for the strlen strcpy solution

5615208
printf	strlen
if you only need to determine how big would be the concatenation of the two strings i don t see any particular reason to prefer printf since the minimum operations to determine the total length of the two strings is what the two strlen calls do

5615237
filtering	grouping
this is a continuation of my previous question is there off-the-shelf convenient way to filtering by a grouping column in xtragrid gridview

5615281
hide	show
if you are just beginning jquery then in particular check out the show hide and toggle functions

5615284
width	height
if you make your server accept cgi parameters for the width and height of the image and have your server perform the resizing then you can reduce the amount of i o and you can also implement the resizing in a language that can do it much faster using c or c++ with the opencv library

5615287
printf	strlen
the advantage that i can see here is that strlen null might cause a segmentation fault while at least glibc s printf handles null parameters without failing

5615287
printf	strlen
i wouldn t recommend using printf instead of strlen though

5615344
post	put
maybe i m wrong but if you take the formidable example replacing post for put should work

5615351
width	height
i know i can rotate the text with css but then i have to manually set the width and height of the header which is a bit annoying as the whole table will be dynamic

5615358
min	max
there are only signed integer instructions for compare and min max

5615371
put	get
you need to either enable the ftp layer and put in your username and password so that joomla can create new directories with the proper permissions or you need to get a host that runs php as a cgi

5615383
onstart	ondestroy
2 application class onstart and ondestroy for every time the app is started or killed

5615388
filtering	grouping
if i want to both change the database and render the change on the gridview at present i am forced to change ctype grd.datasource dataview .table cell values explicitly because i don t want to lose the gridview s state like which columns are grouping which grouping rows are open which columns are filtering etc

5615422
width	height
here s a snippet of code i ve used before to wait for an image to be loaded before trying to access its width and height

5615422
width	height
it s not really any additional time it just forces your code to wait for the last stage to complete to get the width and height

5615446
fadein	fadeout
i have tried putting fadein in the callback of the fadeout function and queueing the two animations but they still don t happen sequentially

5615505
background-color	transparency
try setting the background-color of your text to transparency and see what happens

5615525
onstart	ondestroy
2 application class onstart and ondestroy for every time the app is started or killed

5615525
onresume	onpause
if not you re welcome to rig up a service that is notified on each onpause and onresume does the bookkeeping to see if there are any live activities and if there hasn t been for x period of time does your leave the app logic then shuts down

5615536
width	height
i ve been using absolute width and height lately but that s causing problems in many instances

5615536
width	height
say i want the image s height to be the same as the height of its container but the width to be proportional in that sense

5615557
width	height
all you need to do is specify only image height and width will scale proportionally

5615561
printf	strcpy	printf	strlen	strlen	strcpy
for example if you had three strings rather than two and two or more of them overlapped it would be possible that strlen str1 +strlen str2 +strlen str3 +1 exceeds size_max and wraps past zero resulting in under-allocation and truncation of the output if printf is used or extremely dangerous memory corruption if strcpy and strcat are used

5615614
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am having a problem with my jqm form not working properly in mobile browsers ipad 1 safari android dolphin but working as expected in desktop browsers google-chrome firefox safari ie9 on win7

5615729
direct3d	directx
most always include directx which includes direct3d and possibly opengl

5615735
direct3d	directx
direct3d is a microsoft directx api

5615753
sdl	freeglut
you can easily use it with many popular window toolkits qt sdl freeglut jogamp gtk etc. and have confidence that your application will compile on other operating systems if you wrote it properly

5615774
onresume	onpause
you can track activity lifetimes using a variety of mechanisms including setting clearing sharedpreferences in onpause onresume or use a singleton with reference counting

5615789
getter	setter
you might be interested in implementing the idataerrorinfo interface on your viewmodel therefore implementing validation logic there instead of right on the properties getter setter

5615803
jobs	cron
the cron handler finds a list of specific jobs to run and creates a task queue event for each discrete task

5615809
post	get
stuff like this is usually done with a post request not a get request

5615814
post	get
however i think instead of fiddling around with mod_security rules its better that you figure out a way to send the code in a post var rather than get

5615888
getter	setter
i defined some getter and setter for this but getting some type error

5615888
getter	setter
isn t this the correct way to assign the values through getter and setter

5615938
implements	extends
just a class that extends broadcastreceiver and implements the onrecieve context intent method of it

5615945
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however in the browsers i ve tested google-chrome safari on osx firefox on win7 the answer is

5615948
hide	show
i have read that the ipad must use a uipopovercontroller to view the photolibrary however i have edited the code to make it the popover show but it does not hide when i choose a picture

5615995
folder	directory
eclipse simply has the tree view and when you click on a folder it lists all the sub-directories and files quickly cluttering the tree and making it harder to navigate to different directory

5615998
short	base
i have 4 objects novel short story non-fiction sci-fi all of which extend from a book base class

5616013
pull	push
you just need to push your pull collections

5616023
hide	show
click once to show all click again to hide them

5616034
serializable	deserialization
serializable is the process of converting an in-memory object into a format that can be easily streamed over the wire and deserialization is the reverse process of converting the serializable format back into an object

5616144
submit	submission
i simply want to be able to have a signed-in user be able to submit a submission and then have rails understand that there is a relationship between the current_user and the submission they just wrote

5616145
folder	directory
you will need to add the appropriate sub folder to your library directory which is just below the include directory options

5616156
ubuntu	debian
i m wondering if this is a bug or if i m misunderstanding something - i know ubuntu and debian have many differences perhaps this is just one of them

5616184
post	get
one problem i can see is that your ajax options in your razor view specify the get http method but the action filter on the controller action specifies post

5616210
factors	matrix
specifically i need only the right-hand side variables i need the output to be a matrix not a data frame and i need factors to be converted to a series of dummy variables

5616231
margin	height
so it should have an exact margin from the top and from the bottom at 30px and then the wrapper itself can expand related to the browser height but it will always be a specific distance from the top and bottom of the browser

5616263
margin	height
this will give it a 30px top and bottom margin and it will adjust with your window height

5616278
versioning	upgrade

screens	tablet	screens	mdpi	tablet	mdpi
for tablet width xhdpi screens you could apply the same calculation multiply by 2 the dimensions of mdpi images 320dpi vs 160dpi

brew list imagemagick jasper jpeg libtiff little-cms nginx pcre

5624788
integer	unsigned
unrelated since c++ now has 65663 questions and so far 164 have been asked today that means that only just today the number of c++ tagged questions exceeded a 16-bit unsigned integer

5624825
oncreate	onstart
i have tried creating an if statement initially set to false around all the code inside of the overridden method but there is no way of knowing when to set it to true because the overridden method runs after the oncreate onstart and onresume methods everytime

5624835
oracle10g	oracle11g
it supports both oracle10g and oracle11g hash formats

5624847
outputstream	inputstream
i know how to do this with inputstream reader outputstream writer combo and array buffer but this time i m dealing with bytechannel s

5624863
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
also you can see that the abstract bitmapdecoder class in this example is assigned a jpegbitmapdecoder instance but you could get an instance of another decoder for your image type tiff gif png bmp and wmp are also supported

5624876
graphicsmagick	im4java
imo the best approach is using graphicsmagick image processing system with im4java as a comand-line interface for java

5624876
etsy	flickr
sites flickr and etsy

5624894
ant	maven
it is mainly used for them but you are confusing ant for maven

5624925
width	height
sets the height and width of the console buffer

5624935
graphicsmagick	im4java
you could try to use graphicsmagick image processing system with im4java as a comand-line interface for java

5624935
etsy	flickr
sites flickr and etsy

5624981
rss	feed
django-zinnia-blog has rss feed traceback pingback and comments via django-comments

5624992
post	get
i am calling a wcf service from ajax and i can get it to work as a get request but not a post request

5625012
pull	push
then you can work on local branch fix and do push and pull without other arguments

5625038
int	double
cannot implicitly convert type double to int

5625039
postorder	inorder
insertion can be done iteratively but inorder traversal for dumping the results and postorder traversal for deleting the tree when done both require either recursion or an explicit stack

5625054
super	implements
the upside to this method is that it is trivial to implements and super easy to use from anywhere in your code

5625063
int	double
you say you want an int cast but you actually need to cast to a double

5625063
int	double
otherwise you need to change refurb_rate from a double to an int

5625069
int	double
refurb_rate int double totalrefurb totalunits 100

5625069
int	double
make sure you case the int to double otherwise 1 2 will equal zero instead of .5

5625073
vmware	virtualbox
in other words you run the x86 build of android in virtualbox vmware or whatever and dispense with the overhead of emulating an arm processor

5625086
profiling	debugging
a good way to debugging this is to run your program through the concurrency profiling in visual studio 2010

5625099
int	double
i don t understand your error because refurb_rate is a double and everything else is an int

5625103
vb6	vba
using the code the the following this article vba vb6

5625123
portrait	landscape
i will be beginning to port a portrait-only app to work for both landscape and portrait screen orientations

5625183
mouseleave	mouseenter
nothing wrong with that except that hover is actually two events in one mouseenter and mouseleave

5625183
mouseover	mouseout
so it looks like you ll have to use mouseover and mouseout which are quite a bit more complicated because of how event bubbling works

5625203
for-loop	arrays
you do have a problem with your for-loop - you re going go one past the end of the arrays which might be what s causing your segmentation fault

5625208
submit	submission
to stop the form from submission create an onsubmit handler that tells it not to submit

5625212
getter	setter
if you have a document class in your swf then rather than using parameters in the constructor create a public init method with your parameters or even use getter and setter

5625223
rfcomm	l2cap
you cannot do it over rfcomm spp - connecting to a2dp uuid is not enough - the profile connection profile level protocol procedures need to be done to implement a2dp - more over a2dp directly works over l2cap protocol and does not require rfcomm

5625262
fileoutputstream	filewriter
or opened by filewriter fileoutputstream its deleting the file

5625267
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

lisp and dialects like cl clojure scheme etc.

5625316
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql it is case insenstive where as in mysql it is case sensitive

5625324
mouseup	mousedown
if so mousedown followed by mouseup ought to do the job

5625325
right-align	center-align
i could do some crazy thing where i do center-align by cutting all the text in half and add each half to column a and b under right-align and left-align respectively

5625330
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine with firefox v4 but google-chrome v10 just shows the middle column

5625332
lisp	prolog
it can be done in all lisp dialects where this feature originated under the name eval as well as in prolog call 1 and any number of other languages

5625336
folder	directory
further investigation shows that if you add a directory containing your plist files as a folder reference xcode will not look inside it it will simply copy its contents into the produced bundle

5625396
google-chrome	firefox
if i navigate to the pages manually in ie google-chrome or firefox 4.0 i don t see any problems on the page and in the browser console

5625425
width	height
how do i set the width and height of a loaded image in flash

5625425
width	height
the width and height remain zero

5625434
for-loop	arrays
note that the for-loop is executed for array_length - 1 items not array_length items since arrays j+1 would be out of bounds in the last iteration

5625444
int	double
assuming that means exponentiation and that q is runtime variable use std pow double int

5625444
int	double
edit for completeness due to the comments on this answer i asked the question why was std pow double int removed from c++11

5625444
int	double
about the missing function and in fact pow double int wasn t removed in c++0x just the language was changed

5625533
put	get
put this part somewhere that won t get changed every tick

5625542
nstimer	nsrunloop
use timer cfrunlooptimer nstimer and run loop cfrunloop nsrunloop apis to accomplish this

5625544
width	height
i can use width 100 to make the button horizontally fill a table cell with css but height 100 doesn t do anything

5625599
post	get
you could modify your code to check for both post and get requests by using the super global variable

5625643
implements	extends
make a java class that extends a view that holds all header elements and one that holds all footer elements and implements them in every view like this

5625644
implements	extends
what i did was implements my own appender which extends the appenderskeleton and takes the loggingevent object where the message returned by getmessage is my own object

5625674
ssms	sqlcmd
then put that in a file and run it with sqlcmd or open it in ssms

5625727

lennie s new approach is to use the phonegap framework whilst my approach targeting the next release of delphi employs the freepascal compilers and an opengl-based gui platform enabling full extensibility to develop android applications using native pascal code

5625756
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
since you are using big-endian shorts you could be using a datainputstream wrapped around a bytearrayinputstream and dataoutputstream bytearrayoutputstream on the other end rather than doing your own decoding

5625758
post	put	wadl	wsdl
you don t need wsdl nor wadl afaic documentation in rest could be plain text for developers schemas xsd rdfs...etc depending on the content types you use sitemaps for example a lot of links and post put templates for example to mimic forms in html

5625835
width	height
why does setting the width and height when the dialog is defined not affect the initial size of the dialog

5625869

i am not sure at the moment what is causing the problem but if i ever get around to figuring it out i ll post that too

5625903
table-per-subclass	fluent
is there anyway to use fluent in order to implement the table-per-subclass with discriminator strategy

5625903
table-per-subclass	fluent
from all of the documentation i ve seen the use of a discriminator actually tells fluent to use the table-per-class rather than table-per-subclass

5625917
folder	directory
does anybody have a sample or no how to delete a lot of files and sub directory in a folder with threads and c# .net

5625923

i would recommend you to use jquery to achieve some show hide tricks if you have static data like this

5626083
hide	show
if you take a look at the code you can see i load jquery to use function like hide show

5626090
g++	gcc
we can use gcc g++ ...or intel compilers

put	get
as you try to put in 11 04 2011 parsing this as long fails and you get the exception

5626697
mspec	nspec
mspec is also an option there has been a lot of work put into it but there are just somethings that are just simpilier in nspec you can build up context incrementally in mspec but it requires inheritance which can become complex

5626697
nunit	moq

you can get an idea on how to write onclick onmouseover events

5627030
int	double
while looking into efficient way to compute p q exponentiation where q is an int and reviewing the c++98 and c++11 standards i noticed that apparently the std pow double int overload was removed in c++11

5627030
int	double
in c++98 26.5 6 it has the double pow double int

5627030
int	double
obviously the pow double int version provides a nice opportunity for optimization so it seems odd that they would be removed

5627272
google-chrome	firefox
i tested the example in ie google-chrome and firefox and they all show the extra as text

5627278
int	double
has type double or an int type

5627278
int	double
so while the freedom is there to shuffle pow double int off to a separate algorithm most implementors i m aware of have given up on that strategy with the possible exception of checking for very small integral exponents

5627278
put	get
and in that event it is usually advantageous to put that check in the implementation with the floating point exponent so as to get the biggest bang for your optimization buck

5627307
int	chars
the function uses three arguments in c++ an unsigned int a const chars and a long

inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
when a subclassing inherited main from a superclass is it possible to determine the actual class invoked on the command-line

5627819
superclass	subclassing
the closest i ve come is to require that the subclassing implement main and call a helper method in the superclass which then reads the thread stack to determine the calling class

see this stack overflow question core data migration across multiple versioning upgrade

5632040
dbcontext	objectcontext
since the switch to ef5 nqueries does no longer support compiled queries as it switched to dbcontext if you still would like to take a look take the 1.03 release source code which is still objectcontext based and supports compiled queries

5632071
serializable	deserialization
deserialization uses this number to ensure that a loaded class corresponds exactly to a serializable object

go to the folder in which you want your external directory to apprear

5632287
hash	md5
the idea behind these lines of code is that we append all the values of a class model into a stringbuilder and then return the padded hash of that the java implementation returns md5 hash that are lenght 30 or 31 so the last line formats the hash to be padded with 0s

5632308
int	boolean
if you need you should create similar wrappers to deal with int boolean etc

5632320
jobs	cron
as others have said you can also set up cron jobs or scheduled tasks to automate the running of scripts at set times although i would suggest investigating a ci server like jenkins ci formally hudson that can either run tests at a set time or be triggered to run tests based on code commits

5632347
hash	salt
i suspect it was omitted from your example for brevity but you should probably hash your key from a good dose of salt

5632363
next	except
this all works well except for the slider to re-initiate after the first click next or prev doesn t matter

5632390
put	get
so calling get key on your key is going to return the value you provided with put key value

5632410
width	height
you can stretch your background to 100 width and height by putting your image in an tag and give it a z-index of -1 so it acts like a background and is behind everything else

if you do not want to break the aspect ratio just set either width or height and not both

5632452

equals hashcode and tostring are public

5632465
google-chrome	firefox
it behaves as expected in firefox and google-chrome but fails in ie

the main thing to remember when using the bbq plugin is that instead of manipulating the dom directly eg show hide things ajax loading etc you change the browser url fragment instead and then make the dom changes in the hashchange event

5632497
post	get
i am working with the httpexchange class and want to use the getattribute function to get the post parameters

5632548

here is a java code which computes sha512 hash of a byte array with salt

5632632
hash	salt
this works perfectly computes the same hash as the java code if i use the same single data the salt is nil in the java code

5632632
hash	salt
the problem is that if i want to computes hash of two nsdata there is a salt the second parameter in the java code is not nil

5632673
post	get
i am not familiar with this api but it appears that httpexchange.getattribute is not the method you would use to get post parameters

5632674
viewdidload	dealloc
you will see similar call in init dealloc viewdidload etc

5632674
viewdidload	viewwillappear
this is not the situation with viewwillappear animated or viewdidload etc

if you have static collection of nodes and then you want to show hide them based on user accessibility then you should override isaccessibletouser

5632890
children	parent
i would recommend creating an abstract function in the parent that each of the children will implement with it s own logic

5632890
children	parent
edit since you are trying to iterate over all child objects i would recommend to create a base class that handles all the logic that needs to be implemented to all children and override it in each of the child classes that need additional logic and call the parent function inside it

5632914
getter	setter
what i think you wanna do is this when creating the new form send to the constructer the first form as an object then and make a setter getter or just make the thread public then you can access it from both forms as you requested

5632926
put	get
currently i execute a batch get for the 20 targets update the serialized value in each then execute a batch put

5633007

however i doubt that the sortable jquery library would work when using absolute positioning i must admit i ve never used it with absolute positioning it is likely that getting items to move out of the way when you drag something over them will be problematic

5633007
draggable	droppable
the jquery draggable and droppable api will help but you will need to do a lot more coding to ensure the items you move snap into position moving others out of the way when you drop them

note the capitalization of the variable names because two of the keys in your array are capitalize

5642280
width	height
scalex width height etc

5642287

5642364
width	margin
the nav is floated left and has a negative margin the same number of pixels as the width which effectively makes it slot into a zero-width space

5642364
width	margin
it has a left margin the width of the nav so the content avoids hiding underneath the links of the nav

5642378
getter	setter
you could use javascript getter and setter

5642418
folder	directory
5 i have always been a bit reluctant on having spaces in directory names so i would copy the ext folder to the root of c somewhere for testing maybe something like c phpexts

5642456
width	margin
one variation i use with these layouts is wrapping every column with an extra inner div and setting the margin or padding on this div and nothing else this will make the width and positioning calculations a lot simpler you ll see if you check it out

5642465
min	max
clearly this will result in the min for each column to be -1 the max will be 1

5642473
getter	setter
if you made any alterations in the setter getter methods in any class in the hierarchy look closely at those methods especially if you used a primativevalue method

5642504
keydown	keyup

5642504
keydown	keyup
use 256 for keydown and 257 for keyup

5642504
keydown	keyup
wparam and lparam are message-specific so for keyup and keydown wparam would be the key code see this page for the hexadecimal codes and lparam contains other miscellaneous information see this page

5642504
keydown	keyup
for example you can use 0 for keydown and 65539 for keyup

5642533
mouse	keyboard
where events are things like the mouse moving the keyboard being pressed and timers going off

5642547
min	max

5642732
subscript	superscript
my point is that i think your goal here kerned superscript subscript text boundaries with normal text is going to result in worse layout not better

it seems designed to make protected private methods public instead

5642862
for-loop	arrays
i then split the months and year and calculate how many months are in there then i do a for-loop and fill an arrays so i have 12-2010 01-2011 02-2011...etc then another for-loop to query the database for sum quantity where date is between 12-01-2011 and 12-31-2011 etc

5643141
folder	directory
you just need to make a folder called public in the same directory as your ruby file and place your js and css files there

5643161
getter	setter
normally i use the beanstyle with getter setter for any objects

5643161
getter	setter
my question does it make a difference in regard to memory usage and cpu time for access at runtime having getter setter methods for an instanciated object versus not having them and directly accessing the fields members

5643161
getter	setter
for example if having getter setter makes an object bigger for 5bytes per method and instance then this would dramatically add up in total with millions ob objects

getter and setter do not affect memory usage

5643189
getter	setter
the method implementations of getter setter are stored with the class of which there is only one in a given classloader

5643189
getter	setter
regarding performance i doubt it would be significantly slower to call simple getter setter

5643189
getter	setter
i would definitely first implement with the getter and setter and then if you find it is too slow you could potentially do away with them

5643190
getter	setter
getter and setter methods shouldn t make the objects larger just the class that represents those objects

5643190
getter	setter
it s unlikely going to matter to your performance to have getter and setter methods especially since the jvm should optimize that out

5643207
getter	setter
a getter and setter will add a small amount to the size of the class

getter	setter
because attributes instance variables generate getter methods and if rw also setter methods out of the box you should do this

5647774
superclass	subclassing
well you re trying to assign an object of a superclass type to a reference of a subclassing type and of course that s a compile-time error because it might not be valid

5647784
implements	extends
you should use a listadapter and create a class that extends arrayadapter and then in your getview function you should implements each row from an arraylist or array

google-chrome	firefox
please the following website in google-chrome and firefox you will see the difference

5647947
portrait	landscape
in the oncreate method of your activity then android will select the correct layout depending on whether the device is in portrait or landscape orientation

5647970

versioning	upgrade
since i upgrade my monotouch to versioning 4 i have problems with the .xib.designer.cs files

5648071

donâ t pass a string to setinterval and settimeout just pass the function itself

5648269
jar	war
this can be done by either putting this jar file inside your war file in web-inf lib directory or simply by copying it to tomcat lib directory

5648323
postgresql	mysql
limited services available it currently only supports postgresql and redis so if you want to use mysql memcached mongodb etc you are out of luck

5648373
gridview	repeater
just like we have pagesize property in gridview that allows us to switch back and forth between pages isn t there anyway i can incorporate the same functionality in a repeater

5648397
folder	directory
if mysite folder is within htdocs then you can access it using if htodcs is your home directory

5648449
inherited	subclassing
this is a real improvement over inherited for this kind of object because they are used by the core framework and you don t have to convert a nsstring object to your subclassing when you want to call your custom method

5648470
for-loop	loops
the redrawing doesn t happen at least until execution returns to the run loops and that can t happen until your for-loop finishes

5648479
int	chars
the cases when it makes sense to write binary are for other types than chars an array of int

i ve tried this in google-chrome firefox 3 and 4 and opera with the same non-updating results

the following code runs fine except my output file does not contain the int 10 but instead the chars when i open it up in vim

5648668

if i start my application directly and later on attach a debugger to it like visual studio 2010 sharp develop 4 mdbg delphi 2007 windbg everything works fine

5648782
getter	setter
this way you can just use a single getter no one setter is required

5648814
hash	salt
on the server remember to hash and salt the passwords preferably using bcrypt

5648874
put	get
you would put such files not in the drawable folder but in your assets folder and you can get an input stream to these files just by using

5648910
hash	salt
javascript on client-side creates a cryptographically secure hash of the user s password and the salt

5648910
hash	salt
hash is sent to the server you can then retrieve the password from the database create a hash using the salt for the session and the password from the db and check if it is the same as the one sent from the client

5648929
hash	salt
i m using sha-512 to hash my passwords with a salt ofcourse

5648937
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
a simple c++ calculator program to calculate addition subtraction multiplication and addition.

5648965

you have to have a look at setter and getter theory

5649015
dlsym	dlopen
i m using the dlopen dlsym dlclose set of functions

5649034
client-side	server-side
the best way to do it is by using json a format for communication between server-side and client-side

5649040
qpushbutton	qwidget
i want to connect this qpushbutton to the promoted qwidget

5649040
qpushbutton	qwidget
for example i have a function on my promoted qwidget class and i want to call this function when i click the qpushbutton located at the mainwindow.ui

5649052
content-disposition	content-type
if the content-disposition header is used in a response with the application octet-stream content-type the implied suggestion is that the user agent should not display the response but directly enter a save response as... dialog

5649064
hash	salt
once you have the password you retrieve that users salt and hash password from the database

5649064
hash	salt
you take the submitted form hash it with the user-specific salt then compare it to the pre-hashed password from the database

5649064
hash	salt
in that case you should simply assign each user a unique salt hash their current plain-text password + salt and store that as their new password

5649067
google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome and firefox add these to the css

5649072
jtextfield	jtable
there is jtable in selectcontactsfrm file to show the contacts.when user select a contact from jtable and when he she press ok button selected values should be copied into taskfrm.java s jtextfield

5649097
uicontrol	uibutton
while uibutton can take transparent images as backgrounds and uicontrol can have custom views the hit area of these is always square

5649114
ienumerable	iqueryable
so in design time the actual sequnce iqueryable or ienumerable which the call should be run against is unknown

5649131
division	multiplication
second reason is that with the sieve you only do multiplication not division

5649131
addition	multiplication
if you do it cleverly you only do addition not even multiplication

5649131
division	addition
and division has larger complexity than addition

5649131
division	addition
the usual way to do division has o n 2 complexity while addition has o n

5649137
division	addition
the first difference is that division is much more expensive than addition

5649150
width	height
if it s the dimensions you want to change then it could be as easy as changing the width and height parameters of your embed code or loading the swf into another one and displaying it behind a mask that shows only the parts you want to show

5649150
width	height
the width and height of an swf are coded inside it and could be changed with some editor like a hex editor

5649158
getter	setter
the object is mirrored by a myobject class which has getter and setter for all the variables which are of different types and will be accessed by various other classes

5649178
width	height
for a wpf application i have a user control myusrcntrl with height 300 and width 300

5649190
hash	md5
i would like to convert hash md5 sha1 etc into decimal integers for the purpose of making barcodes in code128c

5649234
mouse	keyboard
don t undervalue your display keyboard and mouse

5649292
public	protected
public protected virtual or

5649309
subclass	abstract-class
this differs from a generic class because an abstract-class knows something needs to happen but it does not know what that something actually is the subclass knows

5649328
button	checkbox
i am working on a app which has one button and a listview with checkbox one per list item and functionality required that whenever i click on this button checked items from list should be removed

5649328
button	checkbox
i saved the state of checkbox in my custom listview adapter using boolean type arraylist and trying to access it in my main activity but the problem is whenever i click on button its not removing the checked items instead its removing the items of exact amount as checked items from the bottom of the list

5649365
goto	break
continue goto break are first words that thoughts us not to use

5649371
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
the 2nd loops body executes only if an element in an arrays isn t empty while the first finds an element of an arrays that is empty and tells the for-loop to continue

5649375
goto	break
try to avoid using continue break and goto raptors

5649385
children	parent
a client can have many children but can only have a single parent so it s a many-to-1 relationship

5649406
goto	break
i use continue or sometimes break or goto in the middle of the loop but always put it all on one line so continue cannot accidentally be separated from if and always provide a comment of the form if â we re done.

5649421
width	height
if you want to extend and compress the height and width of your usercontrol then make the parent controls and and don t assign any height and width to your controls present inside usercontrol

5649508
put	get
any user opening word will then always get a different instance of word and will not see what you have put on the document unless you have saved it and they open the saved document

5649533
getter	setter
i m not sure to understand how could be implemented setter and getter for these 2 properties to refer to the private ivars

5649536
put	get
if i put there just item i get result

5649556
for-loop	arrays
if i try to remove the markers in random order the first one is removed but then the others just stop working the listener still works but it seems like the for-loop doesnt find the other markers in the arrays

5649648
mouse	keyboard
mouse pad and keyboard pad with wrist rests necessary for long coding sessions

5649657
prepare	execute
normally you d prepare a statement and then you d only send different values when you execute it inside of loops

5649761
mouse	keyboard
you do not want to keep it so busy that one core is burning 100 load for the main thread that s going to be perceptible by the user when the ui thread starts responding sluggishly to mouse and keyboard input

5649775
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
in the modern runtime used pretty much everywhere at this point you don t actually have to declare the ivar at all -- if you synthesize accessor for a properties and there s no matching ivar the runtime will provide one

5649775
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
finally properties with dynamic rather than synthesized accessor don t necessarily need an ivar at all -- you re providing the accessor in this case so you re free to derive the value of the properties however you like

5649835
width	height
you can change the width height to match the size of your background image

5649864
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you stick with ienumerable or iqueryable then you are hiding the nuances of the entity framework behaviour from the client but still getting the advantages like lazy loading and deferred execution

5649869
width	height
what i want to happen is the two button areas to not do any height growth but would allow width growth

5649879
put	get
but nuget wants to put the associated files in scripts which would get way too messy

5649937
min	max
skor means point sure means time --- max point min time multiple order

5649937
min	max
but skor max value and sure min value and userid must be only one as you see there is 6 userid 2 i want the only max value

5649942
width	height
to shrink images that are too large simply insert the width and height attribute along with your image source and a alt along with a id

5649973
webrat	cucumber
i love running something like cucumber webrat capybara locally to hit every url exposed in the app to make sure the basic stuff is working ie

5649984
min	max
this is assuming you want the max and min per user not on the same record row

5650014
freemarker	velocity
if this kind of design is hard for you try freemarker or even something like velocity although i don t recommend it to force you to do this

5650058
background-color	transparency
but be aware that setting the background-color to transparency sometimes gets wonky in ie

5650068
expression-blend	silverlight
it will feature a timeline similar to the flash authoring tool and expression-blend a silverlight dev tool

5650078
hide	show
you could consider to render show hide components conditionally in the server side by the rendered attribute so that the generated html output is less large

5650081

the queues are either defined in active directory or as text files in the system32 msmq storage lqs folder for public and private respectively

5650135
opera	firefox
dragonfly opera or firebug extension for firefox or any other good javascript debugger

5650145
free	malloc
if you really do want to store items larger than 1mb you can recompile memcached with an edited slabs.c power_block value or use the inefficient malloc free backend

5650166
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

5650668
installation	upgrade
after fiddling for 2 hours i found out that the installation folder url that you set in the properties of the solution where it upgrade from is case sensitive and stupidly needs to be the same case as the initial installation url

5650705
for-loop	loops
the foreach loops in the code doesn t compile while the commented for-loop works fine

5650715
yesod	happstack
you could build a website using warp the yesod team s web server heist the snap team s template system and acid-state the happstack project s persistence system

5650715
yesod	happstack
for the most part i think the choice of snap vs yesod vs happstack is less an issue of features and more one of personal taste

5650718
folder	directory
just to clarify .net has no function to delete all files in a folder at once and leaving the directory

ncover	dotcover
i have some builds that use ncover for test coverage analysis and some that use dotcover

5650797
ncover	dotcover
i merge the ncover dotcover summary report into the ccnet log but the item that i need to pull out into the ccnet coverage statistic is different depending on the tool because the format of the reports are different

5650797
ncover	dotcover
if i just list both sections inside the statisticlist the second one always wins so if i list dotcover second builds that use ncover have their coverage stat set to zero because the dotcover stat can t be found

5650797
ncover	dotcover
what i want is for the stat to get set to the ncover stat if it exists or to the dotcover stat if it exists

5650824
imagemagick	libjpeg
this means that you would need to use and compile a native library such as libjpeg or some full-fledged package such as imagemagick in order to support reading from various images formats

ienumerable	iqueryable
the following orderby defines a query on this list which is an ienumerable and not an iqueryable anymore

more importantly how can i get the actualwidth and actualheight values after the layout subsystem has done its job but before the control is rendered so i can create the geometry before it s needed in the onrender override

5652156
actualheight	actualwidth
my latest implementation overrides arrangeoverride as the value that s passed in there is a size containing what the actualwidth and actualheight values should be after the core layout system takes into consideration horizontalalignment and verticalalignment with values of stretch minimums and maximums etc but what they actually are depends on the value that s returned from that override so it s a little more complex than that

for-loop	loops
this is different than your for-loop which falls out of loops without returning anything

5655337
hide	show
you can put all the elements as visible then bind the checked property of the radiobutton controls to the visibility property of the portions you want to be able to hide show and use a value converter to convert the checked bool to visibility

5655615
hash	md5
use whatever hash function your system has with the smallest size md5 for mysql or you might even try crc32 if your database is not-so-big

5655623
rtp	rtsp
at first i thought i would need to use an actual streaming protocol such as rtp or rtsp but it seems like it maybe better using a custom javascript player that takes the mp3 file in via http

5655623
mp3	m3u
i also looked into m3u files but this seems to require a complete mp3 file although i m not clear on it

5655690
octal	binary
octal and hexadecimal map quite conveniently lining up exactly with the binary bits

5655690
integer	unsigned
if you want to hold an actual number it s best to use signed unsigned integer long etc

5655697
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i noticed that web-kit browsers like google-chrome and safari windows tend to round em values to nearest pixel while firefox ie

5655697
google-chrome	firefox
you will see that in firefox even the smallest letters still have a shadow while google-chrome rounds down the em value to zero and the first two paragraphs have no shadow

5655697
google-chrome	firefox
px firefox will display smaller and smaller shadow while when google-chrome goes below 1px it suddenly displays nothing

5655711

5655820
serializable	deserialization
i m trying to do some serializable deserialization stuff with a custom exception type

5655846
hash	md5
i m not sure why you are checking the length of the string against an md5 hash of the string here but assuming is the number from the user you can just do this

5655895
free	malloc
you need to malloc memory from the heap and return that and then free it later

5655902
free	malloc
instead you should use malloc and free it once it is done

5655908
gif	png
now how can i export this drawings as an image png gif jpg

5655955
jobs	cron
i ve looked at delayed jobs and cron jobs but i don t know enough about it to know which route i should take

5655955
jobs	cron
seems like delayed jobs and cron jobs are usually reoccurring not very accurate with timing and are started with rake not by a user action right

5655969
spaces	delimiter
operator considers both spaces and newline as delimiter

5655989
getter	setter
try calling each setter before your getter

5656028
mouse	keyboard	keydown	keyup
but i want the same action to trigger if the user doesn t use the mouse and instead is using keyboard keyup keydown to select from the menu

5656028
keydown	keyup
it doesn t do that by default which i hoped it did but that doesnt seem to be the case so i want to assign the same action for the keyup or keydown event but i dont want to write or copy paste the same code over again

5656041
radiobuttonlist	requiredfieldvalidator
it looks like you re using webforms so you don t need to touch jquery you could accomplish this with a requiredfieldvalidator one for each radiobuttonlist and you re all set

5656053
acs	adfs
adfs can federate with acs

5656053
acs	adfs
i m not sure if you could remove adfs and simply federate acs with these other products in its place

5656055
floating-point	fractions
this is due to the finite precision of floating-point representations of fractions numbers

5656057
vmware	virtualbox
if thats the case and the linux only stuff is going to bite you use vmware or virtualbox to run local linux instances and install the ide inside those and just make sure they have goobs of ram to deal with it

5656057
chown	chmod
autobuild.php runs svn update and gets the latest code changes as well as does any chown or chmod file permissions stuff and resets any server specific config files config.php

5656076
client-side	server-side
however this may be challenging to maintain server-side if there are many potential values of item1 and item2 and expensive to retrieve client-side

5656140
width	height
the reason you want to do this is that your width and height are maximum allowed dimensions that the manager can occupy and if you try to call setextent with dimensions larger than it you will most likely get an error in your console saying that there was insufficient room to layout

5656154
crypt	hash
you would have to generate the crypt hash for the password

5656164
portrait	landscape
i m creating a image gallery with dozens of landscape and portrait images on a single page

5656249
repo	egit
i m looking for a way to see though egit to the whole history of my current git repo

5656345
entity-relationship	diagram
option two would have only one row per item cleaner than option one in this regard but having two fields on one table that both reference the company table doesn t smell right and it s messy to draw in an entity-relationship diagram

5656395
for-loop	loops
i am able to do this using a foreach loops but i only need to access the first 10 objects they are sorted so i am trying to use a for-loop

5656422
width	height
in our case the document was extended past the page width but it can easily be modified to accommodate the page height

5656442
min	max
with standard b-tree indexes join complexity is o min n m log max n m

5656460

5656510
subtract	add
i add to or subtract from xpos for movement

5656587
folder	directory
also thought to make it in iis virtual directory for every part or application to use its own bin but also never use its own bin folder especially in convert virtual directory to application

5656619
jruby	rubinius
have you checked whether rubinius or jruby would allow you to precompile your code

5656633
width	font-size
you can use jquery to check the length of the string and guess at a suitable font-size check the rendered width and then adjust again if necessary

5656638
folder	directory
basically i m trying to run a zend framework application multiple of them actually from within folder -- but without specifying the public directory

when creating my xmlserializer use both the type and default namespace both for serializable and deserialization

5656651
firefox	safari
other browsers such as safari and firefox have no problem

5656681
children	parent
the last thing is that if the joins are performance critical between the parent and the children you should use abstract inheritance

5656697
ubuntu	debian
if debian ubuntu you will want to install the build-essential package via aptitude for make and friends

5656708
min	max
this will need to do 2-4 passes through the list two to find the max and min values and up to 2 to find the values to remove if they both happen to be at the end of the list

5656708
min	max
you could reduce this to one by writing a python loop to find the max and min in a single pass and remember the index of each so you can delete the items by index after the loop

5656708
min	max
however min and max are implemented in c so replacing them with python code would probably result in lower performance even if it allowed you to reduce the number of passes

5656758
libxml2	libxslt
specify the libxml2 and libxslt dirs

5656770
libxml2	libxslt
you have read nonstandard libxml2 libxslt installations right

5656770
libxml2	libxslt
if youâ ve got libxml2 and or libxslt installed in a nonstandard place read as â œnot opt local usr local usr or the standard ruby directoriesâ you can use command-line parameters to the gem install command to grease the wheels

5656770
libxml2	libxslt
note that by default libxslt header files are installed into the root include directory but libxml2 header files are installed into a subdirectory thereof named libxml2

5656774
post	get
i have a form that post data on click of the submit button an ajax function is called which should get the php processing page

5656803
width	height
you create a cgrect by calling the function cgrectmake x y width height

5656803
width	height
of course you are going need to set unique values for x y width and height for each button or they will all overlap

5656814
udp	tcp
is this a fair design for managing the game state tcp connections and send receive udp packets for state updates

5656816
integer	unsigned
from what i understand the pdword type represents an unsigned integer 32bit

5656828
width	height
i have a series of divs which may vary in height thought they will generally be the same width

5656906
integer	unsigned
pdword is a pointer to a 32-bit unsigned integer

5656920
integer	unsigned
so it s a pointer to a dword which msdn also says is an unsigned 32-bit integer - in other words a uint

5656931
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome run the validation instantly

5656947

if you read some of the post you might get the idea that it s all mad shaky - it s not

5656962
put	get
put text input in your submit form to get user s answer on captcha if it s not provided with captcha script

5656966
ivar	subclassing
you could also create a subclassing of nsurlconnection and add a webservicelabel ivar property to that

5656982
for-loop	loops
it looks like you are using an index and a while loops where a for-loop can be used

5657090
put	get
how do i get the original hop variable value using javascript and what is the correct format to put it into the exitsplashpage var

5657093

hash	md5
the format of each email hash is the crc32 and md5 hash of the email address combined with an underscore _

5657337
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
furthermore since i m already writing a book here you don t need to cast the return from malloc or calloc or realloc or anything else that returns in c and doing so can cover up problems

5657354
hash-collision	key
by default in the case of a hash-collision a state-city pair already exists a single bucket for a key stores multiple entries which can be searched sequentially using the hashtable java api

5657375
free	malloc
probably the simplest way to manage those issues is to malloc a structure for each thread initialize it pass the pointer to the thread and let the thread free it when it s done with the data

5657423
gif	png
png jpeg gif

5657460
boost	stl
my feeling is a lot of the work that goes into boost libraries is making them work with other libraries stl

5657484
hash	md5
the advantage of doing this over just using a md5 hash is that these are guaranteed not to collide with non-named-based uuids and have a very very small possibility of collision with other name-based uuids

5657517
hash	md5
the advantage of doing this over just using a md5 hash is that these are guaranteed not to collide with non-named-based uuids and have a very very small possibility of collision with other name-based uuids

5657541
folder	directory
since movefileex only works for moving directory inside a volume and copyfileex only works for copying file not directory shell object s moveitem is the only option for me to move folder cross volumes

5657560
set	bag
a bag is like a set but allows an item to be in the set multiple times

5657567

5657626
integer	fractions
note that this function also works for fractions numbers having no integer portion .2px

5657646
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
you need to rethrow the exception from somemethod because myexception is a checked exception doesn t extend runtimeexception - which is an unchecked-exception and the compiler forces you to handle checked exceptions like this

5657656
pop-up	dialog
will pop-up dialog box

5657686
post	get
if i try to post the form directly without jquery i get a response from the php page - either please enter your name

5657687
versioning	upgrade
assuming you found a way to reliably profile your application keep in mind that it will all go out the window should you switch to another jdk impl ibm to sun to openjdk etc or even upgrade versioning on your existing jvm

5657689
free	malloc
you must free memory allocated by malloc when you are done with it

5657694
hide	show
in explorer there is a shell extension that hide the details of how the gac and native images work and just show you a prettier ui

5657751
querypath	phpquery
but i would be lazy here and resort to phpquery or querypath it seems a one-time operation so you don t need to watch out for performance

5657760
terminate	timeout
so the state of thread in your example at the moment the timeout has expired will be anything that is not terminate which is why the timeout occurred as opposed to join returning naturally in which case thread would be in the terminate state - of course thread could almost immediately transition into the terminate state just after the timeout happened

5657801
websphere	ibm
i am trying to make ssl work on a webservices created by using ibm websphere jax-ws runtime for quite a while now but am unable to make it work somehow

i know that i regularly deal with tgagabytes of text on macs linux solaris and bsd systems more than 99 of it utf-8 and only twice have i come across bom-laden text

5657857
terminate	timeout
but even in the latter case it could have gone into terminate state between the timeout having fired and the calling code having caught the timeout exception.

5657879
cng	cryptoapi
elliptic curves are supported by cng which is the replacement of cryptoapi

5657886

but what you re going to end up doing is crafting the urls you want to access including all get post parameters sending the data listening for the data parse data place in db

5657892
postgresql	mysql
i would suggest postgresql mysql or any db relational or not see mongodb but don t think pyqt supports it yet but you can use any python lib with pyqt nicely

5657914
capistrano	rvm
i had this problem with vps plus rvm rails3 capistrano and nginx

5657925
button	checkbox
i take it that error message is being generated because of the lines of code _post for the gender and media form elements which are radio button and checkbox respectively

5657964
width	height
how come a percentage value for height doesnâ t work but a percentage value for width does

5657964
width	height
the width of #working ends up being 80 of the viewport but the height of #not-working ends up being 0

5657970
rsa	dsa
you can t use makecert for things other than rsa and dsa

5657986
migrate	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
based on this principle i do not see a reason why you would need to migrate to another versioning of hibernate if you only upgrade the driver

5658019
maven	cargo
i am trying to work out how to force the version of cargo that maven or more specifically cargo-maven2-plugin should be using

5658030

if you are using a versioning of node.js much older than 0.4.5 then upgrade

5658053
disk	ram
i d prefer to use a solution that accessed the database from hard disk and not ram unlike redis

5658055
google-chrome	firefox
firebug on firefox or google-chrome s built in developer tools

5658062
width	height
when you specify the height or width as a percentage that s a percentage with respect to the element s parent

clean up all .class files and other artifacts shut down intellij build the war with ant or maven and try deploying that to tomcat

5658238
children	parent
the ids need to be unique such that when all the children are finished the parent can reap the children and then collect the data

5658238
children	parent
when the parent finds that all the children are finished it uses storable to read back in the files into a hash and use the hopefully unique as the key

5658240
superclass	subclassing
the errors i m getting indicate that although the method is being called from the superclass it s calling the subclassing s version of the method

5658263
webclient	webrequest
it uses webrequest rather that webclient but it is from microsoft and should be a good example

5658275
put	get
i was just wondering if this might put too much pressure on the server if the site would get heavy traffic

5658338
children	parent
to allow the parent to keep track of all the result files it needs to harvest you could simply generate a unique job id in the parent then keep this constant down through the tree of children

5658381
post	get
if you are interested in patterning your restful api after twitter s then i suggest studying the way twitter has organized their api resources see the method docs under the links in the right sidebar here how they support different resource formats by changing the extension like .xml or .json of the requested resource how they version the endpoint and which verbs are supported per resource for example how the oauth request_token method supports both post and get methods

5658423
width	height
just set the sizes attribute to the specific width and height and mobile safari should match it up correctly

5658424
ubuntu	linux
tomcat is a service in linux as well so in ubuntu you have to start tomcat in order to access it

5658425
xcodebuild	xcrun
while you wait on apple the only solution i can offer is to use xcodebuild and xcrun as part of a command-line shell script where you would know if you are archiving or not

5658455
width	height
just set the sizes attribute to the specific width and height and mobile safari should match it up correctly

5658455
width	height
you can see the various width height values from the link you posted too

5658505
memcached	apc
if you must do this every second even though like others i would advise you against making a call to the server that frequently look into something like memcached or apc to make the request trivial in nature

5658515
mouse	keyboard
i tried to set mouse keyboard event handler on combobox but it only works on the combobox s textbox not in the dropdown list

set it to stretch both height and width and you d get a slightly fuzzy idea of what a particular size would be

5659782
stdout	stderr
if you want a more advanced process execution routine to write stdin and read both stdout and stderr as well as get return code

5659807
portrait	landscape
initially u can set label s frame for portrait mode and then this method will called when u change yr mode from landscape to portrait

5659807

5661870

int	double
the comparison will promote the int to a double

5670291
int	double
what you re asking is if the compiler is guaranteed to do identical conversions each time it converts identical int to double

5670817
ontouch	ondraw
try to define all the fixed values variables in the constructor of the surfaceview or in onsizechanged where you know the size of the canvas and bitmaps loaded so not to make any unneccesary variable creation requests or calcualtions in ondraw ontouch or other methods to handle game logic otherwise it will slow down

5671066
google-chrome	firefox
this works great with browsers such as google google-chrome and firefox 3 i have not tested 2 yet

5671079
super	implements	super	extends	implements	extends
note that the feature i m trying to implements is easily obtained if i invert the order of type parameter declarations thus changing the super constraint to extends

5671079
super	extends
as a simple rule you use extends with the types you demand and super with the types you provide

5671086
min	max
i want to use min max values not to restrict what values exist but what values are shown

5671144

5671202
actionscript	mxml
i think what your are asking is how to keep your actionscript files separate from the mxml files that contain your designs

5671202
actionscript	mxml
create a script element on this mxml file and set the source to the relative path of your actionscript file

5671202
actionscript	mxml
the external actionscript is treated as if it were the method definitions for the class generated by the mxml

5671202
actionscript	mxml	mxmlc	compc
when a flex project is compiled using mxmlc or compc those are the compiler programs for flex applications and component libraries respectively mxml files are pre-compiled into actionscript class definitions

5671202
actionscript	mxml
if you add the -keep-generated-actionscript directive to your compiler options in flash flex builder ant command line compile command the compiler will leave the generated classes that compose the actionscript class derived from the declaritive mxml files in your project

5671202
actionscript	mxml
having actionscript defined in a script block in your mxml is not mixing logic with presentation

5671202
public	protected
unlike an interface those methods can be of any namespace type protected final public internal mx_internal etc. and can must function bodies have code inside the function block

5671204
qtcpsocket	qtcpserver
you must extract qtcpsocket object from qtcpserver with nextpendingconnection call when the newconnection signal was emitted

5671204
qtcpsocket	qtcpserver
the key here is that listening socket qtcpserver is only responsible for creating connection sockets or qtcpsocket each time a new client connects

5671208
submit	submission
essentially what this will mean is that you ll want to interrupt any submit events and combine all of the form data into one set of parameters before submission

5671281
x86	64bit
a 64bit program has the following advantages over the same one compiled for 32-bit x86

note that it does work if i don t put any get attributes

5675580
implements	extends
why is it necessary to extends the class first and then implements the inteface

5675601
libpcap	jpcap
hence manually crafting icmp packages is out of the question jpcap is no help here since it relies on libpcap which i suppose you won t find on any vanilla installation

5675614
implements	extends
because you can extends just one class and implements more than one interface having the class first make easier to read

5675629
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
it works in firefox safari ie7+ and opera

5675640

is it possible to place 1 div inside another div and have the div inside have a larger width and height than the div it is contained within

5675826
width	height
basically i want to have a container that the user can set the width and height of

5675826
width	height
the image will be the background of the container however due to the fact that the background image could be made bigger than the container i want it to be possible for the background to be a div that can expand beyond the height and width of its container - to crop the image if you like

5675849
integer	unsigned
java does not have unsigned integer types and the long long type from c++ also does not exist in java

5675849
int	chars
there is also chars which is technically a 16-bit unsigned int but which is meant to hold chars data

5675871
rss	feed
i need a step by step procedure in creating a rss feed based on the search queries that users type in

5675871
rss	feed
the resulting rss feed should be based on the large rss feed

5675894
super	self
self and super work quite differently self means the calling object at runtime while super means the superclass of the class where the method definition is

5675894
super	self
in both cases they are specifying where the search for a method should start in the case of self the starting point is determined dynamically in the super case it is known at compile time

5675894
super	self
class parent has a method two which calls one on self and super

5675894
super	self
hopefully you now can apply inheritance self and super to your example

5675916
innodb	myisam
1 in mysql engines myisam is better or innodb

5675940
filesystems	ntfs
if you can rely on the filesystems being ntfs you could tag all your folders with an alternate datastream check if such a stream is present while reading the list .

5675971
post	get
when i post a message in fiddler i get the error

5675982
switching	screens
than i switching to any other tab tab2 3 or 4 and change screens orientation and it always resets to default tab tab1

5675986
innodb	myisam
1 if you need foreign keys relations on db level use innodb else use myisam

5676013
post	get
and i assume you are trying to get the user because if you want to post to their feed you should just use

5676034
outputstream	inputstream
in java you can do it directly via parsedelimitedfrom inputstream and writedelimitedto outputstream

5676047
google-chrome	firefox
but problem is i can see scrolbar-x on ie but on firefox or google-chrome it sets overflow hidden

5676096
hide	show
just hide the tableview and show it again when the data has been loaded

5676148
macports	homebrew
instead of using the pre-compiled framework you ll be on the safe side using something like source-based framework using the source macports or homebrew

5676163
tweenlite	papervision3d	tweenlite	away3d	away3d	papervision3d
if you want to use 3d use papervision3d or away3d but that requires some studying and getting to know the libraries as where tweenlite is easily accessible and used

5676173
innodb	myisam
myisam table locking so innodb can handle more concurrent requests

5676173
innodb	myisam
innodb is transactional so inserts will generally be slower than myisam

5676173
innodb	myisam
innodb is more reliable than myisam

5676173
innodb	myisam
myisam is faster than innodb for reads myth

5676173
innodb	myisam
myisam tables have smaller footprints than innodb ones myth

5676173
innodb	myisam
however not many people will mention innodb clustered primary key indexes and how a well designed innodb table will easily out perform an equivalent myisam one because of this

5676185
concave	convex
that s because your polygon is not convex - the top right corner is concave

5676198
width	height
so i thought of editing the image but i want to edit the image in correct composition correct height width ratio so that image doesn t looks odd

5676198
width	height
with the above code i am able to resize the image to 350 x 350 but ii wish to scale it with only width as a parameter so that height adjusts accordingly and the image ratio remains the same

pull the files create an eclipse project with mvn eclipse eclipse code a while and commit push them to the repo

5676282
disk	ram
faster disk raid and much more ram will take you some of the way

5676282
vertica	greenplum
if you have the use solutions from vertica or greenplum there may be other options these are the ones that i m familiar with

5676282
hbase	hypertable
if you prefer open source byo use hadoop log event data to files use mapreduce to process them store results to hbase or hypertable

5676302
for-loop	arrays
is it at all possible to do this is a list comprehension or make a for-loop take four items from the arrays instead of one

5676332
hide	show
moreover pd s style doesn t change visually at all even in case of using hide - change style- show schema

5676353
decoder	encoder
for simplicity letâ s also assume that both encoder and decoder know

5676386
prepare	execute
you will notice that for prepare statements the php.net list of functions is available at even functions such as - execute

5676393
pull	push
on the central server you create a bare repository and on you re local machine you clone from that repository push and pull from that repository often through ssh

5676401
post	get
now as i understand it the client app has to have a post method to post the stream to the server and then i should have an aspx page on the server to decode back the stream i get from the post and formulate my xml file and then save it inside the folder correct me if i m wrong

5676435
maven	m2e
m2e is an eclipse plugin that integrates maven builds

5676468
ienumerable	iqueryable
i ve few doubts regarding how shared ienumerable and iqueryable is accessed in multi-threaded application

5676468
ienumerable	iqueryable
and what if i use iqueryable instead of ienumerable in the above code

5676503
folder	directory
what this means is that while the applet or web start application may have full read write privileges on the machine because the executables are running from a low integrity directory they are only allowed access to files and folder that are low integrity as well

5676573
int	chars
you can t simply cast a chars to an int

5676630
pull	push
this branch is the one that you push and pull between your private repositories

5676630
pull	push
now you work on the new wip2 branch instead and that s the one that you push and pull between your repositories

5676640
ienumerable	iqueryable
then it doesn t matter if the iqueryable ienumerable is thread-safe

5676680
prepare	execute
i could write the tests for every module in a way that is initializes the applications state to a pre-defined state and then execute its tests but having to clean and prepare the state would be quite an effort

5676699
post	get
but i think the best your going to get if you don t want to use any client-side technologies like javascript or flash is to let the user upload a file with a normal post and then somehow maybe in your session remember the files that the user uploaded or just save them to the database as they come in

5676708
fast-forward	merge
that means that if this doesn t turn out to be a fast-forward merge there ll be a merge commit added in the git history and that can only be represented by a single commit in subversion

5676709
width	height
width and height are 10 and 10

5676721
width	height
there would be a workaround by putting the iframe into an a div container that has a defined height and width and overflow hidden to clip the view port

5676771
profiling	debugging
i m transferring the application to my device using this provisioning profiling debugging mode

5676798
folder	directory
create a folder lib in your projects root directory with the eclipse workbench

5676805
postgresql	greenplum
greenplum which is a proprietary but mostly free-as-in-beer extension to postgresql supports both column-oriented and row-oriented tables with high customizable compression

5676826
squash	merge
you can squash commits on merge includes pull or rebase interactive as well

5676876
xsl-fo	xslt
or you could use xslt on the html and use xsl-fo like apache fop but it seems overkill to me

5676895
stdout	stderr
a windows subsystem process one with winmain will not have a stdout stderr or stdin unless it was specifically given one on launch

5676895
stdout	stderr
if launched in that way it will have both a stdout and stderr which will both go into the named file

5676895
stdout	stderr
on the other hand a console subsystem program one with main will by default have a stdin stdout and stderr all set to the console

5676908
width	height
and of course move the fixed width height from the textview to the tablerow and leave the textview to wrap_height

5676932
post	get
i have used jquery to post the data to a php validation page i have also got the result but when i get sucess i want to redirect to some other page say success page and on that page i want to display email-id

5676934
int	double
i have read a great deal of commentary on why int and double are less precise than decimals but the short answer is to use decimals

5676935
super	extends
record is a super class there are many classes that extends record say wellnessrecord

5676947
svg	vml
the added bonus is that raphael also works in older versions of ie as it can detect and switch to using vml if svg isn t available

5676965
post	get
next should be a post param not a get param

5676991
put	get
you should get the value for the token first increment it and put it again

5677065
int	chars
in that case its value refers to the int number of chars

5677103
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview which contains a uiwebview as a subviews

5677131
accessor	properties
in .net applications the culprit is frequently a properties accessor returning the properties itself rather than the private backing field

5677155
google-chrome	firefox
i m getting a javascript error in ie9 that i m not getting in google-chrome or firefox and i can t figure out a good way to solve it

5677155
google-chrome	firefox
current versions of google-chrome and firefox perform as intended

5677250
16-bit	64bit
does the word size have any effect 16-bit 32 bits 64bit

5677263
post	get
i have written code use a digital certificate to get cookies from a secured url to in turn post data back to another url using the retrieved cookies and same digital certificate

5677263
post	get
the get works and cookies are retrieved the post comes back with an error 500

5677289
post	get
but post increment requires a lvalue which is a variable with a name but a++ returns a rvalue which cannot be incremented thus leading to the error message you get

5677355
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
following code worked for me on firefox ie 8 google-chrome safari and iphone

5677367
zlib	libpng
you must use some other libraries addons libpng zlib loadpng

5677367
zlib	libpng
loadpng is bundled with allegro from version 4.3.10 but you need libpng and zlib installed in your compiler

5677374
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
following code worked for me on firefox ie 8 google-chrome safari and iphone

5677411
jobs	cron
if your getting more then 1 from your request then your exponantially creating more cron jobs

5677412
width	height
the measuring phase will set the desiredsize property not the width height properties

5677412
width	height
the width height properties are used to give an element an explicit size versus auto-fitting to it s content via the measureoverride

5677412
width	height
you shouldn t be setting the width height based on the results of the measure or arrange phase as these properties are used by the measure and arrange phases to determine the best size

5677412
width	height
the width height may not be valid sizes

5677412
width	height
the general rule of thumb is your panel should not touch the width height minwidth minheight etc type properties

5677413
jar	manifest.mf
see the manifest.mf in side jar

5677436
x86	mips
the current version of windows embedded compact supports intel x86 and compatibles mips and arm processors

5677591
hash	salt
if you re using hash salt them

5677591
hash	hmac
to use straight hash use hmac

5677605
ubuntu	freebsd
as for modifying the web server s environment i did that on a freebsd server where you just add a script with the environment vars you nedd inside usr local etc apache22 envvars.d and i suspect you could achieve the same on ubuntu editing etc apache2 envvars

5677623
getter	setter
what actually happens is that the attributetypeids and producttypeid properties are bound to the relevant request parameters and the getter setter simulate producttype and attributetypes properties

5677681
getter	setter
i have left out the majority of the setter and getter of the entities

5677686
cpu	processors
if a thread is truly cpu bound it will only slow another thread if they are both executing on the same processors core

in the .h i define 2 typedef struct say ts1 and ts2

5677794
children	parent
using your parent node loop through all the children

5677810
google-chrome	safari
so the normal flow of events that happens when browsing to this server is that the web browser both safari and google-chrome prompts the user to select a certificate and retry the operation

5677821
codeigniter	pyrocms
i have been used doctrine with codeigniter but is not the same thing to integrate with pyrocms

5677883
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
you can also use getelementbyid to get a specific node much quicker than any array search could ever be and getelementsbytagname to get all elements of a particular type

5677893
versioning	upgrade
if their versioning is too old i present them with 2 options upgrade or quit

5677913
google-chrome	firefox
using response.outputstream.write does indeed work however the video player in both firefox 4.0 and google-chrome cannot seem to determine how long the video is

5677913
google-chrome	firefox
firefox s counter just increases as the play time goes on while google-chrome shows a completely random time

5677914
put	get
this is grat for multiple languages because you are able to put the strings.xml in a country-code ending value folder like values-de values-en or values-fr in order to get the right string based on the phonesettungs

5677943
button	checkbox
if you mean that you don t want multiple checkbox from a same logical group to be checked at one time you should use radio button instead of checkbox

5677966
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest	xunit.net	fsunit
fsunit currently supports nunit mbunit xunit.net and mstest vs11 only

5677996
portrait	landscape
my problem is that i m animating a ball on the screen in portrait mode but now i want do to the same thing in landscape mode

5678019
multiplying	addition	goto	break
it has the advantage that you can break out of multiplying nested control statements more easily than with break as was proposed by someone and in addition to what goto provides has a status indication that can encode the reason for what went wrong

5678023
prepare	execute	prepare	bindparam
you d like to have a look at pdo s prepare statements pdo- prepare pdostatement- bindparam pdostatement- execute and pdostatement- fetch

5678036
folder	directory
you can use nsuserdefaults the documents directory or one of a few other folder in your app s directory hierarchy or core data

5678036
iboutlet	ibaction
iboutlet and ibaction ibaction and iboutlet are typedef s for void

5678069
prepare	execute
after you ve prepare it you can execute it multiple times just changing the values

5678070
post	get
access the data using http get post methods

5678074
width	height
so i am trying to insert an image to a page with javascript with 50 of its width and 50 of its height

5678114
google-chrome	firefox
and it works very fast in firefox and google-chrome

5678144
width	height
does the parent container have a height width

5678150
cassini	iis
website works fine in cassini and even on our windows 2003 server with iis 6.0

5678153
width	height
first of all if you re setting a width and height you should also include display block

5678153
width	height
but more importantly when you express a width or height as a percentage that s a percentage of the parent element so if the parent is 1000px wide the image will be 500px wide regardless of what size the actual image file is

5678164
width	height
the css you ve got means that the width and height should be computed as half the size of the parent container not the image itself

5678164
width	height
the eerily knowledgeable å ime vidas points out that setting the width or height attribute should make the right thing happen with the size being reduced appropriately to maintain the aspect ratio

5678187
strcpy	strdup
delete the text _crt_insecure_deprecate fopen_s from that line and you will no longer get the security warning when you use fopen but it will remain for strcpy strdup and those other possibly dangerous ones

5678189
fink	macports
it might be in macports but it might not be or in fink i don t know

5678204
carrierwave	paperclip
you can use or paperclip or carrierwave gems

5678221
128bit	64bit
a guid has 128bit length a long only 64bit you are missing 64bit of information allowing for two guids to generate the same long representation

5678222
debian	linux
also that problem reproduces only on linux debian 5.0

5678279
google-chrome	firefox
the edit-server extension for google-chrome or it s all text extension for firefox are both two great alternatives to having emacs or fetchmail download huge quantities of mail to a machine you don t want the mail on

5678294
x86	64bit
the solution i got is to compile as x86 and then run it as 32 bits application on the 64bit machine

5678298
openejb	weld
any articles about getting openejb atomikos weld eclipselink and jetty or any other similar stack working together

5678547
lambda	first-class-functions
for example microsoft .net has lambda and delegates no relation to objective-c delegates while the most generic names are probably anonymous functions or first-class-functions

5678578
apache	lighttpd
the backend will most likely be implemented in python using wsgi on apache or lighttpd but that is still open for discussion

5678588
bellman-ford	floyd-warshall
when that happens shortest path algorithms bellman-ford johnson floyd-warshall would detect the existence of such negative cycle and fail but no other useful information is produced

5678592
google-chrome	firefox
i noticed on google-chrome firefox and ie to have those images at different positions

5678657
equals	tostring
although the parse should succeed the value of tostring on the resulting enum instance is not defined and may not equals textarea as your assertion is expecting

5678658
implements	extends
most mx class drawing methods were implements incorrectly with private methods doing most of the drawing and this makes extends those classes difficult

5678670
tablet	galaxy
in one edit text i am setting onkeylistener so that when i enter 5 numerics in edittext it will accept n do next process but in samsung galaxy tablet it is not working i am using these lines of code

5678700
cvs	svn	cvs	rcs
the command you are likely looking for is svn update -rnnn however without some background on svn odds are excellent that you ll misuse it as svn is very like yet in some ways different than the old school cvs rcs sccs like systems

vsto	add-in
so my questions are in a powerpoint vsto add-in

5678738
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
if you are using the synchronous method nsurlconnection sendsynchronousrequest returningresponse error you need to wrap it in a nsoperation so it doesn t block the main ui thread

5678768
portrait	landscape
this should return the propery bounds of your screen 320x480 in portrait 480x320 in landscape and check against those values

5678776
folder	directory
if the repo-browser doesn t get to the path specified it ll get as far as it can recursively in the directory until it finds the problematic folder a folder that for the youngest revision does not exist

5678802
width	height
so i have a bunch of elements that need to have a specific width height and padding and need to be centered within their parent element

5678802
width	margin
i don t know how many elements there will be so .pages can t have a defined width so margin auto

5678811

they just use a simple text editor textmate vim emacs and debug using the console

5679070
integer	unsigned
nsstring length returns an unsigned integer

5679075
next	except
if in your mind s eye you ignore the dim and compare what s left you ll find vb and c# pretty similar except that c# does it the wrong way round you can guess which language i grew up with and like c puts the type first or uses var and the name of the variable next

5679079
superclass	subclassing
also when you are using data components and retrieving a collection typed as a superclass with subclassing instances you will need to add this setting to the bean reader

after i am capturing udp packets in c# successfully i will be sending them over a tcp connection to my server at which i need to send out the udp to the destination and then transmit the response back to the client machine that is capturing the packets and then send the response to the program as if it was directly from the server in question

5679375
udp	tcp
i need to create a network driver that captures all of the udp traffic generated by all the programs on my computer send it to a dedicated server in which i would have coded a server daemon to translate the tcp to udp and send it to the original destination

width	height
alternatively you can use the fillrect x y width height with a width of 1

5679417
width	height
though the parameter works as x y with width height as opposed to p1 to p2

5679456
width	height
i have tried setting the width and height as follows

5679456
width	height
but the bitmapimage returns zero values for the width and height

5679589
switching	screens

5679809
rspec	capybara
see there first for rspec and rspec + capybara

5679819
for-loop	arrays
you would need to do it using something like assigning array_keys to an arrays then using a for-loop to go through that etc.

5679837
put	get
but when i try to put it into practice it i get error saying that the getcontext attribut is undefined

5679893
int	chars
you should map the function read x int to each of the elements of the string as a list of chars

5679963
post	get
so it would be helpful if your javascript would keep track of when the browser last received an update from the server so when it asks for a new update it can send in the get string of the url or via post the last_updated_timestamp of when it last received an update

5679966
atof	strtod
qi comes with a benchmark that compares the performance of std atof std strtod and boost spirit qi double_

i then do a jsonp get call immediately after the post finishes with that same src key and it fetches the result

5680101
width	height
as an example when i set this faux canvasrect 10 10 40 20 dp internally it actually sets the canvas.left canvas.top width and height dps and canvasrect itself still remains at its default of 0 0 0 0

5680101
getter	setter
think of it as sort of a coercevalue but on the getter side not the setter

5680101
width	height
width and height dps which

5680101
getter	setter
anyway as i said the dp setter works great but if i did want to put in the getter i m not sure i can think of any other way except to wire up all those change notifications for the related dps

5680221
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
you create a for-loop to iterate over the outer arrays then inside that loops you use another for-loop to iterate over the inner arrays

5680221
for-loop	arrays
how can i iterate over a multidimensional arrays using a for-loop

5680221
for-loop	loops
generally when you use a for-loop loops will look something like this

5680221
for-loop	arrays
an arrays with keys 0 2 and 3 is not because it jumps over 1 this doesn t work well for associative arrays i.e arrays with text as keys - for example because these arrays won t have keys with the numerical indexes your for-loop will produce

5680221
for-loop	loops
for example if you could use any loops but a foreach then it would be a lot simpler to just use a while loops than to try to bash a for-loop into doing what you want

5680226
pdfsharp	itextsharp
silverpdf looks to be inspired based-on itextsharp and pdfsharp but it doesn t use an identical class layout by any means

children	parent
i have a class node with a self referential mapping children backref parent representing a tree in sqlalchemy and i want to select the entire tree

5680461
children	parent
what i would recommend regardless of whether a parent can have multiple children is that you use an anonymous type as the data source for the combo box and populate that type using linq

5680462
children	parent
the parent has to care for it s children

5680462
children	parent
the parent must raise the error throw an exception return an error code etc. if it still has children and can t be deleted

to use this though make sure you have a width height specified on the box

5680540

5680731
jobs	cron
if you need to do more than set some environment variables then you re going to need to put your source usr local rvm scripts rvm either in the cron specs as you have in your question or you ll need to wrap your cron jobs in a cron runner something like this

background-image	background-color
therefore it corresponds to background-image specifically and not background-color or the entire background shorthand

5681954
background-repeat	background-position
1 technically the background-position and background-repeat declarations apply to both layers here because the gaps are filled in by repeating the values instead of clamped but since background-position is its initial value and background-repeat doesn t matter for a gradient covering the entire element it doesn t matter too much

5681959
put	get
the goal is to put this functionality into a single report rather than having to know which report to run for which client if and when they get a sales allowance

5684617
return-value-optimization	nrvo
note the standard explicitly states that copying from a function via return can be elided look up return-value-optimization nrvo and all modern compilers will remove the extra copy construction and build in place at the return site but this is an optimization invisible to the user just think of it as a very efficient copy out of a function

uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
for quick in-line stuff use the uisegmentedcontrol when this is more of a new context or there are too many options use a nested uitableview control that you push from your uinavigationcontroller if there are only a handful of options you can just dedicate a couple of rows in your uitableview to the radio options and run it yourself

5687363
width	margin
i think by slicing he means starting a new line it is true that adding float left to everything with the appropiate width will indeed induce a new line what should happen if something needed to be of a negative margin or float right it would break your markup you should check out your knowledge of tree structure in html and avoid using floats where not necessary instead use margins relative positioning or absolute pages designed all in float are hard to appear correct in all major browsers as different broswers treat float irrespectively

5687372

5688104
width	height
but what it does is it returns me a image of height 155 and width 174 what is absurd because i triple checked and the frame 12 is height 220 and width 200

screens	hdpi
the other way around ldpi on hdpi with scaling you ll have a noticeably pixelated image on your hdpi screens scaled to the same size

5688504
screens	hdpi
hdpi you ll need a larger image to take up an inch of space on the screens than you would for a low density screens

5688523

put	get
that it would perform quicker with get put calls

5690968
for-loop	loops
you should replace for-loop block with foreach loops like this one bellow

5691016
google-chrome	firefox
you should use firebug in firefox or the google-chrome console and see what url ajax call is calling and what error code it is reporting back

5691143
puts	gets
that is b has a gets that asks for input a has a puts that outputs something

5691164

i have a userprofile model with 35 fields chars int bool dec m2m fk

5691226
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
most notably when added directly to the uiwindow or other apple created custom controllers like uinavigationcontroller

5691226
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in this case uiviewcontroller should only be directly to the window or uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller etc

5691226
viewdidload	viewwillappear
custom implementations of viewdidload viewdidload viewdidunload viewwillappear viewwilldisappear not to mention things as simple as properties like say view .

5691297
vim	emacs
for linux and unix machines vim or emacs are the main choices

5691335
versioning	upgrade
the site was developed with versioning 1.5.10 but the hosting provider who is not responding might have upgrade to 1.6 or higher

5691338
inherited	subclassing
constructors aren t inherited directly as members on the subclassing but any non-private constructors will be accessible via a corresponding super call from within the subclassing which works just as well

5691338
superclass	subclassing
when you don t want to modify any behavior of the superclass s constructor just add a version to your subclassing that takes the same parameter s and calls the super version

5691342
lisp	scheme
i don t see why sbcl should be so fast - scheme is a far simpler language than common lisp

5691407
free	malloc
use malloc to allocate the amount of bytes needed to be read and remember for each allocation of buffer you need to free the allocated buffer later

5691428
sorting	filtering
i d like to use isotope to handle the sorting and filtering effects but i m having trouble figuring out how to get elements rearranged by isotope at the end of each row to get assigned the .last class so that they don t overflow into the space that the next row is using

5691571
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
it s possible if you can get their participation- they d need a clientaccesspolicy.xml or crossdomain.xml that allows your hosting domain or all domains access

5691591
implements	extends
of course this is not to say that you could do something like this in your own code extends abstractjbutton and implements canaddactionlistener interface but be aware of the pitfalls in doing so

5691605
children	parent
as a suggestion try calling invalidate on the parent view which will cause drawing invocations to all the children - including your button

5691605
children	parent
play with either invalidating or any other method which will cause the parent to invoke the onmeasure of the children

5691615
stdout	stderr
die is printing to stderr while print is going to stdout

5691665

5691708
uiview	subviews
when talking about a view controller the view that the controller manages is the uiview instance that the controller s view points to and the hierarchy of subviews that it contains

5691708
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
take a good look at uiviewcontroller and you ll see that most of the functionality provided has to do with displaying the view that is the view hierarchy on the screen or with integrating the controller with container view controllers such as uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller

5691708
parentviewcontroller	navigationcontroller
or to access its navigationcontroller or parentviewcontroller properties

5691712
implements	extends
since you are not extends thread but your class implements runnable

5691722
jobs	cron
i know about cron but in there i have to command from the cpanel not in php i think something like start cron from php and stop but parallel jobs is also important

5691742
spaces	linefeed
the output probably looks better if you process the text file anyway treat single cr linefeed as spaces only treat empty lines as new paragraphs etc.

5691746
put	get
because clients need to get immediate response from the gateway while online so i have to put my authentication details in my server-side php script

5691941
mbunit	nunit
unquote integrates configuration-free with all exception-based unit testing frameworks including xunit.net nunit and mbunit

5691988
int	chars
for example suppose you have a 4gb machine and an application keeps int long 8 bytes in c++ if you know that you are not dealing with variables whose value are so large you can change to ushort or chars thus improving performance by locality in ram

5691994
int	chars
the last byte of an int is assignable to chars

5692039
width	height
so if you want to hide an element but still be able to determine its width and height the first solution is the way to go

the closest find is something like fmin and fmax settings set to 20 and 56 respectively don t these look like temperature limits for min and max fan speeds

5692204
min	max
edit i was wrong fmin and fmax specify the min and max fan speeds 2000 and 5600 respectively

5692221

5692256
m2e	pom.xml
i manually added it to the section of the pom.xml and it shows up fine in the dependencies list in m2e

5692267
integer	unsigned
for example you could use an integer or the unsigned type above

5692267
integer	unsigned
in the declaration of output_int output length is the width of the output vector as an integer and the operator is used for exponentiation so the expression means all unsigned integers that can be expressed with as many bits as output has

5692267
integer	unsigned
2 32 -1 is the highest value that can be expressed with an unsigned 32-bit integer

5692272

if you submit the form from form2.aspx to default.aspx than you have it in the request get or post

5692329
inherited	subclassing
this is not terribly different from what c++ lets you do you can use purely abstract-class to define types and have all concrete classes implement them using public inherited but subclassing each other using private inherited

5692348
division	multiplication	ceil	floor
however the mathexpression filter provides ceil and floor operations as well as multiplication and division

5692356
scheme	racket
now i want to make such a tree in scheme racket so i can walk to the tree and build a table for each encoded value

5692467
floating-point	integer
if the number is really huge in a sense that the number of digits is greater than the number representable by the mantissa of your floating-point number then your floating-point number is always an integer

5692467
decimal	ieee
for example the ieee 754 double-precision format has a 52-bit mantissa which is sufficient for about 16 decimal digits

5692467
int	double
if your numbers have 20 decimal digits then any attempt to squeeze such numbers into a double will result in rounding effectively turning your numbers into int

5692467
int	double
if you are referring to 64-bit long long datatype then it automatically means that your numbers are so large that they ll never have any fractional part when represented by a typical double type they will always be int if represented by double values

5692473
int	chars
malloc returns a void and the void is casted implicitly to any pointer int chars ...

5692480
lisp	scheme
in scheme you would use a tail recursive function in common lisp mostly not

... otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

5692907
children	parent
if you need more complicated feedback from a child process you can create a temporary file using mktemp in the parent and get the child processes to save their output to that so that you can process the output in the parent once the children complete

5692963
onresume	onpause
combine onpause and onresume to save and load your checkbox value

5692965

5693092
updatepanel	contentplaceholder
i just want the master to refresh the content located in the contentplaceholder asynchronously that s why i added the ajax updatepanel

5693131
hide	show
now you must give a selector class to each element you want to show hide

5693138
codeigniter	kohana
kohana seems to be an often recommended option my question is how exactly is kohana different from codeigniter

5693157
inherited	subclassing
you really can t mock a class that is under test which is one of the many drawbacks with object inherited subclassing

5693183
firefox	safari
so i m only considering latest firefox safari ie9 and mobile safari and android browser do i need to keep this

5693201
qdialog	qwidget
3 gotocelldialog class is inhereted from qdialog class which has a constructor qdialog qwidget parent 0

5693201
qdialog	qwidget
but in this case you will miss the opportunity of making crteated gotocelldialog object some other widget s child window on construction phase because qdialog base object will use default value for qwidget parent parameter in it s ctor which is 0 see the item 1

5693204
public	protected
if your d inherits from a class c it does not matter if public private or protected d gets the complete interface

5693204
public	protected
and there is not really a difference between public and protected members as far as accessibility to descendants is concerned

5693204
public	protected
y tells you what descendants of c get private nothing protected complete interface public complete interface

5693204
public	protected
to access a s interface in d x and y have to be permissive either protected or public

5693322
children	parent
crossover with a crossover probability cross over the parent to form a new offspring children

5693322
crossover	mutation
after a crossover is performed mutation takes place

5693322

the mutation depends on the encoding as well as the crossover

5693352
nexus	artifactory
the best solution here is to install a repository nexus or artifactory

5693360
hash	md5
a python md5 hash is different than the one created by the md5sum command on the shell

ubuntu	linux
i m running 64-bit ubuntu linux with dmdv2.052 trying to get application working with dsfml2 but i keep running into linker errors

5693478
int	double
double has a greater value range than int

5693478
int	double
that standard says that double has a 52-bit mantissa which means it can represent any int up to 52 bits long without loss of precision

5693480
int	double
because double can contain larger numbers than int or long

5693480
int	double
same reason there s no implicit cast from double to int

5693500
floating-point	integer
you seem to be assuming that the purpose of math.ceiling is to cast a floating-point value to an integer but that s usually not how it s used

5693507
hide	show
1- a form contains the fields text and headline on a panel to show and hide .the default to this panel is visible false .and a button to save changes

5693507
hide	show
2- a panel contains a gridview the grid view bind on your table but take care to use a template field to put the check box and bind the checked property to the flag field.add a template field and add a link button to edit the row.when you clicked the link then you hide this panel and show the above panel to edit the data

5693569
awt	swing
actually you can use every java library in groovy like awt or swing

5693616

children	parent
basically in as3 we have a proper display list where we access children and parent through specific methods used to traverse the display list

5694018
google-chrome	firefox
i use jsonview for google-chrome and jsonview in firefox

5694034
post	get
first look at the request in firebug and note all of the variables passed in and whether or not the request is a get or post

5694041
pop-up	dialog
on the poll event i would like to pop-up a print dialog to print a document for a particular order that was generated and stored on server

5694062

ati	nvidia
second i know that simulating physics is highly computation intensive so i would like to use either cuda or opencl.right now i m leaning towards opencl because it would work on both nvidia and ati chipsets.what do you guys suggest

5694298
inherited	properties
this is one global disadvantage for all columns used to support conditional mapping table per hierarchy inherited and independent associations - they can t be exposed as properties

5694336
innodb	myisam
this doesn t happen in myisam tables but with innodb you have the power to prevent it using transactions

5694388
google-chrome	safari
please note this is only tested in google-chrome safari which it looks fine in and mobile safari on the ipad 1st generation which it looks choppy in

5694393
gif	png
should i just convert png into gif

5694402
firefox	safari
it works fine in other browsers including mobile safari but for some reason firefox is having none of it

5694411
jobs	cron
then you could still run the script every minute and then have an email script that looks for the mail table to see if there are pending messages that need to be sent run as a stand alone cron job - thus the work load is completely separated as the jobs should run in parallel

5694498
nsstring	nsdata
retrieve the content of file based on requirement nsstring nsdata nsmutablearray etc

5694514
printf	getchar
it works because all the functions used in the code - scanf printf getchar - are declared in stdio.h

5694516
sorting	filtering
let s say i have a div that will contain a view from an admin panel perspective of users - there will be a list of users along with options to choose how many to display at a time sorting options what page to be on filtering etc.

5694519
salt	md5
when the user assign a password i will generate a salt which is a ten digit random string and i use md5 with the useractuallypassword and i store the salt and storepassword within store the user actually password is this a good way to do so

5694527
salt	md5
however you should not use md5 and you should use non-ascii salt

5694546
ienumerable	ienumerator
this list has the ienumerator ienumerable interfaces implemented

5694550
hash	salt
you ll still store a hash and a salt and you can pick your own hashing algorithm but you ll take care of dictionary attacks rainbow attacks and a variety of other problems

5694553
hash	md5
and instead of md5 you are better off using either sha256 or bcrypt hash

5694568
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox

5694618
minimum	max
for the generated values to be constrained to 10 digits in length it means the minimum generated value must be larger than 999999999 and since an int has a max value of 2 147 483 647 smaller or equal to that so

5694696
onresume	onpause
isactive is a boolean that keeps track of whether this activity is active - it s set in oncreate and onresume and unset in onpause

5694696
onresume	onpause
i ve been looking into a broadcast intent - i ve seen an example on how to send back such an intent to the main activity but the problem is that the listener has to be registered unregstered in onresume onpause - and asynctask is a separate thread

5694722
public	protected
because if you have public or protected in super class then you cannot have a more restrictive access modifier in the downwards hierarchy

5694774
put	get
if you put a foreach loop running on a separate task you get all the iterations running sequentially but you can run other code in parallel with the entire foreach

5694780
post	get
it s probably the case that when you view the page source it s not sending the post data so you get all the records back

5694803
mongodb	bson
the bson object id s generated by mongodb drivers are highly likely to be unique across collections

5694825
post	get
also to get ride of the whitespace one can collapse everything from for post in site.posts to endfor onto a single line.

5694830
uiview	calayer
specifically i want to know how to use opacity calayer subclasses to replace the backing layer on a uiview

5694840
ienumerable	ienumerator
typically calling getenumerator on an ienumerable will return a new instance of ienumerator for your class but your actual list implementation contains all the state for the enumerator

5694843
int	double
in the example foo should be partially specialized for t int and t double with only one template definition

5694843
int	double
but it should be for t int and t double with only one function definition no code doubling

5694843
int	double
any ideas how to partially specialize this for t int and t double with one template definition

5694855
width	height
setting width and height equal i got ellipses that were about 20 taller than wide

5694952
expression-blend	silverlight
expression-blend on the other hand is the go to tool if you want to do wpf silverlight frontend

5694975
geocoding	geocode
you will see this pattern used a lot in javascript for asynchronous operations - the second argument to geocode is a callback function which gets invoked when the potentially expensive and long-lived geocoding operation finishes

5694975
geocoding	geocode
just like you ve found out in your geocoding example - the call to geocode returns immediately without a result and works in the background invoking the callback function with the actual result sometime later

5694979
post	get
so your connection will be through http protocol via post and get requests

5694992
implements	extends
you also have to extends your main activity class to implements the view.ontouchlistener interface and add the necessary method at the end of your class

5695009
serializable	deserialization
you can actually try to write custom method to detach the whole object graph but as you said it was asked 500 times and i haven t seen working solution yet - except the serializable and deserialization to the new object graph

5695034
flann	surf
i just want to match surf s from a query image to those with an image set by applying flann

additionally you ll probably upgrade your third party libraries to newer versioning so that you don t have to port those yourself

5695081
codeigniter	kohana
i ll be writing about kohana 3.1 and main advantages i ve seen over codeigniter 2 so far

5695081
symfony	kohana	codeigniter	yii	codeigniter	kohana	kohana	yii
before kohana 3.0 year and a half ago i used codeigniter zf symfony cake and tried many others at the moment trying to do yii only because i have to

5695081
codeigniter	kohana
kohana doesn t use any of the old code meaning 2.x or codeigniter s in the current version

5695081
fuelphp	kohana
i ve seen fuelphp which seems to be more like a mashup of ci2 with kohana than a ci2 branch though i have to say it definitely has potential

5695081
memcached	apc
caching library with drivers for most popular caching techniques apc eaccelerator file memcached sqlite wincache and xcache

5695096
width	height
as i can see from the snippet you already pass context in the constructor new targettrainer this width height

5695111
width	margin
the preferred way to do this would be to set the width of the child div and set the left and right margin to auto

5695111
width	text-align
if you are not sure about the width of the child you can also assign text-align center to the parent div

5695115
put	get
this way you don t have to put it in the get string and maintain it for the user although i suppose you could do that as a backup

5695124
versioning	upgrade
you might want to upgrade to the latest versioning of idea laclojure java 6ux and clojure 1.2 should work fine make sure idea knows where to find your clojure jars and which jdk to use sounds like you know how to config a usable idea setup so you re good there and make sure you have bp s only in expressions that can be evaluated

5695139
ati	nvidia
if you want to run your program on both nvidia and ati chipsets then opencl will make the job easier

5695139
ati	nvidia
for example on ati cards you ll want to manually vectorize code using float4 int4 data types or accept a nearly 4x performance penalty while nvidia works better with scalar data types

5695143
post	get
you could call your get handler in your post handler

5695260
google-chrome	firefox
one more thing to note is that i am receiving the same weird behavior in firefox google-chrome and ie

5695311
stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush	stderr	fflush
in this case i would avoid redirecting or testing for values in stdout or stderr since the access to those streams is not threads-safe in a way that output buffer may not be appended and fflush as possibly predicted

5695326
post	get
i get the null response with httpresponse response client.execute post

5695333
width	height
however when content expands beyond the browser window s height or width the sections don t seem to expand like i would want

5695333
width	height
am i right in thinking this stems from the fact that setting something to 100 height or 100 width via css is static

5695333
width	height
whatever the height width of the browser window was when the css was called is saved and that s that

5695383

5695614
folder	directory
the command yiic.php webapp var www vhosts domainname httpdocs appname successfully creates the directory with the corresponding appname in the desired webroot folder

5695614
folder	directory
since the framework folder obviously has the necessary rights to write the demanded files into the webroot i double checked that all the files are created as expected i suspect it must be some sort of issue that comes from the webroot not having the needed access to the overlying framework directory

5695632
children	parent
it seems you cannot access the children classes static members in the parent s static method s code

5695640

5695740
inherited	properties
using inherited overriding the properties so that they have setters

5695764
profiling	debugging
memory profiling exists but inspecting the internals of applications beyond your control may be difficult because usually you need debugging symbols and or instrumenting to let a tool to know when and for what object memory was allocated afaik ms offers checked builds of windows but not office

5695768
superclass	subclassing
when you subclassing a superclass you are specialising the superclass

5695768
superclass	subclassing
when you call the superclass method printx we are asked to echo the value of which has been redefined in our subclassing to be test2 not test

rather than set deleteim to the post variable check its set first as if you dont check it you get no value if its checked you should get checked

5695965
width	height
because the height of the image changes with the width i need to the div of text to move up and down so that it stays over a particular portion of the image

5695969
udp	tcp
on the foundation you have either udp which is unreliable but incurs almost no overhead but very well suited for broadcasts and tcp which is more reliable therefore has more overhead but is easier to use

5695971
folder	directory
each folder in the directory will create a toolstripmenuitem and each files inside that folder will be represented inside the dropdownitems of said menu menu item

5696006
mongodb	bson
i want to store a filesystem tree into mongodb within a ruby application so we are talking about json bson representation of something like

5696053
put	get
i have a problem here to any time i put to this ballontip it ever get to be only 5 seconds

5696075
jar	war
both war and jar are zips

5696075
jar	war
so converting a war to a jar would not be useful because as the war contained a web the converted jar will also contain a web so trying to run it as a program will cause an error

5696078
free	strcpy
the strcpy function forgoes memory management entirely therefore all allocation needs to be done before the function is called and free afterward when necessary

5696078
strcpy	strncpy
strncpy works similarly to strcpy except that it allows you to pass an additional variable describing the size of the buffer so the function will stop copying when it reaches this limit

5696083
pop-up	dialog
i would use jquery ui dialog to handle the pop-up windows and have a form tag within each pop-up that uses its own mvc controller using ajax i prefer the jquery ajax command

5696147
folder	directory
when you rename your package eclipse creates new directory folder to put the package in

5696148
dired	ido-mode
the basic problem here is that while there s a read-file-name-function which ido can attach itself to there s no read-directory-name-function ido-mode has no explicit support for this feature of dired and there s nothing about the read-file-name invocation i could figure out that ido-mode could hook onto

i d imagine that you could put together a solution using ucma 3.0 to build a lync application to control a conference and get access to the video stream then stream that to the silverlight clients using iis live smooth streaming or something similar

5696482
min	max
straightforward solution with plain scala and anonymous lambda without any mappings folds double. min max value and so on

5696516
put	get

5696841
webkit	gecko
as this page points out you can use drawimage to draw the gif on the canvas and at the moment it ll draw the current frame from the gif in gecko and webkit -- but not in opera and also not according to the spec so it s not a good idea to rely on this behavior

5696902

5697246
post	get
post which will never reach that else statement at the bottom so you dont get a httpresponse

5697246
post	put
the other thing that looks strange is even if you fix your indents you show the registerform initially and after the post request you put the data from your registerform into a gradeform if that doesn t validate you show pass your gradeform to your template

5697340
width	height
consider finding the sizes from the parent and calling onresize width height

5697737
jruby	rubinius	ironruby	rubinius

5697740
hide	show
html5 video - show hide controls programmatically

5697750
pull	push

due to the above-mentioned subtleties it is generally a good idea to put an tailrec annotation on methods that you need to be optimized both in order to get a compile error but also as a hint to other developers maintaining your code

5697944
for-loop	loops
the reason that there s lots of waiting at the end of loops is that some of the threads are done well before the others and they all wait at the end of the for-loop for quite a while until everyone s done

5697989
sqldatasource	objectdatasource	sqldatasource	formview	objectdatasource	formview

powerpc	i386
they are built as 32-bit i386 and powerpc using a deployment target of os x 10.3 so they will run on all apple systems shipped that support any version of os x 10.3 through 10.6 and should run on os x 10.7 when released

5698369
powerpc	i386
the most important thing is to build them as universal builds with -arch i386 and -arch powerpc

5698400
lme4	nlme
the r code is at the same place and for longitudinal data it seems to be generally considered wrong these days to just fit ols instead of a components of variance model like in the lme4 package or in nlme which to me seems to have been wildly overtaken by lme4 in popularity recently

5698401
directwrite	direct2d
and there is no telling when other browsers will add sub-pixel rendering to text in the future -- in fact ff4 already uses direct2d but may not be using directwrite
