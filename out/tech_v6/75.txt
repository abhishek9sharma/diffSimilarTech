bundler won t go to rubygems but instead will install all gems from . vendor cache directory

11301078

or run this program by redirecting stderr to stdout

11301117
screens	tablet
at this point you can optimize your application for different screens sizes phones and tablet

11301122
rubygems	bundler
well that s because the gemfile isn t a file from rubygems but a file from bundler

11301132

it should loop this method through all folder found in a directory here is the bash version of this

11301132

i was able to install gnuwin32 coreutils sed and grep so i m able to use all the same tools but the actual process of looping through all folder in a directory isn t working

11301132

informix	firebird	informix	interbase	interbase	firebird	postgresql	informix	postgresql	mysql
oracle db 2 mysql postgresql sybase informix interbase and firebird all use that same standard syntax

11301150
interbase	firebird
as remus rusanu said though it s not strictly required but could help the database manage internal resources better if it knew that the savepoint was no longer necessary it certainly helps on multigenerational architectures like oracle interbase and firebird

11301151
width	height
within that i plan to place a div that stretches to the height and width of the viewport and has black background colour at 50 opacity

11301151

another option could be that on submission some code linked to the submit button onclick or similar reloads to page in the frame or a page of my choice before it s had a chance to load externally - again on correct submission going to the welcome page before having a chance to reload

11301221
width	height
for an alternative to width and height you could use instead position

11301252
width	height
set a width and min- height of 100 on both the html and body tag

11301252
width	height
setting the element as fixed with the 100 width and height you have now is probably better as mentioned in other comments

well the message tells you what to do git pull fetches and merges changes then git push again

11301270

i m creating a ciimage from a uiimage as follows

11301560

comparing someciimage.extent.size.width height with someuiimage.size.width height i find that sometimes the ciimage is double size in dimensions and sometimes its the same size as the uiimage

11301560
ciimage	uiimage
it seems like if the uiimage is slightly larger the ciimage is double the size whereas if the uiimage is slightly smaller this isn t the case

11301560
ciimage	uiimage
this is causing me real trouble as i m trying to draw a ciimage from a loaded uiimage

11301626
scatter	graphing
i have other graphing that use scatter plots without any similar results

11301658
pbkdf2	hash
so taking your erratasec article that benchmarks 430 million sha-1 hash per second on a gpu as a baseline - the agilebits article shows metrics that suggest pbkdf2 with 10k iterations would bring that down to around 100k tests per second

11301721
put	get
i also can t seem to cut on the to try and get rid of the first put of the string no matter how i try to escape the slashes

11301725

shouldn t this only be causing the canvas to span the width and height of the viewable window

11302051
public	protected
this will create public variables - so unless you want them private protected that s the easiest way to achieve what you want

11302129

being a dvcs mercurial would allow off-network developers to work anywhere only having to be on network to deal with server push pull situations

11302195
temp	tmp
you may be running into a permissions error with the windows file system and the sessions not being able to write to the local temp or tmp directory

when user click other icon hide and show in the other

11302231
pop-up	dialog
if you forget to turn on gps satellites it will pop-up a dialog asking something like do you want to turn on gps satellites and or wifi to improve the accuracy of your location

11302231
pop-up	dialog
a dialog pop-up asking whether or not you would like to tweak the settings

11302240
post	get
even if writing to _request is really a bad coding practice and at least one should differentiate between post and get

11302268
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
depending on how you increasing the size of the div width height you can just change the margin of the div to reflect a fraction of the change in size

11302334

11302495
couchbase	couchdb
afaik the way that couchbase works is that if a string that you set or add is the json representation of a valid couchdb document it stores it as a couchdb document otherwise it stores it as an attachment

11302495
couchbase	couchdb
the upcoming version of couchbase 2.0 now in developer preview exposes almost all of the couchdb functionality except for couch apps which are irrelevant if you re using erlang anyways

11302495
atomic	compare-and-swap
so if you want to use that you ll want to pass json of objects over the memcache interface but note that then you lose memcache s atomic shortcuts you d need to do a compare-and-swap which requires an extra network hop

11302514
versioning	upgrade
i think you have to upgrade your jquery library to the newest versioning

it floats all of the content areas next to each other hide the overflow sets page width to say 500 if we have 5 slides and moves the left-margin -100 to show the next slide

inherited	properties
since c is not an object-oriented language gobject provides a c-based object system which includes properties and inherited again built into python already

11302576

11302632
put	get
or maybe is any way of get the actual state of the touchscreen state on this way i can put a timer until it reaches for example 1000ms but only while the touchscreen is touched because inside the ontouch event i can only know the state of the touchscreen when the event ocurred no matter which is the current state

11302987
pipeline	pscmdlet
when implementing a cmdlet or pscmdlet derived command implement idisposable and powershell will dispose your command for you when the pipeline completes

11303005
union	distinct
as blorgbeard commented the distinct clause in your solution is unnecessary because the union operator eliminates duplicate rows

11303005
union	distinct
the distinct clause makes sql server 2005 perform a redundant sort operation because the query optimizer does not know that any duplicates filtered out by the distinct in the first query would be filtered out by the union later anyway

11303009
width	margin
your div is likely already centred although if your css rules are literally just margin auto they re not doing anything until you specify a width on your div

hide	show
if you click the asp checkbox it ll loop through and say ok show sample 1 because it s got asp in it then it ll loop and say show sample 2 because its got asp in it then it ll loop once more and see that sample 3 doesn t have asp in it so it will hide it

11303493

11303626

in your case you could put another for-loop inside your second one and call to get the y th character in but it s more efficient to store in a local variable and index that like so

11303629
for-loop	arrays
trying to iterate with this for-loop and input int from user into arrays

switching	screens
the only other more complicated way i could think of doing this is every time you switching orientation or increase decrease the number find the width of the screens in pixels figure out the width of the word total and the each digit of the number in pixels subtract that from the width and divide that by the number of pixels a dot takes up

11310261
opera	firefox
that makes both firefox and opera respect the max-width rule

11310279

11311439
ssl	https
i think the answer depends on whether you are evaluating providers solely on the basis of providing ssl over the mongo wire protocol choices are likely limited at the moment or if you are fine to use their apis most will support https

11311443
integer	unsigned
you should always do a specific signed unsigned cast before converting to integer from a lower order less bits logic vector

11311444
stdout	stderr
i have some strange behavior redirecting stdout and stderr from s3cmd

11311444
stdout	stderr
this output is if i m not getting it wrong part stdout and part stderr

11311444
stdout	stderr
effectively stderr is redirected but we want both stdout and stderr

11311444
stdout	stderr
in the same way if i try to redirect both streams i get stderr but not the stdout output that i need

put	get
but as i put this in a dataset.xsd query i don t get the same output i cannot put more than one id into noidin parameter because the noid type is integer

11312241
width	height
best option is to get the screen width and height dynamically using simple height and width getting parameters

other option is to do create it for device with highest screen width and height and then handle it mathematically for respective screen size

11312272

11312920
implements	extends
yes an interface can extends multiple interfaces and the implements class should implements all the methods inherited by the implements interface

button	checkbox
i think typical android ui would just use the flick to remove but some like the longpress or a button some use an edit list option which adds a checkbox next to each item on the list and then gives the user an option to delete selected items best for managing large list or batch quantities

11313207
folder	directory
the only think i ve been able to do is to have it copied into the output folder selecting for the copy to output directory option copy always but the file is not parsed by the vsdbcmd so its variables have no value

we could maintain a single document to hold the stats of a channel for a month which would have a single monthly max min 31 daily max mins with 24 hourly max mins for each of the those days

11328356
min	max
using a document for counting using inc is great for in place atomic updates a max and min on the update modifier would solve our problem but that s unfortunately not available

11328356
min	max
we can keep the max and min within the task processors and issues set but that has issues with coordinating those over all of the task processors in the system potentially on different machines so we have decided to keep mongo as the main reference

then in your view code you have logic that says - if the request for this url is a get request then do the work to configure the form otherwise you assume it is a post and then you can handle the response

11328561
post	get
additionally i would advise that the your view explicitly checks that the request is a post and if not make the assumption that it is a get rather than the other way around as you have it this is safer as get and post are not the only request types and you definitely need to know that you are dealing with a post request if you want to deal with variables submitted in the post request

uidatepicker	uipickerview	uitableview	uipickerview
as the uidatepicker or uipickerview don t have the ui_appearance_selector and even you can t change uidatepicker contents appearance as its uicontrol and not having any delegate so it has its native appearance whereas in case of uipickerview you can change its contents appearance similar as in uitableview

using files for cache is not an option either it has the same unaffordable serializable deserialization overhead - use case is a ha server with lots of data used in random human order and low latency needed

11332253
post	get
works as well but should be avoided because what you get out of it depends on php settings and a mixed-mode submission a post form but using query variables in the url is dependent on those settings

11332279
put	get
i say almost unavoidable because you could probably concoct some system which made further virtual method calls on the object passed in to to get the right kind of comparison behaviour but in practical terms another virtual method lookup remember virtual methods also have a runtime performance penalty because the compiler has no idea which implementation will get called so can t put in a concrete function address is probably no faster than the cost of the rtti

11332290
int	double
the ampersand on the other hand literally means the address of and is usually used for primitive data type variables such as int bool double etc in cases where we want the method to modify the variable itself often what it points to as well and return a useable value

11332717
x86	64bit
the actual error arises in this case because libtool would appear to be unable to generate a dynamically loadable module for the x86 64bit architecture from a x86 32 bit static library

11332717
x86	64bit
alternatively the problem is due to libtool on this platform not being able to create a loadable module from a x86 64bit static library in all cases

11333014
portrait	landscape
sounds like you will have to do something where a special viewcontroller gets shown on start that in the loadview or init gets device orientation then sets the views frame appropriately and which based on whatever mode portrait or landscape it is then only returns the allowed orientation from the shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation

11333044
verilog	vhdl
also from my limited sample of job interviews and experience its been pretty evenly divided between vhdl and verilog over most of my career

11333044
verilog	vhdl
my take on it is that vhdl and verilog were pretty even until the mid-2000 s when verilog evolved into system verilog and vhdl stayed fairly static except for minor changes

11333044
verilog	vhdl
it used to be that vhdl had more non-synthesizable language features that aided verification that old-school verilog

11333044
verilog	vhdl
with system verilog vhdl got leap-frogged in that area of strength and never responded with an evolution of its own so i m anecdotally seeing a migration towards sv and away from vhdl

11333373
document.write	window.open
there are also more or less hackish ways to write directly to the new browser window by calling document.write on the handle returned by window.open but i would only do that for simple things that don t require too much user interaction i ve used this approach for a print preview feature

11333376
width	height

int	chars
casting int pointer to chars pointer causes loss of data in c

11333825
width	height
if you set just the width or just the height of an image and leave the other dimension unspecified the browser will scale the image proportionally while maintaining its aspect ratio

11333850
jboss	glassfish
jboss seems to have a pretty easy set of annotations configurations for clustering and load balancing session beans but i m not seeing the same features in the glassfish 3.x docs

11333857
int	chars
you then take a pointer to this int and cast it as a pointer to a chars a single byte

11333905
getter	setter
your question and grammar is a bit ambiguous but it seems to me what you want is custom manual property getter setter

11333928
mocha	node.js
i ve also found a few examples using mocha and phantomjs via node.js including this lib extending grunt to run mocha inside phantom and this script showing how to run mocha inside phantomjs

11333948
udp	rtp	rtp	rtsp
assuming that you are talking about rtp over udp afaik vlc uses live555 libraries for client-side rtsp rtp functionality and live555 has a built in jitter buffer that should take care of re-ordering for you

11333950
hide	show
while designing html interface elements it s a pretty common scenario having doms show hide depending on certain events

11333969
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i am using linux mint 12 based on ubuntu 11.10 and installed clang compiler with the command

11333978
iboutlet	ibaction
1 ibaction - for ui controls just as you ve connected iboutlet in your uiviewcontroller class you can also fire events touch up touch down etc on user interaction

11334007
jar	war
in both cases shrinkwrap and arquillian deploy your in-memory archive jar war ear directly to the configured container via a jboss-homegrown streaming protocol however when tests are run in different modes they have different access to the container depending on the test mode

11334117
inherited	properties
all inherited properties in the realized concrete class will be persisted and retrieved

11334140
curlpp	libcurl
another good choice can be libcurl library which is c library but it has c++ bindings - curlpp

11334159
base	fractions
absence of literally fractions power units of measure does not anyhow discounts f# unit facility as it allows presenting seemingly fractions exponent unit relationships the other way around having smallest fractions as a base dimension

11334162
google-chrome	firefox
below you can see how the same code is displayed differently with firefox and google-chrome

11334162
google-chrome	firefox
how comes google-chrome doesn t care about this but firefox do

11334198
folder	directory
you have to append an asterik see msdn findfirstfile for more information to your directory path szdir in order to enumerate all files and folder in the downloads folder

11334212
width	height
both jpanels the width it prefect but they are not filling to the height

11334220
profiling	debugging
i think fastest way for debugging applications like this is profiling application for specific usecase in this way you can understand which classes used for this scenario and after finding classes you can debugging these classes

11334220
yourkit	jprofiler
commercial yourkit jprofiler jprobe

11334228
put	get
repeating an action that has already been done should result in 200 ok or a redirect etc if the request method is idempotent get head put delete

vbo	vao
i ve been bashing my head on the wall this afternoon persuading my opengles2.0 code to perform correctly when i move from using vbo to vao vbo

11334374
width	height
i was making it twice the height and twice the width of the google map so 4x the screen size total and it seems to really slow things down.

11334396
superclass	subclassing
i could ofcourse have a static animation per subclassing and not use a superclass but that would require a lot of redundant copied code

11334403
pull	push
then just use pure git interface pull push instead of git-svn as if it always were a git repository

11334476
getter	setter
if directly annotating the field property getter setter to be skipped is undesirable another approach is to make use of the jackson mix-in feature

11334486
width	height
that above code is pretty crude and you may want to scale the video better ie find the ratio of the media width vs the stage width media height vs stage height .

11334488
oncreate	onstart
to onstart instead of oncreate

11334549
background-image	background-color
in case of images just replace background-color with background-image url www.example.com myimage.png

11334552
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
last but not least lots of work has been done around serialization and the overhead of serialization i m not speaking about the poor reputation of objectinputstream and objectoutputstream is not that big

11334807
gentoo	linux
the arm device is running gentoo linux

11334901
calloc	malloc
use malloc calloc to allocate a new string as has been suggested

11334916
children	parent
your approach doesn t work because you would need to change the direction of the sidebar s parent box not its children

11334955
put	get
i want to build a screen for user to get his marks on competitions the screen will have may row each row for one competition where have i to put scroll in my layout and how

11334971
post	get
i would like to get numbers of comments for each post using mysql

11334992
free	malloc
both require a local variable on the caller s side but malloc ing it will require an additional call to free the allocated memory and is also more expensive than simply passing a pointer to a local variable

11335007
png	tga
load texture from png tga and pvrtc file

11335018
hide	show
this works fine but it show hide toggles only by clicking the x #close-overlay

using sudo but that would require storing a passwd or having no

11335084
apache	nginx
put an nginx or lighttp server in front of your apache

11335131
post	get
i would say you ll have a bit of magento work on your hands to get your custom post types to work might even be quicker to go for partial integration and code up a wordpress theme to match your magento one

11335171
cos	sin
x cos t x - sin t y

11335171
cos	sin
y sin t x + cos t y

11335187
rss	feed
i m using the following code to read an rss feed and output the results

11335208
min	max
once min and length are calculated thus the max idtag is known chartdata is iteratively initialized

11335214
switching	screens
the problem i am seeing is that if you switching quickly between the master and detail screens several times whilst fresh data is being retrieved parsed and saved the app freezes or crashes completely

11335270
free	malloc
the overhead of using allocate and deallocate is the same as the overhead of using malloc and free in c

11335270
free	malloc
actually most fortran compilers implement de allocate as wrappers around malloc free with some added bookkeeping inherent to all fortran 90 arrays

11335301
glut	glfw	glfw	freeglut
playing around with opengl for a while using the freeglut library i decided that i will use glfw for my next training project instead since i was told that glut was only designed for learning purposes and should not be used professionally

11335336
unsigned	short
gl_unsigned_byte or unsigned short gl_unsigned_short

11335375
memcpy	malloc	free	memcpy	free	malloc
first if you need to duplicate the input data do it dynamically using malloc and memcpy then free it afterwards

11335375
free	malloc
remember that not only write but also malloc and free may modify errno and you must hide those changes from the caller

11335375
udp	mtu	udp	tcp
applications do internal processing and especially when working with sockets flush it at odd sizes multiples of mtu for tcp ip and udp ip in particular

11335409
integer	unsigned
in other words when you re passing integer types like unsigned byte use a normalized value of gl_true and use the full range of that type such as 0 to 255 so a value of 127 would be approximately equivalent to floating point 0.5

11335420
folder	directory
create an empty __init__.py file in the app folder so python treats the directory as a package

11335425
button	checkbox
when i click the button i want to check if all checkbox in the datagridview are checked or not

11335470
hash	salt
if you want to provide even more security store the users register timestamp and use that for a hash salt

11335470
hash	salt
that way the hash salt is more random and your data a bit more secure

11335479
prepare	execute
i m trying to execute a prepare statement using pdo however i keep getting an error despite the fact that similar statements run fine in other files

11335499

11335556
emacs	textmate	vim	textmate	vim	emacs
a lot of people use textmate vim or emacs as well

11335560
hash	salt
from this you can cater your length of salt and number of stretching iterations to whatever you feel is secure enough though i personally like to make sure the hash takes at least 1 2 second to generate on a really beefy server

11335569
width	height
the width and height columns might indeed have to be made nullable in the database because until the transaction is fully complete they can contain null values

11335627
portrait	landscape
if i have 10 screens in landscape then it ll be 20 screens in portrait

11335649
hide	show

tclientdataset	paradox
i just finished rewriting the used-to-be paradox program that runs on the laptops using delphi xe2 professional and tclientdataset briefcase model

11336185
int	double
if you re unsure of what type it will return for a tuple or projection take advantage of the class hierarchy since long int short double float biginteger and bigdecimal all extend the number class

11336192
folder	directory
lastly i turned on invisible files and went looking around my computer and couldn t find a mysql.sock file or mysql folder in any of the above directory

submit	submission
i have a submit button and after the user clicks it i want it to disappear and be replaced with thanks for submission your info

11336731
for-loop	loops
one last point in your query method you return within the for-loop so you ll only execute one iteration of loops rather than iterating over all of database

11336786
accessor	properties
you can also setup accessor for the properties hash store using a proc that dynamically gets the accessor names from the all the criteria field of the categories of the product

11336792
min	max
the min max control what gets outputted

11336824
hide	show
all i want is to click the div and hide the current one and show the next one but the problem is when i click on a p element it hide neither.

11336841

there are hundreds of blog post out there that can easily get you started with running devise

11336901
mousemove	mousedown
found the problem i was using preventdefault in mousemove instead of mousedown

11336907
free	malloc
i have found that dynamic array allocation within tight loops can really slow down the execution of my code with valgrind showing that a large percentage of cycles is taken up by malloc and free

11336907
valgrind	callgrind
it is easy to see this overhead by profiling using valgrind callgrind functionality it may be worth reducing the size of your problem as the profiled execution can be at least 10 times slower

11336913
int	chars
the delimiter second parameter of ignore is of type int to which a chars constant can be converted implicitly

11336926
punctuation	words
this approach lets you search for any punctuation not only spaces between words

11336929

you can use onload onreadystatechange for ie to detect when the script is finished loading

11336930
public	protected
i had the same problem and after spending a lot of time realized that the method was marked as protected and not public

11336944

11336993
pop-up	dialog
the behavior is at about 8 minutes of inactivity a jquery ui dialog pop-up warning the user of their impending timeout

11337026
google-chrome	firefox
i have a jquery plugin supersized 3.2.7 working in google-chrome and firefox but just doesn t work in ie8

11337041
stdout	fflush
i know that i could fix it by adding a fflush stdout after each printing operation in the c++ program

11337059
folder	directory
even though i had this file in my own directory outside of the c python26 folder it was interfering with the code.py that python expects which contains the interactiveinterpreter code.

11337097
post	put
it turns out the post data contained duplicate fields because i didn t put a prefix on the formsets

11337119
int	chars
you can also check whether ascii value of each chars scanned from user input should lie in range 48-57 it will only then be int value

11337122
public	protected
in c# there are private public protected internal protected and internal am i missing one

11337126
profiling	instrumentation
try using the time profiling instrumentation in instrumentation hold option to select parts of the graph where your program is bogging down and examine the call tree

11337150
public	protected
documentation provides more information than private protected public does and a good system will have documentation anyway

11337217
uiview	calayer
previously we use a uiview with its drawrect implemented for each riser and later i decided to use calayer without implementing its drawlayerincontext for each of them for animation

11337230
public	protected
nobody should depend on your internal and private implementation they should only depend on your public or protected implementation

11337230
public	protected
also a clear distinction between public private and protected are extremely useful with inheritance in defining what you expect to be overridable and what shouldn t

11337234
width	height
width and height restriction have been removed

11337244
put	get
alternatively you may want to put the script tags in the head to get the javascript files earlier in the fetching order before images audio or video files specified in the body for example

11337260
maven-javadoc-plugin	pom.xml
maven-javadoc-plugin doesn t attach to any phase goal by default you need configure it manually in pom.xml

11337329
oncreate	setcontentview
however if you desire you can customize the screen layout by setting your own view layout with setcontentview in oncreate

11337335
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome ie9 and firefox

11337339
apache	nginx
if you want to have an even more lightweight system consider nginx as an alternative to apache

11337402
express	node.js
it all works as expected but being new to express and node.js in general i was just curious if attaching properties onto the response object is ok or is there something wrong with doing it that i m simply overlooking

11337452
put	get
1 have your action implement the sessionaware interface and write some code to manually get and put the data from into the session map

11337480
gauge	progress
as shown in how to use progress bars you can specify indeterminate mode until you either have enough data to gauge progress or the download concludes

11337497
centos	linux
i have an old mfc based c++ project that i am trying to compile with g++ in eclipse on linux centos 6.2

11337613
sqldatasource	detailsview
i used a sqldatasource and was binding the data to a detailsview

11337712
post	get
as you download the post just keep track of which tags you get

11337712
post	get
it s kind of unfortunate you have to download the body of the post just to get the tag list but i don t see any other method that gives you the tags or a option to supress the body and just see the meta-data for post

11337712
post	get

11351461

set	bag
edit - if you insist on a substring approach this is possible but more long-winded because without the ability to generate a node set which is what exslt s split does and therefore apply templates on that node set the only trick you have in your bag is recursion - one template calling itself for as many times as a space features in it

11352215

11353215
int	chars	post	get
the good side is that you have not to add and then remove alphabetic chars from id like someone suggested don t remember if in this or other post with similar question you could easily trim it but most of the times the space is just ignored and if you post or get those to another file they will simply see the int value not the space

11353230
client-side	server-side
but for anyone looking to do this client-side on the web rather than server-side with node beware that is not standard.

the good side is that you have not to add and then remove alphabetic chars from id like someone suggested don t remember if in this or other post with similar question you could easily trim it but most of the times the space is just ignored and if you post or get those to another file they will simply see the int value not the space

slideup	slidedown
ok so i am trying to recreate the slideup and slidedown functionality in jquery but when a flexbox is used for its display

lodash	underscore.js
the difference method in underscore.js or its drop-in replacement lodash can do this too

11353536

put	get
when using get i cannot put stuff in the body

11353540

my question is a bit complex i have a managed bean possibly a session scoped one now in this bean i retrieve information stored in a database about some elements their width their height their x y coordinates..etc but these elements number are dynamically stored meaning they don t have a certain number and the other thing is they also might have another element nested inside

11353634
maven	pom.xml
change your maven pom.xml to enforce java 6 or 7

11353651

it may appear wasteful as testing for equality will compare each pair that are not on the diagonal twice but this is done at the c level so will be much faster than using explicit loops and doing the minimum number of comparisons

11353654
getter	setter
i want to use core data support for restkit but when i change synthesize to dynamic i ve lost all getter and setter and i use them across all my app in almost every model

here s an example using properties for x since it s just an attribute and an array proxy accessor for y

11354489
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
i haven t used caliburn.micro but it sounds a bit odd that your viewmodel inherits from screen

11354489
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
a quick google search suggests that in caliburn.micro the viewmodel implements the iscreen interface as opposed to inheriting from screen

11354872
put	get
the problem is i am trying to get linearlayout from the parent class so that i can add my stuff in it but for some reason it returns null the reason i have linearlyout in the settingsactivity class is because i want to put some ads etc at the top of preferences and without putting ad specific code in the library project

i have a content div position relative between the header and footer and when i set a margin around the div my absolutely positioned header and footer move from their top bottom positions by the height of that margin this also happened when i tried setting a margin above and below the paragraphs in the div

11354955

multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
any time you want to deal with these kind of alu items be it add subtract multiplying etc start with 2 or 3 bit numbers much easier to get a handle on than 32 or 64 bit numbers

11355057
subtract	add
normally these are computed on every alu operation for the non-mips type processors you will see signed and unsigned overflow being computed for add and subtract

11355057
subtract	add
if i wanted to subtract 3 - 2 using twos complement what actually happens is that is the same as +3 + -2 right and to get from +2 to to -2 we invert and add one

11355057
subtract	add
i used some twos complement tricks to perform an unsigned operation because here again no matter whether i interpret the operands as signed or unsigned the same rules apply for if add or if subtract

11355057
subtract	addition	subtract	add
it has to do with cascading operations taking say a 32 bit addition logic and using the carry flag and an add with carry or subtract with borrow instruction creating a 64 bit add or subtract or any multiple of the base register size

to crop you could try using an outer with overflow hidden and the resulting set width and height have the image within it then use margins to crop

11355423
margin	height
the margin value would be the difference of the original height and the cropped height so in your case 20px

11355423
width	height
if you don t know the height width of the image try this fork of praveen s solution

11355429
memcached	apc
if you have access to memcached or apc on your webhost some shared plans disable this functionality look them up as they are considered fairly high-performance forms of caching as it utilizes the system memory directly memcached is more suited for distributed systems

11355437
width	height
height the second time not width

11355459
margin	height
if you don t know the height of the image and you need to cut the image then you can use the negative margin and overflow hidden left is the image as is and the right one is cropped one

and look at the relational database mysql and vfabric postgresql you can see how auto-reconfiguration works

11355904
uiview	subviews	uilabel	uibutton

11357302
onclick	onchange
remove onclick and make it onchange

use jquery or similar to hide all and show the relevant table based on clicking in the summary table

11358605
put	get
also always put your session_start to the top of a script before every other output or your script will not work you ll get the headers already sent warning

11358655
getter	setter
the errors are from compile time and they state that the conversion cast cannot be performed for both getter and setter cannot convert from b to a and from b to a .

11358677
udp	tcp
if you want to make sure that you will receive all send packets you should use tcp protocol instead of udp

11358682
width	height
i need to do this using jquery and i won t necessarily know the values of height and width

11358684
opera	firefox
on firefox and opera on linux it is working all right but maybe you try this

11358707
versioning	upgrade
i have a very simple service that has always worked earlier but now i upgrade it to newer .net versioning and it has stopped working with error message like this

11358720
coalesce	isnull
i m using coalesce instead of isnull because it is more portable

11358754
width	height
to swap width and height

11358785
post	get
my best suggestion for you is to post on the wordpress stackexchange where you may get someone who has done this configuration before

11358822
children	parent
then with the parent element found i need all the children of those elements

11358854
hash	md5
i use md5 function to generate a hash value of it and then i save the encrypted data into the database

11358887
min	max
considering only the min max slopes doesn t tell anything about the whole curve

11358925
aggregate-functions	sum
i am wondering why the below query is not retrieving the difference between two aggregate-functions sum properly

11358951
redmine	trac	redmine	bugzilla	trac	bugzilla
when i then open the task respository view and try to add new task repository it does not give me an option for redmine connector only bugzilla and trac

11359006
min	max
as you aren t using the max function like in your second query you need to call the min function before the time_to_sec

11359015
salt	md5
another point to keep in mind while using md5 is to use a salt value

11359015
salt	md5
md5 is susceptible to brute force attack if no salt is used

11359015
salt	md5
using a salt means adding a arbitary string to the user entered value before calculating the md5 and saving to database

11359015
salt	md5
for example if the value entered by user is abc and your salt value is 12345 you will calculate md5 for abc12345

11359074
pull	push
i ended up using a gui tool sourcetree a good and easy to use tool to pull push your code from local git to remote git repository

i opened 2 browsers a firefox and a google-chrome

11359240

udp	tcp
use tcp udp socket connection can be the quickest solution

11359295
put	get
when i put limit to 1 million records i get this error

11359347
unsigned	short
if you later needed to handle another type unsigned short you might need to either

the data would be static and the user would have the liberty to choose to hide or show the data after choosing from the dropdown

11359363
google-chrome	firefox
so take a look at www.qualificationcheck.com under both google-chrome and firefox

11359363
google-chrome	firefox
using google-chrome dev tools and then firebug in firefox i can see that in google-chrome margin-top ends up being -33px while in firefox it ends up being -87px

11359384
ssl	https
the problem in my case was the the connection pooling between reverse proxy and backend server was not taking place because of the backend server apache closing the ssl connection at the end of each https request

11359402
google-chrome	firefox
i personally strongly prefer google-chrome s developer tools over firefox firebug but regardless which one you choose learn how to use the debugger

11359576
erlang	scheme
if you want to implement a round-robin scheme in erlang the easiest way is to have a single point of entry and then let it forward the requests out to multiple nodes

11359596
jasmine	mocha
otherwise i recommend you take a look at jasmine or mocha

11359596
jasmine	mocha
while i prefer mocha my experience with jasmine has generally been better for in-browser development thanks to the awesome jasmine-jquery plugin

11359597
hash	md5
and a small helping method to get md5 hash needed for the login

11359601

macvim	textmate
i have just made the switch from textmate to macvim and so far i am loving it

11359667

11359766
ubuntu	linux
it is packaged for linux distros at least for ubuntu and the website claims it also runs on macos x and windows i haven t tried

11359769
versioning	upgrade
i suspect the upgrade to a new .net versioning is either a red herring or is only indirectly causing the problem for example you might be getting exceptions that you weren t getting before and your code might be failing to dispose close connections properly when an exception is thrown

11359790

hash	salt
if i limit to a base64 string then essentially i always have to use a hash as a salt is this the recommended way

11359916
children	parent
parent know all about their children but children know nothing about their parent

11359916
children	parent
in this case i would still try to work with the children known nothing about their parent mindset

11359916
children	parent
think where the parent page is the mediator between your children the wikipedia page is good

11359916
children	parent
but your children still need to know something about the parent right because they are doing complex ui interactions

11359916
children	parent
each child depends not on the parent but on an interface that defines exactly what the children need access to

11359917
opera	firefox
sometimes some animations make user s computer slow on opera and firefox so i need a snippet that can help user cancel all css js based animations in my web app

11359918

opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the problem never occurs with firefox nor google-chrome nor opera

11360330
opera	google-chrome
with ffox google-chrome or opera my server indeed receives a single request from the browser

11360346
folder	directory
while the above code will work only if you follow android rule which doesn t allow sub directory in drawable folder so the above code will work only when directly accessing images from drawable

11360357

11360490
mocha	sinon
personally i have been enjoying using mocha + chai + sinon as my stack

11360519

since you are not catching exceptions but i guess that what you are doing wrong .in pdo your bindvalue or bindparam variable should be equal to used in query

11360573
post	get
how can i get the post parameters in my symfony2 controller when i use the jquery and serialize functions

11360599

i ve found some post on here that say indicate i need to do a self join but i cannot get it to return the same amount of records but with the title it returns many more

11360628
acaccount	slrequest
if you really want to preselect an acaccount beforehand you need to use a lower level api namely twrequest slrequest in ios 6 and create the ui yourself

11360638
email	dkim
if not is there a way to use dkim signing for a case other thatn sending through page email

following methodes can be used to get height and width of screen

11360692
accessor	properties
and you can have a collection of accessor if you need to access several properties dynamically

expandablelistview	spinner
i have a expandablelistview with my own adapter in the childs i have spinner edittext etc

11360886

11361035
rss	feed
i don t get any errors but nothing happens the text box which i want the rss feed to be displayed is empty

your updatetext function can be changed to this to get the value from your controller and put the resulting text in the text area

11361117
xpc	nsfilehandle
i m not 100 sure but i think apple recommends passing an nsfilehandle to the xpc process in this case

11361163
button	checkbox
user can delete any data using checkbox and button

11361208
udp	tcp
it becomes obvious that i should use udp and aside from sending coordinate updates frequently i should also implement kind of semi-reliable protocol afaik tcp induces packet loss in udp so we should avoid mixing these two to handle such events like chat messages or gunshots where packet loss may be crucial

11361331
maven	pom.xml
may be i need to write something in pom.xml to instruct maven to download sources

11361337
int	double
i would treat all parameter as an int or double even if there is only two possible values use 0 and 1 instead of true and false

11361477
children	parent
the looping is simple because the parent node is link to the children nodes by a link object

11361477
children	parent
all i have to do is call the parent node s draw method and all its children nodes are also redrawn

11361507
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
java.util.calendar 5 java.util.date java.sql.time

11361601
unix	bsd
you re going to have to learn a bit about bsd unix linux input output to pull this off replace your call to scanf with a non-blocking function you write to acquire input from the user s keyboard

11361673
width	height
unfortunately since this is a mobile app i can t work with absolute sizes at all as i need this app to work on a variety of platforms and resolutions thus all groups have relative sizes assigned usually 100 for both width and height

11361727
width	height
you can use left top width and height to position controls just as effectively

11361754
mouseleave	mouseenter
works for me although it fires twice since .hover with a single argument calls it upon mouseenter and mouseleave

11361759
httprequest	httpresponse
i decided to circumvent the libraries and went directly at the google rest api with native httprequest and httpresponse objects

11361761
jlist	jtree
but looking through the jtree there is no method to get the index of the chosen like in the jlist i have searched online and have had no luck with finding a solution

11361767
folder	directory
moreover if you need to access the appdata directory for the roaming user you can get the folder path without hard-coding anything do not forget that users directory isn t always c users on every windows version and path for appdata may vary too

11361810
put	get
the difference now must be in the requests - the get formed by chrome is fine the put formed by my test client json must be tripping it up

11361822
google-chrome	safari
however safari does not use tcp http as a transport layer thus making it incompatible with google-chrome

11361854
button	checkbox
when the user clicks the button he she will go to the second activity which has 4 checkbox corresponding to hobbies

11361854
button	checkbox
my problem is that when the user sets the hobbies using the button again but already has hobbies showing in the textview the checkbox in the second activity should be initialized according to what is shown in the textview

11361865
nexus	artifactory
if you have your own maven repository such as nexus artifactory etc you can use it as well

11361882
httprequest	httpresponse
i had a similar problem and solved mine by hand-coding the httprequest and httpresponse handling

11361920

11362030
width	height
changing height width or re-position changing top right

11362035
m2e	pom.xml
if you move the original sources to a different folder tools like m2e will prevent you from editing them in say eclipse because they read your pom.xml to determine the paths

11362043
children	parent
to div will make all the absolute positioned children to take position according to parent div

11362053
width	height
bottom-right coordinates however are more murky because they also involve the height and width as previously noted

11362053
width	height
the top-left coordinates are set to 10 10 the height is 10 the width is 10 and the bottom-right coordinates are 25 25

11362053
width	height
scenario 2 - rather than calculating the bottom-right coordinates the height and width are calculated

11362053
width	height
by limiting the programmer to top-left and height width the above scenarios will never occur saving processing time and accidental errors

11362104
min	max
test some or all values against some criteria min or max length min or man number value regular expression etc

11362146
button	checkbox
how to use button checkbox and radio button

11362210
jwindow	jdialog
use jframe jwindow jdialog frame window tried every window model i could without any luck

11362215
width	height
i believe they have made bottom and right read-only not because it is technically necessary but as a way of documenting that it is these properties that get re-computed when top height or left width are modified

11362215
width	height
there are two property sets one for absolute coordinates top bottom left right and one for dimension height width

11362234
atomic	lockless
if you still insist on giving a lockless implementation a try maybe out of academic interest you will need an atomic compare-exchange operation look up legacy __sync functions in the gcc documentation for c for c++ you would use the new atomic ops

11362234
atomic	lockless
alternatively a lockless queue can be implemented with only atomic add or without any atomic operations at all see fast forward queue if you re interested just for curiosity if you make some assumptions

11362246
innodb	myisam
note two of these tables are myisam table for full-text search reason and other one is innodb table

11362270
stdout	stderr
the redirects stderr to stdout and is required because as you said the lines are written to stderr not stdout

11362270
stdout	stderr
that is redirect stdout to your diff file redirect stderr to some file

11362316
hide	show
the animated events hidden and show need it otherwise you can use the static events hide and show they don t wait to the transition to be over to be launch

11362318
opera	safari
ios safari opera mobile android browser

11362395
int	double
you have a small bug in your code you are writing double and reading int

11362395
int	double
the database has 3 rows and every time i run the program one more is added the 0 values are because you are reading int from a double value and random returns a value between 0 and 1

11362409
maven	pom.xml
while checking the relevant file contents to paste here as asked i realized that my web.xml is empty as it should be according to liferay tutorials but a maven plugin generates pluto-specific invoker definitions into it as defined in my pom.xml

hide	show
and i don t want click show hide to show the content

11362475

11362553
children	parent
for the second part you have to get a handle on the treeviewmodel.nodeinfo instance or if you used a treeviewmodel.defaultnodeinfo on its abstractdataprovider for the parent of the highlighted node so that you can trigger a redraw of the children list where the highlighted item is

11362592
inherited	subclassing
when a model is abstract it is not created with syncdb Ã¢ only when you subclassing it in which case only the subclassing model is created in the database containing all its own fields and the ones it inherited from its parent class the abstract-class

instead of directly using the state function you should use the more polymorphic get and put functions so that you can give them the more exciting types

11363115
setinterval	clearinterval
i have been experimenting a lot with setinterval and clearinterval recently for creating my own custom effects and one of the things that i have been working on is an efficient way to clear an interval whilst staying out of the global scope

11363115
for-loop	loops
also i know that this example is kind of silly since i could easily use a for-loop or a .each but it s just an example - i do have instances where i do not want to use a loops

11363147
put	get
then put one back in to get it back and then use this hopefully less arduous query and explain and see if i could get a usful index in or restate the query to use a more useful index

11363181
spaces	delimiter
is it something to do with the delimiter being a spaces

11363183

11363384
versioning	upgrade
note that i also upgrade jquery ui because of jsfiddle to jquery ui 1.8.18 but the problems lie in the versioning of jquery you are using

11363405
getter	setter
depends on the case when you define the fields an underscore character is used and if you just need a simple getter setter there is no need to define the fields yourself because the compiler will define them for you in the background

11363442
button	checkbox
examples include the value property of input elements the disabled property of inputs and button or the checked property of a checkbox

int	double
you can still achieve decent precision by simply shifting your units ie use 1026 as int instead of 1.026 as double or float

11363514
google-chrome	firefox
if that works as expected on your server then i would use a browser developer tool f12 -ie google-chrome firefox to see if there are any errors are present which would prevent the page from loading correctly and resolve those and you should be fine

11363553
width	margin
the workaround hijacks the width property binding with some events textchanged and unloading for cleanup of the events using an ivalueconverter to set the margin

11363621
class-method	delegation
i was incorporating delegation calls within the custom class for textdidbeginediting and textdidendediting in order to maintain the placeholder text when the user tabs out of the field but i wasn t calling the respective super class-method as well

from some posts on the internet on launchpad it seems that some parts of the bionic libc in particular stdio are not thread safe either at least in some android releases we still target pre-3.0

11363743
bionic	libc
edit updating with my current understanding the bionic libc is supposed to be thread safe entirely and the issue shown above is an isolated bug that will not happen in most situations like many mt bugs

free	malloc
malloc error for object 0x102302f20 pointer being free was not allocated

11363998
google-chrome	firefox
xpe is simply componentized xp so as long as the browser you want will run on xp google-chrome says it supports xp i imagine firefox does too though i didn t check that then it s possible to make it run on xpe

11363998
google-chrome	firefox
since xpe is componentized you have to ensure that all of the os components that google-chrome firefox etc use are in the os you build

tcp ip or even udp

getter	setter
note that you can make change protection-level on the setter and getter individually

11364222
google-chrome	safari
the one used by google-chrome and is slower than mobile safari s nitro javascript engine

11364235
min	max
now if i want to get a count in a ideal case when all the p1 p2 and p3 have dumped cache in g1 i would say get me max id from g1 where p1 1 and similarly min id from g1 where p1 1

11364235

whuch means i may be wrong at least one digit at least one lowercase at least one uppercase at least one of the special chars listed with a minimum total length of 8 and a max of 20.

11364371
inherited	subclassing
since some deep copies don t make logical sense to do on objects there can be no generalized solution to doing deep copies therefore if you create an object at the highest level in your inherited tree this object will actually be the same instance of that object for every subclassing

11364468
google-chrome	firefox
test s done with firefox and google-chrome work fine with the exception that the file uploads even though they don t generate an error the files don t actually get uploaded

11364502

i have never tried it but i believe if you make your java class implements groovyobject or extends groovyobjectsupport you should be able to add a metaclass and this sort of dynamic property creation to your java class.

11364534
for-loop	loops
so when you do it will try reading a line into this is a bit weird actually you almost never use a for-loop with a list member as an index but apparently you can do that see that there s no line to read and never executes what s inside loops

11364594
width	height
we have one android application and then the width and height as the wrap_content

am i achieving my goal of getting the snapshot variable inside of my arrays and is my for-loop correctly managing to delete all but the 6 newest

11365119

for example if you use a read-only function on ss in the for-loop but don t declare the ss-parameter as const the compiler can not even know that ss is not changed in loops and has to calculate strlen ss in every iteration

11365125
ant	maven
not in maven or ant

11365902
arrayiterator	arrayobject
i am trying to understand something about arrayobject and arrayiterator classes

11365902
implements	extends
since iteratoraggregate extends traversable itself why does arrayobject implements both when it can just implements iteratoraggregate

11365902
implements	extends
arrayiterator as above this class implements both iterator and traversable which iterator extends

11365902
implements	extends
why do these classes implements two interfaces when they could get away with implements the one that extends traversable

11365930
copying	overwrite
if you really need to do this by using two tables and copying rows then you need an insert into query and not select into as already mentioned by remou in the comments because select into creates a new table or overwrite an existing one with the same name if already there

rss	feed
the app is a new video app where you can get an rss feed in screen1 and videos in screen2.

11365945

i believe if your app targets x86 specifically you must install the 32-bit oracle client package regardless of the underlying os platform you still would need the 32-bit oracle client for a 32-bit app even if you were using a 64bit version of windows

11367994
x86	64bit
check your platform target setting in your assembly that calls the oracle provider x64 will always try to run as 64bit x86 will always try to run as 32-bit and any platform will jit compile to the target os architecture at runtime 32-bit on an x86 system and 64bit on a x64 system

you shouldn t use md5 hash for that reason anymore

11369017

11369304
multiplying	modulo
if you have the choice modulo is probably more convenient basically you take your matrix modulo a number m after each power or multiplying and the individual entries of the matrix will never grow beyond m - 1 2 but obviously the result will be an algorithm for modular exponentiation thus different from what you have now

11369304
exponent	modulo
so for an unsigned long you can have a modulo up to 65535 or so and an unlimited exponent

11369304
exponent	modulo
remember that such modular exponentiations will eventually enter a cycle anyway as the exponent increases how big the cycle is depends on the matrix and on the properties of the modulo

11369304
multiplying	modulo
the code would look something like this not tested and not particularly elegant pretty much just insert matrix modulo s after each multiplying

multiplication	modulo
just for future reference if you are required to do multiplication with large numbers not applicable in this situation since the answer is taken modulo 1000000007 you should look into the karatsuba algorithm

11381595

11381662
getter	setter
the bonus you get out of using getter and setter is that you can do extra stuff that might be required when retrieving the member

11381665
int	double
i think i found the answer and i also managed to make it so that i can use the arrays with any type int float double or even other classes

11381745
pthreads	fork
the other option again for pthreads only is to fork a new process whose job will be to write the string to a pipe while you fdopen the other end to obtain a for your function

11381805

11381823
prepare	execute
is using prepare and execute like

but i asked some friends of mine what i should do just use a already existing cms like joomla or wordpress or write my own

11382274
wordpress	joomla
on the other hand when using joomla or wordpress you need to learn existing system and you spend more time on the learning side of the things

11382291
wordpress	joomla
drupal wordpress and joomla all have great communities so you will almost surely get

11382317

11383434
post	put
of course there is nothing preventing you from maintaining huge directory structure creating new files and directories on post put

11383439

if you re using myisam or innodb engines with mysql you can use some of the built in full-text search functions

11388791
innodb	myisam
definitely have a read about these and you ll probably need to do a little work with your db to find out if it s running myisam or innodb and possibly a little bit of configuration

11388841
merb	ruby-on-rails
ruby-on-rails 3 is basically a hybrid between merb and ruby-on-rails 2 - a ton of stuff changed . fix all that newly broken stuff

getter	setter
it seems to me most of you are giving example of getter and setter not a constructor ie

11389042
awt	swing
swing programs should override paintcomponent instead of overriding paint . Ã¢ painting in awt and swing the paint methods

11389064
folder	directory
so if you need them to be included in the same folder i recommend you rename the xml files to .xml.txt so they will be deployed with the rest of the application instead of to the data directory and then have your add-in rename them when it starts up

11389118
hide	show
that way you can use javascript preferably through a library like jquery which i ve chosen for my code below to hide or show more of your solution without having to make a second database request using ajax

11389125
implements	extends
i would suggest implements it as a subclass that extends countdowntimer such as

11389137
inherited	subclassing
however unlike class inherited using is-a relationship to define what should be a subclassing i m not sure how to use an interface

11389137
abstract-class	superclass
a verybadvampire is-a vampire so my understanding is that a vampire should be a superclass maybe abstract-class

11389137
implements	extends
if we wish to create a new monster called bigrat which is dangerous but not lethal then we can create a bigrat class which extends monster and implements dangerous

11389137
implements	extends
vampire class extends monster implements dangerous lethal bloodsuckable

11389137
implements	extends
chupacabra class extends monster implements bloodsuckable

rather build my implementation to come up with the proper salt hash values then build my tests against those values to prevent regression

11389238
put	get
the problem is when i load metadata of small wcf servcie e.g having only 1 or 2 methods the code works fine for me but as i try to load the metadata of large wcf service having about 70 to 80 methods i get an error of maximum message size 65536 has been exceeded for one of the end points...though i have put all my size variable in wcf config to it s maximum....i dont have anything on my client side web.config file...i am getting all the bindings at run time...can any one help on this

11389253
hash	salt
2 storing the salt and the rounds in the resulting hash is indeed intentional

11389253
crypt	hash
3 you don t need to extract the parameters from the hash to test against it that does the php function crypt for you

11389253
crypt	hash
just pass the existing hash as new crypt parameter

11389285
serializable	deserialization
i could rewrite the serializable and deserialization of a map string unite but that would be a lot of useless code just because i dont understand how lift-json works enough

11389608
width	height
width height 100

11389705

11390217
implements	extends
public class mygenericserviceimpl extends remoteserviceservlet implements mygenericservice

11390225
put	get
you can put the jar in ant s own lib directory instead and then you don t need the classpath but using an explicit classpath element as above means your build file will work with a standard unmodified ant installation so it s a good habit to get into particularly if you are going to be collaborating with other developers

11390263
post	get
post fields do not show up in your url only get s

11390285
spaces	linefeed

11390363
innodb	myisam
out of experience i m involved to a project that uses huge amount of data using mysql and we mostly prefer myisam for data that can be generated it allows to achieve much higher performance losing transactions but generally speaking myisam is faster but innodb is more reliable

11390363
innodb	myisam
if you change the create_table_query innodb to myisam you d see significant performance increase

i have investigated so many similar post on the site about this title upload image to mysql using php but did not get my answer

11390562
integer	unsigned
to do your fixed-point literal conversions you could use the integer literal operator with unsigned long long

11390562
floating-point	integer
c++11 in section 2.14.8 user-defined lierals lex.ext within paragraphs 3 and 4 define literal operator variations including a template version for integer and floating-point literals

11390562
floating-point	integer
this means this technique will only work with integer and floating-point literals

11390562
int	chars
notice that template parameter is a chars --not an int or some other number

11390562
int	chars
thus code like digit - 0 is needed to get the numeric value to an int value for that chars

11390613
post	get
in the below code i am trying to post the username and password but not able to create the cookie using post if i do the same with get method it creates the cookie

fastcgi	scgi
i m about to write a fastcgi scgi independent implementations server but i don t have much experience with networked and especially delayed-application programming

11391099

11391241
vsto	add-in
i have created an vsto outlook add-in

11391282
width	height
if you need to use custom graphics anyway use common links each with custom id attribute then just use css to set it s display as block set the width height float to make sure the each button is in the sam line and finally background-image with your buttons

11391284
postgresql	mysql
note if you want to migrate between databases ie postgresql mysql then you would have to use the db pull approach

super	self
instead of super usertravelscarsmanager self .get_query_set .filter.

11391322
uisearchbar	uisegmentedcontrol
because apple s apis lack in customization of uisearchbar s scope bar that is i want to change its frame which to my knowledge is impossible i had to create a scope bar myself using a uisegmentedcontrol inside of a uiview

trigger ndk-build script from your project s jni folder the folder where android.mk is located and your c c++ files and not from the android-ndk directory

ussd	smpp
i need to simulate smpp messages from ussd gateway and ussd application server

11391484
glut	glfw
to actually create a window - be it a normal or fullscreen - you need to use a user interface library like glut or glfw

11391520
width	height
you can just use a nib file add a uiscrollview with fix width and height

11391605
ant	maven
a few months ago we finalized the migration from ant to maven and at that time the goal was to make sure things built properly under maven 2.2.1 as we weren t still willing to move directly to maven 3.0.x

11391605
ant	maven
yeah we knew that maven was relatively stable but due to the effort required in migrating all of the modules and assemblies from ant we chose to stick with a well-known stable version such as 2.2.1

11391633

11391717
folder	directory
i m making use of the hadoop filestatus api to determine whether a folder is empty in order for the directory to be deleted

11391729
hide	show
i have the following js code which show hide buttons had to be done this way and please don t say do it another way

11391756
put	get
and even if you did you should really get it by the key that s returned from the put call rather than doing a query the eventual consistency model means that it s possible for the data not to be fully persisted by the next statement so a query wouldn t see it whereas a direct get by key is always guaranteed to do so

11391763
mysqlconnection	mysqldatareader
so basically my idea is to create every mysqlconnection mysqlcommand and mysqldatareader for every if condition

11391782
post	get
just change your method from get to post and change the routes accordingly

11391784
setinterval	clearinterval
you can implement a timer in javascript using the setinterval and clearinterval methods

11391831
implements	extends
also i don t think it would be possible to extends lengthvalidator while implements which is mandatory for your validator

11391848
google-chrome	safari
issues can be seen in webkit browsers safari google-chrome etc

11391853
int	double
i have a method for retrieving elements from an array and i would like to use the same method for several primitive types int double ...

11391866
post	get
here also i got correct result but when i use following post method without ajax i didn t get expected result

11391896
listview	gridview
this is a excellent example of implementing pull to refresh in listview gridview webview expandable listview

11392102
textmate	sublimetext
the most popular rails text editors at the moment are textmate and sublimetext 2

11392102
vim	emacs
basically you can use any text editor since you do not need to compile anything even emacs or vim will work if you like

11392163
listview	gridview
how could one accomplish behavior in which a header of a listview or gridview group doesn t scroll with the content but stays fixed until the content comes to an end and the following header then comes in focus

11392263
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
hard to tell from the code you posted but you probably want to set the image on the tabbaritem of the uinavigationcontroller navcontroller2 since it looks like that is what you directly add to you uitabbarcontroller

11392277
min	max
you can remove min and max and group by if second can t have many rows with same first_id

11392309
folder	directory
i have run the . manage.py collectstatic command which populated the static directory in the myproject folder

11392320
for-loop	arrays
is an arrays of 1-49 filled with their respective index numbers then it is run through this for-loop and filled with random numbers

11392322
onclick	onchange
i tried using onchange and onclick event but it doesn t work

11392356
hide	show
what it does is it show an image when ajax call starts and hide it when it completes

11392396
opera	firefox
firefox opera and ie9 all do not raise the click event with middle mouse click

11392396
mouseup	mousedown
they do raise mouseup and mousedown

11392460
getter	setter
to create getter and setter methods select the field s declaration and invoke source - generate getter and setter

11392460
getter	setter
another way to create getter and setter is using content assist

11392460
getter	setter
set the cursor in the type body between members and press ctrl+space to get the proposals that create a getter or setter method stub

11392527
realloc	malloc
use malloc the first time and then realloc as needed

11392588
keydown	keyup
on most browsers you ll get keydown and keyup events for capslock try it here just focus the page and press a key

11392588
keydown	keyup
keydown doesn t seem to repeat for capslock the way it does for others but you can watch for keydown and assume it s down until you see keyup

11392608
int	double
i think it is because of the math.floor method which is supposed to be a double but i did typecast it into int so there will be no problem when passing the parameters

11392645
minimum	max
now i want to select max x from all minimum x for each group

11392677
min	max
get max and min from fields

11392683
int	double
i think it is because of the math.floor method which is supposed to be a double but i did typecast it into int so there will be no problem when passing the parameters

11392691
width	height
how do i extract the width and height of an embedded image in as3 instead of explicitly stating the dimensions

11392764
mdpi	hdpi	tablet	mdpi	tablet	hdpi
however buttons that look good on an mdpi phone look poky on an mdpi tablet and i d rather use the hdpi bitmaps for that application

11392766
min	max
you can use the min and max functions

11392770
hide	show
now there are two possible scenarios in the first you would be loading all the content during the page load - and the tabbed widget will simply serve to hide other sections and show a particular section

11392815
oncreate	setcontentview
if you are extending droidgap no need to do setcontentview in oncreate droidgap will display webview by default

11392835
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in all browsers i ve run the code in ie8 ie9 google-chrome 20 firefox 11 and i want to remove it

11392836
folder	directory
my requirement is that there is a browse button on my ui.when i select a directory and press open then using the selected path a tree structure should appear.the parent root directory will start from the folder that i selected

11392863
multiplying	add
now i want to make changes in the program such that when i write make add or make multiplying or make factorial the corresponding program will compile

11392871
recvfrom	datagram
i do not recommend using this but technically the most efficient way to receive udp datagram would be to just block in recvfrom or wsarecvfrom if you will

11392871
udp	tcp
completion ports are irrespective from using tcp they work just fine with udp too

11392871
udp	tcp
about tcp inducing packet loss on udp this is something that i am inclined to call an urban myth although it is somewhat correct

11392871
udp	tcp
it may have been true once upon a time there exists research on that matter which is however close to a decade old that routers would drop udp in favour of tcp thereby inducing packet loss

11392871
udp	tcp
tcp induces packet loss on tcp and udp induces packet loss on tcp and vice versa this is a normal condition it s how tcp implements congestion control by the way

11392871
udp	tcp
from that everyday observation one can tell for certain that udp is definitively not dropped in favour of tcp

11392871
udp	tcp
if anything qos might favour udp over tcp but it most certainly doesn t penaltize it

11392925
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if you are using java you can use objectinputstream objectoutputstream and not be bothered about serialzation issues

11392934
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
a site i m creating is showing the front page exactly as its supposed to do in both google-chrome and safari but when i test in firefox the menu isn t showed correctly

11392934
firefox	safari
here s a screenshot comparing firefox and safari respectively

11392942
put	get	post	put	post	get
dude the issue in your code for the starters is that you have specified post method for the ajax to call the controller whereas as per your code which you have put shows that the method is available in get method

11392949
getter	setter
the convention for getter method names is simply name so your setter should be setfoo and your getter would be foo

11392953
min	max	minimum	max
then by the groupings of each first group by a.id a.title we can use the min and max aggregate functions on the num column to extract minimum and maximum values per first group

11392953
min	max
in the case that a first_id had all four columns having null s or 0 s the min and max values would show up as null due to using a left join instead of an inner join as i believe this is would be a better behavior for your situation

11392964
mouseover	mouseout
i have a mouseover and mouseout effect but i need a twist if click than keep that box open even though their is a mouseout

11392967
int	chars
we can only see your receive code so we can only guess what you send but lets say for example that you write 4 x 4 byte int to a chars buffer and then send over the socket

11393050
mp4	webm
he plays one video but doesn t want to play the other video in mp4 format and doesn t fallback to webm

11393050
mp4	webm
besides the first video plays normally without using mediaelement.js library in mp4 format and the second one turns into webm format

11393057
uploadify	plupload
you could use existing plugins such as uploadify or plupload which provide this functionality by testing the capabilities of the client browser and falling back progressively

11393064
mouseover	mouseout
for this reason the timeout needs to be accessible to both your mouseover and mouseout handlers as i demonstrate here

11393077
factors	mean
what i would like to do is to concatenate high and low into one factors what i mean is create a new factors called foreign that will contain the values of high and low

11393095
google-chrome	firefox
i have this issue on google-chrome and firefox window.frames.length inside the function crse_frameexists always returns zero when actually it should return value 3 and true in order to proceed

11393113
versioning	upgrade
at the moment i am simply using the same package name in both versioning so when the user upgrade it will read from the same sharedpreferences

11393178
min	max
more or less just keep a min priority queue of the n largest elements and a max priority queue of the n-n smaller elements

11393190
width	height
in previous versions i could manually set things like layout height and width right from the property list if i wanted to set a height to 20dp i could edit it from the property list for example

11393234
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and google-chrome

11393241

getter	setter
this could be useful for example if your setter or getter is doing other things that you may not want to in this particular case

11396243
getter	setter
one solution i thought of was to have all the saving and storing occur in the class in which it was initialized and just use getter and setter but was trying to make it more readily accesible by making it an object that can be called from other classes and changed in those classes which becomes a little more complicated and confusing at times

11397085
subtract	add
so when your app it says app not activity goes to background all the activities are not visible so they execute the onstop method so the idea behind this is to add one each time an activity es started and subtract one each time an activity es hided so if the value of the variable activities is zero that means that all the activities that where started in some point are now not visible so when you app returns from background and executes the onrestart method on the activity in front you can check whether comes from background or is just restarting an activity

give one container height 0 and a padding-top with the percentage you want for the height of your image in proportion to the width

11400713
width	height
so for a height of 50 of the width use padding-top 50 and height 0 which - as explained here - will make the height proportional to the width by 50

much better is to use crypt function with crypt_blowfish or pbkdf2

11400821
subtract	add
so when your app it says app not activity goes to background all the activities are not visible so they execute the onstop method so the idea behind this is to add one each time an activity es started and subtract one each time an activity es hided so if the value of the variable activities is 0 zero that means that all the activities that where started in some point are now not visible so when you app returns from background and executes the onrestart method on the activity in front you can check whether comes from background or is just restarting an activity

11405271

int	chars
store the chars data packed into a single piece of linear memory then use a separate int array to store the starting indices and perhaps a third array to store the string lengths

11413527
udp	tcp
regarding your comments on udp versus tcp speed udp will always be faster

11413527
udp	tcp
tcp offers ordering and delivery guarantees this means possible retries and holding other packets back until a lost packet finally arrives at its destination while udp only promises to send it once not caring what happens with it afterwards

11413527
udp	tcp
a game may typically use a tcp stream where ordering and guaranteed delivery matters the important stuff and udp streams for object movements etc where only the latest position really matters and if one update got lost it does not matter as long as each package contain the full position instead of a delta where all packets matter

11413527
udp	tcp
for your own game i suggest implementing it on tcp first and then when you have some more experience you can try move the time critical stuff where order and lost packets matter less into separate udp streams

11413527
udp	tcp
there are many projects that have failed because people started with udp first and then tried bolting on ordering and delivery guarantees on top of it effectively trying to reimplement tcp

11413575

getter	setter
from what i can grasp from martin fowler anemia means to separate business logic from domain objects which are reduced to trivial getter and setter while the domain behavior is moved to service layer

11414075
getter	setter
you can either have both setter and getter auto-implemented

11414076
getter	setter
you either have a default property with compiler-generated backing field and getter and or setter body or a custom property

mouse	keyboard
i am working on a site that uses a fairly advanced applet that binds the mouse and keyboard to it so nothing is supposed to affect the browser until you hit esc key

the problem is that when it s called during rotation the frame width height has yet to be flipped

11415135
superclass	subclassing
either your superclass should expose those methods perhaps as abstract or your array should be of the subclassing type so you re not telling the compiler to forget the actual type of the objects or you ll have to suck it up and do the cast possibly with the instanceof test

11415161
super	implements	super	abstract
you have to ask yourself why do you need to know their type maybe this can be replaced with the use of an abstract method in the super class that every one of them can implements according the desired result

int	double
int floats and double all have different binary representations and therefore adding two int is a different operation in terms of bit manipulation than adding two floats for int you can add bit by bit carrying a bit and checking for overflow

cpu	processors
the bit size of your processors tells you what the natural word length the cpu is capable of handling in one cycle

11421584
int	chars
clearly you can compute larger variable sizes so in that sense the cpu s bit architecture determines how it will have to store larger and smaller variables in order to achieve best possible efficiency of processing but it is in no way a limiting factor in the definitions of byte sizes for int or chars that is part of compilers and what is dictated by convention or standards

11421601

i ve done this programmatically but there are some issues in ie 7 and 8 all is a bit more complex than described here with padding margins and borders further complicating matters and only ever got this working cleanly in the latest versions of google-chrome firefox and ie

11422956
portrait	landscape
no the size of that photo is controlled by facebook and the only thing you can do is playing around with the relative size of the photo you use so that it would look slightly bigger you should use pictures with landscape layout as opposed to portrait to get a slightly bigger photo

now when i click on a post header on my blog i get an apache 404 error

11423263
int	chars	int	double
i am aware of the limits imposed on chars int and long long that are in the limits.h file in my mingw folder but where are the restrictions of double and float

11423311
int	double
you are guaranteed that double is never smaller than float and that long double is never smaller than double - similar to the guarantees for long long long int short

11423323
width	height
the basic reason why your code is not working is because the height of an element is calculated differently than you might expect it s different than width

11423335
folder	directory
when you compile and run the project in netbeans the .class files are created and stored in some folder within your project s directory probably called bin or something like that

11423384

you could place a wrapper div with 0 padding 0 margins no border overflow hidden auto width auto height inside your box where you put everything in

11423486
put	get
i am trying to get the authtoken using twitter 4j i put it in try and catch but it catches always this error

11423540
multiplying	addition
you can find the maximal divisor by multiplying by ten usually by repeated addition until the divisor exceeds the number then backing off to the previous value

11423542
passenger	unicorn
i d choose unicorn over passenger if only because passenger still doesn t offer rolling restarts

11423547
google-chrome	firefox
the button works fine on google-chrome but does not work in firefox

11423567
sorting	filtering
the databases already have out of the box several utilities and features that assist in manipulating the data input storage analysis sorting comparison integrity checks reporting retrieval search filtering security multi-user edits etc

11423586
subtraction	addition
then inside the enterframe loop to increase the second sound it would be the same as above but addition instead of subtraction

11423633
doxygen	docset
however i do recommend taking the easy way out which is generating the docset based on the php source using doxygen see creating docsets using doxygen inside the article you linked

11423665
free	malloc
i have a basic understanding of how memory allocation works enough to know that if i malloc then free i m not likely going to actually free an entire page

11423665
free	malloc
i m also open to a drop in replacement malloc if there s a solution that makes checking free relatively easy

11423682
post	get
clarification i am not asking if a get or post can be constructed and sent to any domain

11423682
google-chrome	firefox
if google-chrome ie or firefox will allow content from domain y to send a post to domain x

11423682
post	get
i say somewhat because it seems too easy to believe that an attacker could simply issue an http get to retrieve a form containing the anti-forgery token and then make an illicit post which contains that same token

11423752
free	malloc
the easiest way is to make wrappers for malloc and free

11423752
free	malloc
if you use the real malloc and free then the following could happen

11423754
free	malloc
do one malloc free cycle then capture the results of getrusage then do 1000 more malloc free cycles and ensure your process didn t actually allocate more memory

11423754
free	malloc
if you want something more deterministic but slightly more intrusive you can override malloc and free to track allocations and observe the tracking data from the test harness

11423778
post	get
it is possible to build an arbitrary get or post request and send it to any server accessible to a victims browser

11423820
folder	directory
as you made changes to instance a and instance b you would have create a mask that would hide files from commonsource if they were deleted from the instance folder and create a new physical file in the instance directory if an existing common source file was modified

11423839
google-chrome	firefox
the other elements i m animating with it work properly in firefox ie google-chrome

each row i needed was always gonna contain a textview and 3 imageview

11423859
ubuntu	debian
there is also a debian and ubuntu

11423880
inherited	properties
then the child elements will automatically inherited the properties of the parent element

11423891
background-repeat	background-image
first when you use hover and active and other such things the base style is taken so you do not need to re-declare the background-image and background-repeat styles once will do

11423923
versioning	upgrade
i think to do this i need to upgrade the air runtime on the fire to 3 but the versioning in the app store won t install

11423962
prepare	execute
i have some pages that make pdo queries using prepare and execute binding some parameters and they work fine on localhost but are failing online with messages like this

11423988
ready	each
create non-consumable products with product id com.testitem1 com.testitem2 com.testitem3 there is ready to submit status for each products

11424017
int	chars
apart from int the parameters should also support chars type and any other types as well

11424068
for-loop	arrays
you can easily test this yourself by creating an immense multidimensional arrays with a for-loop but accessing it directly will generally be faster when indexing large arrays

11424089
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button are on off switches that may be toggled

11424096
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button are on off switches that may be toggled

if you post your dmanager1.h file you ll be able to get a more detailed answer

11424114
getter	setter
lowercase letter by convention appears uppercase in getter and setter

11424114
getter	setter
getter and setter for property empname

11424125
min	max
using the pre-processor and creating a basic macro such as your basic min max type macro that simply wraps a few and operations

11424127
getter	setter
this makes sense since properties are not variables - they are implemented as getter setter methods by the compiler

11424135
width	height
edit and as the original image is rotated the old width and height have to be reversed

11424142
button	checkbox
otherwise if the field element is an input element whose type attribute is in the checkbox state or the radio button state then run these further nested substeps

11424155
uiview	cashapelayer
use a uiview with a cashapelayer backing it

11424198
folder	directory
for example im in desktop directory say it contains a bb c i type in a b aa bb it will search a b aa bb against all the folder names in the current directory then it outputs a bb c exists aa b don t exist

11424249
inherited	properties
- extend allows you to inherited all the properties of a selector without having to define it as a mixin

11424261
google-chrome	firefox
it only seems to be happening in firefox google-chrome was fine

11424308
installation	upgrade
the release notes to upgrade an existing server installation say to just install the newest libraries and binaries on top of the older ones

11424308
collabnet	svn
i downloaded the binaries from collabnet however i don t know where in the solaris 10 server the svn libraries and binaries are

11424329
google-chrome	firefox
i want to write an extension which can allow users to use their mouses to select multiple tabs in google-chrome the select tabs will be highlighted just like some multiple-tab handler extensions for firefox i have searched but didn t find any useful information so i am wondering if there is a way to do it or it s technically possible to build such an extension given google-chrome s design

11424332
min	max
in result set i want to ad a column which shows min and max date combinely 20 3 2012 - 25 4 2012 from table

11424378
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
when i did server stuff i used bufferedreader and bufferedwriter

11424378
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
note if you re going to deal with large pages this could cause a problem as the bufferedreader and bufferedwriter will fill up before you re ready

11424390
gridview	datalist	gridview	repeater	datalist	repeater
when you set the datasource from code behine the same principle is valid for other databound controls like gridview datalist repeater etc you need to bind again on some paging event

11424390
linqdatasource	objectdatasource
an alternative way to solve this you could add a datasource control like objectdatasource linqdatasource etc... and set it on the listview s datasourceid property and the datapager will work automatically

11424395
width	height	int	boolean
so using your jtable you can get the cellrect int width int height boolean includingspacing and pass it off to the scrollrecttovisible

11424397
comparator	comparable
the classes you are looking for is comparable and comparator

11424465
children	parent
i m trying to keep my parent div and children in focus until i focus out of the div and it seems surprisingly hard to accomplish

11424480
folder	directory
in rails 3.1 i was able to put a symbolic link to a directory of html pages in my public folder and it worked

11424509
inherited	subclassing
it conflicts with the way rails uses sti single table inherited as it uses the type attribute to determine the type of the class when its subclassing another

11424538
width	height
1 make sure that each element in your layout has layout height and width defined

11424539
width	height
as a result i have many some classes with identical styling mainly width height padding etc.

11424553
uiview	subviews
now the other approach would be to just use a new uiview added as a subviews of your main view controller

11424587
children	parent
the issue described at the highest level possible i have a parent class that would like to act as the delegate for multiple children all using the same protocol but when the children call methods on the parent the parent no longer knows which child is making the call

11424587
children	parent
i would like the parent view controller to be notified whenever the user touches one of the children

11424587
children	parent
the parent implements the protocol and sets itself as the delegate to each of the children

11424587
children	parent
the parent defines a separate method for each of the three children and then subscribes to the viewwastouched notification for each of the three children as the notification sender

11424598
decimal	ieee
another way to look at this is to realize that ieee 64-bit doubles normalized approximate positive and negative decimal numbers having absolute values ranging from 2.225073858507201400 e -308 through 1.797693134862315700 e +308

11424598
int	double
the behavior of floats and double wrecks havoc with decimal computations requiring exact decimal accuracy such as financial calculations and is why unless a high-precision approximation is acceptable one should use scaled int and longs or classes such as biginteger and bigdecimal for computations requiring exact decimal accuracy rounding and precision

11424600
post	get
change method post to method get if you only want to send get data

11424602
google-chrome	firefox

11433862
scheme	racket
in racket s scheme it would be

11433863
width	height
i know the window width and height and i know the amount of buttons there is to add

11433863
width	height
is there any smart algorithm to calculate each button s width and height according to this

11433915
implements	extends
just make an baseactivity in which you implements this code and then let all your activities that you want to have this 2 options menu extends your baseactivity

11433994
for-loop	arrays
as expected fast enumeration is by far the fastest and nsenumerator is still a little bit faster than the for-loop but this was for enumerating quit a large arrays

11433994
for-loop	loops
i then tried a hybrid version as well using fast enumeration for the outer loops and a for-loop for the inner one

11433997
children	parent
define the main parent figure window that will hold the generated children plot figures

11434041

11434095
post	get
in my sinatra application i have a get route and a post route that redirects to get

11434100
hash	salt
the password is hash and salt and stored in a login table both values are stored along with the loginid value

11434100
hash	salt
however when i stept thru the code and i login to the application after the registration process the hash and salt values never match

11434112
width	height
under advanced settings there is radio buttons for migrations playing around with those solved the problem and setting the default width of 810px and height to 900px works fine - however i ve got the scrollbar at the bottom

11434134
nfa	dfa
chapter 1 gives detailed algorithms for converting a regular expression to a deterministic or non-deterministic finite-state automaton dfa or nfa in the context of proving their equivalence a dfa an nfa and a regular expression can match exactly the same classes of strings

11434134
nfa	dfa
you then convert the nfa into a much larger dfa which involves creating one dfa state for each set of alternative nfa states

11434134
nfa	dfa
the dfa has at most as many states as the powerset of the set of nfa states an nfa with 3 states can get transformed to a dfa with at most 2 3 8 states and can recognize any target string without backtracking

11434194
inline-functions	inlining
it s not to do with inlining what happens is the linker sees multiple definitions of the same symbol which often happens with template instantiations and inline-functions and other symbols when using dynamic libs and picks one definition to use

11434201
keyevent	onkeydown
you need to override onkeydown keycode event because onkeydown view v int keycode keyevent event does not exist

opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
assuming you have an xpath expression selecting an element node with mozilla or opera or google-chrome or safari then simply do

11434216
google-chrome	safari
in all of the html5 compatible browsers although in this case i m talking about google-chrome 20 and safari for windows 5.1.7 if i specify some video using tags is the idea that this should play without the user having to install plug-ins

11434232
int	boolean
c89 is long-obsolete doing things like storing boolean values in int or declaring all variables at the beginning of a function can be considered bad style now

11434273
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
for example google-chrome and ie9 will play mp3 audio but firefox and opera play a different format

11434308
hash	salt
you should get your salt from the database calculate a hash with the user provided password and than compare the hash to the hash stored in the database

11434348
hash	salt
it s a bit hard to understand the purpose of your code but normally you create a hash using a salt value and a password string

maven	m2e
i checked out a maven project and imported to my eclipse indigo with maven integration via the m2e plugin

11434443
width	height
the number of controls has to be a product of two other numbers so as someone suggested 17 gives you only 17 1 so then button width is gridth width 17 and button height is window height or vice versa if you d prefer one column

11434443
width	height
you could try and do something with aspect ratio to make this more sense width height means you should go for a row

11434443
width	height
if the number of controls is a product then it will either be a square or again you can use width height to calcu out the button widths and height

11434443
width	height
you might also want to consider minimum width and height for the buttons but then you have more won t fit problems

11434455

because it is the temp children that should be treated as parent be matched against parents.parent at the next iteration

11434518
trie	tree
after rereading i think the best way to do this is probably to build a trie or a prefix tree of your big library of strings then match s against that

11434518
trie	tree
it also fits your use case quite well -- while it takes quite a bit of work to build a trie or especially a prefix tree from the input using it afterwards is quite fast

11434527

11442350
int	chars
if the string is already a timestamp then you don t need to do anything more to it than cast it to int strictly speaking even that step shouldn t be necessary but casting will strip out any non-numerical chars so it doesn t usually hurt to cast

11442356

how important is memory efficiency both for the encoder and the decoder

11443213
touchesbegan	touchesended
it seems as if touchesbegan withevent and touchesended withevent methods would be helpful in this case but when i define them on the child view controllers they don t do exactly what i want -- if the user begins touching outside the child view then swipes over the child view no touch events are triggered on the child itself

11443213
touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended
i m observing touchesbegan withevent touchesended withevent and touchesmoved withevent on the parent grabbing the coordinates of each event and determining if they lie within the bounds of a child

i registered the shell extension under the directory registry key so it shows up only when a folder is right clicked

11443288
int	chars
you ve told the compiler i ve got a function that returns int and i want to store the value in a chars

11443288
int	chars
then your code treats that as a 32-bit int that it has to cast to a 64-bit chars

11443298
int	chars
for example chars should be declared as size_t not int

11443320
getter	setter
if you don t have the with no args before it there is an implicit it parameter that s assigned and it s not a zero arg method so doesn t adhere to the javabean getter setter pattern

11443485
versioning	upgrade
on a related topic i ve also heard some talk about putting any upgrade scripts such as schema changes for mysql under versioning control so they can be ran when the versioning is deployed

11443502

11443723

11444267
google-chrome	firefox
that was a little tricky but there is a solution i found for css3 capable browsers tested in ie9 firefox google-chrome

11444279
hide	show
for example if it is sufficient to only show hide questions when the next button is clicked then you can do it in php alone

11444335
switching	screens
however if something will delay the process such as the app not being in the background properly yet such as during rapid task switching or if something else predictable will delay the startup then it reverts to the splash screens instead of the screenshot to ease the user experience

11444367
dictionary	map
i have a dictionary map from integers to a alphabet for some odd encryption algorithm

so basically if auto-do-stuff is checked and the user pushes the button dostuff it disables both the button and checkbox and show the animated gif while the background thread is working

11444418
button	checkbox
when that thread is done it indicates that it is and the button and checkbox should both be re-enabled and the gif should be gone

11444418
button	checkbox
for some reason the the checkbox is re-enabled and unchecked and the gif is gone as expected but the dostuff button is still disabled and reads processing...

11444440
folder	directory
what you see as admin is a directory or folder

for-loop	arrays
one for the arrays class then the other is for the information that i will use for the selected class using for-loop

for-loop	loops
i prefer for-loop that for each loops

11444444
getter	setter
there are also many fields other than the above retrieved with getter but these are given default value as the table property with creation of row so i decided not to apply getter and setter for them

11444444
getter	setter
also i didn t used getter and setter for uid as it is auto generated

11444449
google-chrome	firefox
the problem does not appear in firefox and google-chrome

superclass	subclassing
you can have a superclass shape square and rectangle are two children class but can you have square subclassing rectangle as square is a special rectangle with four sides equal

11445019
width	height	getter	setter
a typical example that violates lsp is a square class that derives from a rectangle class assuming getter and setter methods exist for both width and height

11445019
width	height
the square class always assumes that the width is equal with the height

11445019
width	height
if someone is trying to use what they think should be an instance of rectangle but it s really an instance of square they might set the width and be surprised that the height automatically changes unexpected side effect

11445072
hide	show
or b how can i hide the webbrowser at the start of animation and show it again at the end

11445073

logically to keep it restful i guess that i would have to use post put to update the profile and then get to get the elements to inject

technically you could just take the first 12 characters from the result of the md5 hash but the specification of md5 is to generate a 32 char one

11454067
hash	md5
a md5 hash is 128 bits so you can t represent it in hex with less than 32 characters.

i am trying to scale in a core plot scatter plot like a line graphing so that it scales in to view

11454393
getter	setter
i think this error is about accessing a null getter or setter meaning that it doesn t exist

11454393

that means those screens are hdpi screens

11454524
screens	hdpi
i already have resource for hdpi screens which looks as above on most of the devices

11454524
screens	hdpi
a qhd hdpi device has a display-independent pixel dip screens size of 360x640 whereas the incredible s s is 320x533 hence why some of the images are higher up the screens relative to others

11454524
mdpi	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi
but i d work on making your app adaptable to screens rather than trying to divide screens sizes up like this as you shouldn t really need separate layout resources for mdpi hdpi etc

11454524
mdpi	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi
-- i agree that normally i shouldn t need separate layout for mdpi and hdpi screens

11454524
mdpi	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi
this left me no choice than creating different layout for mdpi and hdpi screens

then when you create an instance of that form and show it as a dialog or not you ll see that when you close it the message box will pop-up right away even if you keep the form instance around and without you ever needing to add a using or dispose call

11454860
portrait	landscape
the application can be in portrait and landscape have 4 buttons in portrait 3 in landscape

11454877

you need to get an image that is the same as background.png but four times the resolution that s the same as double the width and double the height

11454941
pop-up	dialog
for the pop-up dialog effect drop a panel control onto your main form that you call loginpnl or something like with one or more textbox controls and some button controls for ok and cancel

11454965

but i d work on making your app adaptable to screens rather than trying to divide screens sizes up like this as you shouldn t really need separate layout resources for mdpi hdpi etc

11455007
getter	setter
first when you use property synthesize directive you create getter and setter methods around a variable

11455007
getter	setter
in your case the variable is called arrayspeechsentences the compiler will create the variable for you and you can access these methods setter and getter with self

11455016
vb.net	vb6
a proper answer is really too big and time consuming to fit in here and will demand a bit of experimentation to get it working but basically you can install a usb to com driver from prolific and then write software to that or rework the vb6 answer you linked into vb.net using the usual techniques

11455020
client-side	server-side
i just know google analytics which tracks client-side activity but maybe there are many alternatives using client and server-side scripts

i ve placed inside each ldpi mdpi and hdpi folder a .jpg image each having dimensions in respect to this guy s answer see here

11455080

11455105
post	get
i am trying to understand how post and or get methods work in terms of the actual browser

11455106

if you know the size of the image then you must set the pixel size of the div - 100px height and 200px width

11455117
rational-numbers	fractions
every machine fractions is a rational-numbers of the form x 2 n

11455122
getter	setter
you need to create a property and synthesize the getter and setter methods

11455123
bash	tcsh
sh bash not csh tcsh

11455143

the code works for google-chrome but not in firefox

11455176
google-chrome	safari

however you can also use divs with position absolute since you already have the height of the header and the width of the left column as absolute

11455267
switching	screens
i have a switching in my screens and when the user wants that option to be on i need to collect some more information from that user

11455314
put	get
i can get it to work if i duplicate the entire .click and put it into the success part of the ajax however i know there must be something that i do not know for i highly doubt the developers of jquery would require the programmers to copy the same code twice

11455317
free	realloc
when i try to use realloc to allocate memory for a pointer which has been free d i get a segmentation fault

11455323
versioning	upgrade
it worked fine with phonegap 1.5 but after an upgrade to versioning 1.9 it stopped working

11455341
free	realloc
if you re passing a pointer to realloc that has been free d but not explicitly set to null you re probably passing realloc an invalid address which it will try to use resulting in undefined behavior hence your segfault

11455352
implements	extends
if i extends activity and implements an event handler in my base class sorry if that s not the correct oop term how can i ensure that my event handler always gets run from classes which extends mine

11455352
super	extends
is there any way to force instances of classes extends myactivity to run super in methods that overlap on methods defined by me in the parent class

11455359
realloc	malloc
if the pointer passed to realloc is null it will malloc it for you

11455386
free	realloc	debian	linux
this from man realloc 3 from a debian linux box should tell you all you need to know - basically don t free before using realloc

11455386
calloc	malloc
have been returned by an earlier call to malloc calloc or

11455406
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
the pointer you pass into realloc must be one of two things either a valid pointer that was previously returned from malloc calloc realloc or else a null pointer

11455406

if you free the memory you need to set the pointer to null before you pass it to realloc again

11455416
try-catch	exception-handling
i want to be able to log every exception-handling but without putting try-catch s everywhere

11455420
google-chrome	firefox
and for firefox and google-chrome use

11455434

imagine having a tabcontrol with two tabitem

11455525
width	height
auto scale slider option make height scale based on width you need to disable it if you want it fullscreen

11455553
fileinputstream	bytearrayinputstream
here in the example i am using fileinputstream instance but you can generate bytearrayinputstream instance from your dynamic pdf content and use it

11455558
hide	show
whenever i load the page the dialog becomes visible for a second before jquery hide it which looks kind of odd as normally it should not be visible until user clicks the button to show the dialog

11455582
width	height	portrait	landscape
i tested your code with two images one was landscape width height the other was portrait height width

11455583
distance	polygons
currently all we are doing is radius search using haversign distance calculation so one of the strengths of this would be support for more advanced limiting using vectors and polygons perhaps allowing us in the future to scale up to something like region-based limiting

11455597
width	height
fixed width and height

11455597
width	height
circle contained in a div so that width and height work properly

11455670
coffeescript	haml
i m using haml and coffeescript but you should get the idea

11455680
mouseup	mousedown
as monkieboy says the mouseup event is happening outside of the browser so until you click again the dialog thinks you are still in the mousedown event

11455680
mouseup	mouseleave
you can use the mouseleave event to register the mouseup see fiddle

11455687
udp	tcp
do the principles apply to tcp as they do to udp and would there be any differences in implementation

11455829
hide	show
i want the play button to be disabled while the clock is running and enabled when the clock is stopped visa versa but also i would like it to be hidden when its disabled so could some show me the code to disable and hide a button that has been recently pressed and then reenabled and visible when the other one is pressed

11455836
pop-up	dialog
note that if you re giving some sort of bonus for users accepting the requests you should also implement logic in your own app which tracks the number and ids of the sent requests to corelate them later when processing the acceptances as users could conceivably trigger the dialog themselves via javascript or the pop-up dialog and send more requests than your app allows

11455843
actionscript	mxml
so far when i get the application to work if i use an mxml olapcube but not when i try to build the olapcube in actionscript

11455865
width	height
i would like for the text title to have a black background that is the same width as the text but a different height

11455865
width	height
if i get the width right i can t change the height because the span is an inline element

11455865
width	height
if i get the height right by making the span a block i can t change get the width to be exactly the width of the text because it is now a block level element and expands to be the entire width of the page

11455873
width	height
on each resize we size the div and its border radius so that it renders as a perfect circle width height and radius width 2

11455918

then set the top as appropriate the left to 0 and the width and height as appropriate

11455966
put	get
let s say you do get one and put it here web images like.png

implements	extends
abstract methods must be implements in the class that extends it

11456192
integer	fractions	floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer
if you expect an integer value there a floating-point with .0 fractions part you should probably round the result of pow

11456215
getter	setter
it overrides the getter and setter to simply place the values into a map rather than into the object s normal property space

11456233
width	height
i m trying to get the image width and height and am finding that the returned values are not saving

11456305
children	parent
however i think you would be able to detect such situations in a post-processing step and correct them afterwards walk the tree and for each node check to see if it represents a horizontal or a vertical join and if a node x has the same orientation as its parent y then remove x and make its children additional children of y

11456338
strcpy	strtok
i m also getting this error with strcpy strtok and some other standard functions all respective headers included in header.h

11456345
width	height
width and height should be png_uint_32 not unsigned int

11456345
width	height
after seeing your pastebin it looks like you re passing in width and height to the function as unsigned char which are effectively hiding the class members width and height and is probably not what you want specifically since unsigned char can only hold values up to 255 and the width and height are 1024 and 2048

11456365

11456409
post	get
you should be able to get around this by making your view model a parameter into the httppost action result method and then passing that list back to the view after the post so that it retains which items are selected instead of creating a new one

11456419

11457118
free	malloc
this code doesn t include a copy constructor however copy constructor is used in scenarios where you dyamically allocate members of a class so that the program should not crash once an instance or object goes out of scope because the destructor will deallocate the dynamically allocated memory if you have included delete or free for new or malloc respectively

11457129

a serious answer would be to write a separate main for each subclassing but let it call a common inherited method that accepts an appropriate instance

11457349
x86	64bit
if you are using windows 7 64bit make sure you update your x86 jdk jre version as well

11457365

implements	extends
i was wondering if it was possible to set a parameter to a method as an object which must be a extends one class and implements another

11458190
implements	extends
let s say somewhere else there is a class called classb which both extends classa and implements myinterface

11458190
implements	extends
i could also have a classc which also extends classa and implements myinterface

11458190
implements	extends
but what if i wanted a method3 and i wanted to have a parameter which accepts only objects which either subclass classa or is classa itself and implements myinterface and so will accept both classb and classc but not any class which only extends classa or only implements myinterface or neither

you need to check if a post has actually occured - the first time someone hits your page it ll most likely be via a get but your search code will run regardless

11458318
implements	extends
but i don t think it s a good idea - if you have a concept of object that extends classa and implements myinterface it would be better to create a separate class or interface to represent that concept

11458338
int	chars
this assumes that your int will never be more than 10 chars long

11458352
implements	extends
like have a parent abstract class interface that defines the executeoperation graphics2d gr boolean drawingmode method then extends implements it for each operation you support may be able to drop drawingmode too i can t see what it does though. can possibly put the graphics2d into a constructor too

11464365
int	chars
in c programming language signed int when converted to smaller signed int say chars for the sake of simplicity are of implementation-defined manner

11464365
int	chars
update the reason why int doesn t work in oppose to chars and short is because that when both numbers are added there is a possibility of overflow regardless of being int short or chars while not forgetting integral promotion but because short and chars are with smaller sizes than int and because they are promoted to int in expressions they are represented again without truncation in this line

11464365
int	chars
this is because short and chars get promoted to int evaluated and then get truncated overflowed

11464365
int	chars
however this is not what happens in c because chars and short are promoted to int thus overflow is detected which is not true in int because it is note promoted to a larger size

gson	jackson
gson would be my first recommendation and jackson is another alternative you might want to look at

custom getter and setter if you like you can still write custom getter and setter and you can even just write a getter or setter and let the other one automatically synthesize

and you can write custom logic into such a getter and setter you can reload a tableview after a property has changed

getter	setter
if you need you ivar to be public it is simpler to write one property than writing a getter and setter for a ivar

width	height
a pixel size for a font gives a height with a width corresponding by ratio

11477323

min	max
oracle forces me to use an aggregate function and i used max or min knowing that it s completely senseless

11478067

11478163
width	height
the horizontal bar s position will vary with the height of the browser window whereas if you set it as 85 of the width it would be exactly where i want it

11478163

only in designer for height and width i only can set fill_parent or wrap_content values

11478250
getter	setter
this will by default create a getter and a setter and handle the autorelease as well as create the instance variable

11478250
getter	setter
you should always use the getter and setter

11478273
getter	setter
when writing setf expanders for user-defined getter i commonly find that there is code duplication in the getter and setter as far as how the property is retrieved

11478273
getter	setter
to be clear what i d like here is a way to define a getter and typical setter where the way that the getter compiles down to common lisp forms that already have setter car lst is written only once in the code

11478273
getter	setter
what i m talking about here is the case where the setter does the standard thing and just sets the place of the getter

11478298
scatter	graphing
i figured it out myself instead of using a bar chart i used a scatter plot with step graphing that did the trick

daemons	systemd
it is possible for systemd administrators to define certain properties as final so that client daemons may not override them

11478342
mouse	keyboard
either of your methods will work - if you have little programming background i would suggest starting with autohotkey since it mimics keyboard and mouse commands so the programming is much more straightforward and easier to understand

11478343
union	distinct
note that the join potentially returns multiple copies of some stores but because union implies select distinct that won t actually affect your final result-set.

11478457
post	get
here is my initial blog post on it as it can get quite long

11478458
int	double
formally it has internal linkage meaning it can t be referred to by name or linked to from other files it can be indirectly referred to through a pointer or by passing it as an argument to another function. that means if several files define static int testnum then each file has its own internal variable with that name distinct from the testnum in every other file in fact one file could have static int testnum and another could have static double testnum and another they d all be distinct and internal to each file. if you put a definition like that in header then every file that includes the header has its own testnum

11478465
getter	setter
i read that a good practice have entities light only getter and setter

11479900
post	get
_request gets you get post and cookies

11479918

if you have a deep folder hierarchy you are probably ending up with a recursion issue as parent link to children link to children link to children etc

11480537
width	height
the problem seems to be resolved if you remove the height and width lines from the following

11480537
google-chrome	firefox
this does not seem to produce any negative effects on firefox or google-chrome either so it should be safe to remove it

11480538
toolbar	tabs
can anyone please help to modify the code so that i can use the same toolbar without repetition in all ribbon tabs

11480630
width	height
then by setting a min-height and min-width on body equal to #main_container s height and width respectively no matter how short the window would become the body s dimensions would never be smaller than #main_container - no possible overflow

racket	plai
i am studying plai now i have already run chapter 3 s code in racket with #lang plai but i am a newbie in racket

11480693
gif	png
if you re worried about the size of the uploaded image and the time it ll consume then restrict the users to specific image formats and specific size for example if you re allowing a user to upload his personal message board avatar only allow really small images or maybe only gif .gif images instead of taking a huge 2mb+ png .png image and resizing it to the desired size say 52x52

11480695

negative margin on the container could solve that but you don t know what the value needs to be set at as it would differ with text width

11480760
put	get
i m trying to get the out put to look like this

11480784
dictionary	map
the 2d array is actually a javascript object which function similar to a dictionary or map in other programming languages

11480791
post	put
there is a heartbeat object which is sent in a post rather than a put because as i see it they are creating a new heartbeat rather than updating an existing heartbeat

11480791
post	get
perform the post followed by a get which to me seems cleaner from a pure rest standpoint

11480791
post	get
have the post return an object which contains the same information that the get would otherwise have done

11480831
versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade an iphone to a newer versioning but beware you cannot then change back to a lower versioning of ios

11480844

11481221
innodb	myisam
if you store innodb database engine you lose fulltext type indexing that the default myisam supports so you need to determine your database engine

11481249
range	minimum
so k is a scaled version of y that s in the range 0 to 1 - that is the minimum value will map to 0 and the maximum value will map to 1

opensuse	linux
for opensuse i have created a wrapper package called wixwine which gives you the candle and light commands from the windows installer xml wix toolset ready to use on linux

11481493
division	multiplication
division is generally on the order of 10x slower than multiplication on most processor families

11481493
division	multiplication	factors	matrix
the place where it makes most sense to replace division with multiplication by the reciprocal is when you re dividing a vector by a constant factors vector normalization scaling matrix pivoting

11481493
division	multiplication
most likely the compiler optimizer will recognize cases where it makes sense to substitute multiplication for division anyways

11481505
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
what are some tool to help uncover why for instance firefox is rendering a page differently than google-chrome ie and safari

button	checkbox
using a set of radio button or checkbox if several choices are to be allowed instead of a select element you can organize and style them like any other content with indentation and bolding

11481615
min	max
under test 1 it s decided that the blue pane requires proportionally more space then green and yellow blue max height 32767 green yellow max height 100 hence it squishes them down green yellows min heights are 10 pixels

11481615
min	max
under test 2 it s decided that the blue pane should receive the most amount of size as it s max size is 32767 but s min and pref sizes are 10 but it s also found that the green and yellow panes can not be smaller then 100 pixels so it allocates the remaining space over to blue which is about 100 pixels in this case

11481615
min	max
basically the difference between using only the min or only the max is coming down to the default size of these sizes min max pref

11481615
min	max
when you re using only the min the total combined max height is 98301 each components max been 32767

11481615
min	max
when i only used the min size the green and yellow where actually been allocated 200 pixels - this came down to the max size value

11481615
min	max
the docs actually say that the layout managers may ignore one or more of these max min pref values as they are simply a guide line

11481620
queue	fifo
a queue is normally a fifo 1 container while a stack is lifo 2

11481620
queue	fifo
it takes advantage of the fact that a queue is fifo and stack lifo by copying the data queue to stack then stack to queue and finally queue to stack again we have effectively reversed the order of elements in a way that will match your description

11481636

min	max
supposing the columns have the same type and you just have 2 columns to reorder you can rely on the min max functions

11481936
min	max
the min max functions reorder the values in the columns

11481998
put	get
php get put request body

11481998
put	get
i think the way it reads put request is like reading a file or a stream if there is a way to set the reader to the start again probably could get that data

11482019
queue	fifo
well sidestepping your question somewhat the classic purely functional implementation of a fifo queue is as a pair of lists one for the front and one for the back. you enqueue elements by adding them as the head of the back list and dequeue by taking the head of the front list

11482028
jobs	cron
create convert_queue.php file and add it to your cron jobs let s say every 5 minutes

client-side	server-side
i have worked around this by passing client-side templates through server-side templates

11482242
client-side	server-side
so on the server-side read all your client-side templates to an array and pass it to your render function on the server-side

11482253

if you will take code for examples from repository then it contains ready to use pom.xml file for maven

11482264
folder	directory
try to put messages.properties under web-inf directory inside any folder and set the path with basename property

11482265
min	max
to do 2 i would first look for vertical rectangles find the maximal possible width for each consecutive min_y max_y and therefore the area iteratively in o 1 per row just by looking at the min max of 1 s in that row of the connected component

11482265
width	height
the total running time is o mxn for bfs then o width 2 + height 2 for each connected componenet for a total of o mxn + m 2 + n 2

appdata	uninstaller
even things like stored appdata would be lost due to unassociation - different signature for the exact reason you need to uninstaller first

11482403
trie	tree
a simple solution would be to pre - compute the words and build a trie tree having digits in the nodes and each leaf node would have a link to a linked list array or some other data structure of strings that can be formed using those digits

11482403
trie	tree
note since the number of digits 10 only the size of the trie tree would be limited

11482403
trie	tree
a ternary search tree tst could also be used in place of the trie tree but here but since there are only 10 digits there would not be much significant advantages of using a tst i guess

11482447
oncreate	recreate
each time activity recreate after state change oncreate additionaly adds a new tab so

11482477

0b is often used for binary rather than for octal

11483324
boost	stl
if you don t need to do that ask yourself whether you actually need the power of an rdbms - would a series of objects collections based on boost stl not work as well and probably faster

11483334
width	height
the source of the img.lightboximg changes on each click and thus the container width and height changes acording to the image size.the container doesn t center on the first click but it centers on the second.the two loops are used only to change the src on img.lightboximg

11483334
width	height
another thing i don t understand is if i try to get the width and height of lightboximg variable it always returns 0.why is that

put	get
also the submitvalue is a place to put a value so to get the behavior that you are seeking you should set the submitvalue to something like newcategoryclick and then define an eventhandler child under the applicationlayout that checks to see if the submittedvalue newcategoryclick then run your ssjs code that you have defined

11483682
for-loop	arrays
an arrays of numbers that follow a simple pattern in this case arrays element index plus 1 is kind of pointless when you can achieve the same thing with a standard for-loop

11483706
width	height
now width and height are properties of the object stored in the .data size which can retrieved with

11483733
width	height
you are setting attributes in your plugin but at that point you can just store the original width and height in the data object like this

11483733
width	height
this works but you could just get the saved width and height by calling it like this

edit by using getline instead of getchar the program works on ghci thanks to daniel fischer

11484092
getchar	getline
the getchar however removes only the first character entered from the input buffer so the following getline reads from the input buffer until it finds a newline

11484092
stdout	fflush
to fflush the output buffer or turn off buffering for stdout

11484667
public	protected
for ex i can t override a public method as protected while i can override a protected method as public

11484669
prepare	execute	prepare	pdostatement
calling pdo prepare and pdostatement execute for statements that will be issued multiple times with different parameter values optimizes the performance of your application by allowing the driver to negotiate client and or server side caching of the query plan and meta information and helps to prevent sql injection attacks by eliminating the need to manually quote the parameters

11484669
prepare	execute
so you only call prepare once and call execute inside your loop

11484682
put	get
after i read segments i concat first part of latitude and second part of latitude and also put a dot . in between so in this example i get 47.707223 and 16.54322 and i do the same with the longitude

11485592
post	get
tho personally i would scrap the get for the fancy url and just use post

11485601
for-loop	arrays
instead of using foreach you could just use a regular for-loop with an incremented variable i used to grab each at index i of the arrays

11485609
return-value-optimization	nrvo
moreover the c++03 and later versions of the language specification take it one step further they explicitly permit the compilers to perform the named return-value-optimization nrvo which actually eliminates a named non-temporary object

you can set a height css property to make sure both buttons are the same height and set an appropriate width too

11486459
google-chrome	firefox

11486546
google-chrome	firefox
the only way that seems to work in ie 9 firefox 12 and google-chrome 20.0 is the following

11486579
calloc	malloc
use calloc instead of malloc

11486596
post	get
the graph api doesn t work and i get error code 100 when post id likes with no parameters like the documentation says

11486637
memset	malloc	memset	calloc	calloc	malloc
if you want to just fill in zeros use memset after malloc or just use calloc

11486637
strcpy	strncpy
if you want your string to be automatically terminated with a null use strcpy strncpy to copy data into it

11486681
cpu	processors
however high network traffic not necessarily implies low performance since the nic has its own processors and does not makes the cpu stall

11486722
uilabel	nsstring
after your xib instantiated an uilabel and you get its reference using the iboutlet keyword you are then trying to use the uilabel pointer to point to a space in memory allocated and instantiated for a nsstring that s why you are having this problem

11486722
uilabel	nsstring
you simply want the uilabel to display the nsstring you just created and for that you should use the uilabel s text property

11486728
post	get
if this doesnt answer your question please post what you have tried ie give us some code to work with and you ll probably get a more informed answer

11486739
setcontentview	findviewbyid
if you are calling findviewbyid from main.xml you first need to setcontentview as main.xml

11486760
queue	fifo
for your problem i suggest you use simpler ipc mechanisms like pipe fifo message queue

11486768
put	get	post	put	post	get
i m stuck on what to put in my post method and how to get the value from the dropdown list

11486792
prepare	execute
now what i would suggest you do for improvement is to split your db access into three phases prepare bind execute

11486792
prepare	execute
for more info search google for sql prepare bind execute for your target db

11486868
lis	lcs
or the lis by lcs algorithm given in the site is incorrect

11486911
width	height
last just set the margin-top and margin-left negative of the modal window based on it s height and width divided by two

11486916
integer	unsigned
the second set of 4 bytes in the initial header is basically the total file length - 8 bytes and is stored as a 32-bit unsigned integer in little endian byte order

11486940
hash	md5
what i do is as part of the build process rename all the statically referenced files to something involving their md5 hash

11486942
maven	pom.xml
while the properties files were being copied to the target directory and showed up as if they were included in the build the maven pom.xml file was set to explicitly exclude properties files from the built artifact

11486954
uiview	calayer
i assume the allocation is done right before my code is called and is due to an incorrect uiview or calayer size somewhere

11486997
iboutlet	ibaction
as far as what can be connected the keyword iboutlet marks properties or variables and ibaction marks action methods

11487020
servicecontract	servicebehavior
from servicecontract vs servicebehavior

11487020
servicecontract	servicebehavior
servicecontract affect the wsdl emitted but servicebehavior will not

carrierwave	paperclip
i not find any solution with the paperclip but i ended up using the carrierwave and it worked what i needed

11487044
calloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	calloc
if you allocate your primitive using malloc or calloc you must use free at the end i don t know why you d want to use primitives like this though

11487044
free	malloc
same rules are followed when you add primitive fields to your objects if you use malloc in the init then you must use free in dealloc

11487082
put	get
to get the edittext value put this inside the displayedittext

11487096
firefox	safari
firefox supports .ogg but safari and ie do not

11487103
moq	fakeiteasy
my suggestion would be to pick a feature and start unit testing it and introduce a mock library such as moq or fakeiteasy

11487131
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
finally border is included into the width percentage to workaround this you can use css3 and box-sizing border-box

11487134
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
if not try adding box-sizing border-box to make the borders get included in the width

if i understand your question correctly you need to replace your ienumerable with ilist and then use the following approach

11487386
g++	gcc
perl scripts programs usually are not compiled into binary file - they are of course compiled but uhm on the fly - that s why usr bin perl is called rather interpreter than compiler like gcc or g++

11487390
pop-up	dialog
it is not possible to catch this exception because it pop-up a system dialog

11487395

now that might work on google-chrome and firefox but in ie that will probably not work and more over it probably won t tell you where or why it s not working

11487463
ready	each
you wrapped your jquery call in the document ready handler as you should but then you wrapped your code within another ready handler for each element..

11487469
children	parent
a is the parent table b is children table

11487577
width	height
for the scale to be correct the width and height need to be at a 4 3 ratio

11487577
width	height
in testing height the height of the form is 400 so the width of the new size should be 133

11487589
int	double
on the other hand 4d 3 will work and results in a double 1.333_ because now it is double int - double double by promotion - double using the appropriate floating point division

11487602
rss	feed
you should be able to use xmlserializer to deserialize the rss feed directly without manual mapping

11487626

you are returning the highest value a double instead of the highest index an int

11487704
post	get
i tried using some example xsl shared in other post but never managed to get it to work

11487727
int	double
as for the compiler warning it means that when you try to implicitly cast a double into an int you may loose some of the information you had

11487739
int	double
to perform an int division simply ensure that neither operand is a float double

11487783
subtract	add
your problem is that you have to deal with origins too so you ll have to subtract the vector o from p than apply m add q and then o again

11487788

first you need two variables to store your width and height

11487793
folder	directory
copy the war folder to a temporary directory

11487796
128bit	64bit
so you can store the network address as a integer of 64bit the first 64bit of the 128bit address

11487806
division	modulo

11487944
children	parent
i need to group these into sub trees that consist of parent and their immediate children

11487965

one of which is to find the max and min of the json that i am using as input

11488194

11488194
min	max
all i would like some help with is understanding why the d3.min data and d3.max data are causing the entire object to be output to the console instead of the min and max number in the data object

11488442
post	get
is it possible to force an html.actionlink to do a post instead of a get

11488445
int	double
what it does should be clear enough reserve space for 3 int on stack store constant values in them convert them to double cvtsi2sd perform division caveat you write a b in order div b a the result goes in second register

11488445
put	get
in which register to put datas and get results is up to the reader

11488454
width	height
i can change it so the layout is set to width 480dip height 75dip instead of wrap_content

eventlet and gevent are also use

11488526
post	get
you can change post to get and see what kind of urls are generated

11488611
inherited	subclassing
for example another lower-level way to detect when the text in a textfield has changed might be to create your own custom nstextfield subclassing in which you override the keydown method that nstextfield inherited from nsresponder

11488611
inherited	subclassing
however subclassing like that is difficult because it can require that you have an intimate knowledge of the object s inherited hierarchy

11488619
post	get
a naive approach to checking for raw connectivity without creating a get post connection would be

11488619

11488667
google-chrome	firefox
you don t say what problem you re really trying to solve so it s a little hard to know what solutions make the most sense for you but you can write javascript that works on any web page in a browser plug-in like in google-chrome or firefox or by using a scripting language outside of a browser python javascript php etc... where you load the page contents and then manipulate the contents using the language tools

11488688
codeigniter	cakephp
you should look into using a php framework such as codeigniter symphony or cakephp

the answer about the data field being incorrect is right but something this simple shouldn t be a post it should just be a get which doesn t need the data field at all

11488747
getter	setter
i understand how to do getter setter but i was wondering how to do them with hashmaps

11488822
serializable	deserialization

11489017
int	chars
the routine isdigit takes an int argument but it expects that int value to represent a chars

11489017
int	chars
since you re using scanf to convert the input to an int the value stored in a no longer represents a chars

11489017
fgets	strtol
in this case you ll probably want to use fgets to read the user input then use strtol to convert the value to a signed long integer and perform the validation at the same time

11489020
treemap	linkedhashmap
that said you probably want to use linkedhashmap instead of hashmap if displaying the map entries in insertion order is important or treemap if you want to automatically sort them by map key

width	height
the modelview matrix represents the orientation of the camera relative to the points being drawn and the projection matrix represents the camera dimensions width and height field of view nearest and furthest visible ranges etc

11489881
primefaces	richfaces
actually there is no built-in jsf solution for this problem there are drag and drop components in richfaces and primefaces but those don t work for your case

11489881
getter	setter
note don t sort your list in the getmylist method remember that jsf framework do 1 or more calls to getter and setter so these methods shouldn t have a heavy logic inside them

11489892
submit	submission
i wanted to stop the form submission perform validation through js and then submit the form from there i used onsubmit return false

11489903
ant	maven
suggested above tools like maven or ant - just handle the process of building your application and can put your jar in a correct place but imo you should still understand what goes where and what are responsibilities of each component tool

11489903

11489955
submit	submission
javascript function here so i don t know what it contains but if it doesn t already do so i d include code to submit the form via that javascript function submission the form once validation has been successful or returning some sort of human readable error if validation fails - that combined with using button instead of submit should solve your problem

11489955
submit	submission
some browsers will process events handlers such as onclick prior to submission forms via the submit input type

11489969
maven	pom.xml
because maven always runs things in the working directory of the pom.xml unless you configure it differently which i think you can do in the surefire plugin which is what runs test cases

11490002
oncreate	setcontentview
calling setcontentview does not cause oncreate to be run - and that is where i m guessing you link the onclick listener to the button

11490013

i canÃ¢ t tell why you get different results on firefox than on google-chrome unless you have left fonts to their defaults and the browsers use different defaults

11492384
hide	show
this means that the elements with the complexonly class only show when the togglebutton is not in the simple-state they hide in simple state

11492415
int	double
in numerical expressions using different data types unless specified the default choices would be int and double

11492415

put	get
the itemgroupcontroller then has get delete and put methods

11492541

note if you are using alternative http servers like nginx you must search down all of the .htaccess files created in magento s directory tree and recreate all the .htaccess functions used by magento in your nginx setups so you have the same file directory protections as a standard apache dso install

11493812
qgraphicsview	qwidget

getter	setter
so i have a question on setter and getter methods and how useful they are or aren t

11498287
getter	setter
it has come to my attention however that it s better practice to make the variables in the account class private and then use setter and getter methods

11498289
button	checkbox
how to insert the value of radio button and checkbox together into 1 row database..for example the table contains name of menu and the size of the food

11498289

the database table contains food and price..so when we choose which menu we want with checkbox and choose the size of our food use radio button the value of checkbox and radio button will store in 1 row database..

11498295
countif	named
i have named several ranges in excel and would like to use them in a formula countif

11498333

11498352
filtering	grouping	sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering
recalculation means sorting filtering grouping and all other operations except repainting

11498355
getter	setter
as a matter of fact it doesn t prevent and there s no difference until you change access modifiers for getter setter methods or add additional logic into them

11498355
getter	setter
using getter setter are a good practice and used in several approaches like pojos and javabeans but if you are not going to add custom logic into getter setter and are not going to use these approaches you will be satisfied of using direct access to the fields

11498355
getter	setter
using getter setter you can provide computed at the runtime fields that do not exists persistently in the object

11498356
getter	setter
the advantage of using setter ans getter is that you can include rules for lazy initialization validation etc

11498360
button	checkbox
how to insert the value of radio button and checkbox together into 1 row database..for example the table contains name of menu and the size of the food

11498360
button	checkbox
the database table contains food and price..so when we choose which menu we want with checkbox the value of checkbox will store in food database s table and choose the size of our food use radio button the value of radiobutton will store in price database s table

11498361
getter	setter
you can always develop an application without using getter and setter methods.as you have explained.but using getter and setter is better practice because access modifiers private public gives you encapsulation which is oops feature

11498383
getter	setter
this is called encapsulation when you are declaring some private instance variables and declaring public getter and setter method to access and change the instance variables value

11498383
getter	setter
if you are using these getter and setter methods to access set instance variables then it grantees that your program would not fail if developer changes the instance variable names

11498383
getter	setter
for example in current version you are using name address balance instance variables and are accessing them without getter and setter methods like myaccount.setname blah blah

11498383
getter	setter
but what if next version developer changes instance variable name from name to username in that case user program will break but if you are using getter and setter it would not break as developer would not change getter and setter method name according to oops fundamentals

11498386
dictionary	map
i have to do this many times is their an easy way to map dictionary to a table like this

11498404
textview	imageview

justmock	typemock	nunit	typemock	nunit	justmock	nunit	moq	moq	typemock	moq	justmock
i ve looked at ninject structuremap moq typemock justmock nunit xunit etc.

11498476
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller are just derived from uiviewcontroller

11498502
implements	extends
the only cases where you need to #include an .h from an .h is when you actually extends a class or implements a protocol

11498503
min	max	range	max	range	min
both axes may show different scales range min - max like temperature from 0 to 100 degree kelvin pressure from 300 to 900 kpa and accordingly the series will be plotted

11498595
versioning	upgrade
when i upgrade my versioning of ruby i had to reinstall my gems

11498600
fadein	fadeout
this is the code you should use setting a callback function on the fadein to queue the fadeout

11498610
std	ostream	cout	ofstream
since std ofstream inherits from the same type as std cout is an instance of std ostream their interfaces are the same some methods are added to the file-handling stream but other than that they are interchangeable

11498610
std	ostream
to make sure you use the same implementation no matter if you are writing to a file or standard-output you could wrap the code in a function making it accept a reference to std ostream as in the below snippet

11498627
width	height
i have been playing with the demos of draw2d graphiti just curious to know if its possible to scale change width height in editor svgfigure for example the opamp just like how basic shapes can be scaled

11498631
mongodb	bson
i know i am calculating the size of python dictionaries not bson documents and mongodb takes in bson documents but that cant turn 500kb into 16+ mb

11498652
free	malloc
now in your module you need to manage allocate and free memory chunks from this pool and not bother with malloc

11498718
post	get
it sounds like you need a http server and differentiate between http get for downloading files to the client and post to upload files to the server instead of differentiating the types with pipelines

11498729
put	get
in short is there a way to send a put request using afhttpclient a subclass of with the passed parameters appended and encoded as the query string just like a get request

treemap	treeset
take for example treeset or treemap in java which is a red black tree

11498851
google-chrome	firefox
see the rules for cascading in particular the section on specificity make sure your css is valid and use the tools provided by browsers google-chrome developer tools the firebug extension for firefox etc to see which rules are being applied to the elements you care about in which order

11498856
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i think the embedding you re referring to is the embed in menu item which only allows for uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller

11498872
getter	setter
secondly backbone s model mutation observation is based on events model wrappers and use of artificial getter and setter

11498872
getter	setter
not only that this can be very inefficient due to lack of event coalescence there might be a workaround for this in latest backbone versions but the use of artificial getter and setter also interferes with the jit compiler in your browser

11498872
ember.js	backbone.js
backbone.js + ember.js

11498904
getter	setter
create public getter and setter to access those instance variable

11498904
getter	setter
getter and setter helps validating the input to the instance variable

11498986
screens	hdpi
but if i define the other imageviews smaller ones that are placed on the screens in relation to the sizes defined above let s say an imageview has dimensions 20x20 for the hdpi devices if i calculate this dimensions for the ldpi devices the image would have to be 7x7 pixels which is terribly small then the ldpi devices won t be able to see anything on the screens or will they

11499056
mdpi	hdpi
you could well have those images as only mdpi and supply an hdpi version so that it atleast has a higher resolution image for hdpi and xdpi devices

11499161
uploadify	swfupload
but it s still a solid way of doing it uploadify or swfupload

11499161
youtube	vimeo
i think you should look how other companies are doing it like web picasa not really good example as most of files are less than 5mo but yousendit is a solid actor i think they re using flash but should check as well as youtube vimeo dailymotion video actors

11499173
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if you re talking about embed as in interface builder yes as of ios 5 interface builder only gracefully designs user interfaces for three view controller containers uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller and uisplitviewcontroller

11499193
cos	sin
here speed_x and speed_y are sin direction and cos direction possibly swapped or with some coefficients

11499232
fadein	fadeout
iam trying to implement simple jquery fadein fadeout to my website

11499274
mdpi	hdpi
also it always helps to fire up the appropriate simulator middle size with mdpi smallest size with ldpi and biggest size with hdpi depending on what devices you are planning to support and try your layouts out

11499317
hide	show
you can add multiple view on one screen and do hide show to display multiple screens

11499359
implements	extends
though it might be better idea to create a custom basemodel that will extends the backbone.model and implements your custom logic so that if backbone gets updated etc

11499362
devise	cancan
i have setup devise and cancan only users of group admin can access rails_admin

i think that the feed pushing service i use became strict with the rss validation

11499408
mediarecorder	audiorecord
if you really want to read audiosamples i would suggest you to use audiorecord instead of mediarecorder since it gives you more control on audiosamples.

11499440
inherited	properties
i ve googled for articles on vb6 s support for polymorphism but all of the articles that i read merely mentioned that you can make a derived class inherited properties and methods from a derived class

11499510
hide	show
to hide show different views xaml objects panels use their name and visibility property for example

11499533
objectdatasource	formview
i m working with objectdatasource and formview control

11499552
hide	show
if you want to achieve a hide show multiple views in a single page without navigating to a new page you can do that with the help of usercontrols

11499552
hide	show
you can define as many usercontrols views as you want and then hide are show them based on your requirements in the yourpage.xaml

11499629
width	height
now change to height width or height according to your design

11499644

you must put hibernate.cfg.xml into src directory in the same folder that your packages or class

11499781
mdpi	hdpi
i ve only placed mdpi and hdpi images inside each folder but when i run my app on an ldpi device it won t pick the images from the mdpi folder but from the hdpi folder

11499841
public	protected
to disallow copying of derived instances using the copy ctor of base the inheritance needs to be protected instead of public

11499871
touchesmoved	touchesended
if you want to update your image at some point do it on touchesended but not for every touchesmoved

11499892
multiplying	add
whenever the two indexes share a digit this can be determined using the operator multiplying the content of those two buckets together and add the product to a globally maintained sum

11499920
google-chrome	firefox
you can do this by looking into the source code or better with firebug firefox or developer tools ie google-chrome in the network tab

11499921
multiplying	division	multiplying	subtract	division	subtract
one possible solution would be to multiplying oldyear by 12 thus converting it to months adding or subtract addmonths or submonths respectively and then converting back to newyear and newmonth by using integer and modular division depending on your programming language you may be able to simplify this

11499931
draggable	droppable
so i read most of what s out there and could actually build a simple enough draggable and droppable component that basically generate the right amount of jquery js to support drag drop up until i can associate the draggable object and the droppable container and pretty much drag drop things around

11499962
move	drag
the div move with the mouse even if its not click drag action its just a mouseover action
