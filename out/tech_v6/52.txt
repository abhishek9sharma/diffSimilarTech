a parent can and cannot have children in all the tables it could have in child1 and child3 athe same time or just child2 or in no one

6700004
children	parent
these tables are static it is always the parent and 3 children

6700019
performselector	delegation
exc_bad_access means that your delegation was already deallocated when you sent it the message didtouchimageview i assume that everything is ok when you send the message performselector it would be too easy

6700149
children	parent
4 at any point in time the parent script must be able to accept messages from all of its children

6700149
children	parent
i thought of using zeromq and have the parent be a single subscriber while the children will all be publishers

6700149
children	parent
also how do i allow all the children to continuously read the contents of the numpy array that was defined by the parent

6700153
width	height
if i had to take a guess at explaining this effect then i would say that during the resize operation the update of top and left takes precedence over that of width and height which results in both not being updated an equal amount of times

6700161

when an android device queries the server a servlet gets an entity from the datastore modifies it and puts it back into the datastore to update the datastore entry

6700244
hash	salt
using a hash or similar to detect if the transmission was decrypted having a salt hash makes it harder not impossible to change or forge message contents

6700318
pull	push
i think it makes more sense to use push pull sockets as you have a standard ventilator - workers - sink scenario except that the ventilator and the sink are the same process

6700330
google-chrome	firefox
here is code tested on ie7 ie8 firefox and google-chrome

use mktime to add or subtract the user s offset as needed

6700642
integer	fractions
the length function returns an int and the div function performs integer division in other words it drops the fractions part

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
looking at your code with each button press you not only alloc and init a new webview but also a new uiviewcontroller and a new uinavigationcontroller

6700715
keydown	keyup
edit keycode for escape should be 27 and you can also try using keyup instead of keydown

6700726
stdout	stderr
why is stderr redirecting properly but not stdout

6700785
for-loop	arrays
you could also do a for-loop as you would for an arrays but instead of arrays i you would use list.get i

here is my question how do i orient one of the tabs to landscape while leaving the other two in portrait mode

6701060
interrupt	wakeup
calling interrupt isn t suitable because doing so sets the interrupt flag and after a spurious wakeup the interrupt flag is not set

6701065
google-chrome	firefox
if you re using google-chrome or firefox console.log will output the object that you can inspect

6701102

i am using javascript to show hide a nested gridview to show some details inside a main gridview like so

6701102
hide	show
so this works fine but what code is needed to add animation to the show hide for smoother effect

6701142
integer	radix
a subject sequence interpreted as an integer represented in some radix determined by the value of base

6701202
width	height
i know this is not a css solution but i would always specify the width and height attributes of the image tag rather than in css - this will resolve your scrunching issue for missing images

6701212
maven	pom.xml
maven requires very specific project structure relative to pom.xml

6701212
maven	pom.xml
when you copied pom.xml your java files and resources were left inside my-app so maven didn t find any and produced empty jar

6701263
mouseover	mouseout
also .hover is a shortcut method in jquery to handle mouseover and mouseout at the same time

6701310

unsigned integer type with the property that any valid pointer to void

6701335
put	get
so if you want to get any parameters from kml you need to put them in that section

6701345
width	height
or you can make div span wrapper around images and give them fixed height and width like

6701354
pop-up	dialog
go to help then go to install new software and the install dialog pop-up

6701356
post	get
i figured to get around this i needed to set the user_id attribute of the post first then let the rest of the attributes be set as they normally are

6701360
sorting	grouping
to remove this behavior you can right-click on the category grouping go to sorting tab and delete the entry there

6701361
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome and firefox but when i try in ie the div which is loaded by the jquery pushes the content downward

6701428
perforce	svn
this is more problematic with centralised version control systems such as perforce svn etc because there isn t much of a concept of a personal private branch

6701439
getter	setter
that being said the loss will be minor and obviously you ll gain the flexibility of being able to change the setter and getter at a later date such as if you end up making that value implicit such that it s not technically stored in memory or passing it off to a third object or doing something asynchronous to store that may require you to block on the getter in some circumstances

6701449
for-loop	loops
how come that i can easily do a for-loop in python to loops through all the elements of a dictionary in the order i appended the elements but there s no obvious way to access a specific element

6701451
getter	setter
you only access the property thru its setter and getter with the dot-notation or by calling the setter getter explicitly like which is an exact equivalent as this is what the compiler translates to when compiling your code

6701463
post	get
you could either use a simple form to submit the value from the combobox to the server as http post or http get and use the value as a variable in you sql statement or you could use a simple ajax request to send the necessary information to your php script

6701479
min	max
when you add a point compute the new point s distance to all other points and replace your saved max and min together with its corresponding set of endpoint pairs if the new point participates in a better max or min or update the set of endpoints if it matches the current best

6701590
width	height
the sizes you specify with width and height affect how much space the control takes up in the layout this means that the control may take more or less space but the font size will stay the same for example

6701592
button	checkbox
when you say the checkbox are mandatory i assumed you needed radio button

the first is for categories and the group of checkbox radio button is for jobinfo.job_type

6701600
hide	show
here is the javascript jquery code to hide show the div and change the text from show details to hide details

6701622
pop-up	dialog
your code for the pop-up dialog should look similar to this

6701684
mouseleave	mouseenter
instead of always keeping a mouseleave event around only create it when it s necessary and then trash it when we re done since there will only ever be one mouseleave event for each mouseenter event

6701707
getdate	datepart
btw using datepart mm getdate gives a 1-digit month not 2 digits and datepart yy getdate gives a 4-digit year not 2 digits

6701738
google-chrome	safari
if you inspect the html dom elements of the game in safari google-chrome you ll see it s not even canvas it s almost pure html divs and lots of css3 transformations

6701755
cdr	cons
i didn t dig too deep in how your code is supposed to work because there are actually several errors in the ssum cons car l cdr cdr l line you call cons with only one argument but you also have only one form in this cond clause whereas it should have a test and at least one expression behind

6701760
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately it doesn t work in google-chrome or firefox 5

filtering	grouping
i m stuck with mfcc implementation i ve already applied triangular windows to my frames to grouping them by frequency so far at this point everything goes ok i also have an implementation of spectagram using bark scale and if i plot both they look very similar next thing would be getting the natural logarithm of every value if i plot at this point i think everything goes wrong but someone told me that at this point is still ok but when i get to the discrete cosine transform everything goes to hell cuz i get a really hughe value on the first filtering of every frame and on the others really low values some values are

6701850
filtering	grouping
i m using j+1 cause the first filtering is on the position j 0 on the array so m 1 is actually on position j 0 so j 1 is actually m 2 and so on... and well you all know the formula for the dct i don t think the problem is at any other part of the code since the images look good after grouping them with the triangular filtering and the natural logarithm i m using is the one providad in the math class so anyone has an idea of why am i getting this strange results

6701895

6702100
concave	convex
hey so i recently asked this question about how to cut down a concave polygon to convex ones and i was suggested to do triangulation or polygon partioning

if you use git push --set-upstream origin foo bar you can then use just git push and git pull on that branch without having to specify remote and branch names

6702115
mdpi	hdpi
reason why i want to get the original image size is to cater for hdpi mdpi and ldpi so i can set dimensions of the bitmap to 36 x 36 24 x 24 and 18 x 18 respectively before adding it to the imagebutton

6702121

there is a lot going on there so i think i m just going to leave a general outline as to how i would handle this for a small website a website with a large amount of traffic would include cache tables cron jobs and all sorts of funness

6702186
width	height
i would like that if the picture is too big width and or height to fit it will be cropped to the size of the scrollview not the screen size

6702187
pull	push
i am trying to use python with zeromq in push pull mode sending messages of size 4 mb every few seconds

6702193
concave	convex
not a full answer to your question but if you have a general polygon concave convex whatever and you are looking to triangulate it for subsequent opengl style rendering perhaps you could look into constrained delaunay triangulation packages

6702196
integer	unsigned
in that case you will have to decide whether to use a signed or unsigned integer type intptr_t or uintptr_t

6702212
min	max
the reason for the difference is that by design mysql allows columns in the select to not be stated in the group by or aggregate functions max min count etc

6702226
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
you must use an aggregate-functions to describe that like min to select the smallest value max to select the largest value or sum to select the sum of all the values being replaced

6702231

6702456
stdout	stderr
the api says that they write to stdout and stderr respectively

6702505
stdout	stderr
the console methods are more robust in that you can pass n arguments and they will be concatenated before being written to stdout or stderr but they are both convenience wrappers around the same underlying calls to stdout and stderr

6702516
memcached	apc
the problem is my hosting doesn t support memcached nor apc

glibc	newlib	libc	newlib
you are also correct that the semantics of the and family of functions are different if both match they will always agree on the value and consume the same number of characters and any libc implemetation where they do not is broken including newlib and glibc last time i checked but additionally fails to match cases where it would need to backtrack more than one character as in your examples 0x and 1.0e+

stateless	stateful
if the server does not hear the client anymore for some time period for example two times the heartbeat interval he can conclude that the client disconnected however this requires a stateful server and your design is stateless so it would require event processing in a secondary system which could be fed through a message queue

you would need a dictionary attack try all the possibilities and the point of using hash is just that this would take you years for sha-256 or hours for md5

writetofile	nsdata
if you wanted a compact but still portable representation you could manually serialize the individual cgfloats into a byte array in a portable format this previous question may help you there and then wrap the byte arrays in nsdata put the nsdatas into an nsarray and use writetofile atomically to output the mess to a plist like apple does

6708403
hide	show
the hidden attribute must not be used to hide content that could legitimately be show in another presentation

6708403
hide	show
for example it is incorrect to use hidden to hide panels in a tabbed dialog because the tabbed interface is merely a kind of overflow presentation â one could equally well just show all the form controls in one big page with a scrollbar

what i m trying to do is running a bteq script that gets data from a db then exports to a flat-file that flat file is picked up my a perl script the above code then with this post trying to get perl to import that file it gets into a fastload file

getter	setter
answer you can think of property as an behaviour definition of your property so that when you use the synthezie the compiler will know how to interpret the getter and setter for this property

6708595

6708730
argumentnullexception	argumentexception	notsupportedexception	argumentexception	notsupportedexception	argumentnullexception
you should generally never catch usage exceptions like argumentexception argumentnullexception notsupportedexception etc

6708730
notsupportedexception	argumentexception	pathtoolongexception	argumentexception
unfortunately this particular method path.getfullpath was not designed well with those guidelines in mind so you need to handle argumentexception notsupportedexception and pathtoolongexception to validate the user input

6708769
width	height
the canvas width and height are set to the values of the display resolution

6708780
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
argumentnullexception inherits from argumentexception for instance

6708780
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
many would tell you that even getting an argumentexception or argumentnullexception means that you as the developer have failed to validate things higher up in your call

use qdir entryinfolist to return a list of qfileinfo objectsd and then check the state of each of them you can also use filters to only return a list of files and or dirs

6709170
mouseover	mouseleave
all the li elements under the dom element with the name navigation that do not have the class active assigned to them should be bound to the mouseover and mouseleave event handlers given

6709170

6709192
cos	sin
edit to address the omg is it + or - or what question you need to look a little further to see whether you re multiplying by sin or cos of

6709192
cos	sin
because sin 0 0 and cos 0 1 you are looking at the difference between a window that looks approximately

6709203
powerpc	i386
make sure you re using gcc version 4.0 or later and add -arch flags for the architectures you want -arch i386 or -arch x86_64 -arch powerpc -arch ppc64 will compile for 32- and 63-bit intel and 32- and 64-bit powerpc

hide	show
if you actually want to show and hide it it will need to be contained in an element instead of a standalone text node

6709259
dictionary	map
you could use a dictionary to map different key presses to functions and add to that dictionary wherever it made sense structurally

6709365
bazaar	git
first solution that suggest andy is using hg git bazaar blame and carefully check output for all affected files

6709365
bazaar	git
another solution is using hg git bazaar bisect you can also manually perform updates to find first revision in which bug introduced

everything works correctly in ie7 ie8 firefox safari and google-chrome

6709777
post	put
start thinking in terms of what actually is happening not how the verbs are called co ci add update etc. what happening is that files are created in the repository thats a put or modified thats a post or deleted removed thats a delete or the status is queried that is status

6709777
post	get
to the end of the resource urls and use post to add an author and get to read the authors

6709803
width	height
you need to set up a minimum width height for a div container for the page content

6709803
width	height
use width and height css tags on a div containing the page content

6709850
for-loop	arrays
then you can use a for-loop to run through the arrays like so

example if i try to include the check of using the same condition but just swapping next for return i get an error that in the line and likewise if i put any of those conditions into the subroutine

6710075
pop-up	dialog
it pop-up a system dialog to unblock the behavior from the app but it runs

6710080
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome do not display scroll bars unless the content actually needs to scroll

6710101
min	max
the min value is 7200 seconds and the max is 43200

6710151
equals	gethashcode
specifically i d like to avoid accidentally mixing parentkey and childkey when used as keys of some container since their implementations of gethashcode or equals might be incompatible

6710243
equals	gethashcode
either use composition or carefully craft your equals and gethashcode methods so that everyone plays together nicely

6710252
post	get
in a jquery.ajaxcomplete how can i detect the http method specifically a get or a post

6710284
post	get
you can therefore look for the type property on it to see whether it was get or post

6710313
width	margin
the solution is similar position the twitter button in the center with a left margin that is half the width of the content plus the border

6710394
keydown	keyup
i ve tried to trap the enter key to see if i could modify this behavior but the enter key doesn t trap on new rows on either keyup or keydown events

6710404
move	drag
i m attempting to make a application where you can drag scatterviewitems next to each other and the items will dock together so that you can move them around as a single item

6710472
int	double
what i need is a way for the application to send an object user defined or c# int double string etc. across the app domain boundary allow the plug-in to edit it directly the address like a pointer and then return and have the object keep the value as was set by the plugin

6710479
mouse	keyboard
my problem was graphics disappearing once certain visuals animations had taken place for example if you check the website link above the keyboard and screen are separate movie clips contained in another body movie clip the screen is animated the keyboard wasn t so after 10 seconds or so the screen or certain portions would simply vanish until the mouse had been moved or something had been rendered

6710480
hide	show
i have a rather extensive list of titles and definitions to which i have a show hide effect applied to

6710481
accessor	properties
the problem was a slow network access that was hidden behind a properties accessor and had nothing to do with the web browser control

6710499
put	get
for the client to get packets of data we put the http connection into chucked encoding mode so that each packet is in one chucked packet

6710499
backgrounding	multitasking
on ios with this backgrounding multitasking rules means you can t keep this connection going while your application is in the backgrounding

6710513
firefox	safari
also please note that some users also use non-ie browsers which don t support filereader safari older versions of firefox and so on

6710546
realloc	malloc
realloc can return the trailing portion of the memory of a malloc back to the allocation pool but can t return it to the os

6710561
folder	directory
when i want to upload files to my live server nginx mysql php5-fpm i first backup my www folder extract the databases scp everything to my server which is tedious because it s protected with opiekey log myself in copy the files from my home directory on the server to my www directory and if i m lucky and the file permissions and everything else works out i can view the changes online

6710561
folder	directory
for example i m always copying files into my home directory on the server because scp cannot seem to copy them directly into the var www folder

6710565
put	get
i m trying to use a simplecursoradapter with a viewbinder to get an image from the database and put it into my listview item view

6710573
switching	screens
however as soon as i switching the device to portrait the display seems to be horizontally scaled in order to match the width of the screens on the device

6710581
free	malloc
typically on my system 2.6.36 i can free all the unused but allocated memory by just doing a while 1 malloc

6710599
put	get
i put a print statement into the backing bean s only get method and i noticed that the get method is called 6 times during the render response phase

6710601
for-loop	loops
i found a simple condition where using while loops is better than for-loop

6710601
for-loop	loops
if i have to use the value of counter in my program then i think while loops is better than for-loop

6710601
for-loop	loops
in this case i found while loops is better than for-loop because if i want to achieve the same in for-loop i have to assign the value of counter to another variable

6710601
for-loop	loops
but is there any specific situation when while loops is better than for-loop

6710604
java.util.date	simpledateformat
simpledateformat does just what it sounds like it does it formats instances of java.util.date or in your case it converts the long value into the context of a java.util.date and it doesn t know what to do with intervals which is what you apparently are working with

6710606
margin	height
assuming you know the height of your image position it absolutely with top 50 and a top margin that is half the height of the image

6710635
for-loop	loops
a for-loop is just a special kind of while loops which happens to deal with incrementing a variable

6710635
for-loop	loops
you can emulate a for-loop with a while loops in any language

6710635
for-loop	loops
so no there is no specific situation where one is better than the other although for readability reasons you should prefer a for-loop when you re doing simple incremental loops since most people can easily tell what s going on

6710639
for-loop	loops
when you know this before entering loops you can use for-loop

6710643
for-loop	loops
as for your question a for-loop is usually better when you want a piece of code to run a certain number of times and a while loops is better when the condition for the code to keep running is more general such as having a boolean flag that is only set to true when a certain condition is met in the code block

6710657
post	get
however when i use the following code i get an error 411 post requests require a content-length header

6710670
for-loop	while-loop
anything that a while-loop can do can also be done in a for-loop and anything a for-loop can do can also be done in a while-loop

6710685
post	get
you might get a better answer if you post more of your code

6710700
for-loop	loops
everything done with a for-loop can be done with a while loops but not

6710700
for-loop	loops
all while loops can be implemented with a for-loop

6710700
for-loop	loops
basically for loops are just short hand for while loops any for-loop can be converted from

6710707
google-chrome	firefox
it work nicely on ie8 firefox and google-chrome

6710707
google-chrome	firefox
also the font size don t appear to be the same as ie8 firefox and google-chrome

6710718
chown	chmod
assuming you have root access change the group chown on var www or better yet a sub directory to your group and change the permissions to allow your group write access chmod g+w

6710724
hide	show
my code works beautfiully it show when i need it to show and hide when i need it to go away

6710724
hide	show
the only problem is when a user clicks radio box within the group but the radio box does not have the correct value to show the container container ex my false condition jquery will very quick show the box then hide it again

6710757
pull	push
instead of having a push strategy where producers send directly messages to consumers you could use a pull strategy where consumers request messages from producers

6710809
stdout	stderr
i ve created a process and hooked the stdin stdout stderr file descriptors to ones i can read write and i actually drive the input and read the output

6710822
sorting	grouping
my question is better to do the grouping in sql server and return the last result and show it in c# report or get the data without grouping or sorting and do it in c# report you know in c# reports you can make grouping and chose what fields to grouping by

6710886
width	height
generally to align boxes vertically one of the best methods are to make em all block box so they can accept width and height then set the height of all of them to the highest box then try to vertical-align contents in each box

6710891
outputstream	inputstream
change inputstream outputstream to with self with dot syntax everywhere

6710902
capitalize	uppercase
typically the name starts with an uppercase i and then the rest is camel case where the first letter of each word is capitalize and the rest is lower case

6710932
hide	show
i have an existing flex application that uses databinding to show hide certain elements

6710932
hide	show
the problem with this is that while the show event plays perfectly the item disappears from view before the hide effect has a chance to play

6710957
mouse	keyboard
know i can select automatic mode it with the mouse on the assistant editor jump bar but i really want a keyboard shortcut to do this

6711042
post	get
basically you only need to use ssl when you post and get data from the server which are sensitive

6711084
children	parent
4 at any point in time the parent script must be able to accept messages from all of its children

6711084
children	parent
i thought of using rabbitmq and have the parent be a producer of the numpy array to its children

6711118
width	height
some objects have length width height depth

6711169
public	protected
furthermore you can set properties as public protected or private

6711180
datamodel	domain-model
i would suggest not worrying about your datamodel until you have defined you domain-model first

6711192
width	height
here is another example with what you gave length width height depth

6711222
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i have tried making the nsstring declaration to nsmutablestring .

6711235
rss	feed
they can range from adding a shortcode or fetching a rss feed to large blocks of code that duplicate functionality of commercial programs

6711257
nsmutablestring	nsstring
changing nsstring to nsmutablestring won t give you an nsmutablearray object

6711266
post	get
once the user submits the form its redirect to a page where i get the ids of the selected friends in order to post to their walls

6711273
int	chars
this example could be useful for int chars and string

6711294
children	parent
if a parent object starts off with a list of 3 children objects removes child 1 and calls session.update parent what kind of hibernate mapping would i need in order to clear the parent pk from the removed child table without deleting the removed child completely

6711294
children	parent
i can successfully cascade update children by simply calling session.update parent but i m having trouble doing the reverse

6711299
put	get
i am having an issue with one of the lines of code of my code and i don t know what to put to get it to work

6711300
hide	show
there can be two things can be done through jquery to do your things is just remove the attributed disabled disabled and on document ready use the hide and on doing some even again show you required input box the code to do that is as under

6711345
inherited	properties
that is if the visible properties of the parent control is set to false the child control inherited that setting and the setting takes precedence over any local setting .

6711355
gridview	rowdatabound
you can add a new cell in rowdatabound event of the gridview like below

6711379
nhibernate	queryover
2 - someone recommended some nice implementation of repository base generic with nhibernate queryover

6711383
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
only noticing this 1px issue in google-chrome tested in safari 5 firefox 5 also

6711390
jobs	cron
you need to look into cron jobs to automate script execution automatically

6711418
width	height
keep in mind you can put all sorts of stuff in the style now like text size height and width

6711440
src	attr
attr src signatures + #username png

6711444
midi	osc
i would use osc rather an midi

6711444
midi	osc
osc will let you deliver your data over ethernet at a much finer granularity than the ancient 3kb s venerable snail that is midi

6711444
midi	osc
you won t be sending midi notes via osc with a lot of success but you can do so much more

6711452
matplotlib	scipy
this book deals with numpy scipy matplotlib and other examples which are important for scientist

6711460
hide	show
i didn t copy all of your mockup and i used lists instead of divs but this answer will do what you need even using the show and hide by using the corresponding index in the parent methodology you are using

6711522
free	malloc
i don t know what operating system you re using but if this is linux i d suspect that chrome malloc is allocating memory from a program-managed heap size determined using the sbrk system call and the free lists are managed by the c standard library but when you reach a certain size threshold it switches to using mmap to ask the kernel to allocate large chunks of memory that don t interfere with the sbrk -managed heap

6711577
int	chars
also there are int values which do not map back to valid unicode or utf-16 strings which produce unpaired surrogates instead of valid chars

6711679
width	height
first i wrapped the iframe in a div and set the iframe s width and height to be 100

6711683
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
three arguments the jqxhr in jquery 1.4.x xmlhttprequest object a

6711689
getter	setter
i d be careful about overwriting the setchildren method as hibernate needs plain getter and setter

6711702
portrait	landscape
that s what i ve found as necessary in app i m making thought i need the picker to be in portrait but i need it to apply some ui changes if user rotate his device to landscape

6711750
stdout	stderr
i m writing a ruby script that will execute another piece of code capturing its stdout and stderr and writing them to a file

6711750
stdout	stderr
apparently in ruby at least stderr is unbuffered and stdout is buffered which in my case results in out-of-order output as the stderr lines get printed before some stdout lines

6711761
getter	setter
it s setter getter are not tied directly together

6711768
width	height
max width is 700px but you can have higher height .

6711771
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
on hover right now the box containing more information in yellow is being displayed correctly on google-chrome safari firefox and ie 8

6711777
hash	md5
an idea i ve had is to add an extra column to the table that holds an md5 hash of the contents of the other columns

6711777
hash	md5
when the xml is parsed the md5 hash is created of each advert and then added as a final column

6711777
hash	md5
once the records have been added 100k upwards to the table a query is run to identify any matching md5 hash but this takes too long and often times out the query even if the timeout has been extended

6711777
hash	md5
my question then is is the md5 hash route the best one

6711824
hash	md5
we use md5 hash to quickly identify rows and have hundreds of millions of rows of data so i would say this is an appropriate choice

6711826
clang	llvm
if you want to learn a little about the compiler internals for this without digging very deep look at llvm getelementptr this is exactly how a c++ compiler like clang would target llvm when compiling a struct reference

6711854
gridview	sqldatasource
i have gridview when i connect the sqldatasource and run the application data from stored procedure is shown but when i switch to design mode the schema does not loads in gridview

6711856
post	put
i m calculating the difference field by taking the grandtotal of the salesman s subtotals and subtracting them from the budget field that was put into the group footer since i m new i can t post images sorry

6711898
getter	setter
as i know if they are public then playframework uses generated invisible getter and setter for them

6711898
getter	setter
no getter and setter and then i should write them by myself

6711970
jax-ws	jax-rs
i dont need a lot of feature from glassfish full profile like jax-ws jaxb jax-rs .

6711973
width	height
and what would be really cool is if one could declare the column width and row height up above just like a grid

6712014
post	get
the first case of returning a list of ids isn t very helpful to you because then you need to make an api call for each id in order to get some information about that post

6712031
put	get
there are different types of requests get put etc but in all cases the response is just how the other end replies back whether it s with binary data images files etc html or an error code

6712031
httprequest	httpresponse
as for an httprequest and httpresponse these are just .net framweork objects that abstract away the details of reading the raw http data

6712060
tax	shipping
so on the cart page my customers can view the estimate shipping and tax area

6712060
tax	shipping
well i ve got the checkboxes in the template to display in the estimate shipping and tax when there is a freight item in the cart but i don t know much about the coshippingmethodform function so that i can add in the values of the checkboxes

6712072
getter	setter
why not have the framework generate the getter and setter for you similar to c#

6712072
getter	setter
of course since as noted in the documentation the generated getter and setter are only available at runtime the fields need to be declared public so the java compiler won t raise an error if code outside the class accesses the variable

6712072
getter	setter
better yet if you need specific logic in the getter or setter you can add it in

6712072
getter	setter
whether or not this is the right way to handle things is of course a matter of opinion but it s pretty common for java developers to look for easier ways of writing all those boilerplate getter and setter whatever it s relative merits groovy jython jruby and fantom all provide a mechanism for creating and accessing properties that results in syntax similar to what play is achieving

6712087
hide	show
for example i have a items.js in which i show some things on the screen but i want to hide all of those items when the user activates something in a phone.js

6712112
width	height
for input text i d suggest listening for the event.change event then updating the width height based on the number of lines the .textwidth or textlinemetrics info mytextfield.getlinemetrics

6712117
pascal	delphi
i tagged as delphi pascal because it s what i am working in atm but this could apply to all programming i guess

6712146
post	get
you would have to read in all http request headers and get post data in your python server process and then set them in the environment used by your php script

6712168
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
before setting a doctype this worked beautifully on google-chrome firefox safari mobile and opera

6712185
versioning	upgrade
i already upgrade too the latest vb6 versioning which is still quite old and made sure the file was in the right folder

6712190
postgresql	mysql
i created a small django patch that implements connection pooling of mysql and postgresql via sqlalchemy pooling

6712217
width	height
width and row height up above just like a grid

6712258
for-loop	arrays
in one of the answers to matlab linked list the responder suggests using java linked lists which seems like an excellent solution but it is not clear what an elegant way is to convert the linkedlist once constructed to a matlab cell arrays i guess one have a for-loop but that seems a little clunky.

6712303
hide	show
in case that site ever goes down essentially what you are going to need to investigate is using the hover selector to show and hide various parts of the menu at any given time

6712319
button	right-align
a right-align fixed width button looks better imho

6712352
hide	show
my intention was to hide the farbtastic feature but when the use doubleclick the textarea input the farbstastic feature show up

6712378
children	parent
then add the child node to the parent node s list of children

6712411
opera	firefox
this specific use case works best with css transitions plus you get free opera and firefox 3.5+ support

6712440
post	get
if my guess is wrong please post more code so we can get an idea of what the problem is

6712521
public	protected
in languages like c# or vb the standard is to start private things with lowercase and start public protected things with uppercase

6712526
post	put
you might think to simply put status update in the stream talking about the post however the graph api is also limited to 25 such direct feed post per day per app to prevent spamming

6712526
post	get
one solution would be to post to something like flickr get the url of the image and then post to the wall

6712538
post	get
if you can post code i can get more specific

6712546
width	height
the image has varying height and width and size-wise 4-30kb png files

6712547
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
to handle serialization use objectoutputstream and objectinputstream

6712600
pop-up	dialog
does anyone know how to save the text that the user will input after a dialog box pop-up

however from what i ve read about cryptography that is a rather naã ve way to generate salt hash but if you re doing it wrong when typing a-e-s in your source code i figured the same could be true in this case

6713533
implements	extends
my basic approach was to replace all h1-h6 tags using a regex and prepend them with which i implements by extends the tcpdf class

6713548
google-chrome	firefox
i d like to also be able to access these files for times when i run this application inside a regular browser like firefox or google-chrome

6713618
hash	salt
for most of the salt password schemes smd5 ssha the salt is stored after the password hash and its length can vary

6713633
getter	setter
for other class methods it s better to use the setter getter so i can use .

6713633
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	dealloc
as far as i know the behavior is the same than in my example so i should use the setter get method in the viewdidload or viewwillappear and released it in the dealloc without self

6713639
maven	pom.xml
basically here is a maven pom.xml that s a submodule in the multi-module project described above

6714103
rss	feed
i m using the code above to display text from an rss feed

6714126
post	get
additionally if you can confirm that the user meant to execute the script he she sent then you should also be protected from attackers if you will only run script typed onto the page and never script submitted via get or post data or if you include some kind of unique token with those requests to confirm that the request originated with your website

6714154
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
seems to work in opera and google-chrome but not in ie9 ff5 or safari

6714294

all i really want to do in most cases is show hide certain things

6714336
post	get
also have a look at post redirect get

6714341

6714733
rss	feed
i have a tableview that shows a list of rss feed in it s cells some times the list can get to long so i need to show like 15 items then have a bottom cell with load more

6714741

i would recommend using an array of chars instead of an array of strings - then when you ask the user for input and he enters say 1 3 - you can simply either declare two int and use them

6714745
submit	submission
once you have the text you want to submit ready to go you can post it to a url as a form submission

webkit	gecko
from this question is it possible to embed gecko or webkit in a windows form just like a webview

6714765
google-chrome	firefox
instead of panels activation google-chrome shows me just a blank right frame moreover since then my firefox 5.0 gwt dev plugin started do the same blank tricks as if it was replaced with the google-chrome one i think google-chrome caused all these things.

6714765
google-chrome	firefox
i have already uninstalled google-chrome but my firefox still tricks me with blank things.

6714809
agile	sprint
i feel i now understand that scrum is not agile in the sense that continuous deployment is core to agile and scrum is about a cadence of release points about 1 - 4 weeks part with a product owner that decides at the end of the sprint not in a continuous mid-sprint manner

6714842
rss	feed	pull	push
in addition to email you may consider a pull rather than push delivery mechanism e.g a message center web frontend or rss feed

6714853
y-combinator	combinators
other answers provide pretty concise answer to this without one important fact you don t need to implement fixed point combinators in any practical language in this convoluted way and doing so serves no practical purpose except look i know what y-combinator is

6714874
viewdidload	dealloc
also just to shed more light on where you should release arrays you created in viewdidload method it s the dealloc method first in addition to viewdidunload

6714874
viewdidload	dealloc
you should release the arrays you initialized viewdidload method and your other retain properties in dealloc method

6714877
put	get
when i specify the image url in the wordpress image insert box i put in www.greenstarkville.org and when i go to the image on my supporters page i get but i need it to go to www.greenstarkville.org

6714896

i ve heard that minitest is a lot faster and the minitest spec dsl looks pretty similar to how i m used to working with rspec so i thought i d give it a try

6715158
rspec	minitest
i learned how to test from the rspec book and i have no idea how test unit or minitest are supposed to work

6715158
rspec	minitest
can anyone explain to me how to setup some some minitest spec files and get them running so i can compare the performance against rspec

6715167
ant	maven
another possibility the maven ant tasks can deploy files

the gem was installed with bundler and i am using rvm

6715433
int	double
i tried replacing int area with double area but doesn t work

6715437
put	get
queue service interval measures the time between a put to an empty queue or a get that does not empty the queue and the next get

6715437
put	get
so the reason that you are not getting any event messages is not due to put activity but rather to a lack of get activity that would trigger an event

6715447
bash	zsh
if your target shells support arrays ksh bash zsh then you may be better off using an array

6715467
int	double
in addition to making area a double you ll also need to make at least one of the terms in a double or you ll only be doing int math which won t turn out how you expect

6715528
put	get
its still the case that i would put the access to the db via a singleton even if that s just to get the connection

6715589
google-chrome	firefox
i have successfully implemented firefox google-chrome and ie for browser testing

6715603
width	height

6715610
post	get
right now though i m having a lot of problem even trying to get a simple post request

6715624
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure about firefox but in v8 google-chrome you can use a method on the error constructor called capturestacktrace

6715653
onresume	onpause
however i find this activity calls oncreate onresume onpause onresume sequentially according to the output in logcat

6715653
onresume	onpause
it seems as if some a activity comes at front of my screensaver and finishes immediately so my screensaver calls onpause and then onresume

6715668
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for instance safari will the state change event at page load where google-chrome and firefox don t - causing in safari your content to load twice

6715669
post	get
by using server.get you re instructing that route to only respond to get requests but the form is obviously a post

6715669
post	get
you can also use server.any if you want to it respond to both get and post and every other http verb as well

6715709
uitapgesturerecognizer	uibutton
i would suggest that you use a uiimageview or put uibutton on the clickable areas with a blank background image or i would create a subclass of another uiimageview and use that for the button then each of the arms could be separate images and then use the uitapgesturerecognizer inside of your uiimageview subclass like this

6715739
qapplication	qcoreapplication
to wrap it up use an #ifdef in you main to select which presentation classes to use and switch between qcoreapplication for non-gui and qapplication for gui

you get the basic operations of add subtract multiplying divide exponentiate etc but those are usually powerful enough to do quite a bit of stuff

6715866
children	parent
3 controller should not build children object because you can only initialize and save parent object children will be saved automatically

6715933
getter	setter
getter and setter and constructor..

6715953
firefox	safari
this snippet works perfectly under chromer safari and firefox

6715978
unix	bsd
if you are using some sort of unix bsd you could try to do a locate common.py and check if it has a struct somewhere

6715981
versioning	upgrade
i am trying to upgrade the ruby versioning from ruby 1.8.7 to ruby 1.9.2 and rails 2.3.11 to rails 3.0.9 and when i am trying to start the server it is showing me

6716045

considering i want to create mongodb documents for a bunch of distinct urls what would be the pros and cons if any of using the actual url as the documents _id value instead of the default bson objectid

6716061
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome and firefox

6716112
implements	extends
i just need to know by extends and implements which classes will helps me to achieve this

6716116
hide	show
helpers handle html logic what to show hide to user

6716118
width	height
i would like to have an arrow which will do something on hover but only when the arrow itself is hovered not the rectangle which delimits its width and height

6716121
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i tried this in firefox ie google-chrome and opera and none of them applies the width if you don t make the anchor elements into block elements

6716125
xapian	whoosh
the established technologies lucene xapian whoosh have mature python bindings

6716146
mp3	wav
mp3 wav and aac adts and adif variants container formats do not support multiple audio streams

6716175
onresume	onpause
so if you want to clear value of that edittext when switching back to old activity you need to do it by hand either in onpause or onresume

6716204
inherited	properties
normally the liskov substitution principle in object orientation means a derived object can be substituted for a base object since inherited guarantees it has all base properties

6716254
hide	show
then when the trigger element is mousedown-ed you show hide the overlay

6716308
kerberos	ntlm
the returned value would be either ntlm or kerberos

6716315
haskell	ocaml
the reason i wanted to investigate this was because both c and ocaml were significantly faster than haskell for this program

6716319
ssd	sata
using faster disk connections sata etc. and or upgrading to a ssd might help but more cpu power will not

6716319
cpu	processors
having said this i have also seen situations where processes that are definitely cpu bound fail to achieve 100 cpu usage on modern processors core i7 etc. because in certain turbo boost relevant cases task manager will show less than 100

6716340
qevent	qapplication
in your application you will need to subclass qapplication and set up a response for qevent fileopen

6716341
put	get
if you put the image in css as background-image the image will only get downloaded when that class is actually used and visible

6716351
filtering	grouping
the cardinality of the different tables is unknown or can change over time so from the application layer eg php python etc... we would not know if we should first go query user_group get all the user grouping then query user get all the users etc... or first query comment get all the comments then filtering the retrieved comments by users then filtering by user grouping etc.

6716362
folder	directory
note though that the project name need not be the same as the directory folder name of the project so you can either delete any existing project with the same name or alternatively rename the existing projects

6716404
portrait	landscape
the problem is when i change to portrait landscape the image disapears

6716442
getter	setter
avoid internal getter setter

6716442
getter	setter
it s reasonable to follow common object-oriented programming practices and have getter and setter in the public interface but within a class you should always access fields directly

6716451
for-loop	arrays
if you count an arrays it has to count each object using nsenumerator or a for-loop

6716461
hash	md5
i suppose you could trim a hash md5 or sha1 etc. of a field in the item to 8 characters- although you might end up with a collision

6716466
superclass	subclassing	lsp	principles
subclassing is not subtype because subclassing may change semantics defined in superclass subtype cannot change supertype semantics see liskov substitution principles this lsp example

6716467
mousemove	mouseevent
the code below does the same as the internal implementation but can be called at will from within the widget implementation for example from a mousemovelistener s mousemove mouseevent e hook

6716467
mouseevent	mousedown
the default implementation is exposed via the dragdetect mouseevent e method that can be called from a mousedown handler as explained in the documentation for dragdetect

6716573
getter	setter
the performance hit of using internal getter and setter also applies to external getter and setter

6716573
getter	setter
however in the external case the getter and setter have significant benefits in other areas

6716573
getter	setter
so it is generally regarded as best practice to use getter and setter despite the performance hit that this may incur

6716602
hide	show
i want to have a button show hide and not 3 show hide restore

6716617
getter	setter
getter and setter always have an overhead as they are function calls

6716617
getter	setter
will a not having a getter setter break common oops practices

6716617
getter	setter

6718378
width	height
file size width x height x bit depth + metadata overhead

6718378

6718724
int	double
so my question is how would you generate the equivalent of the above but for int instead of double

bmp	png
if you are not explicitly defining an image format it will default to bmp or png format

6719621
filtering	grouping

6719637
goto	break
personally i d use a goto rather than a break because with a goto it s instantly clear where the break re-enters but in this case it s not a big issue because there are no statements in between the break and the re-entry point

6719804
glulookat	glrotate
if you are writing an application that has the concept of the camera moving and rotating too i suppose then rather than operating on the object with glrotate and gltranslate consider looking into glulookat which allows you to set things up in a camera-centered way so to speak

6719833

what you re looking for are accessors and mutators also known as getter and setter but unfortunately they re not cross-browser compatible

6722786
post	get
now i want to get those post with this post_id

6722798
addclass	removeclass
that way the jquery object will be empty if the element doesn t expose the step-dark-left class to begin with so both removeclass and addclass will end up doing nothing in that case

6722801
removeclass	next
so removeclass method if it doesn t find a step-dark-left css-class it just would do nothing and return the jquery object so next method in the chain will work

i suggest you in order to define the frustum to call gluperspective 45 float width height 0.001f 1000f

6723987
width	height
45 for 45 degrees of half angle width height for giving the screen ratio 0.001f for giving a near truncating plane 0.001f away from your eye or the screen 1000f for giving a far truncating plane 1000f away from your eye

post	get
the function below is supposed to do this get some post data from a php file xml format returned on success process that data to check if an item in the cart already exists with this item to prevent it from being added twice under the same name

6724110
mouseup	mousedown
i can t seem to get this event to work so i have subclassed nsslider and implemented mousedown mouseup methods and added a delegate to the nsslider subclass and connected that to my app s controller

6724110
mouseup	mousedown
it sort of works but there is a massive delay on the slider - it slides fine but the video rate doesn t change and only does when i mouseup - basically it seems the mousedown is called on the mouseup

managed	loaderlock
debug + exceptions expand the managed debugging assistants node and untick loaderlock so it stops nagging you

6724293
put	get
assuming that your exceptionresolver is an implementation of handlerexceptionresolver then there s no reason to put your logging logic into exceptionresolverbuilder.getexceptionresolver since the resolver will get passed the current httpservletrequest in the resolveexception method

6724305

6724584
nl2br	htmlspecialchars
do it the other way round first use htmlspecialchars and than nl2br

6724587
children	parent
to make extra sure that this works you can write your own simple sendmessagetochildren function like mfc offers which just walks down through the children of a particular parent recursively and sends each of them the wm_setfont message

6724588
put	get
in the example i just put a comma but if you can t get the release date just leave it and i ll get it another way

so - except for less code you have to write are there any advantages to using magic getter and setter methods instead of traditional getx setx methods

6724895
keydown	keyup
it fires the three events keydown keypress and keyup

6724895
keydown	keyup

6724913
width	height
note that it s a rect that starts 20 into the x axis and spans 70 of the width at full height

6724941
getter	setter
of course you could do this with getter and setter too but then you would have to do this every time

6724969
getter	setter
there is few difference between getter and setter methods and __set and __get methods

6724969
getter	setter
setter and getter are used to assign or fetch value of defined states

6724980
keydown	keyup
the value of which in a keypress handler does not have the same meaning as that of which in a keydown or keyup handler

6724980
keydown	keyup
thus that s a different 46 in the keypress handler for . than in the keydown and keyup events for del

6724980
keydown	keyup
you probably should use either keydown or keyup and check for the keycode

6724992
getter	setter
i must excoriate anyone who suggests using getter and setter in general at all

6724993
getter	setter
except for less code you have to write are there any advantages to using magic getter and setter methods instead of traditional getx setx methods

6724993
getter	setter
the other reason is that you can add a common behaviour to all your getter setter

6725116
post	get
view works out whether this is a get or a post

6725123
getter	setter
to me it looks like this setter is actually acting like a getter and transforming the data as it comes back from the database

6725140
post	get
the next part are url paramters that build an array the same as get or post would

6725176
layoutparams	viewgroup
i solved my problem by using a valueanimator and animating the layoutparams of my viewgroup

integer	unsigned
well according to the msdn dword is an unsigned integer with a range of 0 to 4294967295

6725571

6725925
mousemove	mouseout	mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseover	mousemove	mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseup	mouseout	mousedown	mouseout	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
as a workaround i did find this opera article at that emulates drag-and-drop support with mousedown mouseover mousemove mouseout and mouseup events

6725931
innodb	myisam
it may be more important here to choose the right engine like myisam instead of innodb as this is an insert-only table

6725936
put	get
i know its similar to the one posted above but it will be more dynamic as you dont need to put the message in resource file and you can save the error message in db and get that on other page

6725947

sum	coalesce
you need to use group by in order to split score s sum over different users further more if you use left join then you ll be sure to get a row for each user instance even if it has no rows in stats table then using coalesce as regilero suggested the sum will be 0

6726040
intraweb	indy
previous indy and intraweb editions used a slightly modified version of openssl

6726040
intraweb	indy
so when somebody used a unmodified set of openssl dlls not the indy openssl dlls together with an older indy or intraweb version he will get the could not load ssl library error because of the missing exports

6726040
intraweb	indy
that is why a current indy version - from svn even with delphi 2007 - together with intraweb works with the dlls from slproweb too which don t include these modifications

6726082
children	parent
so how can i inspect entire object in rails console till children are embeded in my parent like i can do it in mogodb console

pull	push
you can use adb pull to get files but there isn t a way for the device to push

6726186
hash	md5
well what about md5 hash

6726190
put	get
if you can put anything into them and get a different result it couldn t be a fixed length byte array and it would lose a lot of its usefulness

6726204
int	chars
update found a similar question mysql int comparison ignores trailing alpha chars

6726250
postgresql	mysql
for example the postgresql mysql and sqlite adapters re-open activerecord base and they might include extra modules along the way

6726264
post	get
when you get to the point of rendering the link below the post just make a call to the helper which can do a quick check on the comments count for that post and could simply return the string or full link you are looking for in that situation

i d suggest trying to style the parent element of the input button pairing a fieldset in my example in order to give a common font-size and fontfamily then using em measurements for styling dimensions padding margins for the child elements

6726350
opera	firefox
albeit the above works fine in chromium 12.x and opera 11.5 ubuntu 11.04 firefox seems to show an extra pixel or two in the latter demonstration

6726434
gmail	hotmail
send yourself a copy of the document via gmail or hotmail or whatever and keep the copy in your account -- the date timestamp on the email should come from the service provider not from your computer so that would be pretty solid evidence i imagine

6726455
komodo	notepad++
i can open the file modules system html.tpl.php in my other editors komodo or notepad++

6726462
portrait	landscape
i have implemented the mgsplitviewcontroller and have noticed that willrotatetointerfaceorientation duration and didrotatefrominterfaceorientation is called when the ipad simulator and device is in landscape mode but not when in portrait

6726462
portrait	landscape
the log always prints portrait when i have the device in either portrait or landscape

6726474
versioning	upgrade
you aren t providing enough information but from what i see i can suggest to upgrade your jar versioning to newest compatible with each other versioning

6726478

i want to download images using www mechanize and to save into the file names their dimensions width x height bytes but can t figure out how to extract the bytes into a readable format - my img_bytes format_bytes

if you follow this design pattern then between your client-side and server-side code i m sure you can easily figure out if a message is stale or not

6726650
inline	inlining
note that this doesn t prevent inlining -- the function could still be inline at link time in exactly the same way that a normal non-inline function can still be inline

6726655
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve got a client who has to have his site work exactly the same in ie as other browsers that actually work like firefox google-chrome and safari but i can t seem to get ie to play ball

move	drag
later on in the graphicsscene class i detect when the user clicks on an item and drag it to move it

6726757
post	put	post	get	put	get
the problem i have is that out of get post put and delete only delete requests appear to deliver the data part

6726757
post	put	post	get	put	get
in the four cases above as str get gets a null argument understandable put and post get empty strings and delete gets the data actually sent

6726758
junit	testng
here is what it would look like with testng it s a little more contrived with junit since you can t pass parameters directly to test functions

6726783
macvim	taglist
setup - macvim with minibufexplorer plugin window spanning the entire top and taglist plugin window on the right

6726800
for-loop	arrays
is there a way to sanitize the arrays i.e escape any dangerous characters inside the arrays so that i sanitize each arrays before pushing it into them for-loop that splits each arrays into strings that are then entered into mysql

6726815
post	put
i m not sure if methods marked with put or post should have the request entity automatically passed in like you are expecting

6726851
post	get
didn t get into it simply re-sized them statically for now but when i do get into it again i ll be sure to post the code

6726875
typhoeus	curb
for more robust tasks curb and typhoeus are good because they can handle multiple requests though you ll need to write a bit more code for managing the files and navigating sites

i am trying to get the work on this code i would like to know how can i will be able to catch exceptions in jtextfield and i would also like to limit the amount that you can put in the jtextfield

6727065
width	height
and you do realize that and is from the tag not the actual width and height of the image right

6727107
width	height
you tell it the coordinates within the canvas to grab pixels from and it gives you back an object with height width and pixels

6727107
width	height
thus there are height width 4 pixels in the array

6727111
mouse	keyboard
to differentiate between keyboard and mouse based focus events you could try binding a keydown handler to everything else to detect a tab or shift-tab but that would be a gross hack and probably not reliable

6727136
realloc	malloc
so is it advisable to read all record one by one doing realloc one by one go on increasing the array size as the element comes or should i spend one pass in identifying the number of records do malloc only once

6727171
int	chars
in the file rline.c chars command_generator chars tab_completion const chars text int start int end void initialize_readline

6727171
int	chars
i think i have to use chars filename_completion_function chars text int state

6727230
textview	imageview
how can i get access to the for example textview from the onclick method assigned to the for example imageview

6727230
textview	imageview

bitblt	gdi
use gdi by calling bitblt to copy the contents of the source dc to a destination dc which you can then write to a file print etc

6727307
inherited	properties
if you instantiate an object yourself then it s almost empty - it only inherited some properties from its constructor s prototype

6727374
directx	gdi
if you are talking about someone else s there is no promise that they will render larger than the screen since would be wise to clip their painting to what is visible and they may be further constrained by other factors such as the size of a directx surface which is smaller than the gdi limit

6727383
free	malloc
when a c c++ program containing the dynamically allocated memory using malloc new without free delete calls is terminated what happens to that dynamically allocated memory

6727406
post	get
in your case the values many be in the collection only checked checkboxes get sent in a post so you could do

6727412
for-loop	arrays
i understand the mechanics of why this is happening the string literal is really an arrays of characters that includes the null character and when the range-based for-loop calls std end on the character arrays it gets a pointer past the end of the arrays

6727419
hide	show
you could set it up to create new pages as drafts and defaulting the public view to show only approved versions but it sounds like you want to hide unapproved versions entirely which would require some extra hacking and as andreas says kind of defeats the point of a wiki in the first place

6727420
hide	show
0 1 2 then set all of the three button s onclick to the same handler and show one of your frames according to the tag of the clicked button and hide the others

6727459
mongodb	bson
now in berkeleydb you needed to define a callback for each type that you stored but mongodb through bson is a little smarter than that

6727493
hide	show
so if you want to show a the page is loading message and hide this when the iframe has finished loading you can do something similar to the example below

6727523
ssl	https
with the release of vs2010sp1 iis express you can now to debug code that uses with https ssl without having to use a full iis server

6727605
pull	push
you need to push or pull commits to move them between repositories

6727635
portrait	landscape
as you can see from the images the uibarbuttonitems look correct in portrait but weirdly squished and off center especially the trash icon in landscape

6727638

if you need more advanced stuff show hide your window decide its size ... you should probably switch to a gui application

6727736
temp	tmp
see tmp pear temp intl configure --with-icu-dir default failed

6727739
hide	show
the first function is to open a panel and the second function to open show hide object inside the panel but somehow when i click the show hide button the panel close itself

6727804
post	get
i think that facebook c# graph api only supports method that get most recently post or messages

6727804

is there any additional parameter to get the previous post or messages

6727810

6727851
super	self
in objective-c why should i check if self super init is not nil

6727890
serializable	deserialization
the deserialization process checks this value when deserializing - if it doesn t match an exception is thrown preventing the serializable data from being deserialized into the wrong version of the class

6727922
free	malloc
if you want really low-level control of things you can also use malloc and free instead which will release memory more immediately than calling release will

6727924
margin	text-indent
you may want to use a padding or margin instead of text-indent if you want the indent to affect all lines not just the first

6727926
hash	md5
i am writing a simple tool that allows me to quickly check md5 hash values of downloaded iso files

6727926

my problem is on the 9th line when i try to take the md5 hash of the file

6727980
implements	extends
why don t you have one baseform class where you put the clean_cpf method and then extends that for the other forms and since clean_cpf is in the parent form you shouldn t have to implements it in the child classes

6727996
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i have a little problem here this page at firefox opera google-chrome has already center but at ie 9 this page still at left

6736160
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
i understand that unchecked-exception are runtimeexception and that it is not required that the programmer handle them but do not understand why when i explicitly state in my interface that i want the exception handled that it does not force me to handle it

6738724
setattr	subclassing
it s also very very very easy to create a subclassing of object with no public attributes and use setattr on it

6738724
getattr	setattr
it s even pretty easy to override __getitem__ __setitem__ and __delitem__ to invoke __getattribute__ __setattr__ and __delattr__ so that item access just becomes syntactic sugar for getattr setattr etc

as a bit of a gotcha -- implode will work based on key insertion order so you may want to use ksort first

6738942

the linqdatasource sqldatasource objectdatasource controls in my experience provide little in the way of development time and hinder maintainability

i ve run into an interesting scenario where a get request will behave differently than a post request both for an unauthorized user

6739102

why do the get and post requests act differently

6739111
rss	feed
i have an rss feed that i need to read but you need to log in with a valid username and password to get the feed

if you want to have more pixels for your canvas use the width height properties of the canvas instead

6739420
filesystems	ntfs
if you use a linux filesystems the file permission of .ssh config must be 600 but on a standard ntfs windows partition these kind of permissions do not exist

maybe infovis or protovis

6739510
post	get
magic_quotes_gpc is a separate directive which only applies to get post cookie operations axil

6739519

you need to use setvisibility method to show hide views on the same layout

6739559
firefox	safari
however that doesn t explain why firefox is not behaving the same as safari

6739572
persistent	transient
so save-update basically says to nhibernate when saving my entity if any objects associated with the entity are transient not yet persistent then persistent save them. any associated objects that are already persistent will be updated

6739604
put	get
you should just be able to get rid of the surrounding handler and put the handler directly in your javascript so that when the page loads the callback is registered immediately

6739604
post	put	post	get	put	get
also your ajax request probably needs a type post or type put since defaults to get requests

6739614
getter	setter
for simplicity i ignore the getter and setter for all other fields

6739618
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r mysql mysql usr local mysql

6739653

6739696
folder	directory
assuming client.py is in your src folder and util.py is in src dir1 dir2 every directory in this path has a __init__.py remember you would import util from client like so

firefox	safari
it seems the litte loading-bar with the infomation about the site at the bottom left side blocks the last 17px in firefox 5 and also in safari

6739739
folder	directory
so i am wondering if this strange behaviour has something to do with some permission settings in the active directory of the server or folder

6739746
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as far as html5 - only firefox and google-chrome currently support html5 native drag and drop events that i m aware google-chrome would include some other webkit variants like safari

6739754
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
to add buttons to a uinavigationbar you need to create a uinavigationitem

6739754
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
if you re using uinavigationbar as part of uinavigationcontroller as is the common case this is done automatically as a standalone view you have to do this yourself

6739755
telerik	componentart

6739756
client-side	server-side
i was able to get server-side function but not client-side

6739756
client-side	server-side
at this point i m putting off worrying about client-side validation since server-side is more important

6739759
strstr	substr
since you have a prefix you could use strstr or strpos to search for the object identification each one of them and them get the name of the field using substr

6739804
uiview	subviews
of course you need to have autoresize subviews on the parent uiview enabled for this to work

6740031
ecdsa	rsa	exponent	modulo
i understand if these are for rsa keys i can cast them to rsapublickey rsaprivatekey and verify that the exponent and modulo match but what if they are ecdsa

6740051
width	height
i think by setting the height and width to 100 on your object you are telling it to fill up the whole div which is why you don t get scrollbars

6740051
width	height
try setting the actual dimensions for the height and width and then when a video s dimensions are larger then the div you should see the scrollbars

6740053
for-loop	arrays
i tried a for-loop to parse both arrays as one but neither of them are arrays due to the separation.

6740066
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
typically projects that people are supposed to compile for themselves are distributed with either an ant build script or a maven pom.xml descriptor

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
one thing to try if you ve subclassed uiviewcontroller in any way or are using a uitableviewcontroller or uinavigationcontroller make sure you ve set the correct object type in the inspector for relevant tab - i ve had no end of problems due to forgetting to do this in the past

6752889

the parent process s data structure has information on the children it hasn t waited for yet whether thay are zombies or are still alive the main difference of zombies is that they have almost no flesh their data structures only contain the exit status resource usage and not much more so they are very loghtweight

6752904
hide	show
when the user clicks the linkbutton i want to show hide the visibility of image

6752918

6752942
int	double
i can create columns specific for each possible type so any primitive value type such as int double string etc and also user defined reference types i want store in the table such as order or i could simply store everything as an object and cast them back to the correct type when accessing the table

6752984
int	double
if you want to avoid boxing and you want to cause a few simple types like int and double to share memory use the layoutkind struct layout attribute to force them to share memory then set your list to be of that struct type

inherited	subclassing
by subclassing function they inherited standard things like a background image or the appropriate nav buttons

6753138
min	max
i haven t looked at the rest of your code but now that your data is in the correct format you should be able to replace the fake data in the example with the real data in your code and have the whole thing work as expected though you ll need to change any assumptions in the example about the expected max and min values for x and y

6753140
versioning	upgrade
however if you can detect that the user upgrade from the old versioning by examining nsuserdefaults you can easily enough have your did they purchase the full versioning

and in one of my methods i m trying to do an addobject within a for-loop but whatever i try the arrays does not appear to contain objects either by using objectatindex or count

6753286

6753323
filtering	grouping
now how do i add filtering to this grouping

6753329
awt	swing
it sounds like you are using swing components jscrollpane jpanel ... in an awt container applet

6753358
accessor	properties
you could make your accessor protected so you can mock or you could use internal so that you can access the properties in a test but that imo would be wrong as you have suggested

6753392
post	put
i could put a relay with some timeout logic that we are in control of in between a.com and b.com a.com post to a.com relay which in turn post to b.com proxy etc. but that seems overcomplicated

6753679
children	parent
however some children of parent will use these arguments so they need to always be there

6753692
int	chars
if the first chars of the column name indicates the data type i int c chars etc. i m guessing that the problem is with the second to last column in the select list

mousedown	mouseenter
but as soon as the mousedown event occurs so long as the mouse it down mouseenter events are no longer called until the mouse button is lifted

6753727

i don t think you can generally do this apart from in some of the latest versions of firefox and google-chrome

6753998

6754070
put	get
if i put more complex objects in there such as list of strings i get the following error

maybe some com guru can explain why this exception happens and can it be possibly fixed just by converting methods to using bstr and sysallocstring sysfreestring instead of unsigned char malloc free

6754146
serializable	deserialization
also if you examine the javadoc for java.io.serializable you ll see that there are number of optional methods you can define in a serializable implementation that will be invoked during the serializable deserialization process

6754178
width	height
i have the li element styled so it has a certain height and fills the entire width of the screen

6754214
width	text-align

6754220
maven	pom.xml
the pom.xml file is actually maven s equivalent of a build file or a makefile

6754220
maven	pom.xml
the pom.xml tells maven what you actually want it to do so it s not going to be able to build or clean without that file

6754258
move	drag
if i remember correctly mouse move events aren t sent during drag and that s probably one reason that you don t get mouseentered and mouseexited messages

6754260
google-chrome	firefox
when i m using firefox and then using the popup opens in my second display above my first one but in google-chrome the popup just opens at

6754283
qdialog	qmessagebox
first of all qmessagebox inherits from qdialog

6754283
qdialog	qmessagebox
since qdialog has a concept of a parent qmessagebox should too for consistency

6754314
width	margin
you can then size the width of wrapper as content + 2 menu and give it margin 0 auto

6754379
post	get
from what you say you re trying to do a get post would be far better

6754384
spannable	charsequence
i was treating a spannable as if it was it s own special class but it extends charsequence which means the underlying data is just normal text

6754405
jscrollpane	jlayeredpane
the resizing the jtextarea can be done easily enough via calling setbounds ... on it -- or better on the jscrollpane that holds it but you will need to use a null or similar jlayeredpane layout on the container that holds the jtextarea and will likely need to repaint the container after resizing the jscrollpane

6754434
put	get
get any incoming object from the socket and put it in the input queue

6754460

6754550
ssms	sqlcmd
so the problem is not the difference between sqlcmd or ssms it must be something else

6754557
equals	gethashcode
don t forget to implement equals and gethashcode as well which can be done trivially for this class

6754562
hide	show
each state has to show or hide a different selection of the available input fields

6754562

it s actual height and width are 122px.

6754621
width	height
so look at your css again and see where that extra height width is coming from

6754631
for-loop	arrays
although trying to search all possible data on the issue all the examples i ve found regarded the case where the second arrays which holds the strings is allocated step by step in a for-loop and freed afterwards in a for-loop as well

6754657
dictionary	map
extract the properties into a dictionary map

6754688
free	malloc

mouseup	mousedown
when an nsbutton receives a mousedown event it enters a private tracking loop handling all the mouse events that are posted until it gets a mouseup

6754717
getter	setter
otherwise you have to make them public or create getter and setter

6754727
for-loop	arrays
you are creating a new variable called from within that for-loop and your arrays will never see the scope of that new variable

6754733
opera	firefox
do the webkit and microsoft browsers support any method of specifying tab width like firefox and opera do using their -moz-tab-size and -o-tab-size properties

currently i am using uiview s +transitionwithview method to add an overlay by adding a uiimageview that contains a transparent image as a subviews of my main view

6754743
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this issue appears on mozilla firefox and on internet explorer but not on google-chrome or opera

6754787
opera	google-chrome
this may not be related as google-chrome and opera are working faster but what may be happening is your server is still trying to get the content and is not done processing the html this is what a video application i wrote in php did before i fixed it

6754787
google-chrome	firefox
though i am not sure i think google-chrome may make multiple-requests to the server and thus pulls down the images while waiting while ie and firefox will do one task at a time

6754807
hide	show
i would like to somehow hide these so only the output from my program is show

6754818
nsurlcache	uiwebview
to capture any other sort of network traffic you can use nsurlcache which is basically a cache layer between uiwebview and network

6754836
puts	gets
this gets rid of the unchecked or unsafe warning but it also puts the onus on the calling class to create the array with the correct bounds to begin with which kind of defeats the purpose of your convenience method

6754843
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
now click the disclosure triangle on uinavigationcontroller and change the class of its viewcontroller to be your custom subclass of uiviewcontroller

6754856
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
here is the xaml that binds to my viewmodel again using caliburn.micro

6754883
opera	firefox
tab-size is currently only implemented by firefox and opera using your given vendor prefixes

6754927

it works with both primitives like int long float double and user defined numeric types that overload the + operator

6755050
factors	mean
dynamic sql is normally taken to mean that the semantics of the statement change based on some external factors

6755061
post	get
if by manually you mean all by www after logging in you can use curl to simulate login session to their website access login page to obtain session cookie then post login data with that session cookie and then with authorized session cookie you can get post whatever you want from their website as authorized user

6755092
width	height
viewport - a float 4 with the viewport x y width height

6755143
width	height
at which point are you calling the width and height functions on the image object

6755166
screens	mdpi
apparently the 10 screens of the motorola xoom is 160dpi thus mdpi and xlarge see

6755166
mdpi	hdpi
this would explain the behaviour of packagemanager returning me mdpi resouces instead of hdpi resources

6755211
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome parent doesn t receive events until the user mouses up

6755212
width	height
line 1 sets the frame of the textview as a rectangle starting at point x y with whatever width and height you specify

6755230
onclick	onmousedown
is there a list of all javascript events onclick onmousedown et cetera with information on which elements are valid

6755234
width	height
besides the width and height methods returns numbers not strings so there is no point to parse them

6755246
try-catch	exception-handling
another thing is the built-in facebook api exception-handling php sdk try-catch

6755327
ubuntu	linux
it compiles without any warning on gcc 4.3.2 in ubuntu even with gcc -wall but segfaults when run on linux

bash	zsh
two things going on here exec with only redirections redirects the shell s own file descriptors and the syntax in bash and zsh creates a pipe and substitutes a reference to its input

6755692
put	get
my first idea was to put the search terms in an array and get the search results for each item in the array and place them into respective search result arrays

6755724
put	get
in your case if would put it on the domain class and sort it in the dao during fetch meaning have two methods or more based on comaprision types on dao one to just get a list of unsorted object getusers and one method for sorted list e.g getsorteduers

6755730
post	get
i think the best way to handle this as soon as i get the data back from the ajax post since that is when it is in purest form meaning before it gets turned into markers

6755737
min	max
distanceapprox x y 1 + 1 4-2 âˆš2 2 min 1 âˆš2 |x|+|y| max |x| |y|

6755738
hide	show
what i am trying to do is force the that is currently being show via the hover css to hide

6755738
hide	show
and of course i have tried hide but this prevents it from being visible and still show as the mouse is hovering over the link once mouseout occurs it is then hidden in the dom unless set to .show

6755772
hide	show
since the css for the new class that hide it is after the css that show it the element will be hidden as long as your css specificity doesn t override that

6755778
put	get
so if you put together all my suggestions you might get something like this

6755782

6755988
min	max
what are your min max and permgen heap sizes

6755988
min	max

oncreate	setcontentview
however if you desire you can customize the screen layout by setting your own view layout with setcontentview in oncreate

6756289
mouse	keyboard
i need workable controls inside my surface receiving any mouse and keyboard event focusable etc

6756314
zoo	xts
doesn t work because zoo objects can be a vector or a matrix while xts objects are always a matrix and there s no method

6756324
mouse	keyboard
it currently only supports the ps3 s six-axis controller but maybe you or i if i ever get the time could adapt the nokia project s keyboard and mouse routines into the python script or convert it to java groovy which is my ultimate goal

6756369
getter	setter
then i am trying to set a variable of customerinfo object with the defined setter method and im trying to echo that variable using the getter method

for-loop	arrays
i am inserting a segment into a uisegmentedcontrol while getting the name from a for-loop which is looping through the arrays getting nsdictionary which is retrieving a nsstring that i will put into the uisegmentedcontrol

6756634
int	chars
and use the return value int which is the numbers of chars read then keep this information on a counter so that when you have read 100 of this

6756636
getter	setter
that s why i usually prefer having classes with getter and setter

6756636
getter	setter
yes it s more typing but with getter and setter users can easily see what properties they can get and set plus getter and setter are ide s auto-complete friendly

6756637
profiling	benchmarking
but benchmarking or profiling will give you the real answers

the first thing to do is stop thinking about folder or directory or their associated urls and do everything including access the applet via

6756957
try-catch	exception-handling
the scope of the try block starts after the member initialization list has been completed so any exception-handling thrown during member initialization will not be caught by this try-catch block

6756957
try-catch	exception-handling
it ensures that any exception-handling thrown from betwen the starting brace of the try block inside the function body gets caught appropriately it would mean any exception-handling caused during the argument passing if any can occur will not be caught in this try-catch block

6757009

6757050
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome the page looks exactly as it should wheras at the widget home middle 3 the recent comments scroll has ridiculously huge font and is and overlaid

6757051
getter	setter
i don t know if this is an option for you -- you may want to consider javascript getter setter functions

6757051
getter	setter
of course this could introduce some browser compatibility problems -- javascript getter setter are fairly new

6757100
for-loop	loops
since you re running the parallel for loops many times layers you loose the advantage of running in parallel since every time a parallel for-loop is finished there is an implicit barrier call which won t return till all other threads finish

6757132
getter	setter
this also allows subclasses to override these methods if they want since you essentially have setter and getter now

6757132
getter	setter
the advantage of this over native setter and getter is that this will work in any browser version with the above drawbacks

6757159
google-chrome	firefox
the problem with the above code is that it removes spaces in google-chrome and ie but in case of firefox its working fine

6757161
super	implements
i believe that i have made my super cool app perform the necessary duties but i am concerned that this is not the way apple intended or would recommend for me to implements this feature

6757305
ubuntu	debian
just say no to old ubuntu and debian packages

6757341
width	height
when you set the .src on an image you have to wait until the image is successfully loaded until you can read it s height and width

6757341
width	height
in this case since the image was already elsewhere in the document you should just read the height and width off the existing element rather than the new element

6757341
width	height
this uses a trick that you only need to set one size height or width on the image and the other will be scaled by the browser to preserve the aspect ratio

6757344
width	height
then you can remove the height width from your grid and all your other ui elements just let the grid dictate the size of its children

6757346
portrait	landscape
edited the happening is i statically placed the relative layout by specifying padding when running in portrait mode i made it fix at bottom but when i changed to landscape its not at bottom

6757375
post	get
also the code is better structured â what deals with particular post belongs to postview and doesn t get in your way

6757436
post	get

6757548
fast-forward	merge
as long as said branch has been rebased on top of the canonical branch the new branch will be able to be fast-forward merge

6757548
fast-forward	merge
more generally the maintainer is rarely the one doing the work of solving non-trivial merge if there is no fast-forward step in sight he she will simply reject that branch and will ask the contributor for a new one

6757603
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
a separate distributed vcs git mercurial bazaar repository could have commit hooks that send patches to a gatekeeper person with svn access to incorporate distributed developer contributions

width	height
it can you should put width and height as attributes of canvas

6757910
width	height
i guess attributes width and height initialize coordinate system insight canvas

width	height
so when you don t specify width and heihgt you will get coordinate system in width 300 and height 150 by default

make a single div fit over the top left and find out the best width and height guessing you know that from the table that you tried

6758806
width	height
you will have to make the image go under the divs so i think you have to give it an overlay attribute or something like that can t remember what it s called so with that in mind you have the class for each div to be width xxpx height xxpx float left and that should be it

to enable the cross domain request the server has to set or the domain of the script actually but covers everything and maybe access-control-allow-methods get post options headers

6762059

6762570
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
of course the superclass can t really call it since its an abstract so undefined method but its an abstract-class so it cannot be instanciated it must delegate the task to its subclassing so why cant they call the abstract but now implemented method

6762570
superclass	subclassing
or remove the init in the superclass and explicitly calling it in the subclassing constructor this is what i wanted to avoid since i will have to write it 100 of the time..

6762582

i understand sending objects over non-blocking sockets is not easy ideal especially with objectoutputstream and objectinputstream but i want to minimise the use of threads also i don t want to re-write this from scratch

6763143
entity-relationship	diagram
i think to best way to start up with is data modeling first start with a entity-relationship diagram then apply the normalization theory this structured approach will always provide you a good database desgin

6763144
tax	shipping
the only way around it would be for paypal to eliminate the ability for the merchant to determine tax and shipping based on the customer s address or require this sort of thing to update it during the paypal payment flow

6763144
tax	shipping
of course if a merchant is changing the tax or shipping values from what was displayed on step 3 then they shouldn t be using this feature

6763590
button	checkbox
use ie7 scroll down and click on one of the many checkbox button with a c- in front of the number

i know its related to the span located inside of the label creating the button image if i attach a click event on one of those spans and make it return false i do not get this behavior anymore. it stops the checkbox from being checked and unchecked on the label click however

6763635

width	height
the width and height will be inversely proportional to the distance from the viewer

so if your natural distance from the viewer is a and the new position is at a+z you will want to multiply the original width and height by a a+z

6764201

ddms	adb
you d think you could run it from an alternate location on the pc and you likely can as long as you use it from the command line but if your fire up ddms it may kill off the running adb server and launch a new one using the default in the path so ultimately you ll have to put your modified version there

6764303
pull	push
more primitive things like logcat shell running process list push pull etc will at least partially work without this provided that your adb daemon doesn t quit modification may be required when it is unable to claim the debug socket

6764790
qabstracttablemodel	qabstractlistmodel

6764939
qitemdelegate	qrect

draggable	droppable
take a look at the draggable and droppable documentation for more info about how they work

6765046
put	get
however since i could not find any concrete examples of what i m doing below multiple tasks i thought it might be nice to put it on here to get the answers and hopefully be an example for others

6765071
width	height
you could put a css class on the #square div which has an absolute width and height set and then in your jquery script use removeclass on #square to remove that css class

6765071
width	height
thus with no jquery available it d be that set width and height and then if jquery is enabled it becomes liquid

i m getting a javascript error in firefox and opera when i m using tinymce

6765154
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox

6765337
put	get
your only real problem is that clips.url is invalid...there are two ways you can access this object within this array...first put the object in a variable before you push it to the array or just get the last object in the array like i did here in this jsfiddle

6765356
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

int	boolean	width	height
instead of going through the hassle of creating a new canvas and all that use bitmap.createbitmap bitmap source int x int y int width int height matrix m boolean filter

lisp	scheme
other things aren t so easy for example there s no standard way to read the command line arguments in lisp or scheme

i have a property that s a double in c++ cli that i need to cast to an int but the compiler gives me a warning c4244 when i do so

6765663
int	double
i understand that the compiler isn t happy because a double might be larger than an int can hold but this particular control is guaranteed to be a value from 1 to 10 so i know that it will be okay

same as mouseover and mouseout

6765956
mouseover	mouseout
when i mouseover it will appear when i mouseout it will disappear no more repeat

6766017
mouseleave	mouseenter
your original code seems flawed since the mouseleave function was inside of the first the mouseenter function

6766034
super	self
i assume that the uiview was released by being removed from the super view and later on the completion block is executed having a reference to self this is messaging a released object

it s commonly no difference what widget to use to present data it could be either qtreewidet or qtreeview or qtablewidget or qtableview

6766235
folder	directory
you should check whether the folder directory to which the files are uploaded exists or not

everything seems to work fine except after a while my samsung tablet slows to an absolute crawl and is basically unusable until the next forced reboot

6766343
int	double
i want store a list of double and int to a bytebuffer which asks for a size to allocate

6766395
width	height
the thing to note about it is that although android would supply the width it wouldn t supply me with a height which was initially confusing

6766425
super	extends
for storing in a sqlite db the best way to do it is by creating a class that extends sqliteopenhelper super class.in this class you will define the functions to insert in the database to delete create tabels and so on

6766430
slideup	slidedown
i want a slidedown and slideup effect on a particular div when you hove on corresponding tag

6766497

google-chrome	firefox
i have included images to show the difference between firefox and google-chrome

6766547
flotr	rgraph
i m hoping that there s a decent library out there that can support all of these however if i must i may include 2 different libraries looking at google chart tools grafael flotr and rgraph right now - none of which seem to include all of the requirements i have

6766567
equals	gethashcode
they really need good iequatable support implement the interface and provide your own gethashcode and equals

6766577
for-loop	arrays
i got trouble when i try to sort arrays in for-loop

6766581
submit	submission
if it s a natural form submission you can bind a new event handler to the form s submit action and call event.preventdefault to stop the browser from posting to the server

6766634
photoshop	fireworks
you can download the mockup toolkit and open up with fireworks or photoshop to extract images from there

6766641
try-catch	exception-handling
if unhandled exception-handling means lesser try-catch blocks if its so in your case then you can think from the perspective that try-catches are generally expensive

6766670
width	height
using graphics.drawstring i was able to use a rectanglef with specified width 0 height as a boundary for my text and the text wrapped correctly

6766673
pull	push
when you pull a merge will happen and if there are no conflicts during that then you can push

6766676
width	height
you may want to try using the dataset syntax used here and also try using a number for width and height until you get it working rather than a percentage

6766738
button	checkbox
i have a below gridview control with a checkbox on it so my question is when i hit on save button i able to find the checkbox which have been checked and till here no problem but the problem started when the user tries to uncheck the checkedbox so how would i track the changes and save it into the db that has been checked

6766859
draggable	droppable
i am working with jquery draggable and droppable and can t figure out why it appears that a div i have

6767053
free	malloc
things not allocated with new or the malloc family should be destructed and free when the object goes out of scope

6767148
kerberos	ldap
the simplest possible answer is yes it is possible to store user names user ids and passwords without using kerberos and in fact directory services accessed via ldap are an excellent tool for storing this sort of authentication and authorization information

6767161
onfocus	onblur
i m thinking about how can i implement onfocus and onblur effects in my input field in jsf 2.0

6767161
onfocus	onblur
i m trying the attribute onblur and onfocus but still nothing appearing in my input field

6767211
oncreate	onstart
so but if you get height of mapview by calling method getheight for example in oncreate or onstart you will get 0 because mapview has not been drawn

6767211
int	boolean
you need to inherit from mapview and override onlayout boolean changed int left int top int right int bottom

6767231
post	get
when i call the comment count function below from within my functions.php file i get 0 even though the post has comments

6767256
getter	setter
is there any solution to get an objective-c source code just after setter and getter have been generated

6767261
google-chrome	firefox
it even works in firefox and internet explorer so it definitely isn t just a google-chrome thing

6767280
bindparam	pdostatement
bool pdostatement bindparam mixed parameter mixed variable

6767280
pdostatement	bindvalue
bool pdostatement bindvalue mixed parameter

6767306
inherited	properties
you then have to use the iadssecuritydescriptor.control properties to control whether dacls and sacls are inherited by the object from its parent container

6767318
hide	show
if make single tap need show or hide navigation bar

6767333
google-chrome	safari
you should use firebug or something similar in google-chrome safari etc. to help you with your issue

6767352
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
the animate function only works with numberic units such as width height padding margin font-size...not with colors

6767358
backtracking	greedy
for such a question the notion of greedy is merely an implementation detail - if you re using one of the common but inefficient backtracking implementations this can affect performance but not output

6767368
width	height
you will need to build and then parse the pes packets before you can find out the width and height of the video

6767376
google-chrome	firefox
it fixes the ie7 problem and still displays perfectly fine in google-chrome firefox and ie8 that i tested

6767383
hide	show
when you re preforming upgrade you can show user only the progress or you can completely hide the ui

select datepart iso_week getdate

6767502
war	manifest.mf
if you have a war then you can reference it as an optional package by modifying the meta-inf manifest.mf file

6767509
photoshop	coreldraw
so my question is how do i convert photoshop illustrator and coreldraw files to pdf programmatically

6767510
hash	md5
you need to use a twisted.spread.pb.iusernamemd5password credentials object to log in because twisted s pb uses a little challenge response scheme during authentication which requires the password to be hash md5

6767527
width	height
note that i added an offset to the location of the tooltip based on the cell s height and width

6767587
maven	pom.xml
maybe including something in the maven s pom.xml file

6767639
g++	gcc
for example gcc will compile c without mangling names so you can refer directly to the function names as they are in your c source while g++ will compile c++ code with mangled names and you re best off exposing c functions via extern c declarations

6767701
width	height
you could set visibility to hidden and the width and height to 1px or position off the page somewhere as a semi display none

6767735
inherited	properties
the size properties is inherited from control and collides with the size method from the activex control

6767735
inherited	properties
editing is tricky though since it is an inherited properties

6767759
put	get
to get the feed news from a page put feed on the end however you may require a auth_token to get news stream

6767761
width	height
the images that are passed in are all height 127 x width 293

6767765
superclass	subclassing
but even if it was a non- sealed class you d have to subclassing which would ruin the point because they you d have to use the subclassing and not the superclass with the operator since you can t define the operator overload between the base types.

6767765
superclass	subclassing
you could do the overload completely between instances of the subclassing but then you d have to use your new subclassing wherever you wanted to do the overload instead of the original superclass which would look clunky and probably not what you want

6767776
post	get
you will only get the value attribute through post

6767788
jar	manifest.mf
if the code in the jar is going to depend on an external jar you can add an entry in the manifest.mf file for each dependent jar

6767847
button	checkbox
when i hit on save button i able to find the checkbox which have been checked and i able to do it so far so good but the problem is

6767866
capitalize	uppercase
for some purposes lowercasing everything is better because it lowers the sparsity of the data uppercase words are rarer and might confuse the system unless you have a massive corpus such that the statistics on capitalize words are decent

6767879
webclient	httpwebrequest
instead you use a webclient or httpwebrequest or something similar to get data using the url you construct

6767895
width	height
firstly i would make sure the elements like those menu elements are all set to be variable width height

6767895
width	height
since all the elements are variable width height they will adjust based on the amount of space available to them

6767921
width	height
that s likely to be high ios uses approximately 4 bytes width height per image to store uncompressed uiimage s

6767921
profiling	instrumentation
as always profiling or as apple might say instrumentation before you optimise

6767937
pop-up	dialog
once the calendar loaded the users have the ability to add edit delete items through a pop-up dialog with the calendar details for the day

6767975
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a uinavigationcontroller a that pushes a uiviewcontroller b onto the stack

6767988
for-loop	loops
now as for your finalplacearray being out of order you are going to need to implement something like clear the finalplacearray before your first for-loop where you printed the expected results and then add nsnull null to each index in loops

6768016
hide	show
i would use quicksearch s show and hide options to add appropriate classes that can be used for filtering by isotope

6768017
inherited	properties
then inherited from that class and add aditional properties

6768081
automake	autotools
it is frequently used with gnu automake and gnu libtool collectively known as autotools

6768136
super	implements
the normal way to dispose of an object is to implements -dealloc where you release any ivars then call super dealloc like this

6768168
for-loop	loops
you are calling the dispose method inside a for-loop so when the program completes the first run of the code inside loops it then gets rid of the paint object

6768244
width	height
however when this png is loaded it causes the bitmap returned to have a -1 width and height

6768247
disk	ram
one possibility is to create a ram disk

6768251
google-chrome	firefox
but this happens only in ie9 it works perfectly in firefox ie8 google-chrome

6768270
hide	show
i am working on developing a webworks app that uses jquery s show and hide methods to dynamically change page contents

6768270
hide	show
when one of the hyperlink buttons is selected jquery hide the displayed text inputs and buttons and show a different set of text inputs and hyperlink buttons

6768278
intersect	contains
the linq to objects extensions contains some set operations like intersect and union

6768278
comparator	icomparer
note employee must implement comparator employee or you should write an icomparer employee and provide it to the setlist constructor calls above

6768355
for-loop	loops
to get the data for all 40 rows you need a loops like a for-loop conditioned by mysql_num_rows

6768413
portrait	landscape
you should return yes for both orientations portrait and landscape

6768426
x86	64bit
on x86 either 64bit or 32-bit linux --

6768495
post	get
here is a blog post describing how to get html from a url using the java sdk or apache commons httpclient

6768595
webkit	gecko
the former gives false positives on at least some other browsers firefox for instance which uses gecko not webkit

6768595
google-chrome	safari
works for me detecting the difference between google-chrome which also uses v8 and safari which also uses jsc

6768672
portrait	landscape
some of the content on certain pages might not fit in portrait mode at all based on how things are already laid out in landscape

6768673
addclass	removeclass
it seems that this createcallback function is getting called a lot when i use addclass removeclass and it s happening in both firefox 3.6 and firefox 5

6768673
google-chrome	firefox
i found the same function in google-chrome and put a breakpoint on it and it s not getting called at all so this seems to be a firefox thing

6768673
addclass	removeclass
only the first two involved me calling removeclass and addclass

6768673
addclass	removeclass
i ve noticed it getting called also when i mouseover other jqueryui stuff on the page tabs when jquery uses addclass and removeclass

6768765
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i saw this behavior in in opera firefox ie ie actually puts textb on a separate line and google-chrome

6768771
width	height
texture width height should be a power of two unless the device supports some extension that alleviates this requirement

6768837
debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	linux	ubuntu	linux
using ubuntu and probably any other debian-based linux you can install it with

6768843
width	height
you have to declare a height and width for the div element

6768881
hide	show
on the click keyup and change events show or hide the appropriate elements jquery makes this easier

6768894
submit	submission
it makes it very difficult to allow the user to submit one form and while that form is loading via ajax submit other forms including the possibility of triggering an event that causes a new form to appear and then submission that form because of issues with keeping track of where to put the response data for each request

6768961
ienumerable	iqueryable
the sad is that linq to sql actually provide much better support for this with dataloadoptions.associatewith but it is still not exactly what you want whereas linq to entities ef provides only what you call workaround - even with respect to the implementation and existing difference between ienumerable and iqueryable it looks like correct solution

6768962
submit	submission
so what actually happens is that you are getting a javascript error because of wrongly using the function and the submit handler never has time to return false and cancel the default submission of the form and the browser happily proceeds into posting to the action of the form which is empty and default to the action that rendered this form

6768993
doc	rtf
i need to convert ms word doc to rtf file and load it into richtextbox and get the rtf string and plaintext string to db get the plaintext string for full text indexing allowing user the search

6769095
width	height
typically i ll resample to a width and height 4 times greater or 8 or 16 than the original

6769102
readonly	temporary
one option would be to make a new step in the build process that removes the readonly bit from the installed files but due to the nature of the build tool that will require a second temporary directory...ugh

6769115
mouseover	mouseenter
i have an unordered list ul that i m trying to bind a mouseover mouseenter event on the list item li children using .live but keep getting the following javascript error

i am developing my first application using svg graphics what about auto scaling of svg background image to match the device screen width and height

6773241
width	height
what i have done to prevent this is have the view thats loading into the gallery have a explicit height and width in dip s and using an imageview subclass that ignores layout requests

6773241
width	height
this works as the gallery still has a layout pass initially but does not bother doing this every time an image in the gallery changes which i imagine would only need to happen if the gallery views had their width and height set to wrap_content which we dont

i would say the use of inline is only ok for trivial getter setter functions written directly in the .h

range	minimum
thinking naively about the problem the average of the measurements will be a good estimate of the offset c while half the range between the minimum and maximum value of the measured f x will be a reasonable estimate of the amplitude especially as the number of measurements increase so that the prospects of having observed the maximum offset from the mean improve

draggable	droppable
is there any way of limiting the droppable to accepting only one draggable but still keep the drag enabled

integer	unsigned	range	minimum
if you re desperate to save a few bytes per date again with mongo s padding and minimum block size and everything this is only worth the trouble in very rare cases you can store dates as a 3 byte binary blob by storing it as an unsigned integer in yyyymmdd format or a 2 byte binary blob denoting days since january 1st of year x where x must be chosen appropriately since that only supports a date range spanning 179 years

in mysql oracle sql server and postgresql not exists is of the same efficiency or even more efficient than left join is null

6778017
records	anti-join
while it may seem that the inner query should be executed for each records from the outer query which seems to be bad for not exists and even worse for not in since the latter query is not even correlated it may be optimized just as well as all other queries are optimized using appropriate anti-join methods

inherited	properties	getter	setter
perhaps its because they wanted to ensure that an override of a getter will follow the same inherited path as an override of a setter but it would seem there are cases where regarding getter and setter as separate items would be more useful in some cases for example it may be useful to have a properties get method return a type which is distinct from but coercible to the set method type

actualheight	actualwidth
use actualwidth and actualheight to form its complete rectangle

6781871

6781931
hash	md5
from what i ve read md5 hash passwords are the best ways to store them in a database

6781940
equals	compareto
equals hashcode and compareto would be implemented using the value of the double

6781990
hash	md5
you d want to do the md5 conversion in your script and then insert that resulting hash into the query

6781999
post	get
the variable is local to the currently executing script started by the http post request so it s not possible a user will get another users uploaded files

superclass	subclassing
if i have one superclass in a uml diagram with 3 subclassing can two of the subclassing have an association relationship between them

6782176
httpresponse	request
if i understood the question correctly then you want to add a cookie to httpresponse at some point after receiving a request from a client

6782176
httprequest	httpresponse
thus you can check if it s available in httprequest and if not then add it to httpresponse and invoke your additional logic

6782189
hash	md5
that said lets use hash sha256 instead of md5 to represent the hashing part of the process

6782189
hash	salt
when you first create a username and password you will hash the raw password with some salt some random extra characters added to each password to make them longer stronger

6782237
hex	binary
if that is binary encoding it to hex or base64 might help

6782238
children	parent

6782315
switching	screens
is it possible to switching the browser into and out of full screens mode simulate an f11 key press from javascript

6782324
google-chrome	firefox
if viewed in google-chrome or firefox the word share is to the left of the orange + addthis button

6782324
google-chrome	firefox
it is supposed to look like it does on google-chrome and firefox but i can t figure out what ie is doing to it

6782327
melt	reshape

assuming you re using release 0.12.1 or earlier of the m2e plugin all you should have to do is point m2e to your local maven installation

6782361

fields and getter setter if you are using jpa property access marked with transient will be ignored by jpa but usually be considered by other frameworks

6782411
xslt	xquery
i don t know about doing this from c# but it s easily done in xquery or xslt 2.0

6782411
xslt	xquery
all you need is a schema-aware xquery or xslt 2.0 processor that runs in your chosen environment

6782438
apache	nginx
it is solved via two complementary mechanisms 1 putting ruby on rails node.js behind a dedicated webserver written in c and tested to hell and back like nginx or apache lighttd

6782438
express	node.js
reading frameworks like express makes it seem like the standard practice is to just serve everything through one jack-of-all-trades node.js service .

6782438
bower	npm
even if you are using something else to serve web content you might still use node.js as a build tool using npm modules to organize your code bower to stitch it into a single asset and uglify-js to minify it for deployment

6782438
post	get
see raynos s post on using futures this is the post that made me get futures

6782438

6782452
portrait	landscape
it s made with grids so that it ll re-size and fit portrait landscape modes

6782454

6782458
borderless	panel
createwindow createwindowex with ws_child would create a borderless menubarless window aka panel

6782472
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
also if you are counting on some event to fire that isn t firing you should search on that ie viewdidload not firing because that can both occasionally be broken ie no connection to the files owner but more often one might misunderstand when that actually gets fired ie viewdidload vs viewdidappear vs viewwillappear etc.

6782610
hash	salt
you can use a format like 128-bit salt 512-bit password hash when storing the hash passwords

6782610
hash	salt
having a hash with random salt for each gives pretty good protection against cases where something like thousands of passwords are compromised

6782638
post	get
this blog post should get you most of the way there - it s actually very easy to take existing viewmodels that use other frameworks and rxui ify them

6782638

6783049
int	double
but the below also works from convert string to nullable type int double etc...

6783051

other answers are giving the cpython answer but other implementations ironpython jython could function differently

6783157
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
one of the proposals that didn t make it was selection roughly implemented by opera safari and google-chrome and by firefox as moz-selection but your use case doesn t really say anything about what you want to do so i have no idea if that selector is relevant to your needs

6783211

public	protected
this is a property which is backed by a public field in this case it is somewhat redundant mparms should be declared as protected or private

6783360
folder	directory
opening a file available in present working directory s temp folder in python

6783535
children	parent
i ve abstracted my collection name to parent and it s embedded documents to children

6783535
children	parent
in the map function i find the parent document in the collection which i m pretty sure uses the _id index and emit its id and children to the reduce function

6783575
post	get
thus you includes d s id as a get or post parameter

6783575
post	get
c as an alternative one could encrypt get and post parameters somehow

6783576
min	max
i don t see any of the linq methods like max min single etc and if i call those none of them work with the notsupportedexception

6783600
hash	md5
there were about 1 million rows and it took 2 hours to compute the md5 hash column

6783607
min	max
make an x-axis scale going from your min value to your max value in your case it would be pv.scale.linear -10 10 .range 0 w

6783607
min	max
in my example i calculate min and max based on the data

6783658
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox

uiview	subviews	children	parent
you could create a parent uiview to which you add children or subviews

6783931
maven	m2e
i switched from q4e helios to indigo m2e plugin and my maven 2 project no longer works

6783961
getter	setter
you code for the localstorage is actually working even if its suggested to use its getter setter methods instead of direct property access

6783966
put	get
the closest that you can get is to set the background image of the very first view in your application to the same default.png graphic and put a uiactivityindicator somewhere in that view

6783986
put	get
the best way to do this is to put the variable in an object and make all users of the variable access it through get and set methods or more specifically named methods

i made the server multithreaded so that it can take either multiple requests such as finding the sum max min of a string of numbers provided by the user from a single client or accept multiple connections from different clients

so either you change it to a public property or you add getter setter methods

6784952
getter	setter
an alternative to the above is to assign getter setter methods to this within the constructor

6785021
hide	show
without the event.stoppropagation it would show the list and then hide it because the .show-list-button is inside the so both click handlers would fire

6785032
getter	setter
if you really wanted you could skip declaring any properties and just declare the getter and setter methods directly and the runtime would hardly notice the difference

6785032
getter	setter
many are only useful for properties whose getter and or setter implementations are created for you using synthesize in the implementation block

6785080

it seems to me that your best bet is the getter setter method since you have a keyframe at the end where a new value will be inserted into the variable s value

6792817
hide	show
i have this piece of code that i use to show hide a popup

6792832

6793930
button	checkbox
i added some checkbox one for each tag that could be chosen and a submit button but html forms send the data to the next page using which isn t part of the url and is generally annoying if you want to reload the page and get asked every time what if you want to resend data and stuff

note that it only works with the newest browsers like later versions of safari and google-chrome for others like firefox 3.6 it implements a fallback that uses hashtags and query strings

6794018
implements	extends
properties extends hashtable implements map so you can get all the keys as a using keyset

6794076
uiview	subviews
however in that case i created a uiview with two subviews one for the tableview and one for a navbar

6794076

6794081
filewriter	bufferedwriter
using filewriter and bufferedwriter

6794088
post	get
php will receive the request from javascript in the form of a post or get

6794097
width	margin
this doesn t work with the above margin trick because you don t know how much to offset it unless the width is fixed and you can t use relative values like 50 because it will be relative to the parent and not the element it s applied to

6794097
width	margin
thus 50 for transform means half the width of the element while 50 for margin is half of the parent s width

6794097
width	height
using similar code to the above example i recreated the same scenario using completely dynamic width and height

6794125
post	get
or if i m doing it the wrong way could someone tell me a better way to get the xml sending data by post

6794137
width	margin
you will need to set your width and then it gets the window width and changes the margin every few seconds

6794258
width	height
then inside of that place two linearlayouts that both have fill parent on width and height

6794277
put	get
or put it in their private app store if they get an enterprise enrollment

6794278
rar	gzip	rar	zip
when you want to send a big file to your friend you compress it using zip rar or other archiver like gzip to save some bytes and make it faster

6794327
put	get
i get back put failed 46 which i m pretty sure means that it s an s3statusconnectionfailed error

6794345
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
what happen if i am using some other browser like firefox google-chrome or safari

6794350

the debug versions of the crt dlls are all available with the standard visual studio installation including the x86 versions even on 64bit machines

6794510
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if it doesnâ t let you stick a uiviewcontroller in between them making uinavigationcontroller embeds uiviewcontroller which has a uitabbarcontrollerâ s view added to it

6794519
sorting	grouping
you can solve this in a vectorized way by first sorting the array using the function sort then finding the indices into the sorted array where the differences between neighboring values are greater than your threshold where the grouping boundaries are using the functions diff and find

6794521
portrait	landscape
i was also experiencing the problem of the uiwebview contents not sizing properly when switching from landscape to portrait

6794530
google-chrome	firefox
found out that specifying works for google-chrome and firefox but shows annoying tool-tip with one space in ie

specifically is it smart enough to evaluate any functions appearing in the conditional part of a for-loop ahead of time instead of evaluating them at every iteration of loops

6794672
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
all anothers common browsers like ie opera safari and firefox works fine

and remove the width and height from the iframe tag

6794709
equals	gethashcode
have you overridden the gethashcode or equals methods of any of your entities or done any similar sort of customization of the auto-generated code

6794728
range	minimum
in addition i also read that a 32-bit windows system has a physical memory limit of 4gb probably due to minimum address bus assumptions so even though a system may have more than 4 gigabytes of physical memory installed a 32 bit kernel will only allocate addresses within the 4gb range

6794738
for-loop	arrays
the only method call i permit to myself to write into the for-loop is a call of length method of arrays

6794791
pdfsharp	migradoc
pdf pdfsharp or migradoc

6794825
postgresql	mysql
when you have a complicated query with a lot of joins etc one day you need to understand how to optimize it and you come to explain command mysql explain postgresql explain to study the execution plan

6794825
postgresql	mysql
if you know different practise for different servers please specify explicitly mysql postgresql mssql etc

6794847
uiview	calayer
another approach could be using calayer s instead of uiview s

6794857
margin	height
the scroll bar was appearing because borders and padding add extra height to the footer so the negative margin was actually too small

6794857
google-chrome	firefox
while this works in firefox the op found out it does not work in google-chrome

6794870
for-loop	loops
you can replace the for-loop in your sample with a while loops and a mutable flag or with a tail-recursive function a tail-recursive function is compiled into a loops so it will be efficient even in imperative solution

6794884
decoder	encoder
if you simply want to serialize an object compatible with javabeans specification look at xml encoder and decoder

it happened once in my app when i called a drawing method in my custom subclass of uiview instance right before i added it as a subviews to parent view

6795020
disk	ram
the only way increased memory usage could impact the execution speed of your program is if you have reached a point where the machine is swapping lots of ram to disk

6795025
implements	extends
edit i know i could try to extends map and implements my own wrapper etc but i am specifically asking about doing this just using using java s generic support

6795026
observer-pattern	mediator
use data caching mediator pattern observer-pattern

6795045
google-chrome	firefox
i tried this in firefox 5 internet explorer 8 and google-chrome 12

stdout	stderr
the enter return behavior you re talking about sounds like the program is not flushing stderr stdout and hitting enter is proceeding to enter in the input so it s buffering the output you should see that forms the prompt then you hit enter return and it takes that as the input so it proceeds after the gets call

6795386
client-side	server-side
i d recommend that you take a look at greg young s article on task-based ui s on how dtos and messages interact with your system both client-side and server-side

6795387
width	height
when your image is resampled to a new size the mask might not be precise any more -- since you are resizing to just a one pixel difference on width and height there is no way that this mask could match

6795389
folder	directory
i know that there is a zipfile -api which has a size -method but it requires a path to the file and since my file is located within the assets folder i am pretty sure the only way to read from this directory is by streaming

6795418
width	height
i need what the width and height to be exactly what i want

6795418
width	height
if the image is larger than the height it will only put the height to 350px and ignore the width that i ve set to 350 too

6795425
width	height
i need a spatial partitioning algorithm that doesn t need a level width and a level height

6795446

using getter and setter it is a standard way of objects data interaction

6795585
children	parent
refer to this question for example remove multiple children from parent

6795586
hash	md5
you can name it a substring of a md5 hash made of the users id and the time

6795604
post	get
to get around this you can create a php file on your domain which would curl out to the webservice you want and change your post function to call to the php file on your server via ajax

6795632
portrait	landscape
everything works fine in portrait but in landscape mode the label is too far down

6795653
getter	setter
this is arguably more in keeping with oo principles than with ml-style functional programming at least in the sense of oo principles that are espoused by the people who yell at you for using getter and setter and think control flow should be implemented via polymorphism

6795653
pull	push
given the above i d say that the iteratee concept would fit just fine in c# and would be most naturally implemented as a sort of inverted equivalent of ienumerable with compositional data-flow objects and a push interface rather than the standard linq s pull style

6795674
superclass	subclassing
not have your subclassing extend from the superclass

6795675
superclass	subclassing
instead of expecting the subclassing to invoke superclass functionality turn it the other way around

6795912
inherited	properties
your mainpage is a user control which has control as a superclass and hence inherited the above two dependency properties

6795912
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
your static class isn t a subclassing of control so it doesn t inherited these dependency properties

6795919
superclass	subclassing
this way the superclass doesn t have to know what the subclassing need

the name of the session attribute is userbean which has a property name with corresponding getter setter

6796064
put	get
unfortunately you won t be able to put on margins padding as they get added to the 100 so the right bottom edges will overflow

6796155
width	height
you can use their partial requests just to pull albumid photoid height and widths of the images and then pull required data depending on your business rules height width

6796161
portrait	landscape
my problem i believe is that i have a gallery in portrait mode and a listview in landscape mode

6796166
int	chars
in addition you don t need the -- d+ matches one or more number chars so looking for zero or more groups of one or more int is redundant in your case and actually means that you can have 0 or more groups of one or more int .

6796195
width	height
there is no way to specify the height and width in number of cells of an html table as each cell must be specified by itself with and tags standing for table data

6796196

width	height
if the only problem your facing is the padding will be added to the 100 width and height you may consider the box-sizing css3 property

6796312
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
for the way you described your problem you may consider using a uitabbarcontroller instead of a uinavigationcontroller

6796328
int	double
perl s pack has the n and v format specifiers for int and perl 5.10 added the and modifiers so you can read shorts floats and double and some other types in the endianness you want

6796357
button	checkbox
then go to dashboard - pages and themes click the inspect button next to your current theme and you ll see a checkbox next to that new page type -- click the install button or whatever it s called i can t remember but it s obvious when you see it

old width height dimension 480 854 new width height dimension 320 569

6796483
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
so i need to choose ienumerable icollection ilist or may be even list

6796792
clang	llvm
running make install leaves each directory with no action and running locate on a name of an llvm executable such as clang comes up with no results

6796817
unsigned	short
the easiest way is to redefine your color class to hold unsigned char rather than short and make sure they re in the correct order for the endianness of your processor

6796843
hide	show
you will have to use the options dialog word2003 don t know where the ended up in later versions to show hide them all in one fell swoop

navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
the controller for dynaview has a navigationcontroller pushviewcontroller to another viewcontroller but since the navigationcontroller is related to mainview using self.navigationcontroller pushviewcontroller won t do the trick so i was wondering how can i make reference to the navigationcontroller of the mainview instance that created dynaview

6796947
profiler	visualvm
visualvm is practically the standalone netbeans profiler which is a great tool by the way

6796987
gson	jackson
for more dynamic map structure handling i strongly suggest switching to use jackson instead of gson as jackson will deserialize any json object of any arbitrary complexity into a java map with just one simple line of code and it will automatically retain the types of primitive values

6796987
gson	jackson
plus gson has other shortcomings that make switching to jackson well worth it.

6797082
int	chars
i also looked into reading the components of the time column which is the 3rd field of data on each line but not necessarily a fixed number of chars into the line in as 3 simple numbers int then converting to a real number which happens to be a decimal version of the time 107 45 00 - 107.75 which would be fine for the plot but i haven t been able to figure out how to get gnuplot to do that either

6797096
int	boolean
anyways the point is that i store a lot of other things because the nsuserdefaults enable you to store boolean int objects etc

6797098
ienumerable	ilist
implementfoo.thingies returns an ilist which is an ienumerable of thing1s which are ithings

6797110

gridview	repeater
but if you want to do things the asp.net way you might use a gridview or repeater to display tabular repeating data and databind to it with some data

6797725
post	get
ideally i guess it would be best to store the chunk of html making up each article into a database but there seems to be a lot of problems with this and like i said i can t find many post over this particular topic and as someone new to php and databases i want to get some input on the best way to go about this before i proceed

you can install via macports or fink pygtk from these package repositories use x11

6797842
typedef	struct
since typedef can t create a new type for us is this part of the declaration of struct tnode

6797842
typedef	struct
so in the above is it creating a typedef treenode and declaring struct tnode

6797842
typedef	struct
like so typedef struct tnode treeptr

6797842
int	chars
the old-type is int and pfi chars chars is a synonym for int

6797842
int	chars
if int pfi chars chars is the old-type what s the new-type

6797857
rss	feed
typically a podcast is an rss feed here are the spec s from apple who get credit for coining the term obviously so they re specs are relevant

6797868
typedef	struct
like so typedef struct tnode

6797895
pull	push
so you instantiate an ef context push objects in or pull objects out it tracks the complete state of the object changes if change tracking on

6797915
x86	64bit
64bit apps will use the 64bit instruction set which carries a great deal more optimisations than default x86 packages which can result in better performance as compared to its x86 counterpart

put	get
i can t put on the around the fb tag in this forum because it won t show up but you get the idea

6798014
tablet	hdpi	tablet	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
your issue is that some tablet not all are actually xhdpi instead of hdpi though i would think it would fall back to hdpi before mdpi

6798014
tablet	mdpi
edit on second thought i think the more likely scenario is that your tablet is actually mdpi as there actually aren t a lot of xhdpi devices

6798042
inherited	subclassing	metaclass	subclassing
your singletons won t need multiple inherited because the metaclass is not a base class but for subclassing of the created class that use multiple inherited you need to make sure the singleton class is the first leftmost one with a metaclass that redefines __call__ this is very unlikely to be an issue

6798042
metaclass	subclassing
the metaclass is responsible for enforcing the pattern and the created class and subclassing need not be aware that they are singletons

6798042
metaclass	subclassing
since metaclass are usually subclassing of type type it s possible to use one to dynamically create an intermediary base class at run time with it as its metaclass and then use that as the baseclass of the public singleton base class

6798042
metaclass	subclassing
an ironic aspect of this approach is that it s using subclassing to implement a metaclass

6798042
metaclass	isinstance
one possible advantage is that unlike with a pure metaclass isinstance inst singleton will return true

6798080
stretchblt	bitblt

put	get
the reason i said there is no good monad is that any such monad would have to put the tree into a canonical form for a given number of entries to pass the monad laws or quotient out some balance concerns by not exposing the constructors to the end user but doing the former would require much more stringent reordering than you get for instance from an avl or weighted tree

6799899
getter	setter
but if i want that i need to write an object for every single query which may be many objects pages of code with nothing but setter and getter

6799932
getter	setter
if the object model exists purely to apply some semantics over the jdbc queries and not business logic perhaps public members are appropriate avoiding the need for the getter and setter in the style of the j2ee transfer object pattern

6799935

stateful procedures setter and getter functions allowing access to the arrays while also masking it

all the rules of precedence and associativity are followed there -- the first addition happens before the second addition and the multiplication happens before the second addition

i personally do not know how to do this with bash and know that trying to do so in zsh results in dirty hacks with redefining zsh built-in commands like compadd using pexpect python expect perl expect tcl zsh zpty or something similar to run shell in interactive mode and inventing zsh- vim ipc mechanism in opposite direction it is much simpler i once started working on a similar module for zsh but stopped as there were too much problems on this way

6804467
client-side	server-side
you can do this redirect either in client-side javascript it already knows where to redirect the user in all scenarios or you can include the redirection url in that actual ajax response so the flow of pages can be controlled server-side

implements	extends
note also that in order to attach a listener to any object that object must have either implements ieventdispatcher at some level in the objects inheritance chain or at some level the object must be derived from or extends eventdispatcher

6805105
getter	setter
another thing to watch out for is if you have the variables synthesized meaning if you tell the compiler to generate getter setter automatically self.object will invoke the getter setter while simply object refers to the actual ivar

6805109
getter	setter
note they are not quite the same - if you had defined a custom getter setter or had kvc observers set up around one of those properties the would trigger them whereas the straight above would not

6805329
button	checkbox
1 you can add the button and checkbox into the html that creates the dialog and not the use dialog s property that generates button for you

6805329
button	checkbox
2 other approach could be add a third button using the dialog s property and substitute the third button html for your checkbox

6805329
button	checkbox
3 a third option use a regular button that provides the same check uncheck semantic that a checkbox i mean visually craft some css when this button is clicked just make sure some hidden field in the dialog markup im thinking in a form you will post after the ok is pressed gets updated to reflect the check state

6805425

6805570
put	get
now when i look at the server my _server request_method shows put but my question is how do i get the data i sent with curlopt_postfields

6805570
put	get
all i need to do is get the data sent with a put request into the next line

6805570

slideup	slidedown
it would be easier if these two handlers were merged into one or if one handler was performing the whole slidedown operation sequence and the other the whole slideup sequence

6805808
slideup	slidedown
it looks like you want leaf_class to be added before the slidedown animation starts but only removed after the slideup animation completes

6805808
slideup	slidedown
you can achieve that in a simpler way with a pair of handlers bound to the toggle event and explicit calls to slidedown and slideup instead of slidetoggle

illegalargumentexception if the width or height are 0

6808318
width	height
but while debugging in eclipse i see the width and height are -1 after creation

6808318
width	height
if i add a log and get the width and height

6808318

do they hardcode the different cases adding some constant subtract some constant multiplying by some constant or is there some algorithm that can automatically predict this for you

6808395
for-loop	loops
you could then use a for-loop that would copy the value you want to all selected cells if you want to make the next ten cells follow the pattern use a for or a while loops that will update the value of those 10 cells

screens	tablet
for example if your multi-pane tablet layout requires at least 600dp of screens width you should place it in layout-sw600dp

6808882
integer	unsigned
bytes are signed in java - an acknowledged design mistake in the language - but we want to print out the hex value as if it were an unsigned integer

6808882
integer	unsigned
the bitwise and with just the bottom 8 bits effectively converts it to the integer value of the byte treated as unsigned

6808924
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
certain operating systems windows are case-insensitive for files and others unix are case-sensitive

6809031

6809291
getter	setter
as my comment said the most prudent and least-expensive in terms of time spent would be to establish prudent rules but not to create a number of faulty constructs like magic getter setter and other cruft since your wily programmers can and probably will at times even without realizing it for instance the public property created in a function get around them

6809329
google-chrome	firefox
this works on google-chrome but even on firefox this is not working

6809335

i am thinking of limiting my rss feed to 15 items so that those who subscribe will not be inundated with thousands of items in the feed

6809712
rss	feed
if i cap my rss feed to the 15 most recent items how can i obtain the prior ones outside of these 15 and the other problem how to load them

6809712
rss	feed
i already have my rss feed classes and i can successfully obtain my rss feed in my phone

6809712
rss	feed
again stated -- once i load my initial 15 items in the windows phone 7 how can i load additional sets of 15 if i keep my rss items in my website xml kept to 15 items at a time again so that i don t have an rss feed with 1000s of items every time a person loads it

im not sure about the other platforms but if you put your password hardcoded in plaintext on android they would get it really easily

6809783
serializable	deserialization
that proxy type requires a which is the root of your problem - for some reason gwt wires up all of the serializable deserialization methods in a string- js function map probably to facilitate fast lookups - but this setup code comes at the cost of lines of code that need to be in the final build

we would prefer to use tcp but if we could have significant performance gain with udp we would not mind losing data packets once in a while

6815039
udp	tcp
i started with the asio tutorials and played around with sync async udp tcp projects

6815039
udp	tcp
for now i m able to send data with 10fps 0.1ms per image with tcp and 13fps with udp

if you want to load your own modules dynamically study the dlopen dlsym family of functions

6815639
versioning	upgrade
first thought is to upgrade your ruby versioning

6815704
mouseover	mousemove
to detect active tab in browsers you can use mousemove or mouseover events

6815710
folder	directory
this other project is stored in the public directory in the folder of the zend project

6815763
elementname	datagrid
the reason for this is that wpf s and silverlights datagrid columns live outside the logical tree and thus make it impossible to use a binding source specified using elementname which is common when referencing viewmodel properties such as commands from within datagrid template columns

6815777
maven	cobertura
my problem was that i had the cobertura maven plugin setup in the reporting section instead of the build section

6815782

from what i can see basically a client calls a web server with get or post i presume and is returned a bunch of xml

6815960
post	get
as in the controller takes the get post parameters and returns json for example to the client

6815999

6816124
post	get
i m trying to get the topics which have the most recent post

6816132
width	height
or you can use a with the appropriate width and height set and use a css background image on it

6816153
post	get
the most obvious difference is that the access of a web service is done with soap and not http as on the servlet so no get or post for the service

6816221
telerik	radcombobox
i am using telerik s radcontrols like radgrid radcombobox on my aspx pages

6816258
post	get
if it s an application authentication submit a post get http request with the details

6816279

for example if your imageview is 100x100 in width and height you can create a scaled bitmap so that your imageview gets filled exactly

6816289
folder	directory
my wix installer needs the contents of a directory to be copied to a destination folder

6816291
google-chrome	safari
i ve recently been porting a google-chrome extension to safari and encountered this kind of error bug feature etc.

6816291
google-chrome	safari
ps in google-chrome i can load that page and it thinks i m acting on behalf of logged in user so i guess there are some restrictions in safari

6816293
for-loop	loops
you could use a for-loop or a while loops to do this quite easily

6816296
listview	gridview
note that gridview is hosted by customized listview class that has an event listener on gridviewcolumnheader.clickevent

6816332

6816333
internationalization	localization
gettext is an internationalization and localization i18n library which is commonly used for writing multilingual programs

6816377
disk	ram
varchar as you expect is variable-length but keep in mind don t specify something like varchar 100 when you only need 5 characters because although the length is variable when stored on disk it takes the length you specify when working with ram so you will be wasting precious memory

6816423
implements	extends
if you create your own listmodel you should extends abstractlistmodel and when implements your addelement method you need to call a fire -method for notifying the user interface for the update like

6816444
screens	tablet
i m working on a tablet and do want to display as a dialog but do not want to have the height match that of the screens

6816444
hide	show
the html contains links which can hide and show content hiding showing divs

6816467
int	chars	int	double
memset treats any memory buffer as a series of bytes so whether it s chars int float double etc doesn t really matter

6816526
post	get
how can i pass an associative array to some other form through get or post

6816535
post	put	post	get	put	get
so what do i have to put as the parameters of mappedonetomany in order to get the post of type postbase

6816587
evopdf	winnovative
winnovative did exactly what i needed it uses ie rendering engine unlike evopdf

6816597
postgresql	mysql
i don t know about sql 2008 but postgresql mysql sqlite etc all have extensions for spatially-aware data that can load and store shape files and various other formats

6816619
parent-child	one-to-many
1. i think indexed params only work if you have a parent-child or one-to-many relationship

6816626
superclass	subclassing
if i add self.load at the end of __init__ for both classes the load method of the subclassing would be called twice if try to create an instance of sub once from the superclass and once from the subclassing

6816667

i tried setting the frame property of viewcontroller s view see below in viewdidload and viewdidappear methods but it doesn t work that way

6816690
hide	show
let s say i have some bit of javascript which will modify the dom perhaps hide show a form field or something like that and let s assume i want to execute this task on multiple pages but only once or twice per page

6816700
switching	screens
i am trying to create an application that has a main screens and then three buttons that would allow the user to switching to an entirely different context so i have another screens that does some rendering using opengl and another that will do something completely different to what the main screens does

6816704
google-chrome	safari
maybe testing the same resources in safari google-chrome or android browser would be helpful

6816711
super	abstract
if you actually want to instantiate super it s not an abstract class you need the if test in it s init

6816719
children	parent
the whole idea of mdi is that mdi children are contained within the parent

6816760
width	height
in mxml you can just specify the percentage sign in the width or height property like this

6816760
width	height
the values passed into updatedisplaylist are the component s height and width as defined by that component s parent

6816760
children	parent
although mxml can mask it sometimes all components size and position their children in updatedisplaylist based on the size set by the parent

6816776
folder	directory
i have checked with apache by navigating directly to the directory and i do see the new change with just two files in the folder

6816776
versioning	upgrade
last two things i tried upgrade mamp to latest versioning currently 2.0.1 and cleared all .ds_store from my localhost but to no avail

6816813
pop-up	dialog
this will pop-up a dialog where you can change a lot of options about the method

6816840
free	malloc
as the comments point out another very important detail is not mixing malloc free and new delete

6816840
free	malloc
if you allocate with malloc use free and similarly if you use new use delete

6816851
free	malloc
as a rule of thumb you pair new expressions with delete expressions and malloc function calls with free function calls

6816851
free	malloc
in fact if you really wanted to implement baby s first c++ you could define the operators as just as malloc free

6816867
superclass	subclassing
referencing subclassing in superclass methods is indicative of a design problem in need of refactoring

6816867
superclass	subclassing
while you can do it if this instanceof subclassing it tightly couples the superclass to the subclassing es

6816867
superclass	subclassing
in class-based oop subclassing are of course tightly coupled to the superclass inheriting is inherently tightly-coupling but the converse is rarely true and almost never appropriate

6816867
superclass	subclassing
edit from your edit it almost seems like you re trying to find out in the superclass s method whether it s being called on an instance whose final run-time class is the superclass and not a subclassing

6816897
udp	tcp
with http no tcp udp the only method i am aware of is to poll

6816898
post	get
there might be a limit on the size of data you can send by http get take a look at this question and rewrite your request to use http post

6816912
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
the main difference is that c pointers are usually obtained directly through malloc calloc valloc and are released with free

6816962
free	malloc
you ll generally not use pointers in memory management malloc free etc. as this is all handled by the system frameworks

6816995
min	max
seems activity field is a bit and you cannot do a min or max on it

6817001
free	malloc
malloc and free are not to be used in c++ code because they don t support object semantics

6817001
free	malloc
furthermore the results of calling free to release an object that was allocated by new or of using delete to release memory that was allocated by malloc are undefined

6817022
portrait	landscape
for iphone its height is 50 for portrait and 32 for landscape for ipad its height is 66 for portrait and 66 for landscape

6817042
addclass	removeclass

6817082
multiplying	add
for sake of curiousity i would like to add or multiplying the color of the current pixel to the color of the pixel in the previous render frame

6817093
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is lightning fast when you use the dom api but vastly slower using the .innerhtml operator by a magnitude 1000-fold slower however firefox is worse than google-chrome in some areas for instance the append test is much slower than google-chrome but the innerhtml test runs much faster than google-chrome

6817115
filtering	grouping
one of the requirements is to dynamically allow the user to filtering the results by the eeo job grouping number

with the above methods fully implemented your two options are to use the method in either the submit button s onclick event or in the form s onsubmit event

6817201

if you return false the form submit or button click depending on which event you ve wired to will cancel - either way same result - no form submission without what you want in the file field

6817213
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i don t want to use a uinavigationcontroller or a uitabbarcontroller as the rootviewcontroller either

6817384
children	parent
to do so i create a new instance of the child class add the child to the parent s children property of type

6817388
onclick	onchange
here s something that should get you started - this is all based on the assumption that there are only 3 checkboxes on your whole page and that you re interested in all of them - you ll want to make a method like this respond to your checkbox elements onclick events - i ve found that to be more reliable than onchange

6817423
try-catch	exception-handling
a big try-catch around everything in your main-method or a throwing main-method is not the way to use exception-handling

6817445
for-loop	loops
i have setup a for-loop to loops through the ball objects in an nsmutablearray

6817499
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
i would recommend using apache ioutils to copy the inputstream to a bytearrayoutputstream then getting the byte array from that

6817512
integer	unsigned
you have to explicitly select unsigned else it is a signed integer by default so your values can be negatives as well

6817514
g++	gcc
i don t think you can do this with include files apart from modifying the gcc g++ source code and recompile it

6817540
gprof	callgrind
edit oprofile callgrind helgrind gprof papi tau and others i ve analyzed seem not to match my needs

6817578

6820287
rss	feed
a site on the web with public images and a public rss feed is allowing some fair use of those but is not allowing unlimited use for any purpose

6821981
integer	unsigned
you need to pass an unsigned long or at least something that is convertible to an integer to

6823680
getter	setter
auto-implemented properties with public getter and setter are shortcuts for private backing fields with trivial get and set implementations

6823687
width	height
thefile is the path to the image and max_x and max_y are the width and height values passed in via what the user sets them to be

6823687

getter	setter
another class doesn t need to care whether he can access some memory slot somewhere - he just wants an interface for which he can pass or retrieve a value - there are the getter and setter or properties

6823833
getter	setter

i think by default a cell will use 100 of the width of the uitableview so a uitableview s width is equivalent to a cell s width and because you would likely have set your table cell height using

then you would have both the width and height of a table cell or did i misinterpret your question

lisp	scheme
javascript is a lisp variant descendant from scheme that is why it looks like lisp

6827421
for-loop	loops
whether recursion can be used in javascript for-loop recursion is depending on whther the javascript interpreter have implemented tail-call-optimization but most javascript implementations add a comment if you know of any does not have that implemented so generally loops recursion that is calling the function without putting the call on the event queue may cause problems if the call stack becomes too deep

6827588
post	get
if i ve understood correctly and you are trying to make an ajax post back to a domain different to your point of origin then you could do this via proxy using the .load or .ajax commands and creating a server side scraper to get the remote page for you

use a different package name - this will prevent upgrade since it is a completely separate app so far as the market is concerned and also has the side-effect that old versioning are still available for those users who are licensed for that data versioning

versioning	upgrade
the second option may be a better match since you can roll out upgrade if necessary for bug-fixes but can also ensure that wholly new versioning are not detected as an upgrade

rss	feed
i m connecting to a simple rss feed using httpurlconnection

6829810
min	max
it is the result of fetch array how can i find min max from this array

6829817
superclass	subclassing
so to make the reading of the code easier and to avoid a lot of typecasting i would like the list of the superclass to refer to the list of the subclassing

6829829
min	max
it looks like maybe you have an array of arrays each inner array has two keys with the same value and you want the min and max of the whole set of values

6829829
min	max
if this is the case you might want to flatten the array so you get a single array with just the values and then use the php min and max functions

6829840
google-chrome	firefox
it shows up fine in google-chrome ie7 and firefox but its messed up in ie8-9

6829842
jsf	seam
i don t use seam just normal jsf + primefaces

6829843
pecl	pear
so pear pecl s sole pupose is now clarified and it also remains clear that xdebug needs to be compiled for php 5.2 as that is the php version used by the acquia 7.4.4 stack

6829860
actionscript	haxe
in java .net or haxe i would be to create a generic type and test against that however i am using actionscript which does not support generics which is why i need a new class for each type to maintain type-safety

6829880
google-chrome	firefox
however i can t make it work locally on firefox google-chrome

6829907
width	height
remove the px in the width and height attributes in the iframe

6829921
google-chrome	firefox
check this fiddle out open your browser javascript console i.e either google-chrome or firebug in firefox

6829974
min	max
here we expect get_slider.php to return a json object containing at least a min and a max property for instantiating the slider

6830025
put	get
assuming you cannot get them to alter their approach i would suggest you consider including all this as part of the product you are producing and using scrum put the tasks on the backlog so that the work involved in performing this is visible and can be prioritised

6830032
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to work on a cd catelog and there are about 4 buttons where the user has to be able to download separate things the catelog itself internet explorer firefox google-chrome and adobe reader

6830045
post	get
also in general new works with a get and a post is sent when creating.

6830060
int	chars
as already mentioned in other answers that you cannot have for non userdefined types like int chars and so on

6830078
pdfsharp	migradoc
i m using pdfsharp and migradoc setting the rows keepwith property to the index of the row

6830166
getter	setter
usually getter setter are defined

6830214
getter	setter
since the getter and setter you provided doesn t do range checking or special calculations why not make the member public

6830311
width	height
after the scaling zoom gesture - i get the width and height of the view and it s the same just like the initial size

6830311
width	height
but after onmeasure is finished if i get the width and height of the view it s again the same as before.

6830319
folder	directory
i figured this should be straight forward enough to fix i just need to include the root box2d folder in the pre-included directory so it knows where to look

6830374
fgets	fseek
use fseek fgets

6830386
fontforge	cairo
there is a library called fontforge which is using cairo for rendering but i haven t tried it myself

6830393
wxpython	listctrl
so i have a wxpython listctrl which contains rows of data

6830428
inherited	properties
this currently works but seems to be just a workaround because the properties has to have the same relationships as the classes that inherited from properties

6830449
getter	setter
for instance in a tight loop even if you used references rather than pass-by-value which then requires a costly memory copy operation constantly having to add about eight instructions in x86 for every call to a getter setter in order to setup up its activation record on the stack as well as the function s prologue and epilogue is using up valuable cpu time and really hurts performance

6830449
getter	setter
since you re getter and setter aren t doing much you really don t need them

6830453
x86	64bit
therefore i could check if it is 64bit java by checking if programfiles x86 is defined and if javahome points to location which starts with c program files

6830469
width	height
i have a form on the top of a page with a height of 20-30px and a width of 100

6830469
width	height
below there s an iframe with a height of 100 and a width of 100

6830480
centroid	convex
the obvious and simple algorithm i ve been using to handle simple convex polygons is calculating the centroid of the polygon translating that centroid to the origin scaling all the vertices and translating the polygon back to its original location

6830480
centroid	concave
this approach does not work for many or maybe all concave polygons as the centroid often falls outside the polygon so the scaling operation also results in a translation and i need to be able to scale the polygon in place without the final result being translated

6830481
uiview	uiwindow
i have added split view to the uiwindow and worked fine but i need to add uisplitview to uiview controller

6830512
google-chrome	firefox
that s sort of what is happening with firefox and google-chrome

6830522

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
my app is constructed with several uiviewcontroller based on a uinavigationcontroller

6830581
wadl	wsdl
my question is simple really is it possible to create a wsdl or wadl for my rest service and is it necessary

6830662
srt	subtitle
in other words when playing a video i use setsrc method to change video source and i would also redefine the subtitle files srt linked

6830694
wadl	wsdl
i think wsdl is not appropriate for rest and wadl is not necessary

6830742
wadl	wsdl
with a good restful service it s not necessary to generate wadl let alone the much-less-well-fitting wsdl for it because it will self-describe

6830767
width	height
obviously you have to calculate the scaled width and height so the image stays by the same aspect ratio

6830768
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
with that said you can listen for some touch events that are equivalent to simple mouse events such as mousedown mousemove and mouseup

6830788
width	height
the width and height of the rotated images may need to be larger then to base image and you may want you set it up to rotate around the centre but you get the idea

6830838
google-chrome	firefox
im working on a web app and my code is working good in google-chrome and explorer but on firefox its giving me troubles

6830865
comparator	comparable
you can either implement comparable or you can pass a comparator to collections.sort

6830888
post	get
further investigation reveals that this is likely iis disallowing post verbs or some other configuration error with the same effect get requests work fine and there are other developers using the same code with no issues

6830920
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works absolutely fine in safari and google-chrome but when resizing the wrapper div in firefox or ie the table s height stays the same and doesn t expand to the div s dimensions

6830922
centos	linux
scenario i have an internal linux centos 5.6 server offering a virtual host access to which i would like to restrict to users already authenticated on our internal windows 2008 server

6831043
google-chrome	firefox
i think what s going on is that the absolutely positioned elements are pushing your little black flag down in google-chrome and ie but are not in firefox

6831141
width	height
the only reason i could imagine for your method to fail are the width and height values

6831193
ubuntu	linux
i create game using java when i test with linux ubuntu 11.04 the mixer only have 1 line so i cannot play sound simultaneously

6831193
pulseaudio	mixer
i got from net that pulseaudio have -1 line thats mean its have unlimited line so i tried to using that mixer

6831200
width	height
as mentioned in a comment to this question the choice of exactly 2880 pixels being the maximum width and height of a flash.display.bitmapdata object in flash 9 and lower seems a bit arbitrary

6831201
rfcomm	l2cap
the system must support three communication layers or protocols as defined in the 1.1 bluetooth specification and the implementation of this api must have access to them service discovery protocol sdp radio frequency communications protocol rfcomm and logical link control and adaptation protocol l2cap

6831279
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s that or switching to google-chrome or firefox but i like safari

6831308
boost	stl
in general you should use stl or boost containers because of their effectiveness and reliability

6831328
post	get
anyway if i get it to work i ll post the code otherwise someone wiser than i might propose a solution based on the info i just provided

6831336
ready	each
because each iteration calls phaser.arriveandawaitadvance the execution of the task threads will be synchronized such that task-0 does not begin its second iteration until every other task has completed its first iteration and notified the phaser that is is ready to begin its second iteration

6831345
touchesbegan	touchesended
this should let you track multiple touches if you store the touches that you are interested in in your touchesbegan and compare them in your touchesended

6831348
put	get
they are normally but not always put there by a form with get as the method attribute in html or they are put there in some anchor href attribute directly

6831401
chaiscript	c++
scripting languages that might be of interest for embedding with c++ chaiscript falcon lua python angelscript monkeyscript io .

6831438
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
generally when you push a view controller into navigation controller it will invoke the - void viewwillappear and - void viewdidappear methods

6831438
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
because viewwillappear and viewdidappear are invoked with different run loop the activity indicator view will work well

6831464
isnull	nullif
however my select keeps returning null even though i believe i have the isnull nullif set up correctly

6831475
getter	setter
it s a little hideous being filled with getter and setter but in this particular case i m using the access methods to make sure that locks are properly set unset

6831508
isnull	nullif
instead of isnull nullif discnumber na

6831522
coalesce	isnull
i ve also been a snob and replaced isnull with coalesce

6831617
multiplying	addition
you can try x1 c1 and then x1 + c1 but i don t think the addition is much faster than multiplying on todays cpus

6831618
backslash	double-quotes
enclose the regex in double-quotes or escape the parantheses and pipes with backslash

6831654

6831743
post	get
more precisely how can get requests be rejected where a post data is expected

6831793
inherited	properties
since it was set at the user control level all elements inherited this properties which is why i was getting the effect of not being able to raise any mouse events on anything

6831795
tiff	png
edit this appears to be unique to tiff images - switching to a different image format like png caused the image to resize without an issue

6831796
ssl	https
for public apps with ssl enabled marking cookies as this can only be transmitted over https protects against firesheep -style attacks

6831831

6832166
hash	salt
best practices using hash include some salt in it

6832166
hash	md5

6832789
m2e	pom.xml
i thought it gets pom.xml m2e variables about repo location and settings.xml or some profile information and goal target of the current run configuration and it just runs mvn with this pieces of information but it does much much more and it can produce unexpected behavior

6832798
versioning	upgrade
since the express versioning does not support compiling c++ applications for either of these platforms the upgrade wizard is failing to convert your project and returning the described error message

6832798
versioning	upgrade
the only way this upgrade is going to succeed is if you use a full versioning of visual studio with the appropriate platform compiler tools installed or if you edit the solution project files that you have to remove any mention of a non-x86 configuration

6832829
integer	unsigned
no there will not be any issues since count is always a 0 or greater number it is ok for it to return an unsigned integer

6832844
width	height
out of experience for the web i would say a width greater than 850 and less than 1000 px preferably in the 900 s and a height of around 750 px but bear in mind that the height would be variable in case of dynamic content

6833275
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
for..in loops are useful for iterating over the properties of an object but you need to loops through each element in the arrays using a simple for-loop instead

6833295
inherited	properties
my quickest solution not the best but just to get it working i thought would be to inherited from the class in the collection adding in an isselected properties i could bind to and just work from there

6833299

if that s the behavior of google-chrome firefox safari then presumably the users desire this behavior because they chose that browser

6833624
serializable	deserialization
the inter-subsystem traffic is relatively heavy and needs to scale so the decision was made to use serializable java beans as the representation for this type of communication due to the speed of serializable deserialization

6833703
nsmutablestring	nsstring
also you can not access the characters in a nsstring or nsmutablestring with this syntax

6833847
clang	llvm
xcode 4 hilighting i think is now based on clang clang llvm is a new compiler technology that has many goals that traditional compilers have not tried to achieve the feature of use to you is the compiler is not a single monolithic compiler but instead a collection of libraries you can pitch and choose which libraries you want to use the one you would be interested in is libclang which takes c c++.objective-c source code and turns it into a symbolic tree it then turn that into the llvm internal representation you should be able to get the symbolic tree representation which you can then use to hi-light source code

6833917
serializable	deserialization
you will need to control the serializable and deserialization process

6833952
hash	md5
another way would be to compare using md5 or sha-1 hash of the certificate data

6833990
width	margin
one way would be to give div.scrollablearea a width and use margin 0 auto

the second one is also obviously not true because an attacker can search the range of md5 values for the hash although for modern cryptographic-secure hash not md5 this is infeasible

6836467

put	get
i often code in such way that i put several classes in one cs file to get my code going and then at some point i want to move every class to a seperate .cs file within my c# project but i have to do this manually by creating a file for every class and cut and paste the class to the new file and then resolve the required namespace one by one for each file

6837956
google-chrome	safari
it renders fine in ie but not in webkit google-chrome safari browsers

6837964
google-chrome	safari
webkit browsers google-chrome safari dont allow javascript to create bookmarklets

6837964
google-chrome	firefox
in the end though i suggest you look into making a google-chrome extension or a firefox plugin instead of a bookmarklet since you have more capability with either of the two

6838017
width	height
css allows for some manipulation of the form element - so you should be able to set it s height and width as with any element

6838031
post	get
i need to retrieve the types from each of the post variables sent to a php script but i want to do it without using javascript and or jquery i guess it would also be nice to get the other attributes as well id class etc

6838050
websphere	ibm
we are using ibm websphere application server 6.1 and browser is internet explorer 8

6838050
ssl	https
when you try to open a microsoft office document or a pdf document over https ssl ie fails with above error message

6838050
google-chrome	firefox
this does not happen for ie9 firefox google-chrome etc

6838052
jobs	cron
do you mean that you have a series of user-defined jobs that need executed in user-defined intervals and you d like to have cron facilitate the processing of those jobs

6838059
pop-up	dialog
currently when exceptions are thrown in my application the exception message is displayed in a pop-up dialog and then the application restarts after hitting ok

6838059
put	get
get access to the third party libraries and put try catch around where the events are being invoked which could then be forwarded to the main application by a global event

6838080
post	get
im having a really hard time getting the html to post all i get is empty divs

6838089
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome and firefox scales it so small it s unreadable when using 4x1 paper settings

6838090
viewdidload	viewwillappear
now in the in the viewdidload method or the viewwillappear method go ahead and assign this value back to the textfield

6838095
getter	setter
i ve created a class with the same structure of this xml file called parsedexampledataset it has getter and setter

6838106
for-loop	loops
refer the for-loop tldp.org and loops tldp.org

6838155
mousemove	mousedown
the trouble is - when i mousedown then mousemove about 1-2px the point which i draw disappears

6838172
firefox	safari
this workflow works fine for ie safari and firefox

6838208
qpainter	qimage	qpainter	qwidget	qimage	qwidget
using qimage qpixmap for retrieving pixel information is not an option because i need very fast access to what s already been drawn onto a qwidget via qpainter on both windows and mac

6838227
google-chrome	firefox
tested with google-chrome 12 and firefox 4

6838228
typedef	struct
so i would agree with msn s answer to declare a dummy enum struct forward declaration or typedef declaration with a name that is obviously not going to conflict with anything throw a guid in there for good measure

6838244
getter	setter
therefore when you call your setter and getter you are always affecting the same object which you add multiple times to the array

6838268
width	height
i have a containing div that is constrained in its height and width

6838320
bash	zsh
this script also assumes that bin bash is available on your system change that value as needed to run the available shell bin sh bin ksh bin zsh you may need to change the path bin to usr bin to find the shells

6838335
width	height
its a delay in wrapper getting the height and width of the image

6838335
width	height
the jquery for centering is executing before browser has preformed its reflow and given wrapper the height and width of the image

6838335
width	height
by setting wrapper s height and width with javascript before centering

6838434
screens	tablet
an exception may be x-large displays such as tablet for which a great read is distributing to specific screens

6838451
accessor	properties
since you are using properties accessor and i am assuming you have the properties marked as retain you can simply set the new value - the old will be released automatically

6838456
children	parent
i don t know if there is some critical element i am missing because from my limited experience if a tag has children the tag s children should be contained by the parent tag

6838461
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
no current browser that supports canvas that i have tried google-chrome 12 firefox 5 opera 11.50 internet explorer 9 safari 5 renders the text the same as real text regardless of x-coordinate shift

6838644
nextuntil	each
nextuntil gets a set of elements starting from the selector up to but excluding the selector given as argument quoting the docs get all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector dom node or jquery object passed

6838649
interpreted-language	forth
there are virtual machines interpreted-language like java or ruby for example and so forth

6838656
textarea	pre
using an editor like codemirror would be awesome but id have to strip it out before saving and my code blocks would have to be displayed as textarea not as rss friendly as pre

6838683
rss	feed
i m using yahoo pipes to analyze an rss feed

6838687
for-loop	arrays
you assign arrydata to a new arrays on every iteration of your for-loop

6838693
folder	directory
if you have a folder in the root directory images emptystar.png and your css is in styles site.css - then you ll need to reference it as

6838753
getter	setter
what happens when the setter and getter have different names

6838758
client-side	server-side
you might want to try client-side javascript solution instead of the default server-side approach

6838770
width	height
for example i have an image that is 1928 width x 451 height

6838770
width	height
then i assign the longest side of the image to 8191 and reduce the shortest side height by the percentage of which the image s width has overflowed in allowable pixels

6838792
put	get
as more an more emails are put into the database it may become unwieldy to get the entire list from the database and then run the comparison

6838852
getter	setter
however my getter and setter s are not getting called

6838852
getter	setter
my getter gets called however the setter still doesn t get called

6838861
g++	gcc
in gcc and g++ the optimization flag -finline-functions will force the inlining of functions it deems simple

6838861
g++	gcc
the -finline-function flag is also set by optimization level 3 enabled in gcc and g++ with the flag -o3

6838861
inline	inlining
with a little tweaking and adding inline directives to your code you should be able to set some compiler flags to achieve full inlining

6838878
getter	setter
cocoa classes don t use as many properties .foo rather they use getter and setter

6838883
google-chrome	firefox
finally and perhaps most importantly you will need to learn how to use either google-chrome s developer tools or mozilla firefox s firebug as these are indispensable tools for reading and writing html css

6838919
width	height
this also could happen due to dynamic height and width are specified in the grid s containing node using css using height or width like 100

6838919
width	height
dynamic height or width may cause problem when calculating the actual height and width

6838934
accessor	properties
to define your own implementation for properties accessor in your example use the following

6838946
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox safari

6838972
addclass	removeclass
what your looking for is the addclass and removeclass functions and on a timer

6838977
post	put
but there is no article method on the http protocol i believe you probably meant either post or put

6838996
post	get
if get method changed to post what are the necessary changes required

6839033
mouse	trackpad
i do this a ton when editing android uis and always reaching for the mouse trackpad is getting really old

6839033
maven	pom.xml
eta as another perhaps more common example consider editing a pom.xml file with the maven plugin installed

6839048
webkit	gecko
your best bet assuming basing your hosting code on open source software isn t an issue for you licensing-wise is probably to look at the implementation of npapi host in webkit chromium and or gecko

6839068
folder	directory
among other things empty cgi-bin folder lying around and an empty dispatch.fcgi file in my public directory

6839101
shadowing	named
there are a few things that package objects are not allowed to do though the list is getting smaller all the time--i m not sure there s anything left except a prohibition against shadowing other named in the package so a regular object might be a better choice

6839103
width	height
so you want to maximize the scale s under the following constraints where h height of image w width of image

6839110
fadein	fadeout
im creating this frame by frame fadein fadeout image but the problem is the ipad is rendering it very slow.is there a better way to do this

6839127
width	height
so you set width to 8191 and then multiply height by 0.9671744007556972

6839127
width	height
if you don t care about your aspect ratio that is you want to stretch on one axis then you already have width at 8191 so set height to 2048 which will result in exactly the limit

6839128
solaris	bsd
absent a system call that actually allocates space for a file without writing data and linux and bsd lack this probably solaris as well you might get a small improvement in performance by using ftrunc 2 truncate 1 to extend the file to the desired size mmap the file into memory then write non-zero data to the first bytes of every disk block use fgetconf to find the disk block size

6839156
post	get
you can change it to post by changing the get to post

6839159
int	double
assuming we convert int into cint the type of double is transformed from

6839159
int	double
export + exports a specialized function for all known num instances at compile time int double etc

6839214
int	chars
the problem is that c code does not do this so if you compiled a c file and tried to make a reference to the name foo the linker wouldn t find it because the name of the function in the generated c++ file is chars foo int instead of foo

6839275
folder	directory
i am creating a java based applet to secure a file system directory directory here stands for the folder tree from being accessed directly

6839296
children	parent
to monitor files in a directory and still allow the directory to be deleted you would have to monitor the parent directory and its children

6839309
put	get
i want to get the image height after it has loaded so i put it on the onload attribute of function here s my code

6839333
put	get
3 get access to the third party libraries and put try catch around where the events are being invoked which could then be forwarded to the main application by a global event

6839366
range	min
however if y excluded min we add 2 c the total excluded space to it to ensure that it s greater than x+c but it ll still be less than b because our range was reduced

6839378
toolbar	tabs
the toolbar works and i can see the tabs on the side

6839408
rsa	aes
generally public key algorithms rsa need much larger keys than symmetric key algorithms aes because they rely on different mathematical properties

6839456
x86	64bit
on 64bit os it will need to be done with two commands -- once with x86 version of ntsd once with x64 version so that you will be able to use jit debugger for both 32 and 64bit applications

6839469
postgresql	mysql
is there a similar event scheduler from mysql available in postgresql

6839478
mouseleave	mouseenter
i tried to subscribe to gotfocus event of the datatemplate s stackpanel but apparently i don t receive those events even though mouseenter mouseleave work

6839494
for-loop	loops
update i made some changes to my code but was already suspecting what others here have already pointed out sure the enhanced for-loop is slower but outside of very trivial tight loops the cost should be a miniscule fraction of the cost of the logic of loops

6839547
post	put
i ve put together different if not exists checks in my post ddl if not exists conditions to make sql scripts re-runnable

6839584
for-loop	loops
or you can use a for-loop that iterates over a sequence and then add extra logic to break out of loops

6839625
jquery	nyromodal
see nyromodal in jquery you can see lightbox examples for html forms and image gallery

6839633
pecl	pear
maybe this answer helps you with pecl how do you change the default pear pecl build folder from var tmp

6839842
umask	chmod
however it is recommended to adjust the permissions using chmod instead of relying on umask

6839847
umask	mkdir
try to add umask 0 before mkdir

6839849
int	chars
since rand can replace int i figured i could save some time by replacing four chars at once instead of one at a time

6839859
put	get
if i put the same button out of the table do not dynamically generate it then it works fine but then i dont get one button per column

6839867
alertdialog	progressdialog
a progressdialog is an extension of the alertdialog class that can

6839869
hide	show
you can also show progressdialog inside the onpreexecute method and then hide the same in onpostexecute method

6839907
jstl	taglib
for jsp jstl taglib please check the following links

6839914
int	chars
perhaps you are expecting that rand 4294967295 will generate a 4 byte int which you maybe interpreting as 4 different chars

6839921
viewdidload	viewwillappear
viewdidload or viewwillappear methods

6839985
int	chars
even if the overall chars array is aligned properly for int the 35th chars will not be

6839985
int	chars
if it really is always the 35th then you can pad the data with a leading chars so you re accessing the 36th being a multiple of presumably 32-bit int size then align the text to an 32-bit address with a compiler-specific #pragma or using a union with int32_t

6839985
int	chars
implementing code that overwrites up to three leading unaligned chars then switches to 32-bit int overwrite mode for aligned addresses then back to character-by-character overwrites for up to three trailing chars

6839990
hash	md5
remember md5 hash bytes not characters - it s up to you how to encode those characters as bytes before feeding bytes to md5

6840008
hash	md5
so when we compute md5 hash of the utf-8 encoded data we get the first result

6840008
hash	md5
so when we compute md5 hash of the data represented with the unicode code points of each character in the string possibly iso-8859-1 encoded we get the second result

6840033
superclass	subclassing
call your code in the touchesended method of your subclassing and then call touchesended on the superclass or called it on a specific view object

6840042
int	chars
if you know that sizeof int 4 sizeof chars then the above code will work

6840055
streamingmarkupbuilder	xmlslurper
you can serialize it using streamingmarkupbuilder when xmlslurper will make the required changes and output the results

6840143
pull	push
that way you have to mention to what remote you want to pull from or push to for that matter

6840204
button	checkbox
let s assume we have an interface icontrol and we have three implementations of it - button label checkbox

6840204
button	checkbox
the user will enter a number n at runtime and i should create n controls of a specific type button label or checkbox

6840221
subversive	javahl
i am having problem in my eclipse subversive 0.7.9.i20100512-1900 javahl 1.6.15

6840275
width	height
for resizing i am adjusting width and height of the movieclip

6840277
free	malloc
one workaround is to malloc as much memory as you can then free that memory

6840282
invokelater	invokeandwait
3 put enabled visible to the invokelater and all action from listener must be wrapped into invokeandwait

6840303
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
i using everywhere my own methods instead of new fileinputstream .... and new fileoutputstream .... so this part is no problem i always delegate to the appropriate stream

6840323
hide	show
how can i make loading mask be show on top and in panel s afterrender hide it

6840330
int	chars
for this answer i assume that you want to generate the unicode chars int the range between b0 and bf

6840434
qtableview	qabstracttablemodel
i m using a qtableview and a subclass of qabstracttablemodel as its model

6840434
qtableview	qabstracttablemodel
i cannot find a way to tell code qtableview or qabstracttablemodel which is the search column

6840462
put	get
for documentation purposes you could put the mapping directly with the actual method declaration so they stay together and are less likely to get out of sync or rather that the mappings will miss new methods as you do not need to declare a mapping for each interface method

6840470
sorting	filtering
what i m selecting filtering on what tables i m using and what i m sorting by

6840474
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for kiddo

6840507
factors	mean
came across the following so question where one of the answer says ab is not a perfect benchmark tool since you have css js images factors to consider when it comes to benchmark - can someone please explain what these apachebench results mean

6840533
oncreate	ondestroy
if you do not persist you member in onpause ondestroy and then restore it in oncreate you ll have empty field after config change

6840542
folder	directory
the parameter maxage n will copy the files older than n - i normally do a copy to a backup folder and later i do a delete all from that directory once i m sure

6840551
onresume	onpause
to ensure that it s state is always maintained you should persist data on onpause and reload it in onresume

6840558
width	height
i have this problem.i am using decodebytearray to decode and decrypted data as an image and after that i am trying to get the actual size in bytes not width height of that image and show it in textview

6840569
post	get
use fetch and save in backbone to get and post data with rails

6840580
width	height
jquery provides width height transition effect

6840598
vbscript	jscript
vbscript and jscript do not natively have the ability to directly use sockets

6840602
datalist	objectdatasource
i have a page with few listview and a few datalist which are bound to a objectdatasource

6840615
filtering	grouping
use where to filtering before grouping by

6840615
filtering	grouping
having is used to filtering data after the grouping by occurs

6840702
width	height
i could not find any function such as get size or get height or get width

6840798
put	get
so instead of doing the full plot myself i can do that if i have to i am thinking of first making the bodeplot grab the data points do the wrapping on the data once i get the x y data the rest is easy then i need to put the new list of points back into the plot and then use show to display it

6840826
width	height
see width geometry height and size methods

6840841
cvs	svn
even better it supports git svn and cvs even mixing them within the same project if you want to freely experiment with d vcs

6840848
listview	gridview
i got a listview in wpf with a gridview as view

6840853
winpcap	jnetpcap
jnetpcap is an api based on winpcap just install winpcap and it will work

6840906
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
i would use a real file and a real fileinputstream and fileoutputstream

6840965
integer	unsigned
you are using u unsigned integer in printf for all parameters but you are passing a pointer and integer and a string parameter i think that is the problem you are having

6840988
division	exponent	division	multiplication	multiplication	exponent
sympy does not cancel things like automatically but i think that any exponent that would combine through multiplication would also combine through division so powers should be canceling

6841001
std	ostream
using different stream types xmlstream rather than std ostream and defining etc and or

6841016
ultrawingrid	ultragrid
i have an infragistics wingrid ultragrid ultrawingrid whatever... with an unbound column

6841034
pull	push
i a mac guy clone to my filesystem makes some commits then push back actually i go to the repo and pull my changes in

6841036
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval will repeat settimeout will run once

6841052
portrait	landscape
when we make ipad specific website i m making different website for desktop users and we also want to write different css for portrait and landscape mode what method you would prefer

6841143
stdout	stderr
i want to differentiate the stdout and stderr messages in my terminal

6841143
stdout	stderr
stderr font color is red and stdout font color is blue.

6841150
pop-up	dialog
i want the dialog pop-up and make the checkbox in the header to be checked and when i leave the dialog make it unchecked

6841153
docx	xlsx
i m note sure about the service however if you can managed and deploy three .net assemblies for doc docx xls xlsx and ppt pptx

6841157
actionlink	renderaction
with creating helper method you reduce the complexity of calling renderaction actionlink and such methods and get rid of the magic strings

6841157
actionlink	renderaction
i would use t4mvc with its renderaction actionlink overloads that accept actionresult

6841158
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	transpose
since the i j entry counts the number of non zero elements in the element-wise multiplication of rows i and j you can do it by multiplying matrix_logical with its transpose you should convert to numeric data type first e.g

6841310
onfocus	onblur
the only solution i can think of is to use javascript onfocus and onblur to simulate this effect on ie

6841311
calloc	malloc
3 use dlsym to access the memory functions malloc calloc etc and

6841370
keyevent	keyrelease
the best solution is add it to the jtable component where you are laying the jcombobox and implement the method keypressed keyevent e or the keyrelease keyevent e one in order to know which is the key and do the necessary action

6841373
hide	show
and i want to hide that cscript window that will show when i execute the above code

6841392
solaris	aix
we ve used openssl on windows aix solaris hpux and linux for quite a long time and never found any incompatibilities

6841430
button	checkbox
this adds a new checkbox to the dialog but you can use the same approach to add a new radio button

6841434
width	height
any component that requires some dimensional computation for its initialization won t work in a hidden tab because the tab panel itself is hidden via display none so that any elements inside won t report their actual width and height 0 in most browsers

6841495
put	get
when you read the contacts for the first time save them to arraylist make your custom class to hold necessary information about each contact like name and number then put them into the key is the contact number then you can quickly get it from the hashtable

6841602
distance	pdist
elaborating on my comment here is a distance function suitable for pdist

6841602
distance	pdist
note that pdist includes a jaccard distance measure but it is actually the jaccard distance and not the jaccard index or coefficient which is the value you are apparently after

6841682
disk	ram
but network input output is extremely slow compared to disk io which is extremely slow compared to memory ram etc..

6841705
opera	firefox
i ve got a image slider on my website it seems to work fine on ie firefox and opera

but it doesn t work on google-chrome and safari

6841783
jtextfield	jlabel
but part of them are based on jbutton jtextfield jlabel placed into jpanel with gridlaout gridbaglayout 7x7

6841783
jtable	jlabel
2 for weekview shedules are used jtable with one tablecolumn there put jpanel that contains jlabel because is possible that some shedules are penetrated or for other jcomponents#setopaque false

6841786
put	get
i think that you must put some effort to read the stored values directly as decimals edit your schema or something like that or if it s not possible then read them as strings and use decimal.parse to get actual values

6841791
width	height
this means your table width and height set to specific value less than screen size

6841881
getter	setter
interface will again expose all properties as public and ef demands that property must have getter and setter

6841922
ubuntu	debian
you need to install that using whatever tools ubuntu provides as it is a debian off-shoot apt get should work but there may be other preferred techniques for adding packages to your os

6841922
ubuntu	debian
i don t use ubuntu or debian so i cannot help with this aspect of your q

6841923
width	margin
for example after testing i found out that a control s desired size does not include it s border width and margin

6841928
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
generally ienumerable and iqueryable are even better than ilist as they re more generic unless you want to limit this with good reason of course

6841956
dbcontext	objectcontext
explicit loading - you will manually tell property to load the approach depends on used api - dbcontext x objectcontext

6842002
hash	salt
i m already using bcrypt to store salt hash for user passwords so i m covered there

6842017

fadein	fadeout
i have this 23 jpeg images but i couldnt do the proper animation like fadein fadeout

6842101
google-chrome	firefox
so in firefox google-chrome it s takes float right in ie it s take float left it s work fine in other page s because you specify your class much more clear then products page reason you specify float right in #pagebottom .footerpanel .addthis_default_style .at15t_compact now the priority of float right is increased

6842109
superclass	subclassing
in my c# project i have a user superclass and an agent and client subclassing

6842153
post	get
is there one sql query that i can use to get the 2 most recent comments for each post that i get from the post table

6842175
superclass	subclassing
you can t cast an object you have instantiated as a superclass to a subclassing as it isn t of that type an object of type user can never been a type of agent

6842177
width	height
because we serve up images via a jsp rather than linking directly to image files shadowbox seems unable to dynamically determine their width and height and so just opens the images in an overlay of the screen size

it seems to me that the functionality of the postgresql array datatype overlaps a lot with the standard one-to-many and many-to-many relationships

6843985
children	parent
registerattached is normally used where you want to expose a property that can be accessed and set in the child class like dockpanel where children of control tells parent where they want to be placed using dock.left or dock.right

6843985
children	parent
so they are kind of special dependency properties which can be accessed in the child controls which is not the case with simple register properties and they in case of dockpanel helps parent control in displaying children

6844029

6844222
getter	setter
this will create the backing ivar and the getter and setter with the signatures and but in the background they will be manipulating the ivar _audioplayer

6844222
getter	setter
you mentioned in a reply that you come from ruby this can be likened to something like this attr_accessor audio_player but in objective-c it creates setter and getter than can deal with memory management depending on whether you pass in assign retain copy into the property line

6844222
getter	setter
this is how apple does it in most of their examples and it means that it is clearer when you are accessing the ivar directly or going through a getter setter

6844222
getter	setter
i have used the getter setter anytime i have interacted with the audioplayer ivar

6844222
getter	setter
the reason this is using the getter setter is because of the self.audioplayer which will be compiled to the appropriate call like this

6844222
getter	setter
method correct we should use the ivar directly without going through the getter setter so i have to use the _audioplayer ivar that we synthesized like this

6844227

dbcontext	objectcontext
why are you converting back to objectcontext when you are using dbcontext

6852997
qapplication	qdebug
please note that qdebug doesn t do any charset conversion if you don t instantiate qapplication

6852997
qstring	qmessagebox
to do that you might use a proper tool to check it file in case you use linux for example or just call qmessagebox information null null qstring fromutf8 æˆ qmessagebox ok and see if a proper message appears

i m not an expert on this topic the reason i found your post was because i was looking for help with a similar issue but i think maybe there is some overlap between our problems and maybe the stuff i ve tried so far might be able to help you or point you in a direction that can get you some progress

6853553
subtract	add
you don t have to worry about inspecting the sign bit to decide whether to add or subtract

6853553
subtract	add	subtract	addition	subtraction	add	subtraction	addition
the two s-complement system has the advantage of not requiring that the addition and subtraction circuitry examine the signs of the operands to determine whether to add or subtract

6853577
floating-point	integer
c could have been defined differently so that integer subexpressions inherit some kind of floating-point context from any expressions in which they appear

back in the olden days having a separate piece of hardware for subtract numbers would have been a pretty big deal so coming up with a system to perform subtraction and addition with a single unit was very useful

6853670
superclass	subclassing
now if a subclassing of c doesn t call the setuppaint function there s no way that the private flag will be set and methods requiring the contractual call to the superclass setuppaint such as paint will be able to check and throw that exception

superclass	subclassing
this provides an internal interface-point that subclassing can use to add custom behavior to the public myexposedinterface method while ensuring that the superclass behavior is always executed no matter what the subclassing does

int	chars
the above line takes the chars 1 and converts it to an int

6863652
public	protected
for public protected and package private default access methods final does indeed prevent a method being overridden

6863667
int	double
to answer your direct question method2 does create objects by autoboxing assuming that the values you re putting in are primitives double int etc.

6863667
int	double
of course if you use a tuple class you re also creating objects but you will be creating 1 3 the number of objects assuming the tuple class maintains two int s and a double

6863668
jquery	touchswipe
to further dig into my problem will a jquery plugin for swipe functionality like touchswipe or wipetouch help me here

6863715

apparently what it should do is load 4 bytes from the file or 2 in the case of int16 i guess.. convert it from little-endian to big endian and then return it as an unsigned integer

6863715
int	chars
is it something to do with converting between the chars buffer and the unsigned int newbuffer

uiview	subviews
finally exactly how a view removes itself from its superview is really an implementation detail -- it might call a private uiview method on the superview or it might modify the superview s list of subviews directly or something else

6864070
int	chars
with all due respect please since chars s map to int s just check the boundaries

6864073
for-loop	arrays
same principle still applies just nest another for-loop in there and keep track of each individual arrays s length as well

6864077

now you may say well isn t that the same as just changing your baseimplementation#getbaseurl method to be public rather than protected

6864746
min	max
i have the following code which i wrote with the help of the following thread how to select min and max values of a column in a datatable

6864754

pull	push
you pull then rebase your work on top of the bitbucket repo tip then delete the bookmark and push

6865217
equals	gethashcode
you need to define gethashcode and equals for your object to define what equality is for your custom type

6865217
equals	gethashcode
if you don t define a custom comparer which you can do by creating a separate class that implements it will use the default equality comparer which uses the class s equals and gethashcode definition

6865217
equals	gethashcode
either define a custom since you re calling distinct on a sequence of owner or add a equals and gethashcode for your class

6865219
free	malloc
there is nothing too fancy to do malloc for allocation and free for deallocation always paired

6865223
equals	gethashcode
alternatively you could just implement equals and gethashcode on owner and your original method would work

6865241
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
for example curly bracket content gets replaced with a few checkboxlist radiobuttonlist textboxes and a submit button

6865341

before i had a sequential dialing app in php using twilio s twimml now using the rest api i am very confused....i would put the call handle url into the phone section now i have absolutely no idea of where to get started or what to do where to find the calls resource uri they are talking about or even how to execute my script and whether i can still use my php script or not i am really confused.

6865541
free	malloc
for instance if your structure will contain pointers to other memory buffers you can t simply pair a call to malloc and free for your buffer of structures .

6865548
put	get
you will also need to put a redirect in there to get them back to a page

6865699
public	protected
declaration with the keywords public protected or private

6865699
public	protected
class properties must be defined as public private or protected

6865702
getter	setter
most books and examples aimed at beginners tend to use very simple objects so it may not make sense as to why you need to go through all the private properties and getter and setter molarchy but as the complexity of an object increases the benefits become increasingly obvious

6865703
int	chars
this will return the int representation of the chars that the user input

6865703
int	chars
however you could also do an if-else based upon the chars itself rather than converting it to an int

6865708
int	chars
if you want the decimal ascii value of a chars just cast it to an int

6865796
extjs	gxt
but gxt s functionality lags behind that of extjs 4.0

6865845
inherited	properties
the itemssource normally is used for data-objects and what you do there setting the itemtemplate suggest that you should not make your object inherited from listboxitem at all instead it should be a normal object possibly implementing inotifypropertychanged if properties may change after creation

6865852
width	height
how do i get the width and height of an element to adjust when the frame is resized

6865853
superclass	subclassing
and both superclass and subclassing declare a field called field it will always use the superclass one anyway because that s all the compiler can see

6866128
children	parent
adds a node to the end of the list of children of a specified parent

6866174
post	get
â the requirehttps attribute can be used on a controller type or action method to say this can be accessed only via ssl. non-ssl requests to the controller or action will be redirected to the ssl version if an http get or rejected if an http post

6866188
inherited	subclassing
next define the method that is to be inherited by the subclassing in currency s prototype

6866288
children	parent
what i want is to be able to order the parent by the time of the children but not to show the children

6866349
profiling	instrumentation
far easier to use than nszombieenabled is to use profiling instead when running and select the nszombie instrumentation

i have 3 cclayer sublassed layers in a ccscene

6866395
inherited	properties
there is also a system properties to inherited the proxy settings from the system

6866446
inherited	properties
if you want to iterate over all of the properties on an object then inherited properties are the only real problem you have to deal with

6866446
inherited	properties
the object.prototype.hasownproperty method can be used to confirm that a properties exists directly an object and isn t just inherited

6866446
inherited	properties
this will print all of the properties of the object itself but it won t print the inherited .example

6866484
struts	wicket
then to implement what you ve learned or already know about the mvc pattern look into struts spring or wicket on how many people implement the mvc pattern in a java project

6866505
width	margin
for the first part of your question you can fix it by simply removing the width property on your footer since it s a block element and it will occupy 100 of the available width after padding margin etc

6866569
win64	wow64
try this looks for wow64 32-bit on 64-bit or win64 native 64-bit in the user-agent string

6866614
addeventlistener	onload
if there were any other listeners to these events then you should use addeventlistener or attachevent instead of onload onabort onerror but if there s only one listener you can go either way

6866618
public	protected
class methods may be defined as public private or protected

6866661
public	protected
so public protected private is to properties as function is to methods now

6866663
width	height
in fact now tat i think you could apply a css class to thins anchor that applies a background-image to it and fixed width and height

6866674
implements	extends
can t you have an abstract asynctask class which implements this db query code if that s all you re doing in the background thread then put it in doinbackground otherwise put it in a private method and then have your concrete child classes which extends this abstract class call super.doinbackground or call that private method

6866681
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
use mouseenter and mouseleave instead of mouseover mouseout

this worked fine in 3.2 but in earlier honeycomb versions the action bar is apparently not set if you don t use the setcontentview in the oncreate method

6867076
oncreate	setcontentview

notice that since gl_texture_2d uses normalized coordinates the offsets aren t 1 but 1 width and 1 height of the texture

6867579

6867710
folder	directory
however i came across a doubt netbeans when i created a new project it generated an nbproject folder with figures from the netbeans of course are the project settings since the eclipse generates files in the root directory of the project i wonder if i would do this with eclipse when i create a project in eclipse create it creates a directory named ecproject and play the files

6867710
folder	directory
settings inside this directory so it looks organized application folder

6867842
public	protected
for example when class b is derived from class a using protected or private then the public members of a get promoted to protected and private respectively

6867871
public	protected
of course not what would be the point of having private or protected inheritance if i can just create another derived that class that blows away the intermediate class access restrictions and makes everything public

6867876
subtraction	addition
and is it any different using the -- operator besides of course that it s subtraction rather than addition

6867901
superclass	subclassing
if not checking a condition means an error might occur that could have been caught 100 lines earlier or in a superclass instead of being raised in the subclassing then i say there is nothing wrong with checking

generally templates get put in the .h files and included everywhere

6868236
range	minimum
but this does not really help me in this case as i do not know what divisions to do before hand unless i do the computation of the transfer function values over the range of the frequencies to find the minimum and the maximum which ends up doing the whole computation twice which i am trying to avoid

6868236
range	min	range	max	min	max
finddivisions would work nice if one knows before hand the min max of the plot range

6869021

6869033
allocator	stl
one fix is relying on dynamic allocator deallocation of the stl structures

6869108

here in the setter method which releases the mynum but then we are again giving some new value that is newnum hence from the getter method the temporary number gets the number which has not been deallocated till the so there will not be any crash

6869306
children	parent
here the children seem to be views on a superview parent

6869315
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you generally never want to embed a uitabbarcontroller in a uinavigationcontroller always the other way around

6869328

textview	imageview
my situation occurs when i have an imageview side by side with a textview like this imageview textview

the imageview is bit taller than the textview and so what i do is add padding margins to the bottom of textview to get it align and look like the imageview and textview horizontal centers are aligned

6869485
textview	imageview	screens	tablet
problem is when this view is displayed on larger tablet screens the padding and margins don t work out right and the textview doesn t look aligned with the imageview

6869728
spaces	delimiter
looks like here you are using as delimiter but in the input that you have mentioned in the questions there are spaces between the numbers

6869728
int	chars
so scanner.nextint is trying to convert space chars into int and hence the type mismatch

6869750
post	put
this is possible because the type of your comments field in your post is probably an ilist or some such generic interface this is because ef4 can put a proxy list instead of the actual comment list

6870237
int	chars
there are two of these one for int and one for chars

6870273
getter	setter
setting up a property will transfer the access to the data through the getter setter methods a breakpoint on synthesize also works and you will be able to see in the call stack who is accessing what

since a cmakelists.txt is distributed with both zlib and libpng my first idea was to make the following structure

6874883
zlib	libpng
just compile and build zlib and libpng independently and do a find_package png... prior to traversing down into my own app

6874883
zlib	libpng
compiling and building zlib and libpng individually via the provided cmakelists.txt works at least on mac os but again only because zlib is installed to usr

children	parent
this is because it is possible for a parent to have no children or child to have no parent hence no presence of the contact in parent children

6876948
uiview	calayer
but uiview uses drawrect while calayer uses drawlayer incontext they both use setneedsdisplay to call it

6876948
uiview	calayer
so i guess at some point in the implementation of uiview a calayer is created and this layer s delegate is set to the uiview class

6877001
put	get
if you put all that content into a single javascript string and get all the quoting and line breaks right to make it a legal javascript string then there should be no problem assigning it to innerhtml and the browser will parse all the tags and create the html for you

it uses the sqrt of r s smallest positive floating point number as its default threshold so it handles multiplication and division propagated errors

6877004
hash	md5
in your case applying md5 20000 instead of 20 times would slow attackers using a dictionary significantly down because each of their input passwords would have to go through the ordinary procedure of being hash 20000 times in order to be still useful as an attack

6877055
min	max
you only need min and max values to decide nice bin width

6877055

if you would like to generate rainbow tables to decrypt django hash you would have to generate tables for each different salt in database

6877669
accessor	properties
you could also use accessor methods like this to make the properties independent of an actual bool variable for example if you later decide that you want to store the carried weapons in a list you could still use the same method to determine whether that list is empty and wouldn t have to change any external code that relies on the method

6877679

for reference you would use a salt on a password hash

as for using css or html tag attributes to set the width and height there will be practically no difference in speed

6883271
disk	ram
since you don t have the source for the exe and you can t won t use a ram disk the next option is to improve the io performance of your machine

6883271
disk	ram
but without access to the source code for the application this isn t really a programming question because the only way you can program a solution is to write your own ram disk application - and you can t use a ram disk so you ve said

6883603
ostringstream	std
use a std ostringstream for the output buffer

6883605

the main advantage is that having every request go through index.php makes sure that you have a single entry point into your applications s php code -- which means you can put your initialization configuration code there or call it from there and it ll always get executed

6883618
plot	heatmap
can any body suggest a function to plot heatmap for upper or lower triangular matrix in r

if this is really undesireable you might want to check if it works without problems with tomahawk richfaces primefaces etc each which supports rendering the children without additional markup

6883675
width	height
if you want to get all the contents of what is added to your stage then the easiest way would be to add a single container to the stage and add all objects to it then checking the width height of that container

6883675
width	height
this will tell you accurately the cumulative width height of all objects you ve created and added to the display list inside this container or one of it s children

6883675
width	height
then check the width height of the document class

6883675
width	height
this is because i noticed in air 1.0 back in the day that not setting these properties resulted in skewed results when setting object position and reading height width on the stage and in my cause it was probably because of scaling

6883695
post	get
the and other variables are sent correctly using the post method the one that gives the problem is the one in the select tag the variable first to explain is that i get the content for the options tag using a db then i set the options that will show using php for it but i really don t get why wont it send the _document variable using the post method

6883719
post	get
post worked while get didn t because that is the default method for task queue

6883719
post	get
if you look at the function documentation one of the kwargs is method in which you can specify get post etc but as you didn t in your code it defaulted to post

6883731
int	chars
you may not see the difference in your specific situation as you re calling printwriter.write int which writes a single chars - if the chars encoding you re using just maps chars to the same byte for chars less than 127 then you ll see the same result

6883737
put	get
for instance your long time users won t get any future defaults you add so if you put a great new feature in and they already have a db they won t get the defaults for that feature unless you put them in code at which point you have to write code anyway

6883754
switching	screens
but on switching the screens to landscape the image gets distorted and stretched too much

6883791
portrait	landscape
android recommends dedicated sets of images for landscape and portrait modes also for low media and high resolution screens

6883791
portrait	landscape
so you need to have a background picture suitable for landscape mode under res drawable-land portrait in drawable-port folder

6883791
portrait	landscape
for lunarlander app you can see that two sets of images were created each for landscape and portrait mode

6883796
portrait	landscape
i use two images one for portrait and one for landscape

6883811
int	double
but you could use boxing with nullable types this would work with int and double

6883811
int	double
in this example the int values will be converted to a double anyway so there s no loss of data and the int can implicitly converted to double but the return value would need to be explicitly cast to int

6883844
hash	salt
again i would urge you to salt and hash your user s passwords for better security

6883851
xml-rpc	json-rpc
aria2c has a nice xml-rpc or json-rpc interface to interact with it from your scripts

6883852

6884162
getter	setter
should all classes implement an interface even if the only thing in the interface is getter setter

6884165
int	chars
yeah as far as i know you can only do performselector blahblah withdelay with objects as parameters not types int chars etc.

6884188
getter	setter
if the interface is only getter and setter that sounds like it s more to do with data than behaviour - and doesn t sound like the sort of thing i d mock

6884192
getter	setter
if a class merely consists of simple getter and setter there hardly seems any point in mocking it

6884211
width	height
window.innerheight and window.innerwidth will give you the current visible window height and width

6884211
width	height
the simplest thing to do is to use a width of w - distance and a height of h - distance

6884228
squash	branch
create a copy of the topic branch interactively rebase it to the master branch git rebase -i e squash the commits in topic branch into one and finally delete the copy of the topic branch you created

6884229
gif	png
if you want to check whether an image s src url ends in jpg png or gif you can try matching the tag returned by getimagefromcontent

6884229
gif	png
isproperurl will be true if the src ends with jpg png or gif

6884242
subtraction	addition
thus no addition subtraction etc

6884254
getter	setter
character and self viking both have the instance variable setter and getter method characterhealth

6884285
width	height
it would be optimal if i somehow would be able to define the height width posx and posy in pixel coordinates from the tile set to draw from

6884295
profiler	yourkit	yourkit	jprofiler
but before you do use a profiler such as jprofiler or yourkit to identify the exact spot that s causing the performance issues

6884325
post	get
the http request is used internally by lwp useragent and if they would return it via get or post -methods it would already be too late since the request is already done

6884365
width	height
i d like to standardize the full width and height that is the width and height including padding and border etc in and without losing the native styles that browsers use by default

6884367
getter	setter
prefer constructor injection to getter and setter

6884371
graphics2d	bufferedimage
rendering using bufferedimage is pretty easy by utilizing the graphics2d class

6884381
division	multiplication
if you read this carefully you ll see that the iterative newton s method is doing two subtractions one multiplication and one division per iteration

6884396
width	height
the quick answer to your question would be to use a form and add a target _blank attribute to it this doesn t give you control of the width and height though

6884420
post	get
you check for get in your php but send post by specifying the type as post in your ajax

6884429
width	height
the table has 100 width and height of the div

6884486
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
try fixing the captions width and height and setting margin and padding to 0

6884487
google-chrome	firefox
very annoying because this works fine in firefox and google-chrome

6884495
division	multiplication	division	addition	addition	multiplication
as a general rule of thumb both floating point division and square root are considered as slow operation compared to fast ones like addition or multiplication

6884513
width	height
height and width of the function getbbox bring me only the attribut values defined as width 30 and height 45

6884513
width	height
i am looking for the real parameters like i would open the picture alone which are in reality width 300 and height 430 pixels

width and height for the li tags needs to be set to something in which your alt tags can fit

6884533
folder	directory
if yes you just can move the folder anywhere on your server let s say usr local symfony and from your sites just load the autoloader from this directory

6884552
cpu	processors
assuming you are using most common x86 cpus i can give you this link this is a collection of measured instruction latency how long will it take to cpu to get result after it has argument and how they are pipelined for many x86 and x86_64 processors

6884552
cpu	processors
for newer processors the cost is less and is almost the same for div and for sqrt for sandy bridge intel cpu

6884552
sse	avx
also newer cpus have vector operations sse sse2 avx of the same speed as scalar x87

6884598
folder	directory
so i took the suggestion of andrew mcgarry and put my android sdk folder in my c directory and viola problem solved...well after i redirected it in eclipse obviously lol

6884599
subtract	add
when incrementing time you should convert back to utc and then add or subtract

6884741
post	get
what you need is a post redirect get pattern

6884751
width	height
i did a little research and was unable to discover a property that you could enumerate to get the images actual width and height

6884751
width	height
the solution is to utilize a hidden as a working container and pulling down the necessary images using where you can enumerate width and height there

6884755
hide	show
per default the searching dialog will be created once and then will be only hide or show

6884772
portrait	landscape
what is the proper folder name to provide a landscape and portrait version of a drawable

6884809
put	get
how does it get put in this file

6884815
folder	directory
and i m working on project with this directory hierarchy model control view and helper folder are in my project folder

6884822
super	extends
just write read the persistent storage in the onresume and onsuspend methdod of each activity or create super activity class and extends it for a b and c

6884823
for-loop	arrays
declare new chardata inside the for-loop and then add it to arrays

6884851
int	chars
another reason i can think of not to store phone numbers as numbers but as strings of chars is that often enough part of the software stack you d use to access the database php i am looking at you wouldn t support big enough int natively to be able to store some of the longer and or exotic phone numbers

6884871
int	double
int double and so on

6884877
onresume	onpause
make sure you release the wakelock and acquire them on your onpause and onresume methods

6884882
rspec	capybara
that is one of capybara s rspec matchers capybara rspecmatchers#have_selector

6884886
inherited	properties
in the code you posted yes when doing inherited that way it s necessary to reset constructor if you want it there because the object you instantiated to act as the child prototype has a constructor properties pointing to the wrong constructor its constructor

6884886
inherited	properties
edit also might be worth mentioning when doing inherited using the non-standard __proto__ it s not necessary to reset constructor because __proto__ merely specifies and object s prototype which it to say the object on which lookups will be performed when an own properties doesn t exist

6884891
uiview	subviews
the subviews was attached to that uiview

where in this process can i free that malloc d memory

6885146
post	get
combining pipedinputstream with pipedoutputstream and peter s multioutputstream from another post here you can get the following

6885160
subtract	add
to use it only for collision detection you just set your bodies as sensors and when a collision is detected you send it off at the angle you would like subtract or add angles together rolling over when the maximum of a range is met

6885162
fadein	fadeout
the fadein or fadeout should be called once this timer of yours has expired the method doesnt need to take the deltatime but its good practise as it will lower the volume at the same rate across all devices

6885183
hide	show
after the animation ends the scrollview is show and i need to interact with the scrollview for example clicking the button and obviously scrolling but all the events are always caught by the linearlayout 2 because it always has the visibility set to visible even if is actually hide out of the screen

6885195
width	height
my recommendation is to use fixed width and minimum height to your body or main container

6885206
put	get
i ve seen a few ideas on this like instead of like create update insert delete crud use get and put

6885206
client-side	server-side
is the object searched client-side or server-side

6885208
free	malloc
there is a good discussion about the safety of using malloc free in objective-c here

6885208
free	malloc
as long as you correctly free the memory that you malloc there should be no issue

6885208
free	malloc
if you don t need ultimate performance i would not use the c malloc free statements directly

6885211
submit	submission
then load all projects one by one and see in which it works and in which it doesn t if you found problems with specific project submit your bug at netbeans.org or there is in built system in ide itself for submission bugs in options

mp3	wav
i want my program to play mp3 wav mp4 3gp files commonly used which is the best library to use

6885229
nsstring	nsdata
nsstring has methods to write its contents to file so converting it to nsdata is not necessary and you can do that with just one line

6885229
nsstring	nsdata
if you can t do that and want to append line to an existing line you ll have to use nsfilehandle class for that as writing methods of nsstring or nsdata simple overwrite existing files

6885245
ddms	hprof
dump your heap using the dump hprof file toolbar button in ddms and examine the results with the mat plugin for eclipse

6885279

it is not legal to free temp since it wasn t allocated using malloc

6885417
qtcore	qtgui
in this case qtgui has a dependency on qtcore

6885417
qtcore	qtgui
qtcore therefore must appear after qtgui in the link list

6885422
fadein	fadeout
this is because you have 4 div elements in your page for each div element you tell to jquery to fadein wait 1s and fadeout this element #image so jquery do it as you request it

6885534
innodb	myisam
i am using mysql server and i came to know that mysql uses both innodb and myisam engine.so i want to know for any big project which engine should i choose innodb or myisam

6885542
innodb	myisam
myisam versus innodb

6885544
innodb	myisam
innodb may be preferable when you have many foreign key relationships to manage as it has the ability myisam lacks to enforce foreign keys and cascade deletes and updates

6885566

in the following code the get action returns a betting card for a given race date and the post i use the post action to transform properties of the bound model to route values for the get action

6885566
post	get
in the details view i only need one command being display for date so i get off easily by using the submit button and the http post takes care of model binding

6885566

i was wondering if there is any way of increasing the volume of such a video especially youtube but could be extended to other types because i m interested in doing it and even publishing it as firefox google-chrome other browser plug-in

6885784
hash	md5
you will need an asymmetric encryption algorithm eg rsa and a hash algorithm eg sha md5

6885794
int	chars
in the same way that a max-length can be specified for string data types varchar 5 maximum 5 chars numeric data type cells can have a display length specified e.g. int 5

6885809
min	max
drop a tprogressbar on the form and set its min and max to 0 and 16383 respectively

6885936
for-loop	loops
implement runnable and assign an id field to each object which will be the for-loop index loops queue 10 runnables and pauses check id while executing runnable and turn a flag on

6885942
ienumerable	iqueryable
asenumerable forces linq to consider the query as an ienumerable rather that iqueryable from this point so what comes next is executed in memory not in the db

6885955
getter	setter
when wpf reads or changes a dependency property binding and animation it does not use these setter and getter

6885955
getter	setter
these setter and getter you are showing are for us developers

6886037
superclass	subclassing
lastly the call to modify cannot be done in the function declaration because the implicit call to the superclass would then be executed again when we set the supposed superclass to the prototype property of the supposed subclassing

6886059
width	height
you canset at the beginning of method default values for width and height to be equals to squaresize and then remove following code block

6886081
post	get
when you post a form you do it generally with post request as opposed to get request

6886085
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
you can install those you need in separate parallels virtual machines vmware and virtualbox would work as well

6886102
post	get
basically the post will say that i m trying to gain popularity for the site that i could really use some shares i ll point out that they get six post a week without asking for anything and i ll tell them that i m fine with them deleting the post if they really don t want to share it

6886125
addclass	removeclass
you should look at jquery s addclass removeclass toggleclass and hasclass methods api references here here here and here

6886125
post	get
give this a try and post another question if you get stuck

6886130
folder	directory
the application goes to the correct directory on my server and the current folder is added with my application inside it

6886150
hide	show
also i m not removing the class on second div for the same reason rather i m calling show hide as i think that is what you intend to do

6886174
post	get
just use a get or post parameter when you run your ajax request

6886207
versioning	upgrade
it turns out that i needed to upgrade the versioning of ant i was using to 1.8

6886212
getter	setter
now this is all well and good for general use in your class but sometimes it is recommended to not use getter and setter in case they cause side effects

6886212
getter	setter
two places where you normally want to avoid getter and setter are in init methods and dealloc

6886212
getter	setter
therefore as you was in the init method you should access the ivar directly without using the getter setter

6886212
getter	setter
when i called it creates the getter and setter using the name appfolderpath but the ivar these methods effect is actually called _appfolderpath

6886212
getter	setter
this is good practice as you will always be sure when you are accessing the ivar directly or through a getter setter because just referencing appfolderpath in your code will not compile

6886217
portrait	landscape
in my -shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation i return yes for both landscape orientations and for portrait not portraitupsidedown

6886217
uilabel	uibutton	uilabel	uitextview
fyi the contents below the top uiview are a scrollview a uiimage a uilabel a uitextview and a uibutton from top to bottom

6886246
rubygems	rvm
instead of using rvm update i had to use rvm rubygems

6886249
hash	md5
i developed an auto-updater for my application that gets a md5 hash list for all files from the update server and downloads the new files in case of a mismatch

6886296
profiling	debugging
its great for runtime debugging and cpu profiling

6886303
typedef	struct
i need to reference a struct that s not yet defined because the struct actually conatins the typedef d function prototype

6886316
post	get
as others have pointed out params values can come from the query string of a get request or the form data of a post request but there s also a third place they can come from the path of the url

6886320
stateless	stateful
if you google on viewparam stateless stateful you ll find some more info

6886334
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome around 15-20 fps and in firefox around 2-3 fps on my computer

6886334
google-chrome	firefox
firefox would freeze before the switch and google-chrome ran about 10x faster

6886347
inherited	properties
thechild inherited the properties _parent_property from its parent class

6886358
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following code works perfectly in google-chrome and safari but bonks in firefox

6886358
post	get
and the php relay on my server that uses curl to post or get from another domain

6886358
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
token shows up perfectly in the error_log and everything works perfect in google-chrome and safari but in firefox the ajax status is error and the responsetext is blank

6886361
setinterval	clearinterval
i have a div that is above something i want to showcase and i have the setinterval working but the clearinterval isnâ t firing when it reaches 2 loops

6886393
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
other ways would be to loops thru the arrays using .each or a simple for-loop

6886424
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
raphaã l currently supports firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ google-chrome 5.0+

6886434
profiling	debugging
one thing that might help you debugging is using the undocumented profiling on -memory which will track allocation in the matlab profiling

6886454
nsstring	nsdata
thats because nsstring in fact does not respond to that message - your code adds a category to nsdata

6886502
getter	setter
it is to do with making your intent clearer about whether you are accessing the ivar directly or using the getter setter

6886502
getter	setter
this will compile and produce the getter setter declarations like this

6886502
getter	setter
to use the getter setter i can use dot notation or the getter setter like

6886502
getter	setter
it will not compile because i am not using the getter setter and there is no ivar called people it should be _people

6886514
accessor	properties
i know of the error the accessibility modifier of the set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer

6886523
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
in a traditional programming language you would use a for-loop to go through the elements of an arrays or vector but generally in matlab you want to avoid for loops if you can and instead take advantage of matlab s vectorization because it s much faster

6886531
public	protected
recall that internal means not visible outside of this assembly except through internalsvisibleto access which makes internal look like public whereas protected means visible to all subclasses

6886565
firepath	firebug
you can use firebug and firepath plugin for firefox to find the ids

6886589
conio	ncurses
you need a special console input output library like ncurses or borland s conio to do that

6886599
hash	md5
you should probably use an md5 hash

6886606
apache	lighttpd
it has a webserver installed first apache then i changed to lighttpd to see if ot solves the problem and i am editing files on a shared folder and then load them in the w7 host via the webserver

6886614
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
i don t have the necessary browsers john resig cites firefox 2 opera 9 and safari 3 as browsers where the array exploit works so i can t test it but maybe this is a place to start

6886623
superclass	subclassing
it is quite improbably for a subclassing implementation to define a total order among objects of a superclass

6886664
accessor	properties
if you mark entire properties as internal protected and accessor method as protected - everything is fine

6886714
kdtree	octree
did you already rule out a kdtree or octree

6886714
kdtree	octree
the descriptions of kdtree chapter 21.2 and octree chapter 21.8 in numerical recipes are quite understandable

6886757
dictionary	map
i used csv.dictreader to create dictionary for each file but i am stuck trying to find a way to map each city to each code

6886763
flask	pyramid	flask	django	flask	pylons	pylons	pyramid
django is great but you might also consider flask or pyramid pylons

6886786
width	height
you need to set the img styles height and width to 100

6886820
width	height
and ask gently for it s height and width

6886833
getter	setter
give it some setter and getter and call it balloonview

6886834
post	get
i found this post which seems to be an exact duplicate but i can t figure out how to get the answer to work for me so i m posting again.

6886841
google-chrome	firefox
currently google-chrome 12 and firefox 5 do not support this

6886844
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
in this example users browsing with firefox opera safari ie7 9 10 will see a red background

6886866
submit	submission
it is just beta - and it includes ios5 which is also beta - you can submit to the mac app store with xcode 4.1 but xcode 4.2 can t be used for app submission yet

6886897
width	margin
this gives it a width and a flexible margin

6886905
mouseover	mouseout
to keep the mouseover and mouseout functions consistent and to reuse the navjumpheight variable instead of using magic numbers you could change the previous line to something like this

6886938
width	height
adjust width and height as necessary

6886941
post	get
i get this message when i post to the facebook wall

6886965
960.gs	fluid
there s also the fluid version of the 960.gs

6886970
opera	firefox
how do i make media queries for the different mobile browsers like opera mobile and firefox on the android

6887001
folder	directory
i m trying to find a way to duplicate a series of files folder from one section on a server to a new directory on the same server

6887020
button	checkbox
i am creating a form with both radio button and checkbox

6887086
hash	md5
of course md5 has been shown not to be a good hash function

6887086
hash	md5
take a md5 implementation hash your serial numbers and see if you get a collision

6887086
hash	md5
a basic md5 implementation should be able to hash a few million values per second and with a reasonable hard disk you could accumulate a few billions of outputs sort them and see if there is a collision

6887115
google-chrome	safari
for some reason safari and google-chrome possibly other browsers have issues playing mp3 files and other audio video files uploaded to this application

6887115
hash	md5
if i download the mp3 from my web application via curl it has the same md5 hash so it s not corrupting the mp3 in any way

6887147
post	get
a link cannot post data only get

6887229
multiplying	add
multiplying the matrix a with the vector x and add the result on the vector y

6887242
put	get
i would use constructor injection but if i put the iuserstatusservice as a parameter in the constructor i can t figure out how i would get ninject to inject the correct parameter when i call new usergridmodel html in the view without explicitly using the ikernel there

6887253
sorting	filtering
sorting filtering pagination i believe raw data can be sorted and table can be rebuilt

6887282
portrait	landscape
i want to use the same image for portrait and landscape but to make it look decent i need to rotate the image 90 degrees when in landscape so that it does not get stretched to fill the screen

6887282
portrait	landscape
my solution was to just create two copies of the image one for portrait that i put in drawable-port and one for landscape that i put in drawable-land

6887299
hash	salt
i ve read on so and from other websites found on google after i tried to look into it a little bit more that the correct secure way to store passwords in a database is to store the hash + salt value of a password

6887299
hash	salt
from my understanding you hash the password then you use another value that you hash the salt and combine those two together so the algorithm to retrieve the original password is different for every user

6887315
int	chars
reading from argv 2 one int to g.number and one chars to c

6887318
hash	salt
what about secure hash and salt for php passwords

6887338
folder	directory
the file that it is requiring is on the same server within the same root folder but it was one directory up

6887339
uilabel	uibutton
then add this uilabel as subview of uibutton

6887346
hash	salt
one uses a salt to avoid the attacker creating a rainbow table a table containing all usual passwords and the corresponding hash sorted or somehow easily accessible by hash

6887346
hash	salt
if the hash are salt and the attacker gets the salt with the hash he will still be able to do the same attack with only slightly more work to input the salt - but now this work of building a rainbow table is useless for the next hash with another salt which means this will need to be done for each user again

6887346
hash	salt
some hash algorithms for example bcrypt which is specially made for password hashing have a special salt input parameter or generate the salt themselves and include it in the output

6887346
hash	hmac	hash	salt
a simple variant which works for most hash algorithms would be using hmac with the salt as message input the password as key

6887346
hash	hmac	hash	salt
hmac password salt hash password âš opad || hash ipad âš password || salt

6887346
hash	salt
then you store the salt together with the hash

6887346
hash	salt
for a slightly higher barrier you could store the hash in another location than the salt

6887346
hash	salt
but you will still need both for login. for login you then will give the password and the stored salt to your hash function and compare the result with the stored hash

6887356
freemarker	velocity
every single templating language out there does exactly that velocity freemarker stringtemplate and jsp jsf expression language

6887385
hash	salt
a salt is just a random string of characters that is appended to the password before it is hash

6887385
hash	md5
if you google this you ll get a number of pages telling you that this is the md5 hash for letmein

6887385
salt	md5
you d be then performing md5 letmein747b517c80567d86906cd28443b992209b8ec601a74a2d18e5e80070703c5f49 which returns af7cbbc1eacf780e70344af1a4b16698 which can t be looked up as easily as letmein without a salt

6887385
hash	salt
you d then store both the hash and the salt and when the user types in their password to log in you d repeat the process above and see if the password the user entered with the stored salt appended hash to the same thing as the stored hash

6887400
post	get
if the form method was get you should have already appended the data to the url if the method was post you ll want to set the data for the curl request to the data query string you generated from the form names

6887409
salt	md5
using salt prevent precomputed rainbow-tables usage as an example if a user use password as a password md5 password sha1 password or whatever password may be well-known results stored in some rainbow tables

6887409
salt	md5	hmac	md5
if you use a different salt value per person - called a nonce - you ll get md5 hmac password randomsaltvalue sha1 password anotherrandomsaltvalue .

6887451
japplet	jdialog
this will give you the option of using your gui in a jframe or a japplet or even a jdialog or embedded in another jpanel should you so desire

6887451
awt	swing
as others have stated and as i stated in my earlier comment you should move up to the swing library as it is much more flexible and robust than the awt gui library that you are currently using

6887457
public	protected
public private protected

6887467
uploadify	plupload
i ve heard good things about plupload and to a lesser extent uploadify

6887476
fadein	fadeout
it will create a mirror observablecollection using reflection use the mirror as itemssource instead and handle the fadein fadeout animations

6887491
webclient	httpwebrequest
list is long i have been strongly advised to use httpwebrequest only problem is i need the raw headers with the response the websites i am trying to download sends a very long and weird cookie which is not handled by httpwebrequest webclient

6887603
calloc	malloc
is there a scenario where malloc fails while calloc returns success

6887603
calloc	malloc
suppose i give malloc 20 and does there exist any scenario where malloc could fail and calloc succeeds

6887613
calloc	malloc
the only reason i can think of where malloc fails and calloc succeeds is if some library or your application overrides one and not the other

6887657
facebook	fbconnect
drag and drop the fbconnect folder from the facebook sdk project into your application s project

6887694
int	double
this doesn t of course mean that you can declare a as an int and then define it as a double

6887735
post	get
unfortunately html specs only has http get post

6887735
post	get
a form tag can either do a http get or post

6887757
width	height
the page width height

6887760
fadein	fadeout
why not just have your fadein and fadeout calls inside your .ajax success function

6887773
versioning	upgrade
we have apache 2.2.14 but need to upgrade to a higher versioning due to security vulnerabilities

6887822
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
if you can t change the memory limit a workaround might be calling the commandline imagemagick or graphicsmagick tools if they re installed .

6887867
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine on google-chrome and safari apparently i m getting the info correctly but in firefox it just returns nan

6887872
uitabbaritem	uibaritem
uitabbaritem extends from uibaritem that has the tag property

6887875
post	get
after editing you can again import the screenshot from to datauri and send it via ajax post or get to your php script

6887883
inherited	properties
you could copy the properties over to the the new object but then it isn t really live inherited

6887905
ironruby	ironpython
you can download the vs 2010 express editions and then download the ironpython or ironruby tools as addon

6887908
portrait	landscape
for example if i wanted my view controller to support portrait and landscape right this would be my implementation this could be reduced to a line but i m expanding it for the sake of clarity

6887945
free	malloc
important thing is that when you allocate memory with malloc you should always free the memory

6887946
put	get
you will only get an newline into a java string if you put it there explicitly

6887948
post	get
and also please read what is the difference in get post requests and when it should be used

6888024
hide	show
it looks like most of the options accepted by the .animate function are accepted in the show and hide properties

6888027
notepad++	jedit
you might find it easier to learn the basics in a simple text editor like jedit or notepad++

6888028
width	height
you ll have to change the height and width accordingly to fit your image

6888062
gridview	onclientclick
how change visibility of gridview template field on onclientclick event

6888070
post	get
third the only important difference not the only but the important between post and get is

6888070
post	get
u can clearly notice that post s dont display in the browsers address bar but get do

6888073
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

6888074
subtraction	add
remember you can add negative numbers so you have subtraction covered too

6888074
printf	getchar
scanf printf putchar getchar - basic c io functions

6888074
strdup	strcmp
- strcmp strdup - a couple useful string functions that will be useful

6888077
hide	show
to do hide lblnetpayments and txtmypayment and show checkmypaymentstatus on btnbulkassign_click event

6888101
int	chars
here the default attribute of the integer-typed property shall only accept valid int values whereas the default attribute of the string-typed property shall accept any chars

6888132
puts	gets
this jsp simply calls the el function let s call it put that takes two parameters and is derived from a java method putperson string string that gets a connection to the database and puts the first and last name in their proper places

6888165
children	parent
if two children have the same parent how does an event firing from one child get handled by the second child

6888172
udp	tcp
my application has the main thread a tcp server thread which accepts async connections and a udp server thread

6888202
lisp	scheme
if foo is a function then it was clear common lisp took the ideas from scheme behind lexically scoped first-class functions and integrated it into the language

6888223
range	infinity
there is no special infinity value in java s integer class you can store the full range of values

6888268
implements	extends
for an object to be runnable it needs to implements the runnable interface or extends the thread class however it does not seem that httpservlet does any of these

6888290
xlsx	xlsm
edit basically i would like to open an xlsm document and save it as an xlsx document without required excel to be installed via the openxml sdk or something

6888292
unsigned	short
of course you are still relying on unsigned short being 2 bytes on your platform and the representation in the file having the same endianness as your machine but at least you aren t making assumptions about structure padding

6888292
int	chars
if you want to see the numeric value you should cast to a non- chars int type

6888342
fadein	fadeout
you can use jquery s animate function to do that or fadein and fadeout which are basically wrappers for it

6888436
setinterval	settimeout
so you re absolutely right calling settimeout through loop from the delayed function itself only reimplements a poorer setinterval

6888443
put	get
to get the data downloaded i use asihttprequest which methods i have put in another class

6888458
setinterval	settimeout
the solution in my opinion is not using setinterval at all but rather call the next xhr request only from within the callback of the previous request possibly by using the settimeout as well to ensure it will wait the proper amount of time before polling again

6888490
min	max
i would find the max and min value within each set and the draw a vertical line on that x point

6888507
switching	screens
i tried switching to version 1.0a2 1.0a4 and 1.0b2 but on 1.0a2 the screens goes blank on orientation change and on 1.0b2 and 1.0a4 split button appearance changes in a not desired way

6888558
spweb	spsite
the above should be fine as long as you still have a reference to the spsite and spweb then you can dispose of them

6888558
spweb	spsite
just a small one best practice is to called dispose instead of close on the spsite and spweb objects

6888566
hash	salt
the membership provider will use a salt sha1 hash of the password

6888566
hash	salt
the salt and the hash are stored in the table aspnet_membership assuming you ve not implemented a custom provider btw - this is why the hash values are different - the salt are different

6888566
hash	salt
on login the membership provider will pull back the membership record hash the password you entered with the salt from the record then compare the results

6888566
hash	salt
what s obviously happening in your case is that you re either not creating the same hash password possibly the wrong salt or you re not comparing the hash output to the correct value

6888572
floating-point	integer
if you know your input will never exceed a certain length and don t need to be able to parse to a primitive floating-point type then you could use something like nsdecimalnumber good for up to 38 digits or implement a comparable utility yourself where you note the position of the decimal point parse the number as an integer and reinsert the decimal point at the correct location whenever you need to print it out

6888578
getter	setter
the clr property getter setter is not used for databinding

6888597
equals	gethashcode
c# compiler generates field-by-field equals and gethashcode implementations because obviously you can t provide them yourself

6888601
comparator	icomparer
each .net object implements the icomparer interface and has it s own implementation of the comparator method

6888601
comparator	icomparer
edit sorry i was confusing icomparer comparator with equals each object implements the equals method and as an example string class overrides this method and just checks that both strings contain the same value not reference the same memory address

6888602
equals	gethashcode
since string has well defined gethashcode equals this works fine

6888604
hide	show
now based on where the slider is you will hide show that div

6888606
put	get
i found that only way to get html data to word is to put them into clipboard

6888633
put	get
the main problem is that i have no parameters to put them in the data section in the get method which means i can t access these data

6888657
hide	show
you need to give unique id to each then use this id to show hide only one specific element

6888665
mouseleave	mouseenter
after that the mouseenter and mouseleave events continue to fire just fine but both the element s html and its data have the same test string so it doesn t change

6888665
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseleave div becomes thicker which will cause an almost automatic mouseenter

6888665
mouseleave	mouseenter
but since mouseenter fired the div went to the test string and became thinner so now the mouse is beyond the boundaries of the div but without firing a mouseleave

6888665
mouseover	mouseenter
next time i mouseover the div mouseenter will fire again this is twice in a row

6888665
hide	show
if you want to toggle things i suggest hide and show

6888677
pop-up	dialog
if user fist time click on this button it is need to pop-up application allow dialog of facebook or facebook login page without redirection to facebook

6888769
sorting	filtering
sorting on a simple name string property fails unless i also have a filterby and even then it only works if i type in at least one letter into the filtering box

6888797
mouseleave	mouseenter
when you leave the element by moving out by the bottom border it grows and causes a mouseenter event which again changes the size so that the mouse is outside but without causing a mouseleave event leaving the element looking like the mouse is still hovering it

6888810
hide	show
it works with the hide before the click but i don t know if it works without calling the show method

6888810
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
never tried this on opera i tested on ie firefox safari google-chrome and it works

free	malloc
while ugly from a formal standpoint using int -to- casts with the thread argument or return value to pass small integer data is usually the lesser of two evils the other choice being malloc sizeof int in one thread and free in the other which not only fundamentally adds significant costs but also can be pathologically bad on some allocators tuned only for the case where the allocating thread and freeing thread are the same

i m just working on the fifo queue the simple one just what s pushed first pops at first with the variable data size but i m not sure with the way i m designing it

6896666
queue	fifo
is this the efficient way how to make fifo queue for data types like strings streams records with size from several bytes to about 1mb in case of stream

6896784
mouseup	mousedown
maybe a mousedown event will work instead of click as this will register on the mousedown rather than on the mouseup event that click will trigger on

6896813
post	get
at least when i ve attempted that you get an error-- it really doesn t make sense to have a post from one static page to the other right

firebug and google-chrome safari opera debuggers show no errors of any kind

6897066

no explicit documentation on ripper exists as ripper is just an interface to mri s yacc bison parser

6897076
invokelater	invokeandwait
you have to look at concurrency in swing result is that all output from background task s must be wrapped into invokelater and if is there problem with perfomancie then into invokeandwait

i wrote follow-up questions as comments but did not get any responses so i thought i d try to put it up as a question and hopefully some expert will see it

6897350
int	double	multiplying	modulo
you need to do the multiplying using double or floats and the final modulo on an int value so it will be like this in c# code

6897370
int	double
try int math.ceiling double x y

6897479
allocator	stl
looks like the feature of stateful allocator in stl containers is widely supported already

6897479
allocator	stl
so most stl implementations support statefull allocator which means that they do not create additional instances of the allocator type under the hood but store the client-supplied allocator instance and all allocator deallocations are done via that

6897479
allocator	stl
update vs2008 s stl requires the allocator to have the templated copy constructor which imo makes the most important use of custom allocator impossible simple segregated storage

6897479
allocator	stl
for whoever is not satisfied with the current state of stateful allocator in stl i recommend to consider boost.intrusive and boost.container

6897500

put	get
put simply if you require users to register on an external site in order to use your app it is very unlikely to get approved for the app store

6897598

6897929
post	get
please post the code to get a clearer idea

6897932
width	height

6898232
qdatastream	qbytearray
assuming your encryption create binary data from text data and is not just text only you probably want to use a qdatastream for writing and reading the encrypted data it handles writing chunks of bytes qbytearray correctly without translation

6898300
superclass	subclassing
so effectively by declaring a constructor in the superclass that is not accessible there is no other constructor that your subclassing could call and thus java prevents compilation

6898312
maven	pom.xml
so i make some research on linked library with maven and i find this command line on a pom.xml

6898312
maven	pom.xml
but i don t know where i can write this lines into my pom.xml because i want maven add this lines to java command line before i run the main class of my program .

6898835
onresume	onpause
these broadcastreceivers should be registered in the activity s onresume and unregistered in the activity s onpause

6898844
mantis	bugzilla
i ve not used bugzilla to integrate with svn but have used mantis almost the same but a bit more colourful

6898844
redmine	trac
alternatively you could use a more featured bugtracker like those found in trac or redmine

6898857
udp	tcp
for the client tcp or sender udp calling bind is optional

6898871
ubuntu	linux
inside linux running ubuntu 11.04 server things are set up with lvm

6898926
jar	war
both wars have a maven dependeny with scope provided to the common jar not included as jar within the war s lib

6898942
jms	jta
i suspect there are more requirements to supplement the jms spec in one or more of the ejb jca or jta specifications or j2ee for that matter i haven t checked

6899004
awt	swing
what are the principle differences between using an awt frame and a swing jframe when implementing your own rendering and not using standard java gui components

6899004
awt	swing
the typical talking points on swing vs awt don t seem to apply because we re only using frames

6899004
awt	swing
we are not rendering any swing or awt components other than the frame or jframe or an enclosed jpanel component etc if it is best

6899025
cout	cin
is it possible to decouple cin and cout so that what i type into the console doesn t appear directly in it again

6899032

6899055
speex	ogg
i know jspeex but - as far as i can see - this library only handles ogg speex and pcm

6899055
speex	ogg
but i already have a speex stream and want to wrap this in an ogg container

6899061
min	max
this makes the dialog unresizable and removes the min and max button and with your above code you then should get the min button back

6899068
int	chars
int getch void reads a chars directly from the console without

6899088

equals	gethashcode
you should use equals to compare objects not gethashcode in case when gethashcode return the same value - implementation of equals should consider another object equality checks

6899163
pop-up	dialog
however i noticed that when cucumber presses sign up button to submit it never really tests for the other pop-up dialog

6899188
post	get
edit this assumes that you re exposing a web service and get rather than post or soap

6899207
put	get
how do i get make to put the binaries for my main.c in the binaries dir

6899216
cout	cin
calling cin.tie null decouples std cin and std cout

6899216
cout	cin
and at the lowest level at least under windows and unix std cin and std cout are both connected to the same device at the system level and it is that device dev tty under unix which does the echoing

6899278
primefaces	richfaces
you need to look for a 3rd party jsf component library like richfaces which has a component or primefaces which has a component etcetera

6899310
for-loop	arrays
you set the size of the vot arrays to sirid.lengh by id but the arrays start index value from 0 to size size value not included see the for-loop

6899326
superclass	subclassing
basically if i create an object with superclass sc new subclassing then i call a method on sc i want the method to be able to call method subclassing instead of method superclass

6899326
superclass	subclassing
i know that generally with oo it s better to stick the functionality back to the superclass subclassing themselves but for my specific use cases i have a bunch of subclassing that are immutable model classes which should be passed to different kinds of execution engines think different example classes

6899335
getter	setter
both getter and setter for all class members are defined properly

6899389
serializable	deserialization
my question is how could i override the serializable deserialization to swap out in the call with a non recursive mock token swapping the recursive call back in when reloading the deserialized tree

6899406
width	height
n height width of image

6899406
width	height
take your image that is a dimensional array of height n and width m and arrange it into a row-wise vector of length n m

6899407
google-chrome	firefox
in my iframe when i post data in google-chrome or firefox it works well but ie it seems that charset is not utf8

6899420
superclass	subclassing
shouldn t you define act in superclass and subclassing

6899477
hide	show
so in your case you would need to render the contents of the file into the page the browser is displaying maybe in a hidden div and then the print style-sheet would hide the content displayed in the browser and show the file contents

6899489
cassini	iis
i have recently changed from using the cassini development server to iis 7.5 express and have found that on some pages my javascript is throwing object doesn t support this property or method exceptions

put	get
i am struggling to work out where to put protoinclude attributes to get this to serialize all the items in the myspecialcollectionlist

6899601

make two public parameters for both width bwidth and height bheight and access it

6899676
intranet	workgroup
if you re in a workgroup scenario where users have login details on their own box and login details on the intranet server in which case moving to ad would be better all round - no need to keep the passwords in sync or deactivate user accounts in multiple places when people leave then mixing integrated authentication with basic authentication would do the same thing - however if you re going to use basic authentication then you will need to add an ssl certificate to the site to stop usernames and passswords being sniffed - basic authentication sends them in plain text

6899715
screens	tablet
as to the second yes but they won t be optimized for the tablet so your users might not like tiny images if you have not provided for higher resolution screens

6899718
width	font-size
if you want to change the width of the h4 instead of the font-size then just do this

6899738
