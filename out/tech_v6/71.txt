this works perfect for 2 items on the page but for one it show the overlay but does not hide it

it still seems to me that if you stack some nsview s vertically inside a superview and set up the constraints such that the top subview is pinned to the top of the superview and going down the stack of subviews you pin each one s top to the bottom edge of the one above and then finally you pin the bottom edge of the last subview to the bottom edge of the superview and you then programmatically resize one or more of the subviews it should be able to pull up or push down on the bottom of the superview to keep it hugging its subviews

10504650
hide	show
i would suggest you use jquery to show hide the elements

10504681
superclass	subclassing
would i be right in saying that all objects like the one being reference by s are subclassing of object in java and as such using the reference s you will be able to call the methods known by the superclass object like clone and the methods known by string like length

scrypt	pbkdf2
the minute your ssns become private and confidential they are not in every country so forgive my stupid question in the comments the same best practices that are also used for password storage should also be applicable to your particular case a slow adaptive hashing algorithm that compensates for the lack of initial entropy such as bcrypt scrypt and pbkdf2 which was already recommended by marcus adams

width	height
you have to set the padding property to 0 because the width and height you provide are too small and therefore are messing with the center value you provide for iconalign

10512202

one way to see it is to increase to width and height to say 100x50 then you will get a centered icon without touching the padding property..

thus the fadein and fadeout events fire as soon as the dom element is added to the dom not when the image is done loading

10512637
fadein	fadeout
in other words the fadein or fadeout actions occur while the image is still being downloaded

10512637
fadein	fadeout
with the image being cached by the browser the latency is greatly reduced and the fadein fadeout effects appear as they should

10515000
min	max
so when i have a test where i test that the value fall between the min and max value

free	malloc
a common approach is to over-ride malloc free with a macro

10515426
free	malloc
to track how much memory is being free in free one option is to allocate an extra field on every malloc call to store the size allocated which you can then check when you free

10515426
free	malloc
or you could just dump the malloc free pointers to file and write a script to post-process and line them up

versioning	upgrade
caused by android.database.sqlite.sqliteexception can t upgrade read-only database from versioning 0 to 1

10515756
free	malloc
and the other solution that would be feasible is the one mentioned by happydave and the one i would not recommend is of redefing the malloc and free functions so that when you call malloc free it records the parameters that you are interested in

10515777
button	checkbox
note save_settings is a button on the tab there is a checkbox if checked then notifications are allowed else diabled

if you hold your mouse onto the path of the animated element you can observe that the events are fired only in firefox not in ie google-chrome or safari when the target element passes under your mouse pointer

10515856

i m not sure i 100 grasp your problem but from the first few lines of your description instead of implements an interface you could define an abstract class and have your classes extends it

10515870
maven	pom.xml
i am looking for solution how to reduce number of libraries can i exclude logging libraries in maven s pom.xml file and configure slf4j to intercept logging messages

10515890

10516245
zoo	xts
you never could subtract xts zoo objects with non-overlapping indices

10516245
zoo	xts
i can replicate the second issue but i m not sure this should be a high priority to fix because it doesn t fit the zoo xts idiom and would result in a completely empty xts object

10516280
svg	vml
my initial thought was to use a combination of foreignobject for svg and direct html with vml for ie

10516280

mousemove	mouseleave	mousemove	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter
a way round it might be to abandon mouseleave mouseenter and bind a mousemove event to the document

10516391
mouseleave	mouseenter
that might be enough though you could extend that to then trigger mouseleave mouseenter events yourself directed at the animating element

10516407

10516883
int	double
as i understand when you cast between 2 of these types with an arithmetic operation in java for example double + int the result will be as the bigger type meaning in this example the result will be double

10516883
int	double
what will int + float and long + double give

10516883
int	double
since int and float are 4 bytes each and long and double are 8 bytes

10516939
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
yes nit is right this is the way to customize the uinavigationcontroller but if you don t want to do it for every uiviewcontroller you have you can create a uiviewcontrollerbase class which is a subclass of uiviewcontroller and in viewdidload method set all your buttons the way nit has described and then make every uiviewcontroller you have to be a subclass of your uiviewcontrollerbase class

10516966

10517014
getter	setter
these are just simple data structures with a bunch of getter and setter and no behavior

10517014
getter	setter
getter and setter are too dumb to be tested unless they encapsulate some kind of conditional logic which is rarely the case with dto s

10517058
width	height
all of these could potentially affect the overall width and height and browsers may have different default values

10517066
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
keep a way to force installation of an old versioning in parallel of the current one so do not upgrade

10517066

another idea could be to convert the result type of the method from ienumerable to ienumerator

10517245
reportlab	xhtml2pdf
if you cannot achieve the results you need with xhtml2pdf i suggest you use reportlab directly

10517245
reportlab	xhtml2pdf
this isn t to say that xhtml2pdf is bad just that it s going to take time for it to be as good as rendering in a browser and if pdf output for its own sake is what you really are interested in i think using reportlab directly is a better choice

10517253

upon further investigation it seems that the ipad looks at the rotation information from exif data on the image and determining it should be displayed in landscape instead of portrait which is what it really needs to be

10517363
getter	setter
this can be used when a property s getter and setter contain extra actions that you don t want to occur when nhibernate is populating or reading the object

10517363
accessor	properties
this can be used when a properties only exposes a get accessor because the consumers of your api can t change the value directly

10517378
keydown	keyup
one disadvantage is that keydown is a step behind keyup when you re doing the value collecting i m doing but in my setting this is only a minor issue

10517378
keydown	keyup
the difference in behavior appears odd to me when you press four keys at a time the keyup displays the same caret position for all of them while keydown is showing four separate caret positions

10517385
put	get
notable is that i couldn t get reflection working which would normally be the early bound way to do late binding best thing to do is put this code in a separate source code file so you can compile that with option strict off in effect

10517436
post	get
i just can t get my head around how to create those 2 buttons to store the post data and then have the final submit button use the previous post data and then other form data to create a new combined post data to store in the database

i have not tried it but if you are using http transport you might be able to use some standard http proxy load balancer like nginx or lighttpd

10517579

if you want to use empty td-s instead of spacers you should provide width and height as well like this

so be sure and check that you aren t accidentally submission the form twice by calling a javascript submit on top of a normal html

udp	tcp
udp is a much more lightweight version of tcp ip

10518261
udp	tcp
thus you normal tcp ip connection will not be able to work on the udp server

10518261
udp	tcp
i would suggest that you convert the quote of the moment server from udp to tcp ip server as this will give you some practise in creating a tcp ip server without getting into too much detail

10518269
for-loop	loops
both use a for-loop to loops through all the characters a mod operation on a non-integer number and a bitwise xor operation

10518272
min	max
if the start and end times are entered by the user you should first convert the string values into timespan objects then you could use a more flexible method which takes date min time and max time as parameters

10522282
width	height
the function i was looking to override is onmeasure int widthspec int heightspec which is called by the parent with suggestions for width and height see view.measurespec

10522282
width	height
then when onmeasure gets called i can compute the available aspect ratio and set the width and height of my view as desired

10522282
width	height
the problem with the relativelayout is that it would not negotiate the width height in a way that allowed me to fix the aspect ratio

10522282
width	height
onmeasure gets called multiple times during measuring and the way relativelayout works is that it first asks the custom view for it s width without telling it the available height and then later comes back and asks for the height while the width is locked to what you specified in the first pass measurespec.exactly

10522282
width	height
this makes it impossible to generate a view of a certain ratio as you must confirm the width before knowing the available height

10522282
width	height
this means i was free to change the width and height during every pass of onmeasure and so i could end up calculating my aspect ratio as desired given the available area

10522297

for-loop	loops
the is because vc++ 6 did the scoping of for variables wrong and a variable declared in the initialisation part of a for-loop could be used outside loops

10522396

getter	setter
finally you should avoid writing your own getter setter in ruby unless you need to hook in some custom code to the getting setting processes -- use the class-level attr_reader attr_writer attr_accessor macros to create them for you

the interrupt vector table starts at 0x0000 0x0000 so you d want to get the 4 bytes at 0x0000 9 4 0x0000 0x0024 and store them somewhere so you can put things back to normal when your software exits and put the address offset then segment of your own keyboard irq handler there instead

replacing unsigned char y 2 with unsigned short y makes no individual difference but if i make an array of these structs and put that in another struct then i ve noticed that the size of the container struct tends to be higher for the unsigned short version so since i intend to make a large array i went with unsigned char 2 to save space overhead

for-loop	arrays
i have tried using a for-loop to index into the 3d arrays and access each of the particle images individually for comparison with the single target but matlab does not parallelize this type of operation on the gpu it runs nearly 1000 times slower than equivalent code using the memory inefficient target arrays

unfortunately afaik that is not possible with pbs torque - the stdout stderr streams are locally spooled on the execution host and then transferred to the submit host after the job has finished

10539215
width	height
then you can set min-height min-width to allow the box to span as large as the content or by you can use the height width settings to only allow a certain size then the overflow auto to allow for scroll bars

pull	push
so pull and push in that branch will pull and pull from to the remote master branch

10539491
decoder	encoder
the decoder runs an exact duplicate of the encoder necessarily delayed with respect to the original including its encoding interval model

10539491
decoder	encoder
the decoder also keeps track of the known output interval of the encoder up to the point at which it has read the compressed datastream

10539491
decoder	encoder
since the encoding intervals are all discretized this unit output interval is guaranteed to fit into some encoding interval so the decoder can never fall too far behind the encoder

10539491
decoder	encoder
however the end of a compressed stream may require a flush of the decoder state -- either by some auxiliary signal like a file length or by the encoder sending enough extra bits to ensure that the decoder finds its termination symbol

free	malloc
when a block is returned by malloc an internal data structure is created so that when that exact block is passed to free it will be recognized and linked into a free list

10540991
free	malloc
and how do malloc and free keep track on the adresses

10540991
free	malloc
well except for the cases where the neighboring addresses were actually needed. using larger blocks will also result in less internal fragmentation which may actually use less memory overall in the steady-state where malloc and free calls are balanced in a long-running process

10540994
free	malloc
after you malloc a memory block it has to be held in order to know how much to free when free is called and a pointer to the next block has to be kept in order to find them all and to chain them together

10541033
width	height
you should take into account that after layouting some field the available width and height left for layouting gets smaller in your case because you are layouting your fields horizontally mostly the width matter

10541033
width	height
another thing is that you want to call the setextent method with the width and height you actually used for layouting your fields and not the maximum width and height received in sublayout unless you are doing it intentionally because of some specific ui layout logic

10541043
width	height
then in css give it position fixed and display none and z-index 9999 along with the width and height you desire

you should be able to simply cast v to a linearlayout then access its children just like you did with its parent

10556616

that spring puts the objects specified by sessionattributes into the session only for the duration between the first get request and the post request that comes after it

however jstree also depends on mouseenter and mouseleave for drop target checking and i don t have an event for those

getter	setter
i have a question below that asks about wrapper methods and relates them to getter setter methods

10563975
int	chars
to be a bit more specific the weird chars are most likely the members of type int and float of the structure you re outputting - the string 12345 and the int with value 12345 do not have the same binary representation and the fscanf fp d s d c f ... expects the former for example the int 12345 is represented as the textual string 12345 while adddata outputs the binary int directly with no conversion taking place

getter	setter
using a getter setter in the internal code of a class instead of accessing the instance variable directly is it good or bad practice

10566222
getter	setter
at least for setter one could add additional code validating the value but for the getter it s just overhead

10566222

how intelligent is the java compiler if my getter setter just set get the value directly will java optimize my code and replace the getter setter by direct access to the instance variables so there s no method calling overhead

10566249
getter	setter
there is no need to do that inside a class unless want to perform additional operations in those getter setter

if you want the final frame to have the size of your original frame in this example with a width of 200 and a height of 250 then you will have to scale the resulting frame

10573394
width	height
of course you could put your uiimageview inside another uiview which will have a non-rotated frame with a width of 200 and a height of 250 but that would just be superficial since it won t really change the fact that a rotated rectangle has a different width and height than the original

so if you re creating lots of temporary objects in each iteration of a for-loop in your code the default autorelease pool won t be drained until after your entire loops has run meaning all the temporary objects you create can add up to a high temporary memory usage sometimes called the high water mark

10574586
x86	64bit
x86 64bit

10574631
int	double
as you see you can not restrict where t to double or int32 that s why you probably have struct on that place int and double are not struct

10574631
int	double
you should either typecheck t and throw an exception if it s either double nor int like in answer by ie

10574631
int	double
box double or int result into it and implement implicit conversion into double or int

10575135
int	chars
example name field will be storing chars string literal and hance can t be int type and has to be string type which in sql is chars or varchar or nvarchar

10575216
lisp	scheme
i am more used to scheme but here s a solution that works in lisp

10575233
int	boolean
generally it s a good idea to avoid treating boolean values to int to make the code more readable especially for developers who use multiple languages

10575246
addition	multiplication	addition	modulo	multiplication	modulo
much easier to define addition or multiplication modulo 2 32 or 2 64 and not worry about it

i can setter and getter functions rename to c# reflection model

int	chars
function chars fgets chars s int count file stream

10575525
getchar	getline
use getchar or getline instead

10575576
free	malloc
on the other hand the heap usually has a huge size say as much space as is free on the system and so malloc ing a large object won t cause an out-of-memory error

10575619
base-class	subclassing
in a manner of speaking yes but a proper visitor implementation would require that your base-class implementation have an if chain that checks what subclassing of the base class this is an instance of since as others have pointed out the purpose of the visitor pattern is to achieve something like multiple dispatch which requires distinguishing the runtime type of an object in some way

10575673
pull	push
then you can push to pull from each other s repositories

10575753

10576062
getter	setter
basically the way i implemented the iterator and getter setter is probably the source of the problem

apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
in theory you could build a pure-node web server that emulated the functionality of apache lighttpd nginx but i wouldn t recommend it

10576127
apache	nginx
nginx is very fast much lighter than apache

10576158
daemons	systemd
the one suggestion i would make if using php on same systemd is that you ensure you are using mod_wsgi daemons mode for running the python web application and even one daemons process per python web application

10576186
gunicorn	uwsgi
there is no specific reason why a python web application would consume more memory under apache mod_wsgi than under a different wsgi server such as uwsgi or gunicorn

cout	cin
for more substantial input output where you d naturally want to use cout or cin a better option is to use subprocess.popen

10576230
stdout	stderr
standard output the result of cout in c++ is then passed into the stdout list and standard error is passed into stderr

10576254

jython	pypy
also note that none being less than everything and the empty tuple being higher than everything wasn t ever guaranteed in py2 and eg jython and pypy are perfectly entitled to use a different ordering if they feel like it

10576607
post	get
and this post has been helpful in helping me understand how to get the intersection of two lists

10576662
width	height
in order to do this my guess is that the inner div needs to ignored from the outer one s size computations for width only not for height and that s what i m not sure how to do

freebsd	linux	libevent	epoll
maybe you can take a look at epoll linux kqueue freebsd libev and libevent to get some idea

10576704
int	chars
amazingly when i write the same code with int in place of chars it works just fine

10576851
hash	md5
my idea is there is a server which can get the md5 hash of each file in the ftp server and send that hash list and file list to its clients

10576856
accessor	properties
i understand the most proper way to do this is to create a properties in form3.cs with get and set accessor

10577161
sorting	filtering
dataproxy and loader are used mostly to facilitate a relying on the server for filtering paging sorting or b reuse between parts of the application for getting access to the same pieces of data

10577161
accessor	properties
the propertyaccess interface allows valueprovider and other instances to be generated by just the properties name that the values will be get set from using bean accessor

10577161
sorting	filtering
the loader is responsible for being told what settings paging filtering and or sorting to use when loading then triggering the load - different subclasses have different responsibilities accept different load config types and return different results

inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
other than using implementation inherited using superclass abstract method which is overridden in the subclassing can make the classes tightly coupled

10577246
superclass	subclassing
listing subclass-specific constants in a base class is not that great an idea because ideally a superclass should not know about its subclassing

10577254
rspec	capybara
i already have a background in unit testing and acceptance testing rspec and capybara on rails 3 and now i m starting this new project with javaee and i m looking for a quick start with both of this technologies

10577510
folder	directory
you will have to make sure that the system user has full access to the tomcat folder so that when tomcat runs it can freely create folder and files within its own directory

10577579
free	malloc
if you allocate memory on heap using malloc you can free the memory any time you want even before the end of your function s execution

10577584
superclass	subclassing
indeed it calls the superclass for fun but the superclass calls print and as print is overridden the overriding version in the subclassing gets called

10577604
put	get
actually i m probably missing quite a lot because i d like to put this a #total_distance method in the swim model swim.rb but when i try to do that i can t get the controller to recognize the method and i read elsewhere that a view should not try to access a method defined in a model due to caching issues

10577622
margin	height
i found a couple of solutions here but if i change the height of the top row the bottom row s style margin need to be changed along with it

parent-child	one-to-many
i have one-to-many parent-child entity book - borrow

10578084
memcpy	memset
i mostly use memset or memcpy to copy the data from to buffer

10578084
memcpy	memset
so that means c++ compiler will insert the internals in to the structure object and memset or memcpy will not work as in c

10578089
rss	feed
however if you re submitting to the app store apple will require that you re really implementing a voip-like app and not just downloading new rss feed in the background or some such.

10578114
memcpy	memset
as long as your structures don t use any c++ constructs virtualism etc memcpy and memset will work on them even in c++

10578119
int	chars
int value chars escape sequences will not be supported it is an unreliable method that does not scale well across multiple platforms and unnecessarily increases the complexity of parsing by proxy of validation

10578176
hash	md5
md5 hash to avoid duplicating files on save

10578203
folder	directory
in php it s hard to do that since the source is open to all but you could do something similar to modify the index to grab the server s name or ip and check for it in your database if you have allowed it the process returns ok and every thing works fine else you send a self destructive command to the index and the index will delete all of the files and folder starting from its directory you can find a command here you can delete the maxdepth argument to recursively delete all the files and folder and keep in mind there is no perfect solution for your problem since the other party could change the index source code easily

10578306
getter	setter
i am looking at options to not having to write getter and setter in my code

10578306
getter	setter
currently i am using __call to automatically map getter and setter to my properties however i have been informed that that is very slow

10578306
getter	setter
what options do i have because writing getter and setter to return properties only is not a very good use of our developer time and maintaining them is more of a headache

10578313
gridview	repeater
i have read many articles regarding difference between gridview and repeater

10578313
gridview	repeater
i come to know that gridview pattern is fixed in and where as repeater can provide customized html mark up

10578332

see also how to generate getter and setter in eclipse php

10578415
getter	setter
i couldn t find any good articles that talk about how to maintain getter and setter dynamically so i thought of another way which may or may not work for you

10578443
gridview	repeater
in simple words we can say performance of repeater is far better than gridview

10578443
gridview	repeater
if you need basic rendering for read only items then its better to use repeater and if you need events pagination and editable controls then you should go for gridview

10578443
gridview	repeater
so it depends upon you requirements either you need repeater or gridview

10578487
put	get
i know that it would be wise to put the flash message inside a controller as opposed to the methods that get executed in the models but..

10578538
addition	multiplication
as multiplication of ints has more overhead than simple addition

10578554
dictionary	map
in clojure you can update a map dictionary with assoc-in and create key path automatically if it don t exist

10578562
superclass	subclassing
i m trying to use an nsinvocation to invoke a superclass method from the subclassing

10578562
super	self
this seems a bit odd to me as i had always assumed that super followed pretty much the same rules as self it could be treated as a direct reference to the object in question and assigned to variables used as a return value etc.

10578562
superclass	subclassing
anyhow is there any simple way to get my nsinvocation to target the superclass implementation i cannot use self as the target because the subclassing overrides the superclass methods or do i need to look for some other approach

10578603
super	self
super and self are the same object so just use

10578603
super	self
the difference between them is that you can use super as a receiver of a message to self as a way to ensure that it invokes the superclass implementation

10578613
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tested it with the common browsers like google-chrome firefox and safari

10578680
post	get
if it is on a page template for instance you will not get any post because when pass query_string into your query you are using the global wp_query object and it will only query for page post_types

webkit google-chrome safari does not support transitions on pseudo elements

10578758
post	get
what i want is to post this url from android to get that json data into androids view

10578959
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
and set width for wrapper and also its not good practice to give margin in minus values and also you had set the width and height for each divs thats why its looks like that in ie

10578965
getter	setter
create getter setter

10578987

button	checkbox
in internet explorer up to at least ie8 clicking a radio button or checkbox to change its value does not actually trigger the onchange event until the the input loses focus

10579151
onclick	onchange
now your onchange event should be triggered but as you can see it is redundant code thus you are better off just using the onclick event handler

10579161
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
in other words ob_flush tells php to give apache or nginx lighttpd whatever the output and then for php to forget about it

put	get
i ve bound 2 views to listen for add events on the collection but only one seems to get notified of the event and when this happens no put request is sent to my server

10579397
children	parent
then their children should hav the parentid column value as thier parent id number... either 1 or 2 in this case

10579397
children	parent
if the parent id is proper then u can update the personid of children properly

10579421

clang	llvm
clang targets llvm which includes hooks to support gc that have been used and proven in other projects

10579842
clang	llvm
if you re primarily interested in a proof of concept to play with my guess would be that somebody will put together a package of clang llvm gc within 3-5 years

10579887
cpython	ironpython
for example a popular library like numpy will only work on cpython as it relies on cpython s c api which neither jython or ironpython can provide

implements	extends
simply extends abstracttablemodel and implements the following methods

10579919
groupbox	panel
if you need recursion imagine you have a panel in your groupbox and checkboxes have been added to panel i think your extension method would still be usefull

button	checkbox
edit because of the comment adding a checkbox that disable enables a button

10580067
button	checkbox
if you want a checkbox to disable enable button you need to do some work on your getview in the adapter of your costum listview

10580067
button	checkbox
save the button to be acessible in your checkbox listener mycheckbox.settag button where the button is the button you want to enable disable and you can get him the same way you got the mycheckbox

10580067
button	checkbox
set a setoncheckedchangelistener on your checkbox where you change the visibility of your button depending on the state of the checkbox

10580077
execl	fork
the alternative is to fork each time in the loop and have the child do execl while the parent would continue the loop

superclass	subclassing
up to now i thought this was the standard way of making a class subclassing that was basically superclass plus extras

width	height
width 2048 height 1588

10580195
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in my desktop browsers google-chrome safari firefox the digital goods flow works without problems

10580195
width	height
however in mobile safari on my ipad 2 popup windows are always opened as new tabs even if a property string containing width height etc

10580197
post	get
the best way to handle that is to use the post redirect get pattern

10580211
post	get
use post redirect get design pattern

10580222
inherited	properties
if you have changed the assembly root namespace ensure that you edit the reference in the inherited properties of the the asmx file itself

10580230
post	get
the main thing to do is to get links to your site Ã¢ write interesting blog post contact customers etc so they link to you

10580236
mouse	keyboard
note in xul you usually want the command and not the click event - unless you are really interested in mouse clicks only and want to ignore the button being triggered by keyboard or other means

10580281
width	height
as you can see i have a group of float divs with the same width but with different height

10580287

you can fadeout the image then fadein in the callback after swapping the src

10580343
src	attr
note that there s no need to go through attr for src

10580418
memcpy	memset
i mostly use memset or memcpy to copy the data from to buffer

10580418
memcpy	memset
you should definitely prefer to move to use properly default copy constructed objects and ditch the memset memcpy operations

10580418
memcpy	memset
while memset and memcpy can work in limited cases basically when the class struct and all its bases contains only stuff that would have worked in c a pointer to the virtual dispatch table will not be properly set by memset but may work after a memcpy - all implementation-defined and doesn t try to maintain any invariants

10580418
memcpy	memset
you do not have to worry about this in the context of ab using memcpy and memset

10580418
free	memcpy
you still have to worry about the c issues memcpy creating multiple objects using the same resources file descriptors pointers to heap locks etc. where both objects assume they have exclusive control of that resource and attempt to delete free release it later

10580482
superclass	subclassing
2 if you want to call _init on subclassing which will actually execute the superclass _init method then do not define define it on the subclassing class

10580482
superclass	subclassing
when you try to access the _init method on subclassing instance object of subclassing js engine tries to look for it on the current obj if the method is not found it is searched in subclassing proto type chain superclass

superclass	subclassing
if you want to call superclass method inside a subclassing method then use

10580542
getter	setter
should i make protected getter setter for flag and use setter in the derived classes to init it

10580542
getter	setter
if other classes call the flag e.g if baseclass.flag.equals ... should i make public getter setter for it

for the user to move around a decoration they had already placed i had to use manual touch handling to detect the right decoration since they could easily be overlapping and ones that looked round to the user are actually square in terms of uiviews so it was easy for the user to accidentally drag the corner of one when they intended to drag a different one

10585945
hide	show
i know is not exactly what you are asking but if we go an step back in your question i think what you really want is to toggle between two buttons so i think is very much maintainable understandable intuitive and a lot of more things to just having two well formed buttons and show hide then alternatively

rspec and minitest are other frameworks with other strengths but lack this business readability factor in that they are mostly code and not nearly as readable to a non-technical person

10586170
rspec	minitest
so chances are you are going to want to use rspec or minitest for your unit testing or the default test unit and cucumber for integration testing if you have an interested product owner or a need for a common language for test scenarios

10586170
rspec	minitest
if you do not you can write your integration tests as rspec examples or the minitest equivalent without losing much

10586404
nstimer	nsrunloop
the reason for this is that we have complete control over the thread while using a nsthread but if using a nstimer than we are executing inside a nsrunloop which may freeze the ui if any heavy lifting is done inside

10586404
nstimer	nsrunloop
you are also guaranteed that a nsthread that is detached is executed immediately with a nstimer which is based on nsrunloop cannot as it may or may not be able to execute immediately

10586410
children	parent
was to do as the answer below suggested and then in the parent window s wm_paint message send a wm_paint to each child and have the children paint into the parent s doublebuffer not painting anything into itself and then have the parent bitblt it s buffer that has been drawn into by itself and then by each of its children going from the bottom to the top of the z-order into it s hdc

i expect two subsequent calls to the save method using the same tiff file to produce the same png file

10586541
uilabel	nsstring

what would a good cross-platform c++ parser for use on a spaces and tab delimiter txt file

10586852
post	get
a redirect response from your server for whatever request you made regardless of it being post or get request always results in your client making a get request unless you somehow enable it to not automatically follow redirects--sometimes i do this with curl but i don t know any widely used browsers with this functionality available easily to the user

10586852
post	get
if you redirect outside of .htaccess say in a php file to construct redirect response your only option is to convert the post parameters into a string of get parameters and add it to the end of the url you send back to the client with your redirect response

10586852
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i m fairly confident there is not a way to do automatic post parameter appending to redirect in the .htaccess or in the httpd.conf files whether you use the redirect directive or the rewrite directive via the mod_rewrite module

10586879
x86	64bit
i have installed my 32bit msi target x86 on 64bit machine every things seems to work fine except some com dlls which fails to load and gets an attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format

put	get
the code works fine if the rows sub is passed integers hardcoded but when i put a variable i get the select method of range class failed error

10587014

getter	setter
3 should have the getter and setter too

post	get
use post instead of get and everything will be fine

10587372
public	protected
i am not aware of any rule that says any particular attribute should be private in a class java offers other modifiers like protected and public and no modifier which implies package accessibility

10587372
getter	setter
about the getter and setter part of the question i believe these are just a way to enforce encapsulation

10587372
getter	setter
their paper demonstrates very compelling reasons on why something like getter and setter methods could be a good idea to avoid class extension fragility

10587395
width	height
the width isn t 960 height is

10587432
children	parent
without doing anything to the parent div if i invoke the following code on any of the children in the parent div

10587432
children	parent
the parent div will conform to the new height based on all the heights of its children

10587432
children	parent
and then change the height of any of the children in the same fashion as described above the parent s height does not conform to the new height based on all the heights of its children

10587432
children	parent
is there a way to ensure the parent div will conform to the heights of all its children even if i set the parent s height using the code above

10587451
persistent	transient
the simplest solution is to add a persistent section attribute or convert your existing transient attribute

the build artifact of a oozie project is a jar file containing all mapreduce jars it uses and their dependencies we use maven s assembly plugin to compress it this is the artifact we later deploy to hdfs after decompressing

10587741
hdfs	oozie
deployment to hdfs is on-demand from archiva getting the artifact of the oozie project build extracting it and putting it to hdfs

10587754
filesystems	ntfs
this article gives some info on how to extend your filesystems to allow for diacritic characters for ntfs anyway

10587763
apache	nginx
since your rails instances can be run in different processes when using nginx or apache no shared memory like in threads i guess the only solution is using file locks

10587842
mouseleave	mouseenter
i want a z-index of 1 to be set on all highlighted edges before the transition begins on mouseenter and i want the z-index of 1 to be removed after the transition completes on mouseleave

folder	directory
i have three directory and each of these directory contains 8 subdirectories and each of those subdirectories contains 2 folder that i want to delete

10587864

hash	salt
here s the bit that generates the password salt and hash when the account is created

how can i convert the get method to post

10588032
moq	justmock
when i need to test i can use a mocking tool moq justmock rhinomocks etc to create a fake iconfig that returns a known value without hitting the actual .config file or you can do it without a mocking framework by making your own mocks and store them in your test project

10588064

10588162
free	malloc
it s a bad programming design concept if you don t explicitly free memory that you have malloc ed and although you eventually can rely on the os to do this for you it may cause memory leaks when you later modify your project not to exit but you forget to free your used memory

10588171
width	height
the .imgclose need a height and a width in order to display correctly.

10588174
cpython	pypy

the two popular implementations are bonjour used by apple systems avahi used by linux

10588250

10588369
vim	emacs
for example both vim and emacs support tags files generated by the ctags command that list all of the function and variable definitions in a project

10588391
post	get
so far all is well however when it comes to displaying the message inbox of all conversations sorted on the latest post it get s tricky to do with one query

10588391
put	get
is there another way i could get rid of the userconversation table and create a unique id to put in the conversationid column

10588398
inherited	subclassing
however if you followed my initial map of your inherited you should have had an epiphany that using subclassing for what you are trying to do is an inappropriate solution for what you are trying to model

10588452
photoshop	paint.net
if the image is of a file type that supports transparency open it up in image editing software paint.net photoshop etc. and delete the white or replace it with empty transparent color

10588594
instances	transient
but i expect you already know that and just want to know why not to just inject a new instances with a transient lifestyle of the dbcontext into anyone who needs it

10588594

d3.js	raphael	d3.js	protovis	raphael	protovis
further if you incorporate a library like protovis or d3.js or raphael charts can sencha display anything the graph canvas element will otherwise display

10588765
multiplying	add	multiplying	multiplication
it shifts all bits over by 2 places resulting in a multiplication by four just as you would add two digits in a base 10 number to multiplying by 100

10588774
ffmpeg	avisynth
solution is to install avisynth and then you can load with ffmpeg any avi file for whom the system has a vfw codec

10588793
express	node.js
however i m still a little bit uncomfortable as this translates to a server-side javascript environment such as node.js and more specifically an api written on express

10588798
inherited	properties
notice that this code also injects the base class in order to gain fine grained control on properties parsing and support for inherited between different dsl files

10588809
sorting	filtering
sorting and filtering functionality with the non-data header rows could be a problem

10588836
put	get
i can go to the web service in a browser put in the same values and i get a seemingly valid xml response

10588872
express	node.js
i m trying to display these images to the browser via node.js using express framework

ubuntu	debian
for ubuntu you really want to work within the .deb apt-based packaging framework the distro already provides the same applies to debian derivatives generally

10589021
google-chrome	firefox
update my anwswer refers to a similar issue that happened in firefox a few months ago and i suggested in hopes that it would work for google-chrome 19 but currently oleg s answer is the correct approach

10589021
google-chrome	firefox
a few updates later of firefox it did stop happening and currently all of my grids are fine in google-chrome 18 so hopefully it will not be an issue when 19 is released

10589038
pull	push
fork the 3rd party repo on github to so i have a place to push fixes and from which i can send pull requests to the 3rd party lib maintainer

try opening this example in google-chrome and firefox

10589059
rss	feed
i was trying to read rss feed from powershell and need to traverse through feed i am wondering what would be the way to do it

10589091
prepare	execute
the function would prepare the query prepare statements and then execute it return the result in an array

10589119
int	double
your code will only handle bytes and int it cannot handle floats and double

10589154
ready	each
as each child actor sends back the data set the corresponding flag in my main actor is set to true and the other two flags are checked to see if were ready to move on

10589177
folder	directory
so i went to git bash and typed npm install socket.io i found the the directory in my user folder c users weka node_modules .

10589229
padding	overlapping
a more custom way to do it would be with two overlapping divs where one is only slightly larger than the other by either size or by using padding

10589240
int	chars
that represent the transition of the nondeterministic automaton each with 2 int and a chars i j and c representing the states where the transition ie the transition goes from state i to state j with the chars c

10589242
ant	maven
in response to comments complaining that maven is rigid and makes it hard to use custom build logic provide fine-grained control over the build process - i would recommend looking into ant plug-in for maven there are actually several but here is one

10589242
ant	maven
basically it allows you to run any ant command as part of the maven build and you can do pretty much anything with ant

10589281
getter	setter
and now i have dynamically built getter setter and attr_accessible custom for each instance of the class or so i think

10589351
free	malloc
i am juggling with two ways of free ing malloc ed memory in a linked list structure

10589373
free	malloc
you can free memory blocks allocated by malloc in whatever order you like

10589380
hash	salt
i am reading about the best way to store password information in database and most of the examples say that we should not store the actual password in database but hash and salt values

10589380
hash	salt
in a web application the code that authenticates user is located on the server side so we send user name and password over the wire and on the server we read the salt value then hash password that we received with salt and compare it with stored hash value in db

10589380
hash	salt
this means that hash class would be exposed on the client and i would need to read hash and salt value from db on the client which kind of allows anyone to create a few lines of code and fetch all user info on client

10589387
public	protected
any public or protected property or method in site.master.cs will be accessible from site.master

10589390
google-chrome	firefox
also when firefox does the post back the whole page does not appear to reload with google-chrome or ie the whole page will flash white and reload

for the moment it work in the last google-chrome and the last last firefox opera

10589406
awt	swing
i have a swing + awt application which uses an external jar library by calling a main method inside it

10589436
width	height
edit if you are looking to fill each grid square with a different color then this function will not work or could at least be used in combination with another function which creates and fills the squares in a similar way to the function above but cutting the width and height off based on the dimensions of the canvas width and height

10589444
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
but i didn t test firefox safari or opera

10589461
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox when you click on something it seems to gain focus but that does not seem to be true for google-chrome in this case

10589514
superclass	subclassing
to resolve this try to store a base class reference whenever you define a new subclassing avoid using this when calling a superclass method

10589530
ssl	https
are you using https with a valid ssl certificate or something similar if not it will probably not work

10589540
post	get
usually a get request has no body so try with a post

10589546
jsf	stripes	struts	stripes
that is why companies usually adopt an existing and well-developed mvc framework like jsf spring mvc stripes struts etc

10589585
sorting	filtering
now i am supposing that you are getting the cursor from the procedure get_data.get_emp_data .. .you need to write a procedure that call the above procedure and do sorting pagination and filtering on the above data returned from the cursor

10589659
folder	directory
this version appears to have installed fine however it appears that the developers never intended for this to be installed outside of a root directory cause installing it outside of root in a sub folder seems to break the styling and scripting to a point seems my bet is they did src href assets blahblah.ext instead of assets blahblah.ext

10589671
folder	directory
and yes socket.io is a folder into the root server directory and my server-side socket is listening on port 3000

10589676
portrait	landscape
if i test my code in portrait mode i can see only icon and if i rotate orientation to landscape still i see only icon

10589676
portrait	landscape
on the other hand if i run with landscape i can see text and icon on portrait and landscape

10589680
springsource	grails
i have installed the latest version of springsource tool suite and have installed the groovy and grails plugins and everything is working fine

10589713
usergroups	administration
when going this route for extra security it would be best to use integrated security for the sql connection and then lock down access to the queries and tables so that only a certain usergroups can run the administration actions and add users and regular users can only execute read and data insert update statements for related tables

10589715
rss	feed
i use wordpress for my blog and would love if the pictures that i post in each blog were added to the rss feed like say the first image

10589736
eruby	erb
templating languages like erb eruby erubis use the ruby programming language to run arbitrary code embedded in a web page and replace the results of that code with the text it produces

10589751
oncreate	ondestroy
to oncreate through to a single final call to ondestroy

10589751

parent views contain and organize the layout of their children

10589751
button	checkbox
android has a number of ready-made views widgets that you can use Ã¢ including button text fields scroll bars menu items checkbox and more

10589780
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
if you can calculate the totals on the server before binding to the repeater or gridview or listview as others suggested

10589784
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu both support many architectures many of which have absolutely no binary compatibility

10589795
boost	stl
i know stl does not have a matrix or quaternion data type but boost does and boost is about as close as you can get to the standard without actually being in the standard

10589798
for-loop	loops
body of this loops consists of some instructions which should be done sequentially and one for-loop

10589810
width	height
visible elements have a width or height that is greater than zero

10589819
rss	feed
the rss feed should have an element that points to an image url

10589821
post	get
i m trying to get my application to post photos to a user s timeline using the user generated picture feature of open graph

10589836
try-catch	exception-handling
the bad connection scenario aside you should use a php mysql library that supports exception-handling like pdo and use try-catch blocks to catch error states you want to log

10589840
pseudo-class	visited
if i need to apply the same property to both states somewhere but i already have it in separate a link and a visited rules write a selector that combines both pseudo-class

10589856
post	get
if you get a specific issue while you are doing this then would be a good time to post another question

10589870
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
in my case i could then dynamically fill the segments of a uisegmentedcontrol or rows of a uitableview using the title image properties of the tabbaritem s of the connected view controllers

10589900
versioning	upgrade
my non-osgi application build is in gradle and i am trying to upgrade from very old versioning of jersey 1.1.4.1 to something much newer 1.12

10589907
submit	submission
when i am submission one form and if i had made some changes on other form i am loosing it as on submit the page is getting refreshed

10589927
gif	png
gnuplot can take a command file that configures a plot and output the plot to a gif png or various other formats

10589940
getter	setter
and the userworkload class just contains simple getter setter

10589951
put	get
when i put in the wrong username password combo it recognizes this but when it is right it will get this error and fail to log in

10589981
width	height
i do that frequently but i found that the only thing that always works especially when tables are involved is giving 100 dimensions for both width and height and adjust the container be it a td or a div in a classical way

10589999
width	height
the background image alone cannot expand the element until it s visible that s why you need to specify width and height

10590012
width	height
so just add a width and height to #myimage

10590015
int	chars
the large string is split into an array split by spaces and for each item in the array it converts it to a hexadecimal number int a 16 means turn string a into an int string a is in base 16 and then returns that ascii chars chr ... represented by that int

10590021
getter	setter
the docs say play has been designed to generate getter setter automatically to ensure compatibility with libraries that expect them to be available at runtime

10590025
int	chars
chr converts this int into chars

10590034
int	boolean
isn t allowed in java is that is an expression of int type and java only allows boolean expressions for if conditions

10590034
int	boolean
one big reason for this is to maintain compatibility with c - in c there is no boolean type so int are perfectly valid if conditions

10590035
int	boolean
int expressions are not automatically promoted to boolean expressions

10590053
versioning	upgrade
the end user who uses dpkg-divert should be aware that things might break after upgrade as a result because the package maintainer hasn t foreseen that these files would be modified by end users and the locally modified versioning might be incompatible with a newly upgrade versioning of a different file

10590056
getter	setter
php frameworks also use these hooks to redirect code execution to proper getter setter methods which really need to be distinct for the reason you have discovered yourself so that read-only properties can be achieved as well

10590058
int	chars
the line for which picks a random int between 0 and 256 and gets the ascii chars for it

10590069
width	height
turns out the body tag didn t have a height as 100 but rather two width settings

10590069
google-chrome	firefox
it renders fine in google-chrome in full colour but only shows the stars and the black body background in firefox

10590069
google-chrome	firefox
putting the doctype on the page actually created the same issue firefox is having with the google-chrome rendering of the page

10590070
int	chars
this is split the string on whitespace read the substrings as chars decoded from int in hex the second argument to int is the base

10590073
gmail	hotmail
no transactional emails are getting to customers with the email address associated with the same domain but are getting to accounts outside of the domain hotmail and gmail etc

10590078
hide	show
i show and hide it constantly with new data

10590078
hide	show
i could show and hide the control 10 times one after the other no problem

10590078
hide	show
but if i hide it and show it again after 2-3 minutes then i get this behavior

10590102
post	get
whenever i try to post to an https endpoint i get a javax.net.ssl.sslexception java.lang.nullpointerexception

10590116
post	put	post	get	put	get
when using match you can instead and you probably should use get post put or whatever verb you plan on using instead of simply saying match

10590155
integer	fractions
you are trying to get the integer part and the fractions part of the float to print your result

10590159
getter	setter
and usual getter and setter

10590166
hide	show
how can i hide the and show it when someone click on my button

10590228
pop-up	dialog
then when i mouse-over the event it pop-up with a qtip jquery plugin to show a pop-up dialog

10590230
width	text-align
and set a width but to center text within an element you would use text-align center

10590238
hide	show
if you want to show hide after every click then

10590290
apache	nginx
if you have some sort of a proxy in front of your tomcat server like apache or nginx i believe it can be configured to translate 404 into a different status code and error page

10590350
google-chrome	firefox
here is a demo i see the problem with firefox 11 and google-chrome 18

10590374
google-chrome	safari
linux x86_64 applewebkit 536.5 khtml like gecko google-chrome 19.0.1084.41 safari 536.5

10590410
firefox	safari
also i don t see this experience in the same way in firefox and safari

10590441
for-loop	arrays
if you really want to swap the contents of the arrays then use memcpy or a for-loop

10590446
rss	feed
i am parsing an rss feed using php and javascript

10590446
rss	feed
first i created a proxy with php to obtain the rss feed

10590446
rss	feed
then get individual data from this rss feed using javascript

10590446
rss	feed
so my question is how to i obtain the elements in the rss feed

10590454
vbscript	vba
if you know vbscript - which is very similar to vba i think this should help a lot

10590491
gradle	ivy
i added an artifactory generic deploy task since i m not using maven ivy or gradle

10590497
puts	gets
i m building a django application that needs to interact with a 3rd party restful api making various gets puts etc to that resource

10590515
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
personally i use the #2 when i am in a uiviewcontroller that is under a uinavigationcontroller

10590522
ddms	adb
you ll need to restart your adb server if you can t find the emulator in the list of running android devices in ddms you can go to the drop list next to the camera icon and reset adb or do it manually from the the command line

10590525
projectile	particle
if it is look in your projectile class for a particle system component or a static mesh component reference similar to the answer phillip posted

10590553
opera	firefox
this works in opera and firefox but doesn t work in ie specifically ie9 as this is the only version i ve tried

10590553
opera	firefox
the code does work in firefox and opera so it s confusing me why ie should be any different

10590560
chown	chmod
as a creative solution i thought that if php executes as its own linux user not as apache i could use normal chown s and chmod s to accomplish this

10590563
button	checkbox
defaultchecked for checkbox and radio button

10590566
width	height
when displaying an image in full size i want the width to be of maximum 800px as well as the height to be of maximum 600

10590578
public	protected
but again seemingly abstract methods cannot be declared static the abstract method method in type nestedclass can only set a visibility modifier one of public or protected

10590603
ienumerable	iqueryable
2 create an ienumerable extension method called dosomething using the same signature as the iqueryable except accepting returning an ienumerable instead of iqueryable

10590603
ienumerable	iqueryable
for some reason the above scenario appears to make a recursive call to the ienumerable extension method instead of the iqueryable

10590603
ienumerable	iqueryable
i understand that iqueryable extends ienumerable

10590607
children	parent
is it possible to rotate parent div only and all its children will also rotate with it

10590615
google-chrome	firefox
what is the min version of each browser ie google-chrome and firefox for less running on client-side

10590624
width	height
the key is to multiply both the width and the height by the same scaling constant

10590636
button	checkbox
just take this code go to extjs api doc for checkbox and replace the example code with the above then push preview and click on the button get counter

10590667
inherited	subclassing
when you make a static method it goes on a single class it doesn t get inherited by or have its implementation deferred to subclassing

10590716
for-loop	loops
in the loops the query object automatically calls .run and returns an iterable but is it hitting the actual database every time or does it cache it meaning that the second for-loop would be a much faster operation

10590719
integer	fractions
2 you can use a float representation of the dates with the integer part being a day offset from a millennium mark and the float being the fractions of the day which is then easily converted to hh mm ss

10590734
superclass	subclassing
i ve used this in the past for an application which needed to know at runtime all the subclassing of a particular superclass

10590743
google-chrome	firefox
as per my comment i experienced the same issue but with firefox failing and google-chrome and ie succeeding

10590752
google-chrome	firefox
according to it s ie6+ although they don t specify which versions of google-chrome and firefox are supported

10590775
implements	extends
implements a class for example with the name globalvariables which extends application

10590775
pull	push
push the variable from your first activity into the glovalvariables and pull it from the second trough getting an instance to the globalvariables

10590803
pop-up	dialog
is there any support for working with pop-up dialog specifically file downloads in c#

10590804
google-chrome	firefox
my code looks like it follows the examples i found on the internet and works in firefox google-chrome but fails in ie9

10590808
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
you can write your own for google-chrome opera and firefox

10590815
client-side	server-side
i don t think this can be done client-side using css - i d use a server-side function that creates the bitmap with the specified color possibly caching the result and then call it from the html

10590852
jgit	egit
jgit egit at the

10590881
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
events that in a were handled at the level of the qgraphicsitem are instead handled by an object inheriting from qgraphicsscene

10590894
folder	directory
the image is in image folder under the rot directory webcontent

10590940
post	get
i m trying to figure out how to get a server to accept a file through http post in one step - without going through all the trouble of creating an html form and clicking the submit button

10590944
jsf	stripes	jsf	wicket	wicket	stripes
so what was wrong with jsf 1.x what made it so iritating when compared to stripes spring mvc or wicket play click etc

10590944
post	get
only post requests were supported which caused performance problems get requests can be effectively cached hard to achieve bookmarkable urls and more

10590944
post	get
get and post requests are equally well supported

10590944
primefaces	richfaces	primefaces	icefaces	richfaces	icefaces
and the last huge jsf 2.x advantage tones of well designed great looking and well performing ready to use components richfaces primefaces icefaces

10590944
jsf	stripes
still jsf might have performance issues as compared to action-based frameworks like stripes which work more closely to http requests without building component model which is using more memory more network bandwidth

10590979
jgit	egit
afaik jgit and egit always use utf-8 path encoding but native git doesn t guarantee that 1

10590988
button	checkbox
my radio button and checkbox share similar convention for using enums but the checkbox uses whereas radio button use

10591043
pop-up	dialog
this basically pop-up a ckeditor dialog window and loads an external url into it

10591056
children	parent
qgraphicsitems can have parent and children and this has several effects similar to parenting amongst qobjects

10591056
children	parent
for example if you move a parent qgraphicsitem its children will move with it and if you delete a parent its children will be deleted

10591056
children	parent
you can access a qgraphicsitem s parent using qgraphicsitem parentitem and children using qgraphicsitem childitems

10591065
accessor	properties
properties accessor gets compiled down to methods in jsil so you might get around by using get_xxx method

10591071
profiling	instrumentation
when i profiling it with allocations using instrumentation the overall bytes goes from 9.3 mb to 22.4 mb which is certainly a spike but i wouldn t think that would cause a crash

10591083
hide	show
but you can actually take advantage of that fact to create a single control and then show hide it when necessary

10591085
put	get
if you needed a submodule to tell those who get your repo where to get the updated source of the library without bloating the size of your repo you could simply put an url and an instruction into a readme file or a script or whatever

10591085
pull	push
...well it could be a special variant of the pull command say import and of the push command say export that would additionaly translate the paths accordingly

10591091
bids	ssis
basically in 2005 i could create ssis package enable configurations in bids for testing and once tested deploy the package to server and run it 3 times using sql agent with 3 different confogurations

10591142
post	get
if you want to redirect from http to https and not lose the signed_request post parameter you can manually snag it before the redirect and append it to the url as a get parameter

10591152
bash	tcsh
bin csh refers to the c-shell bin tcsh the t-shell bin bash the bash shell etc

10591152
bash	tcsh
this page might be of interest as it translates between bash and tcsh commands syntax

10591152
bash	tcsh
for instance i use the tcsh shell interactively but often run bash scripts using bin bash in the script file

10591162
fadein	fadeout
yes i know it does work with fadein and fadeout if you provide the

10591172
qgraphicsitem	qobject	qgraphicsitem	qwidget	qobject	qwidget
it does inherit from qobject and lets you have a mixture of qwidget and qgraphicsitem functionality

10591205
portrait	landscape
you can use onconfigurationchanged to detect when the screen switches between landscape portrait

10591258
wordpress	ipb
i have removed index.php from wordpress urls successfully with nginx-rewrite however when i try to use seo friendly urls on ipb nginx simply returns to wordpress 404 page

10591270
mouse	keyboard
i m making an application that will simulate an action using mouse keyboard macro deppending on the value of a variable

10591308
ssms	sqlcmd
the syntax is specific to sqlcmd r is a sql command directive but if the script is opened using ssms then the relative path is relative to ssms not the script that you are running

10591319
sorting	grouping
for me designing contentproviders without a grouping by clause is like manufacturing a keyboard without numbers... for 4.0+ i would suggest iterating through the regular cursor and sorting the messages yourself

10591372
dictionary	map
it consists in building the dictionary of unicode ordinals from the chars to delete and to map them to none

10591381
ssms	ssdt
i am using the sql express on aws rds free usage tier myself lately and connecting via ssms or ssdt

10591438
submit	submission
i have a form that i have been submission to salesforce with standard form submit action

libc++ in some cases might have a better implementation of the c++11 standard than your existing libstdc++ library

10602859

the latter is important if you re using clang in an environment with an outdated version of libstdc++ like mac osx but note that the two c++ libraries are not compatible with each other so you would have to rebuild any dependencies against libc++ if you were to use that

i am currently attempting to upgrade my versioning of sql server express edition to developer edition

10603801
targetinvocationexception	argumentnullexception
however since i am invoking a private method using reflection i would assert a targetinvocationexception for the method that throws an argumentnullexception like so

10603801
targetinvocationexception	argumentnullexception
i would like to assert an argumentnullexception instead of a targetinvocationexception for that private method so i can scan over its code and know what its expected to do rather than to debug to find out

10603822
union	distinct
there is no reason to use distinct and union together as union will make the results distinct

google-chrome	firefox
i ve reproduced in google-chrome in firefox

i think the easiest way to do what you want is to present some uiview that is 1.5 pixel height and animate it s width

10603856
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it appears to work properly in the latest version of firefox mac but not in google-chrome safari mac

for-loop	loops
if i replace the boost_foreach loops with a for-loop using an iterator

10603909
free	malloc
you can modify malloc free using hooks to remember allocated memory for example suppose that your record the new pointer in an array of pointers

10603921
versioning	upgrade
in addition to avoiding peculiar upgrade issues when moving to a new edition and a new versioning unless you don t really mean express is sql server 2008 you also have the added bonus that you still have your original databases intact which you won t have if the upgrade fails in worse ways than simply being blocked

10603975
opensuse	linux
i am running java 1.5.0_15 on an opensuse linux machine

10604001
post	get
i need a simple code example of sending http post request with post parameters that i get from form inputs

10604039
put	get
the solution that comes to my mind is write a .py file to continually put trending topics in a queue and write independent .py files continually running making get queue requests and saving the data in the db used by django with raw sql or sqlalchemy

10604066
addition	modulo
the xor operator performs addition modulo 2 making the potentially expensive mod operation unnecessary

10604066
int	boolean
using packed int however would be a somewhat more complicated than your use of a simple boolean array which really is likely just an array of bytes

my question is this is there any way to test for this event so that i can either stop it in its tracks or at the least pop-up some sort of dialog box to alert the user that this should not be done

10604216
hide	show
note with this you will face the problem if keyboard is show it will not hide so you need also add -endediting yes

10604236
int	chars
9 there are number of chars that can be interpreted as decimal digits and converted to an int

10604284
vsto	add-in
the add-in is managed code c# but is not built with vsto - it uses custom wrappers and a com shim

10604284
vsto	netoffice
i ll add that migrating to vsto or a similar technology such as netoffice is an option but we d prefer to avoid that if possible

10604305
superclass	subclassing
so means that a function that takes superclass of a can be viewed as a subclassing of the original function

10604534
width	height
i want to convert this to an ogv file with a much lower bit rate 128kb but the same width and height

10604540
width	height
while this certainly can be done with core graphics it s infinitely easier to add a transparent png to your project with the appropriate width and 1 pixel height and then position a uiimageview in your table cell over the content to create this effect

10604570
google-chrome	firefox
just use firebug extension in firefox or the built-in google-chrome developer tools

10604601
for-loop	arrays
alternatively you could use an arrays that is actually 3x2 instead of 4x3 then fix your for-loop to use indexing that matches

10604630
awt	swing
i have heard quite a few times not to mix swing and awt heavyweight and lightweight components

10604630
awt	swing
so i guess my question is is there still a compelling reason to not mix awt and swing components even if your only displaying one component on the jframe at once

10604638
width	height
i got an assignment that i have to make a programm in java that takes an image.creates 3 buttons named align left right and center .2 textfields width and height that i can input numbers there and a button resize.the 4 buttons align left right center and resize have to change the image place to left right or center and resize the image as the numbers were given respectively

10604638
width	height
i need to also make a setpreferedsize and somehow get the width and height of textfields

10604659
hash	salt
if your app uses the user id in public data such as by including it in a url parameter you should use a hash algorithm with a salt value added to obscure the id

10604666
int	boolean
in java that is a compilation error because the value of the assigment has type int and a boolean is required at that point

10604672
serializable	deserialization
my question would be is there a simpler way to solve this than implementing my own serializable deserialization

10604676

mdpi	hdpi
i can t find the reference right now but i m pretty sure the value of density in that class for mdpi is 1.0 hdpi is 1.5 and xhdpi is 2.0

10604927
screens	hdpi
ideally a large-mdpi image and a large-hdpi image will be approximately the same size when measured with a plastic ruler on the screens but the hdpi image should look nicer on account of having more pixels

10604948
typedef	struct
there is no struct timer in scope just a typedef for an anonymous struct

10604957
awt	swing
you can use awt components together with swing jcomponents only if you have got really important reason s for example a.m

10604957
awt	swing
i d suggest don t mixing awt with swing and vice versa

10604957
awt	swing
swing is based or inherits of awt components and their methods

10604981
awt	swing
mixing awt and swing has performance drawbacks and if you are trying to use themes you will also run into problems

10604981
awt	swing
swing is built on top of awt and yes it is newer and faster and better but it s still got access to everything awt has

10604992
versioning	upgrade
as per this homebrew imagemagick issue precompiled binaries may reference the wrong library versioning when something else is upgrade

10605014
keydown	keyup
the only information i ve found on this is that you need to keep track of variables such as the shift key kanji key etc for foreign languages with bools in the keydown and keyup events and then make a massive switch case that will take in all of the variables and spit out what you d want for your app

10605030
width	height
it s as if animating a width height of an element cancels out all other animations in the animation block

for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
however i am wondering why it shows the correct thing during the while loops as it goes along but then after it is complete the for-loop shows all three of the arrays entries having the same name the value is correct for the third entry but for the first and second entries the value field contains half of the correct value for the third entry

10605101

10605124
couchbase	couchdb
btw couchdb and couchbase are completely different database products both use erlang platform and it seems like you are using them interchangeably

10605124
couchbase	couchdb
maybe the problem is that you are trying to connect to couchdb with couchbase client or something like that

10605125
fgets	strtok
the value returned from strtok will be pointing to an element in curline so all entries in the array of struct s will be pointing to an element in curline which is overwritten with each call to fgets and will only be valid for the current iteration

10605125
strdup	strtok
you should make a copy of the value returned from strtok during the while possibly using strdup

10605135
hex	binary
so far i ve investigated that i can not simply open core as binary and search for 654321 converted to hexadecimal nothing found in hex editor

10605137
getter	setter
i would suggest introducing functionaljava s option in the accessors getter and setter while leaving hibernate to handle a simple java field which is allowed to be null

10605146
readonly	temporary
it seems that this puts a temporary lock handle on the binaries even when they are on a readonly share

10605150

post	get
another solution is to get all tags of the post from db compare the list with the submitted one and decide what we have to delete and what we have to insert

10605571
width	height
can we get the width or height of a div even if we don t specify it

10605589
int	boolean
the role column is an int and each its bit should mean different boolean flag as in previous example you can map this to a enum in c# and say that if the first bit is on then user has rights to update description if the second bit is on user can change schedules and so on

10605645
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works in firefox but not in google-chrome

check this page for strtod reference and this page for atof reference

10605837
width	height
you can use setpicturesize int width int height

10605855

one way to do this is with getter and setter functions which would both encapsulate and allow you to do your const thing

10605858
stateless	stateful
i was trying to check the component being stateful stateless with the statelesschecker

10605863

10606172
int	double
d expects the corresponding argument to be type int not double

10606172
int	double
now it s almost guaranteed that sizeof int sizeof double so when printf takes the next sizeof double bytes from the argument list it s probably starting with the middle byte of temp rather than the first byte of ftemp

10606175
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient which is wrapper around httpwebrequest but it doesn t hurt to try

10606217
width	height
i look at the source through firebug and can clearly see that the width is 0 the odd thing is the height adjusts each time i click next or previous going through the gallery

the better option is to upload a single rtsp stream to centrally-hosted streaming server which will convert your stream to rtmp mpeg-ts and publish it to flash players set-top boxes

10606361

quicksort	heapsort
i saw a big improvement when i implemented intro-sort quicksort that falls back to heapsort if the recursion depth exceeds a certain threshold

10606415
quicksort	heapsort
of course intro-sort is no longer pure quicksort as it uses heapsort to bring the complexity back to n log n when pure quicksort hits some bad data

10606420
mouseover	mouseout
mobile safari emulates click mouseover and mouseout events

10606496

10606618
for-loop	arrays
so i would recommend that you start with your arrays fill it completely with random numbers instead of generating them as you go along and fix any numbers that match use a for-loop

10606625

10606895
mouse	keyboard
.net only has .net controls forms buttons etc based mouse keyboard hooking built in so to programmatically respond to those events outside your .net controls you need a global event hook that can intercept mouse and keyboard activity from anywhere in windows

howto use one keyboard mouse hook dll to perform the functionality you are requesting the ability to respond programmatically to mouse keyboard events globally

10606895

to clarify a bit my idea was to get this statistic in tshark like wireshark gives me when i access telephony voip calls the same way that tshark -r myfile -q -z rtp streamsreturns me statistics just like wireshark s telephony rtp show all streams is there a way to do this

10606979
post	get
i am trying to send a post request through ajax to another domain and get a json response

10606979
post	get
1 always the server is hit with a options request rather than a get or post request

10606984
sudoers	passwd
the correct solution would be to edit your etc sudoers to not prompt you for a passwd for that binary

10606997
postgresql	mysql
note that heroku only uses postgresql so i would not suggest developing off of mysql since there are some inconsistencies in some syntax and how you do a couple of things between the two platforms

width	height
why is the android browser returning such a wide variance in values and how can i reliably detect the width and height of the browser window

10610787
int	double
if you look at a datetime variant numerically as a double the int portion is the date and the time is the remainder

10610797
range	max	range	min	min	max
without knowing beforehand the min and max prices what i d like is to have the histogram cover the entire range of prices with a set number of intervals say 10

10610797
min	max
i know that one solution could be to query my database for the min and max values and then figure out the appropriate interval size but that goes against one of the main points of using elasticsearch which is to not have to hit the db for search related queries

10610807
width	height
because width and height doesn t change when dpi changes object returns same width and height i cannot see what the real size is of the image in pixels the size the user see

free	malloc
for the actual program storage the interpreter and garbage collector will use plain malloc mfree to allocatate and free memory plus some fairly complex control structures to enable the garbage collector to function

10610967
hide	show
you could hide show all .row lists by simply checking the length of their visible child list items within the anonymous function used to set the display of the list itself

10610968
gif	png
the regex above filters jpg png gif files and that is fairly complex as it is

10611010
post	get
one way to get around it is to change the slug of your post

10611075
width	height
so without any other restrictions the images are just going to take on their natural width in this case scaled to keep the aspect ratio the same with a height of 100px so long as it doesn t exceed 50 of the container

bash	subshell
the bash -c call spawns a subshell so you don t need to worry about it changing the directory of the current shell

10611565
skip-lists	tree
suppose we have a sorted set a balanced binary search tree or a skip-lists data structure with n elements

10611568
width	height
as i understand it choosing one or the other height or width but not both retains ratio

10611569
children	parent
if there are more than one parent div elements that have three or more such children then all of the 3rd children are selected

10611581
int	chars
obviously that number has to be something wider than a byte since there are more than 256 chars java uses a version of unicode where every chars is assigned a 16-bit value and this is why java chars are 16 bits wide and have int values from 0 to 65535

serializable	deserialization
during serializable the objects instance variables are sucked out and converted to bytes and written on a file typically a file with .ser extension then during deserialization the bytes are read from the file and then converted to instance variables and are used to create new object identical to the one which was serializable

10624616
serializable	deserialization
you can check the hashcode of the object before serializable and then after deserialization they will never be same as hashcode is provided by jvm depending on where the object is create on the heap and its obvious the 2 objects cant be created on the heap at the same address...so they are diff objects but with identical state

10624621

udp	tcp
like matzi suggested udp gives you lower latency and lower packet overhead as the header is smaller than tcp but on the downside the delivery of the packet to the destination is never guaranteed ie

10624972
udp	tcp
you could say that udp packets are sort of like separate entities while tcp is a continuous unbreaking stream you need some way to distinguish where one message ends and another begins

10624972
udp	tcp
after you ve selected udp and or tcp for the transport you still probably need a custom protocol that encodes and decodes the data payload the tcp udp packets move around

10640204
bmp	png
the question is i have images in png format or jpg as bmp is quite large for my app

10640214

if i comment out the dim and directcast the package executes successfully and i can successfully get the connection string in a messagebox

10640257
versioning	upgrade
when you upgrade you will need to install the new crystal reports runtime for the versioning of the framework you re using on whatever machine needs to run these whether it s the runtime or the merge modules

10640273
post	get
i know that if the form on a jsp html page has a post method then the dopost is called otherwise if it has a get then the doget is called.when is the doput called

i m totally digging on meteor but i m stuck trying to cut down on the global-ness of the examples and add a dash of oop

10640340
dictionary	map
you may be better off storing your players in a dictionary map and then you can add and remove them by name

10640365
versioning	upgrade
i finally fixed this by simply uninstalling all versioning of the web app and then manually going through the registry and removing any and all references to the web app s name upgrade code and the various product codes for each versioning

10640405
hide	show
i need to hide a serie when user click a button and show it when user clicks again

10640413
move	drag
the behaviour i am trying to achieve is such that when i drag a navigation element the content container move with it and when i drop the navigation element in a new position within the list the content container sticks to its new position in the content area as well

10640416
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop is not the best way to approach iterating over an arrays in ruby

10640446
int	chars
if chars_read is less than the length of the string then sscanf didn t consume all the chars so the string didn t consist entirely of a single int

10640471
subtract	add
instead you probably meant to synchronize your get - add - and subtract -methods

10640476
post	get
i know there are other plugins out there that already do this but i m not sure how they actually get the content from the php file to edit the post pages

10640518
int	chars
this can be generalized to either form a atoi function ascii to int or extract the first number that occurs in a string terminated by any non-digit chars by using a loop and a chars pointer to index over the string str

10640564
folder	dir
i want the name to be 1config.ini so that it appears at the top of a folder dir

10640663
next	replacewith
note one think should keep in mind that when one use then #myfield will removed from dom so next time you can t catch it and next replacewith will fail

10640721
public	protected
from a subclass you cannot call private methods only public and protected - this rule applies to constructors as well

10640773
clang	llvm
emscripten can compile llvm bitcode eg generated by clang from c++ to javascript

10640816
google-chrome	safari
granted these are new and i believe they only work in safari and google-chrome

10640851
google-chrome	firefox
try echoing dumping the content and viewing the page with firefox or google-chrome and change the encoding to utf-8 and then something else like iso-8859-1

10640870
getter	setter
technically a property is just syntactic sugar for a getter setter method - so a property can do anythign a method can do but most of the time it shouldnt

10640874
getter	setter
this means you only have to mess with the magic __get and set once and then simply naming your methods the right things will make the behave as getter setter and lazy initializers

10640876
ubuntu	debian
in debian ubuntu is something like this

10640892
hide	show
on bases of those values i am hide and show few contents on page2

10640917
width	height
my approach has been to get the canvas width and height at the beginning of the game calculate the side of the squares and then draw the grid out and save that as a bitmap and then use that bitmap in the game

10640923
getter	setter
first of all this is exactly the reason why you should use getter setter methods

10640927
hide	show
in this example all elements with the class togglable will show their primary child element when clicked and hide all other child elements

10640980
uitableview	nsindexpath
void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

10640985
public	protected
using the same example as op you can t lazy load public members as you would protected private

10641020
int	chars
since this is c++ you should use reinterpret_cast to cast the unsigned chars pointer to an int pointer

10641044
width	height
i even reduced the sizes width height kb to match with men.jpg but it still doesn t show

10641138
children	parent
children divs are displayed or hidden programmatically what changes the height of the parent element

10641147
pop-up	dialog
however after a few seconds maybe 20 a dialog pop-up stating that the application mytool.exe has stopped working

10641163
inherited	properties
you can use the style.basedon properties to inherited one style from another

10641171
slideup	slidedown
instead of .hide and .show use slideup and slidedown animation which will give a nice effect instead of that shaky effect

10641234
fflush	gets
2nd parameter in printwriter constructor is fflush which accepts boolean datatype we need to fflush the data so it gets thrown on the console even if the buffer is not full

10641263
integer	unsigned
this is because pythoncom represents them internally as a 32bit signed integer when the correct representation is a 32bit unsigned integer

10641263
integer	unsigned
we need to interpret the negative number as a 32 bit signed integer then interpret that as an unsigned integer

10641284
scrollable	panels
i have some htmlwindows in a scrollable panels and i want to see the full text in these windows

10641340
filtering	grouping
the individual users need to be part of a roll-up role or grouping in order to add that roll-up role or grouping to the filtering

10641364
int	boolean
when you do add explicit casts to convert the pointers to int the program becomes valid again and you will get boolean from the comparisons

10641390
width	height
i have a script i don t remember where i found it for resizing images based on stage width and height

10641440
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
listview.items is listviewitemcollection inherit of ilist icollection ienumerable

10641443
width	height
check if the machine it s not working have the opengl extension gl_arb_texture_non_power_of_two and check if your texture have a non-power of two width or height

10641462
screens	mdpi
do this so it looks right on an mdpi medium dot-per-inch screens

10641512
put	get
when you put scrollview inside scrollview android just get confused which scroll view is touched

10641559
int	double
i have a formula that involves a double but is guaranteed to give an int answer -- specifically an unsigned 32-bit int which alas java doesn t do well

10641559
int	double
eventually i found the issue but the behavior is still very odd to to me a double cast directly to an int seems to be capped at the max_int for a signed int whereas a double cast to a long that is then cast to an int gives me the expected answer -1

10641559
integer	unsigned
the max int of an unsigned 32-bit integer represented as a signed 32-bit integer

10641559
int	double
so to the question then is this expected behavior in java any double cast directly to an int will be capped to max_int

10641580
int	chars
real type means the int types enums real floating point types and chars Ã¢ 6.2.5 17

10641602
google-chrome	firefox
the page works fine on firefox v12 and ie v9 but breaks in google-chrome iron v12 specifically clicking on the club name to get the stats for the club causes the tabs to be displayed vertically and the accordion to be a mess

10641648
google-chrome	firefox
i tested your files locally using google-chrome 19.0.1084.46 and firefox 3.6.22

10641648
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox i could view it with no problems but in google-chrome i saw nothing

10641667
xsl-fo	xslt
xsl-fo or xslt formatting objects a w3c standard was the most often used technology to generate pdf documents

10641695
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
though it s probably best that you do whatever it is you are wanting to do in the viewdidload viewwillappear or viewdidappear methods of your rootviewcontroller unless it s something you don t usually want to happen

10641704
post	get
you can then loop over the post to get individual post details

10641741
int	double
temp should be a double not an int if you don t want things you assign to it to become int

10641744
avd	galaxy
i would like to create an avd of the samsung galaxy s ii

10641744
portrait	landscape
the sole purpose is to test websites with it s default web browser to see how they look in both portrait and landscape mode

10641762
postgresql	mysql
you re much better off using mysql or postgresql - both are trivial to use in cloudfoundry and will perform much better

10641833
findstr	ipconfig
another possibility is to put in this place the ipconfig all | findstr command so the auxiliary file is entirely avoided like i done in the first version of my program

10641864
implements	extends
your pattern class has to extends basicobject and extends implements codeobject which is actually an interface

10641864
implements	extends
the method will accept any classes that extends basicobject no matter whether they extends implements codeobject

10641888
hide	show
i would like it to hide the error div and then do the alert but as i run the code the alert show up firs then the area is set to hide

10641907
post	get
i want to pass the username email and password to my users model to add the user to my database but i m not sure how i can get the post data into that method

10641918
width	height
i recommend wrapping your entire document in a and setting it to height 100 and width 100 and controlling overflow with that div instead

10641919
post	get
from the other post here it looks like it could be a compiler problem in which case you can get around it by using a typedef instead of the map type directly

10641964
post	get
the codeigniter input class allows you to get the post data after it has been filtered by the form validation library

10641983
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
json.stringify in javascript which is in all mobile browsers google-chrome firefox opera safari and in ie since version 8.0 more detailed list of compatible browsers is here

10642005
google-chrome	safari
if yes is there something simliar in google-chrome safari and ie

10642033
children	parent
is it possible to only trigger the event on the parent element .tile so that overflowing children .item do not obfuscate which tile i really hover

10642059
opera	safari
there isn t a good compiler for converting userscripts into safari or opera extensions

10642059
opera	safari
some userscripts work on opera though and there are some older safari extensions that run some userscripts but i don t hear good things about them

10642060
floating-point	integer
converting a floating-point to an integer type if the value is too large for the destination then the maximum value is substituted

10642071
comparator	comparable
to implements comparable interface class must implement a single method comparator

10642072
int	double
remember that there are no primitive unsigned long or int types in java and the java language specification java 7 for narrowing primitive conversion 5.1.3 states that casting a too small or too large floating point value be it double or float to an integral type of int or long will use the minimum or maximum value of signed integral types emphasis mine

10642072
int	chars
a long if t is long or to an int if t is byte short chars or

10642072
floating-point	integer
otherwise if the floating-point number is not an infinity the floating-point value is rounded to an integer value v rounding

10642072
int	chars
the results for chars int and long are unsurprising producing the

10642072
int	double
the first case thus promotes maxuintfromdoubleaslong to a double via multiplication and then casts it to an int

10642072
int	double
so first promotes maxuintfromdoubleaslong to double back to long still fitting and then to an int

10642093
width	height
i was able to do this by destroying and recreating the cycle updating the width and height field based on the container and images within there images were dynamically sized to the container width

10642095
width	height
consider replacing it with a div and setting a width and height

10642127
put	get
i know that does not exactly answer you question but hopefully it will put you on the track so you can provide some more information and get it all fixed

10642179
screens	tablet
which works fine in phone s screens the problem is that it could happen that a 7 tablet takes the value from values-mdpi and a 10 tablet too but the result is not the same i guess because of the screens size although is the same resolution and similar density

10642182
getter	setter
i have noticed there are some new features in roo 1.2.1 to facilitate jpa functionality rooentity to roojpaactiverecord but i thought when i open roo shell in sts it could handler that conversion automatically...i can still achieve that manually however after i change the annotation name no matter i use poll now or re-build the project all the getter setter finder entitymanager are error out due to no aspectj injection actually i can see the aspectj files are generated sts just cannot identify them with the entity java file

10642222
hide	show
just hide all spans and then show the one you passed as variable

10642249
inherited	properties
relevant information backspacehideaction inherited from frameworkelement and has a dependency properties called target actually same as mytype

10642267
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you want the web audio api html5 rocks tutorial which unfortunately is only partially supported in firefox google-chrome and safari currently

10642275
implements	extends
create another class which does the extends implements

10642369
subclass	abstract-class
you could skip the interface if you ll never have an implementation other than a subclass of the abstract-class

10642377
post	get
i have an application interface that uses http post get using xml messages

10642377
inherited	properties
i have the objects deserialized into the following that cannot be changed extended inherited but no additional properties functions

10642477
shadowing	named
and it avoids the dangerous issues that can happen when you start shadowing variable named -- accidentally referring to the wrong x will get you into trouble sooner or later

10642486
folder	directory
reorganize my folder to a shared parent folder to avoid this cmake craziness which presents some security problems for me as some directory are not public

10642497
webclient	httpwebrequest
by analyzing these http requests you will be able to extract the ones that retrieve the data and automate them using webclient or httpwebrequest

10642515
pop-up	dialog
i don t know how you are displaying this window but i suggest using a dialog pop-up

10642515
pop-up	dialog
once the user closes this dialog pop-up you need to then somehow call the api.playtoggle function again to start the slideshow back up

10642545
ubuntu	debian
it is possible that this also might be part of a specific build that debian ubuntu distros are using

10642597
getter	setter
you should also create getter setter moethods instead of using public fields

10642613
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and mozilla firefox seem to work fine

10642728
svg	vml
use vml2svg.xsl and its dependencies as the imported stylesheet of an object which calls transformtoxml to convert vml to svg then convert svg to png using readimageblob and imagemagick

10642730
mootools	zepto
jquery and other similar frameworks like zepto mootools and dojo irons over some of the cracks in javascript such as cross browser inconsistencies and will make things a lot easier

10642730
hide	show
jquery also provides a quick and easy way to show and hide elements on the page via show and hide here how it works

10642783
folder	directory
you will need to create a lib and config folder inside the bin directory of your application

10642783
folder	directory
the .config files go in the config folder and the jar files of from the roles in the install folder go in the lib directory

10642804
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
use firebug with firefox or in google-chrome or safari or ie8 use the developer tools to see what js is loading on your site and use the error console to find fix the errors

10642805
docx	xlsx
i have similar behavior for docx and xlsx files

10642805
docx	xlsx
after uploading the document if the file is of type docx or xlsx i call a sp webservice to update the metadata

10642851
post	get
sorry for the long post i wanted to get all the details in

10642869
hide	show
i use jquery to hide this button when clicked on to inturn show more button links

10642907
children	parent
i don t want them to be positioned absolutely because i have a parent element that has a background border and color but when i position the children absolutely the parent doesn t stretch here is the code in its entirety

10642919
xul	xbl
overlays only apply to xul documents not to xbl bindings it is a xul feature and not supported by xbl

10642992
inherited	subclassing
instead other models inherited from the abstract model gaining all of its functionality and it s those subclassing that actually are instantiated

10643045
screens	mdpi
mdpi resources for medium-density mdpi screens 160dpi

10643045
screens	hdpi
hdpi resources for high-density hdpi screens 240dpi

10643075
onresume	onpause
also i m stopping and starting threads in onpause and onresume respectively

10643110
ienumerable	iqueryable
i have a model with list or ienumerable or iqueryable or whatever.

10643110
ienumerable	iqueryable
so instead of list ef4type or ienumerable ef4type or iqueryable ef4type

10643136
folder	directory
create a directory named shelled in eclipse dropins folder

10643138
hide	show
if you do your own view as i do in my apps you can easily show it and hide it by playing with the alpha property

10643155
bids	ssis
you need bids business intelligence development studio to create the dtsx packages and ssis which isn t available with sql express

10643162
uilabel	uibutton
just out of curiosity can you maybe switch from using uilabel s to just using uibutton s with the custom type

10643176
post	get
when i submit a post with ajax that is not in english i will get something similar to u4f60 u662f u5982 u4f55 u505a uff1f

10643215
postgresql	mysql
i have a default installation of mysql and postgresql on my os x box and mysql is 2x faster comparing queries that are warmed up by repeatedly executing the query

10643215
postgresql	mysql
the big question as far as i m concerned is still outstanding -- will postgresql require more fiddling and configuration to run well than mysql

10643234
shadowing	named
then there is no ugly shadowing issue because you are using distinct named

10643257
post	put
all i can figure is that since i run both domains they think i should put a forwarding script in the hard coded silent post url which basically looks for an originating domain parameter and re-sends the post to the secondary domain

10643292
post	put
i have never used iframe post form lib but the initial working code looks like it is setting up the listeners on document ready in your code you put the set up inside of the change function of file-to-upload

10643292
post	put
but the problem with your code is you put the set up of the post form in the wrong place

10643321
width	margin
with a fixed width and auto margin css will center your div

10643342
mouse	keyboard
but this has the problem of exaggerated events generated when the user moves the mouse and no events at all if he moves out of your script windows or if he s more of a keyboard user

10643426
width	height
i tried adding an svg text using the x y width and height attributes and then prepending an svg rect

10643438
width	height
check box width and change image width if needed then check if image height is greater than box height if not then done

10643458
filtering	grouping
this way you don t have to use the .include and you can even filtering the grouping

10643465
floating-point	integer
do you really want to define a type as either integer or floating-point

10643465
int	double
you can almost do the same thing by converting everything to long double but that can lose precision for large int values

10643502
rss	feed
in one of my pages i pull in two rss feed and display them using the jfeed plugin

10643504
postgresql	mysql
that guide contains examples for doing this for mysql and postgresql earlier in the page

10643543
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am using jquery to prevent the default action and this works fine in google-chrome safari firefox and ie 8 9 but in ie7 the browser is trying to make use of the of the anchor in the default fashion

10643557
screens	tablet
these are also based on the physical resolution of the screens so may vary across devicesÃ¢ for example a 1024x720 tablet with a system bar actually has a bit less space available to the application due to it being used by the system bar.

10643582
width	height
would this cause any issue as the width and height of the bars will change compared to the previous version of font 40

10643590
post	get
i have registered a custome imodelbinder or attempted to but when my post action is called my custom binder isn t hit and i just get the default serialization with the null arrays - even though wireshark shows me the incoming complex object contains array elements

10643602
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
dotnetzip is much easier to use than sharpziplib example of zipping all files in folder

10643613
pull	push
also if you login you should try git pull heroku master then try to git push heroku master

10643637
free	malloc
a small template program for midi sysex input using various malloc d spaces would free memory in the wm_destroy bit of the wndproc but when i transplanted this to a larger program it crashed on exit

10643662
mp3	ogg
i am using a plugin that asks for mp3 and ogg versions of the file

10643662
mp3	ogg
for some reason every other browser uses the mp3 but firefox looks for the ogg and then i get some sort of error and it won t play

10643680
bash	zsh
as you can see they appear to be identical - there s certainly no color issues in either zsh or vim that i ve noticed i don t use bash much

10643680
bash	zsh
however i do not think i ve messed with anything that would affect the solarized colorings between bash and zsh in vim

10643688
mp3	ogg
you should try to force the content-type header to mp3 or ogg when you re serving up a file like that

10643692
subtract	add
though it s not possible to do the operators you could always just create add or concat subtract and compare methods..

10643695
submit	submission
by giving a unique value each time and setting the session data to the same value you can also avoid duplicate submission if the user clicks submit twice

10643696
mp3	ogg
i use buzz.js for playing music you still have to provide a mp3 file as well as an ogg one but it solves your problem and works on every browser

10643708
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
i also agree with the suggestion of antonio bakula to use dotnetzip instead of sharpziplib

10643708
folder	directory
if you want to enumerate the files or directory inside a specific folder you can instead use directory.enumeratefiles or directory.enumeratedirectories

10643712
comparator	icomparer
most of the linq ordering methods are supported in linq to entities with the exception of those that accept an icomparer because the comparator cannot be translated to the data source

10643732
google-chrome	firefox
notice that for ie 9 it works the same way as other browsers google-chrome firefox but when i changed the document mode in the developer tools to ie 8 the problem showed up

10643746
width	height
there is also a background image on each column that is scaled to fit either the height or width whichever is greater

10643747
getter	setter
and myconnectiondao is a pojo with getter and setter for above properties

10643758
equals	gethashcode
why is it important to override gethashcode when equals method is overriden in c#

10643758
equals	gethashcode
is there a way to check for equality where i just check the hash code in the equals method so implement both equals and gethashcode and not get the object.gethashcode not implemented warning

10643758
equals	gethashcode
what will happen if i just implement the equals and not implement the gethashcode

10643779
textmate	sublimetext
has anone had any luck both compiling and running coffeescript files in sublimetext 2 with the textmate bundle

10643785
getter	setter
and i also know that you have to either use getter or setter or you have to notify the observers with self willchangevalueforkey thekey and self didchangevalueforkey thekey when you change the values programmatically

10643785
getter	setter
getter and setter implementation

10643811
equals	gethashcode
if you override one equals and not the other gethashcode then you run the risk of encountering inconsistent behavior when using gethashcode plopping your objects in a collection implemented as a hash table versus equals

10643815
equals	gethashcode
if you implement equals but not gethashcode then if your class is used in any data structure which uses hashing etc. it will behave incorrectly

10643823
width	height
because if you call it before the image is loaded its width and height are 0 both

10643837
range	minimum
but for some reason the numericupdown controls throw an error as the value 0 is out side the minimum maximum range the minimum is set to 1 so basically it is reading it as 0

10643842
google-chrome	firefox
it s better to first inspect your code online using google-chrome or firefox s inspect element or firebug

10643883
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the print styles work just fine with google-chrome safari firefox and ie9 but completely breaks in ie7 and ie8

10643886
boost	stl
boost serialize already has methods for serializing stl containers so that is not the problem.

10643894
exponent	modulo
let s say you already have a modulo and exponent from

10643895
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade my websphere application server from versioning 6.1 to 8.0 but my application does not work anymore and gives the following error

10643923
popover	tooltip
a tooltip has more in common with a popover but they are generally regarded as a popup historically

10643927
exponent	modulo
let s say you already have a modulo and exponent from

10643959
single-quotes	double-quotes
short answer use double-quotes instead of single-quotes as pavel suggested

10643962
exponent	modulo
i have a library that lets you create the binary data to import rsa keys in modulo and exponent now

10643962
exponent	modulo
let s say you already have a modulo and exponent from

10643963
width	height
for a 2.5d projection otherwise known as an orthographic projection the simplest method is to choose a 2d vector for the third dimension and use it as weights to add the depth to the width and height

10644011
bufferstrategy	bufferedimage
on a bufferedimage in real-time in conjunction with a bufferstrategy

10644014
children	parent
so that if the parent s dirty bit is set then the children will also need to be redrawn for the whole picture inside this view to be drawn correctly

10644014
button	checkbox
also each of the nice looking button or labels are just a uiview object with a drawrect that was already implemented that can draw a good looking image of what it is -- a button a checkbox a label or any other widget

10644015
put	get
by using such static methods you can build dynamically expressions like m m.name nick with a couple instructions...than you put in and them...done you get and expression you can apply to an exixting iqueryable

10644069
width	height
without the use of jquery ie only using old javascript how can i set all canvas s in the html document to the document s width and height

10644091
jar	war
as of ava ee 6 is you no longer need to separate ejbs from servlets and can use them together in the very same jar in the war file

10644100
oncreate	setcontentview
the crash itself happens on the setcontentview r.layout.foo method call in oncreate

10644100
tablet	mdpi	tablet	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
we ve seen this on at least 2.2 - 4.0.3 on mdpi hdpi xhdpi phones and tablet

10644115
udp	tcp
there is also a slight glitch in the docs when you open the page for basic_datagram_socket async_connect the example in there is instantiating tcp sockets instead of udp ones

10644116
inherited	properties
then we need to inherited from csharpclientcodegenerator which doesn t really generate anything but just tells ria which generators to use by overriding some of its properties

10644129
fflush	gets
you don t need both and you should close the output stream writer rather than the input stream so it gets fflush

10644152
width	height
be careful when your image was rotated it s width and height hadn t switched

10644164
zlib	libpng
several things i found in the cocos2d forums lead me to believe it s an issue with the zlib implementation on ios but i ve tried using both stb_image and lodepng to avoid zlib and those libraries actually performed even worse than libpng

10644178
hide	show
finally you ll want to use a bit of jquery to hide and show the different field sets when the user selects a different job type

10644178
hide	show
to do that attach a .change handler to the select_tag element and have it hide all the fieldsets then show the one fieldset with an id that matches the selected job type

10644200
jtextfield	jlabel
if i enter a letter a jlabel is displayed and the color of jtextfield changes in red

10644200
jtextfield	jlabel
if i delete the letter the jlabel will disappear and the color of jtextfield is normal

10644204
google-chrome	firefox
hovering over a will rotate the element in firefox but not google-chrome

10644247
width	height
changing the canvas s style will change the canvas s client width and client height not the actual width and height so the content of the canvas will end up being scaled stretched

10644247
width	height
you can t specify the width and height of a canvas in percentages

10644247
width	height
example of the problem here note that no canvas shows up when width and height are percentages

10644247
width	height
you need to set the canvas s style to be width 100 and height 100

10644260
uiview	subviews
i have tried adding a subviews but it simply overlaps the dvc below it and i have not been able to figure out a way to add a dvc as a subviews to a uiview

10644279
getter	setter
i have a class called db details that encapsulates a bunch of string properties with getter and setter

from i understand from the code you have the angle between the sin element and the cos element of the given x y coordinate

10644307
spaces	delimiter
and does not consist entirely of delimiter characters defaults to spaces and tab

10644339
apache	nginx
andrew gerrand has a good blog post about this for nginx but the principle is the same for apache

10644437
gif	png
the background of both 8-bit-transparency png the ball and 1-bit transparency gif the hand allow the background of the svg page to shine through correctly

10644440
background-image	background-color
the browser disables some css rules like background-image and background-color some browsers have options to enable them

10644458
subtract	add
uppercase the letter convert it to ascii subtract a then add 1

10644458
multiplying	add
as you calculate as per the previous recommendation multiplying the previous sum by 10 then add the new value

10644474
int	chars
you can try by convert the chars to int and rest 96 you have to take care of out of range chars or use regex

10644524
stdout	stderr
kernel#quietly uses the following to silence stdout and stderr

10644526
textview	imageview
i have a simple combination of one imageview and two textview over it

10644526
textview	imageview
i would like to make the textview overlap the imageview and then save the combination as a whole as png for example

10644526
textview	imageview
i know i can layer the textview over the imageview using a framelayout which i am already doing

10644526
textview	imageview
is there a way to just export the framelayout as a png image say or do i need to create a canvas add the imageview and textview and export the canvas itself as a png

10644529
super	self
you can override __setitem__ self key val method and use super specialdict self .__setitem__ to access parent object s dict s method

10644573
folder	directory
place your .dae files in a folder titled models in your root directory

10644599
liferay	web-inf
jaxen and dom4j are liferay dependencies that reside in its web-inf lib folder while jaxen also exists in weblogic system classpath

10644599
liferay	web-inf
you can try to fix this situation for example by moving dom4j.jar from liferay to weblogic system classpath or by setting prefer-web-inf-classes option in the web-inf weblogic.xml deployment descriptor of the liferay application

10644636
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu over the last couple of years

10644651
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately i can t make it work in google-chrome it works in firefox and most of my users use google-chrome

10644685
width	height
notes avoid trying to execute this code on the oncreate method since you re likely to be trying to fetch the width and height of the view prior to it being drawn and therefor will result in an error since the dimensions of the bitmap can not be 0

10644690
comparator	comparable
you ll want to look at the comparable interface and the comparator interface

10644690
comparator	comparable
implement comparable if this is the only way your objects can be compared comparator otherwise

10644694
post	put
the most problematic expressions are html tags and because it interferes with the way i put my post variable together

10644699
multicastdelegate	delegation
an important thing to note however is that because of the unfortunate way multicastdelegate and delegate.combine are implemented attempting to use covariant delegation with any code that will attempt to delegate.combine may cause a crash at run-time since delegate.combine requires two delegation that are the precise same type

10644699
multicastdelegate	delegation
it would be nice if there were a generic method to combine delegation of different types the method itself would have to be given a type which could be satisfied by both delegation though the product of such combination couldn t be a multicastdelegate since instances of that class only hold type information for one delegation type

10644701
cpu	processors
suffering a cache miss can stall the processors for hundreds of cpu cycles waiting for the slow bus to supply the data

10644718
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you need to call setcontentview before findviewbyid

10644744
libevent	epoll
python s select module is just a wrapper around select poll and epoll syscalls whereas libev and libevent implement an event loop

10644805
getter	setter
events deal with multicasting the call to multiple delegates you can add custom logic to allow or not a delegate to be added the same way you can wrap a field in a property and add some logic on the getter setter for the property

10644816
put	get
i have put my code at so that you can get a feel for it but here is the gist of it

10644892
folder	directory
these .h files are physically located 2 directory up and one down in an include folder

10644964

versioning	upgrade
did you upgrade your project to a new different versioning of the .net framework when you first opened the vs2008 solution in vs2010

10645040
boost	stl
is there a nice stl way to do this without relying on icu boost or any other 3rd party libs

10645052
getter	setter
one further thought if protobuf objects have getter setter or appropriately named fields one could simply use jackson json processor s data binding

10645052
getter	setter
by default it handles public getter any setter and public fields but these are just default visibility levels and can be changed

10645053
hex	binary
i have never tried to convert hex utf-8 code points to binary before turns out it s actually quite easy when you get your head around it

10645133
post	put
and the user is filling out a form of information on a client that i will eventually patch put post to that resource

10645137
int	double
otherwise i would have to make an instance for int int float double etc

10645166
super	implements	super	self
so you can just implements those methods to change what they do using super specialdict self .__setitem__ key value or dict.__setitem__ self key value to refer to the normal implementation when you need to

10645187
mongoid	mongomapper
hi can some one help me map this to rails and mongo i have two days on the subject but i can t seem to figure it out i mean make the models for these two collections in mongoid or mongomapper

10645196
width	height
when i look at inspect element in chrome i can see that the css max-width has over-written the javascript generated width but it has not chamged the height and that remains as per the script

10645275
touchesbegan	touchesended
most probably you will notice the events responsible for touchesbegan and touchesended for tapping

10645283
interpolation	splines
if you don t know what the function should look like you can use simple splines or interpolation schemes

10645304

nsdata	nsjsonserialization
i m creating a simple nsurlrequest using post and setting its body to an nsdata build using the nsjsonserialization

10645321
folder	directory
if you have that exact directory structure you can use relative imports to import from the parent folder

10645336
interpolation	splines
if there s not much going on between any two of your data points ie the actual function doesn t have any bumps whose peaks are not represented by one of your data points then the splines method of interpolation is one of the best choices you can make

10645377
build.gradle	gradlew
just add apply plugin eclipse at the beginning of your build.gradle and then try running gradlew eclipse

10645386
getter	setter
given that the property is called movieposition the getter should be called -movieposition no underscore and the setter should be called -setmovieposition no underscore and the first letter of the property name capitalized

10645386
getter	setter
while it is allowed to specify the names of the setter and the getter neither kvc nor kvo pay attention to that

10645401
python-mode	pymacs
mainly because in the python-mode package there is some more stuff to use with python emacs like pycomplete pymacs etc.

10645430
width	height
you specify that your view will change its width and height automatically and can get the right values you need to get from there

10645449
public	protected
member functions in class b can access any public or protected member variables in class a

10645449

10645470
folder	directory
i have successfully added the fbconnect folder to my application as well as the src directory to my header search paths in build settings

10645540

that class s compareto must return 0 to indicate that two artifact s are equals

10645557
udp	rtp	rtp	sip
i am having some trouble packetizing an h.264 stream using sip and rtp over udp

i ll just make a note that this flicker occurs in ie and google-chrome while it does not occur in firefox

10645624
updatepanel	contentplaceholder
wrapping the contentplaceholder in the master page with an updatepanel

min	max
the headline aggregation can be a sum min or max value but even if the individual values are of type float the aggregation will be of type integer

10645664
background-image	background-size
you can use css3 to fit the background-image using background-size

10645666
mp3	wav
this is where wav or mp3 files come into play since they play sound as a wave they can play any sound really

10645692

10645775
post	get
i found a stack overflow post with a sample showing how to get the duration of an avi file

10645785
dsl	dynamic-languages
a call to expect is defining a structure for rspec to execute using rspec s own custom dsl and system of matchers. gary bernhardt has a rather neat screencast in which he argues that the mystery of rspec actually falls out naturally from a dynamic-languages like ruby

10645847
for-loop	loops
since my carousels are created in a foreach loops i cannot know how many of them i will have so i tried to call the function in a for-loop

10645883
freebsd	netbsd
in bsd freebsd netbsd etc use

10645903
udp	tcp	icmp	tcp	icmp	udp	sctp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	icmp
layers 1 and 2 fit very closely layer 3 is roughly ip routing layer 4 is roughly tcp udp sctp icmp and so on

10645903
udp	tcp	icmp	tcp	icmp	udp	sctp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	icmp
send works with stream datagram and raw sockets so it could straddle multiple layers of the stack -- you could use it to send tcp udp sctp or icmp packets or scribble directly on the wire if you wish

10645939
sudoers	passwd
for that scenario i added a all nopasswd line in my sudoers file that allows the jenkins user to run usr sbin installer without providing a passwd

10646518
accelerometer	gyroscope
the devicemotion property is only available on devices having both an accelerometer and a gyroscope

10646518
accelerometer	gyroscope
i expect some simple but good enough math calculation upon the senser data from accelerometer and gyroscope to finally calculate the roll yaw and pitch

10646576
inherited	properties
you don t have to worry about messy inherited heirarchies - you can just alter the properties at will

10646601
google-chrome	firefox
tested with firefox 12 and google-chrome 18.0.1025.168

10646601
google-chrome	firefox
note how in webkit browsers google-chrome the file size changes but in firefox it didn t update the file size

10646601
google-chrome	firefox
is there a way to get firefox to update the file size similar to how google-chrome does in this situation

10646601
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome will see that the file size is less than 2mb and add it to the form

10646601
google-chrome	firefox
a user chooses it in the form and both google-chrome and firefox show bytes 40 000 - 50 000 in the textarea

10646615
scrypt	salt
the keys are so small in fact that you can have the user choose a signing passphrase feed it to scrypt 1 with their user id as the salt and use the output as the private key you just need to frob three bits to make it a valid ed25519 private key

10646626
hid	keyboard

i use xdebug helper in google-chrome or easy xdebug in firefox to initialize xdebug my problem occurs regardless of which i use

10646639
integer	unsigned
use an unsigned integer type to get more eventid and userid s out of the same number of bytes

10646639
integer	unsigned
if you are only using ipv4 addresses store the ip as an unsigned 4-byte integer and use inet_aton and inet_ntoa to convert back and forth

10646659
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
typed arrays are not supported in ie 10 firefox 4 google-chrome 7 safari 5.1 and opera 11.6 and mobile support is shaky but improving

10646804
realloc	malloc
in the first case the second malloc originally the first was crashed and in the second case it crashed a realloc that appears later in the same function

10646805
hide	show
so is it possible to show a loading image or text while it processes and after completion it will hide the image and display file content

10646836
multiplication	modulo
using the modulo allows you to map every possible output of the matrix multiplication encryption to a letter in the alphabet which is b which lets you store the encrypted message in the form of a string of letters

10646842
public	protected
the function f can access only the private and protected parts of the base class but only public parts of the derived class

10646915
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
unless ptr is null it must have been returned by an earlier call to malloc calloc or realloc

10646915
free	malloc
this could be anything - you could be overwriting the internal structures of malloc which could cause a crash later on some invocation of malloc or free

10646915
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
also after the realloc cont 0 cont will no longer be a pointer returned by malloc since it s as if you d written free cont

implements	extends
some important points are to extends element and implements ielementsizing

10647212
mouseleave	mouseenter
however this creates a funky blinking effect because on mouseleave of the main image i hide the three small images which immediately triggers a mouseenter for the main image because of the overlap and the mouse still being on top of the main image

10647212
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works great on safari and google-chrome but not on firefox and ie where the images still blink

10647212
mouseleave	mouseenter
i tried to work with switches that i flip on off as i mouseenter mouseleave the various images but that doesn t work either because the events seem to trigger in different orders

10647265
folder	directory
i was wondering how could i get a .wav file without creating a whole new folder in the application release directory

10647273
hide	show
and on jsp page2 whatever show and hide content is there rendered using

10647282
children	parent
if you want multiple instances of rec running you should be using execlp on the children not the parent

10647282
children	parent
then instead of just exiting the parent you wait for all the children to finish

10647309
width	height
both height and width on both parent and child is fill_parent

10647312
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	html5lib	html5lib	beautifulsoup
the best solution is to install an external parser lxml or html5lib and use beautifulsoup with that parser

10647376
folder	directory
with it you can change your current directory allowing php to think you are in model folder

10647378
mouseover	mouseout
but the issue with adding html dynamically with js is that the resulting dom elements would not have the necessary event handlers attached to them in the case of hovercard mouseover mouseout and probably others

10647394
profiling	instrumentation
while profiling the app i don t see any valid memory leak in instrumentation tool

10647520
for-loop	loops
well this is quite embarrassing and i couldn t manage to do it on the interview that i had today i was applying for a junior position now trying at home i made something that works statically i mean not using a loops which is kind of useless but i don t know if i m not getting enough hours of sleep or something but i can t figure it out how my for-loop should look like

10647521
apache	nginx
the easiest solution is to add a rewrite rule to your nginx or apache server like so

10647577
apache	nginx
the easiest solution is to add a rewrite rule to your nginx or apache server to internally rewrite all calls to the same index.html page

since scheduling is system dependent if i get the priority of the current process as sched_other and try to get the min max values on a ubuntu or other linux systems i ve come across my values would be 0-0 which won t work for trying to set a valid priority range

10657970
range	max	range	min	min	max
since my main concern is only trying to get a valid range of priorities values to ensure the user doesn t input too high or low a value should i not even bother with the current process priority and only get the min max values for sched_ff or sched_rr since those values seem to give me valid range for the various linux unix systems i ve encountered or am i missing the point completely

10667884
quicksort	mergesort
problem is i have found no such thing as a 3-way mergesort i only know of a 3-way quicksort so i thought that he probably meant to take an array split it into 3 parts and then mergesort those 3 parts together and i m doing this by mergesorting the first 2 parts together and then mergesorting the combined part with the 3rd part

equals	gethashcode
this is known to us that if we override the equals method of object in our custom types we should also override and provide an implementation of gethashcode method to support generating unique hash codes for use in support of hashtable and dictionary collection classes and may be other classes

10667938
equals	gethashcode
now i want to return true for 2 laptop instances that have all the above defined fields matching with each other so that requires to override the equals and gethashcode method and also another requirement as you can see is that this is a derived class and may be re-used further and support a number of methods

10668020
ampl	mathprog
thus you could try the student version of ampl with cplex or gurobi with your gnu mathprog model

10668025
equals	gethashcode
so requirements for equals gethashcode are the same for structs and classes

10668025
equals	gethashcode
and as henk said it is better to not override equals gethashcode at all.

10668156
hide	show
and then display block to hide and show the heading

10668170
coalesce	isnull
coalesce is more correct of course you could just embed isnull over and over and over... but put that under a performance microscope and coalesce may just win

10668170
coalesce	isnull
coalesce returns datatype similar to that of case evaluation whereas isnull returns datatype of first in list

10668170
coalesce	isnull
furthermore coalesce is ansii standard isnull is engine specific

i ve seen several tablet apps that split the screens into two parts

10669133
vim	gedit	vim	emacs	emacs	gedit
vim v gedit v emacs i wanted to use a regular expression which would be more human readable and easier to write then creating a massive tree or as user joel suggested just going over the words with a loop

also you may want to upgrade to a more recent versioning of the autocomplete plugin

10669187

10669327
stateless	stateful
dealing with a stateless cluster is often simpler then dealing with a stateful cluster

10669332
postgresql	mysql
i think postgresql is most common in the python world with mysql close behind

10669332
postgresql	mysql
and either way unless you want to use database-engine-specific things you can use any database - be it sqlite mysql postgresql oracle or anything else supported by sqlalchemy

10669416
range	max	range	minimum	range	min	min	max	minimum	max
all that is left for you to do is prepare an ienumerable of tuple where the first int is minimum ip int-value the second is the maximum and the tvalue is the data that is associated with that min max range

with the introduction of ios 5 we got the ability to write our own container controllers view controllers that can host other view controllers inside themselves just like uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller do

10669691
fseek	ftell
use ftell to store the position of the file an fseek to go back to it later

10669709
put	get
the form displays when i remove the php code but when i put the code back in i just get a blank white page

10669719
post	get
combined to do post then get its probably better to use separate functions but this will work for th e demo

10669721
fseek	ftell
the process is simple with ftell and fseek

10669736
width	height
basically this is for a fluid width site where i want to cap the box height and auto adjust the image size to show all the text without going over the height

10669765

it s working perfectly now but i don t know if it s the right way to do it cos i can t figure out how to adapt it so that i can add extra search fields for bathrooms minimum price max price zip etc

10669765
minimum	max
how do i add a search field for bathrooms another for minimum price another for max price another for zip etc

10669778
coalesce	isnull
coalesce function works a bit different coalesce will take any number of parameters and return the first non- null value i prefer coalesce over isnull cause

10669826
put	get
problem is when i get back to where i am trying to put it into an arraylist once returned it seems to work fine

10669845
free	malloc
you need a call to free for each call to malloc

10669845
free	malloc
that doesn t necessarily mean that each malloc call in your source code needs to have a corresponding free call

10669845
free	malloc
i should also note that free ing all malloc ed memory isn t absolutely required

10669851
children	parent
if i have two models - parent and child and parent has_many children and i have an array of parent and want to retrieve all of the children for all of those parent is there a way i can do this in rails without writing the sql statement manually

10669862
width	height
at that point you can move text from the end of the current textarea to the beginning of the next textarea until the scroll height width goes away

10669886
width	height
or sometimes you will get called an onmeasure with measurespec.exactly at which point you have no choice but to use the supplied width or height

10669888
hide	show
i m using it basically to show hide advanced options on the form

10669890
width	height
you re better off either avoiding the iframe and simply modifying the webview contents directly or giving the iframe 100 height and 100 width so that it takes up the entire webview

10669948
pop-up	dialog
if the name already exists another dialog box will pop-up to alert the user that existing data will be replaced

selecteditem	selectedindex
because it s easier i bound to selectedindex instead of selecteditem

10670213
int	chars
in this case both an int array or a chars array seem convenient for the board representation

10670213
int	chars
is there any difference in terms of efficiency when doing operations in an int array and a chars array

10670213
int	chars
i suspect that since every element of the chars array has size of 1 byte it may be slower because of a different representation in memory consider a modern computer which has at least 32 bits for int representation .

10670223
chown	chmod
and i used chown wwwdata and chmod 777

10670228
width	height
is there any way to enforce a minimum size width and height on a window

10670239
int	chars
chars s are generally 1-byte aligned and int s are generally 4-byte aligned

10670239
int	chars
assuming you are working with a machine that follows this standard both arrays will store their content as contiguous blocks of memory the int array being 4x the size of the chars array

10670262
crypt	salt
on the php crypt document page the crypt_blowfish example has a trailing for the salt argument it s this

10670279
typedef	struct
because in c++ the struct you defined is named s while in c it s named struct s which is why you often see typedef struct used in c code

10670291
google-chrome	firefox
when i access the system using firefox or google-chrome browsers the user will not be able to re-submit the Ã¢ Å_createtoeditÃ¢ partial view which will contain the modelstate errors and any data annotation errors

10670291
google-chrome	firefox
where this problem is happening on all the browsers ie9 firefox google-chrome

10670311
hash	salt
if so the hash are still going to be different due to the random salt

10670312
width	height
basically if the rectangle the window is going to be exceeds the maximum width or height it adjusts it and sends it on so it shouldn t cause flickering

10670318
crossover	mutation
a genetic algorithm which does mutation crossover operations on randomised sample portfolios will find a very good solution pretty fast

10670326
jboss	glassfish
how do i know the logics of optimization between jboss glassfish tomee

10670330
portrait	landscape
also even if you re able to make the layout look nice in portrait mode it ll probably be not even close to that in landscape

10670372
listview	gridview	switching	screens
i don t know how you have them on the screens but you should switching to using some sort of adapterview listview gridview etc.. and then load an adapter with all of your teams

10670404
put	get
i can see in the attributes inspector there is an identifier field should i put something in here for the detailviewcontroller detailviewcontroller1 and then somehow get that object by it s instance name in code

10670474
int	chars
what is the relation between chars ch and int codepoint for chars that are a-z a-z 0-9

i used to build it on a 32-bit debian box and run it on a 64-bit centos 5.3 server box and it worked fine

10670501

should i somehow put an earlier versioning of libstdc++ on the dev box and try to link against it or try to upgrade the prod box

10670526
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
in first detailviewcontroller s viewdidload and in viewwillappear and in viewdidappear

10670530
post	get
api commands are get and post but i guess you re looking for the list of fields tables

10670555
glut	glew
i do not want glut or any other middleware utility library in between to do the dirty work for me that includes glew

10670614
glfw	glew
here is a sample with glew and glfw copied from my project

10670701
int	chars
but it might give you a hint - probably that int and chars will be much the same

10670701
int	chars
so if you store data in the chars array and then process it somehow using int types you will probably get an extra instruction each time a conversion is made between the two

10670721
createelement	each
is there any way i can use the createelement approach that preserves the case of each attribute

10670766
min	max
-selecting a single record from each group based on the max or min value doesn t matter which one contained in a different field such as support_id

jtextpane	jeditorpane
for editable text use components like jeditorpane or jtextpane

10670899
google-chrome	firefox
i tried on the three i have installed firefox google-chrome and ie 8 i believe and none of them execute anything

10670910
post	get
after form post you can get all select box values

10670949
portrait	landscape
there s no way you can force your device into portrait mode if it s in landscape and vice-versa.all you can do is tell your application to be in a particular mode either landscape or portrait.you can do that by -

10670962
width	margin
i want to get rid of the white space because i have a centered window that grows to 100 width and because of the invisible margin on the left it extends farther to the right and causes the white space on both sides to be asymmetrical

10670974
width	margin
i m working on a webpage and i have the width of my div tag set and am using margin 0 auto

10670975
hide	show
if this is the only h2 with an anchor tag in it on the page then i would add the jquery hide and show methods to the script

10671018
int	chars
for example with 128-bit simd you can process 16 bytes per instruction or 4 32-bit int per instruction and chars might be 4 times faster because of this alone

10671052
put	get
i mean it s ok to have a comment with a simple text but if you want to put complex info there like i showed in my example with sub-fields like author copyright license it is easy for third party programmers to get those node objects

10671102
getter	setter
every thing else is fields constructor getter and setter

10671102
getter	setter
each field has a getter and a setter

10671102
getter	setter
there are no more methods than the getter and the setter

10671102
getter	setter
1 field per each getter setter method pair

10671102
entities	entitymanager
now when i have a customer which i build out of three entities address phonenumber and person the customer can instantiated through finding the other three entities in the database with the entitymanager

10671169
rss	feed
have you considered an rss feed or several

10671249
folder	directory
assuming you are using a recent xcode and haven t configured it to save build files in your project directory you should be able to place your project directory in your dropbox folder

10671256
setinterval	clearinterval
i want to execute clearinterval function automatically after removing div which containing setinterval function and this div is the result of ajax response because it don t stop itself after removing the div

10671282
portrait	landscape
clearly this does it if the user is currently holding their device in portrait orientation and thus presumably your shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation is set up for landscape only and this routine will shift it to landscape if the user s holding their device in portrait mode

10671307
setinterval	settimeout
rather than use setinterval to schedule the animations use the completion callback of the last animation to trigger the next cycle with a settimeout if necessary

10671316
vim	textmate	vim	gedit	textmate	gedit
but you should stop trying to use vim as if it was gedit or textmate or whatever other editor you are used to

10671352
pop-up	dialog
you can use the filereference.browse to get a dialog system pop-up to choose a file

10671355
implements	extends
you can use labelitemrender as is or extends it to implements your custom labelitemrenderer

10671379
post	put	post	get	put	get
additionally actions performed on those resources identified by the uri are determined based on the specific http method used in the request get post put delete etc

10671379
post	put	post	get	put	get
in other words any language or platform that can make http requests and can send get post put delete requests can be used to extend or build upon your api

10671390
google-chrome	firefox
let me see if i understand this correctly the ajax data comes back correctly formatted only in google-chrome firefox and even then only if you email the json to yourself

10671450
libusb	pyusb
it requires libusb and pyusb

10671490
put	get
get rid of the 8080 in the curlopt_proxy setting and put the curlopt_proxyport value in quotes

10671610

the response headers keys sent back when i make a request are date content-length content-type charset connection server

10671620
put	get
simply put i want to access the individual keys and values of item in swig but i can t get json.parse to work

10671674
width	height
at this point you would probably want to set a fixed width and height to the ul that holds all of these list items and place them at 0 0 with regards to their parent

i have thought about emulating the nsstring initwithformat functionality by stepping through each chars of the format string finding any chars starting with and somehow using a switch statement to append the correct type to a nsmutablestring but this seems overly complicated some format specifiers are more than 1 chars signed 16-bit int hi and the function should take into account positional specifiers such as 1 etc

i need to be able to target one of the layouts xml file and update the textview and imageview on it

10678973
width	height
the addition of a s scroller component wrapping the vgroup will give you the scroll bars essentially the way this works is you set the size on the s scroller to the size you want to visible can be a percentage like 100 width height of the view container then you set no explicit size on the vgroup the vgroup will expand to have a height equal to the height of all the components nested in it plus any padding plus the gap space the scroller will take care of figuring out how big the scroll tab button should be and adjust the scrollrect on the vgroup for you essentially it s going to work like magic

10678973
width	height
if you don t constrain the scroller s height and width it will not work as it doesn t have a defined region to draw in and will just become as large as it s children the nested components

at this point it is not finished because for my version of angstrom distribution 2010.x uclibc is not default library built by bitbake but eglibc is built

10692568
x86	64bit
the extractimage interface bb2e617c-0920-11d1-9a0b-00c04fc2d6c1 on a 64bit os is only accessible from 64bit applications because explorer is 64bit thus resulting in a class not registered exception from hresult 0x80040154 regdb_e_classnotreg exception in applications compiled as x86

10692640
gtk	cairo
it requires ruby of course as well as the latest ruby gtk bindings and ruby cairo bindings and of course gtk and cairo themselves

10692975
int	chars
some are already mentioned as assigning the chars to the int array

10693057
uilabel	uibutton
your comment says ad uilabel to the toolbar but you then proceed to make a uibutton with a custom view manufsectionlabel

by the way i am using a main class that extends gameview and implements surfaceholder.callback and i already have a game loop thread

10693094
opera	safari
maps api version 3.7 january 24 2012 included enabled canvas street view on ie 9 opera and safari windows

10693173
implements	extends
you should create a class that extends baseadapter using the constructor that takes a list the list of your strings and make it implements spinneradapter

10693176
accessor	properties
you should use a copy accessor when the setter parameter may be mutable but you can t have the internal state of a properties changing without warning - so the judgement as to whether you can stand the value to change unexpectedly is all your own

10693210
portrait	landscape
the image at the external url could be landscape or portrait and i don t wan t to have the image cropped with something like overflow hidden

10693383
subtract	add
i have a working implementation but theres seems to be some thing i m missing since the results i m getting are not precise that is if i add or subtract 20 or so pixels from the width i get the same truncated string..it should be a little more accurate and have a closer cut

10693390
flyway	liquibase
configure the db migration tool to run on application startup both flyway and liquibase support this through their respective apis

10693390

10693433
post	put
http authentication is generally eschewed in favor of either an http put or post request over https usually fortified with some kind of cross-site request forgery csrf prevention measure or an oauth2 strategy which typically defers the issue to the authentication broker s implementation

10693553
udp	tcp
if you re asking if tcp can be implemented in udp the answer is no

10693553
udp	tcp
first tcp packets and udp packets have an incompatible format

10693553
udp	tcp
second tcp and udp have different protocol numbers seen in the ip header which means that tcp traffic destined for a udp port would not be passed to the correct upper-layer protocol

10693570

i thought of extends the outputstream class and implements my own outputstream.write method

10693583

please note that https ssl was not designed to work on shared-ip hosting such as gae so there are some ssl extensions that have various support on browsers sni vip

10693749
post	get
it sounds to me that you re expecting a get request but by default a form will result in a post request

10693752
median	percentile
etc then reservoir sampling is a reasonable way of estimating percentile median from an arbitrarily long stream of numbers

10693752
median	percentile
finding the median or any percentile is then a straight-forward matter of sorting the reservoir and polling the interesting point

10693753
free	malloc
free malloc pair to resize buffer i am afraid may lead to fragmentation and reserving memory before hand creates other problems

10693771
rss	feed
i tried to implement rss feed following this simple explanation from cake book

10693942
min	max
i ve tried assuming a sched_fifo or sched_rr priority class to get the min max values which gives me valid min max values and i don t get the invalid argument error but the function loop output is not in the prioritized order it is instead in whatever order the function happened to get called to be expected if no priority was set

is there a more portable way to set a thread s priority or grab the valid min max values

free	malloc
use free and malloc

10694067
free	malloc
so use free and malloc

10694585
getter	setter
i have then set the related class to the class in which i would like to display the tableviewcell then linked my getter setter to the tableviewcell and the uiwebview inside the tableviewcell

10694679
min	max
but then in the question referred bsd give max and min 0 and 99 even in case of sched_other didn t understand why but one thing is clear it is not a very portable and to rely on its exact value will not help

10694704
google-chrome	safari
i tried the solution in distinguish google-chrome from safari using jquery.browser but it doesnt work

10694713
dictionary	map
better yet you could use generics and denote the types of the dictionary key value at declaration of the map

basically i have a resources folder that s not in the root directory of one of the sites it s inside another directory but i d like a symlink in the root so that it appears to be both in the root directory and in that other directory

10694834
implements	extends
rather than extends wrappersimpleapp your main class should implements the org.tanukisoftware.wrapper.wrapperlistener interface

10694849

maven	pom.xml
you can do it in the same way you normally tell maven to run from a pom.xml that s somewhere else the -f option

10695337
width	height
when you call new image you reload it and set width and height when the load event fires

10695337
width	height
a simple solution would be to just grab the width height directly from img.width and always run the plugin on window.onload

10695356
filtering	grouping
if you have many more rowkeys you could consider execute these via tpl which now makes sense given there s no table scan either as single rowkey per filtering or grouping into ranges or filtering list

10695375
hide	show
so as an example if there are no products within the price range of 10 - 20 then hide the 10 - 20 on the left panel since it s irrelevant and it just show an annoying no matches found message to user

post	put	post	get	put	get
pragmatically speaking rest uses the http protocol to create read update and delete crud resources that are addressable by a url using http post create http get read http put update and http delete delete

10695936
post	get
more theoretically rest means representational state transfer in which representational refers to the representation of a resource the content of a get or post request or response that is sent or received in a http request and the fact that by doing a request you are transfering the state of a resource from client to server or vice-versa

10695936
