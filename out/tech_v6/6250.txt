subtraction	addition
the carry-in bit is used to implement subtraction via addition and this bit helps to get correct values of the carry-out and borrow-out bits

12700572
subtraction	addition
basically i implement typical cpu-like addition and subtraction with the carry flag in the status register

12700572
division	modulo
so it does both division and modulo and does them in a typical cpu-like way like the x86 div instruction

12700582

12701404
portrait	landscape
for coming to images with the size 480x800 have different look in portrait and landscape

12701454
int	chars
that means sprintf will never receive a chars -- a chars will always be promoted to int before sprintf receives it and a short will as well

12701454
int	chars
yes since what sprintf is receiving will be an int you can use x to convert it to hex format and it ll work the same whether that value started as a chars short or int

12701454
16-bit	64bit	int	chars
beware one point though if your chars is signed and you start with a negative value the promotion to int will produce the same numerical value which normally won t be the same bit pattern as the original chars so for example a chars with the value -1 will normally print out as ffff if int is 16-bit ffffffff if int is 32 bits or ffffffffffffffff if int is 64bit assuming the typical 2 s complement representation for signed int

12713111
uicollectionview	uitableview
let s call a uitableview tv and a uicollectionview cv to clarify the following explanation

12713111
move	drag
i am basically trying to reproduce the drag drop of the tv but i am not using the edit mode the cell is ready to be move as soon as the long press gesture is triggered

12713131
hide	show	portrait	landscape
use media queries to test the orientation in the portrait stylesheet hide everything and show a message that the app only works on landscape mode

12713149
int	double
an int for x and an int for y or should i use a double

12713189
width	height
i suggest you use avg w h 2 where w and h are the width and height of the search area

12713214
laravel	codeigniter
if i m not mistaking laravel s bundles should be similar to codeigniter s hierarchical mvc triads

12713214
laravel	codeigniter
i have a project built in codeigniter and i want to migrate it to laravel so i m trying to match some functionality

12713217
unix	solaris
as for my understanding local-loop in solaris do have tcp fusion enabled somewhat similar to unix domain sockets to reduce overhead of stack usage

12713223
sqldatasource	objectdatasource	sqldatasource	linqdatasource	linqdatasource	objectdatasource
the data source controls that provide built-in support for sorting are the linqdatasource objectdatasource sqldatasource and accessdatasource controls

12713240
websphere	ibm
how can i create a message queue without using any message queue softwares like ibm websphere mq

12713264
gmail	hotmail
it is working fine for other mails like gmail hotmail and yahoo

12713313
put	get
to get put s to work again in windows server 2012 and iis8 you need to remove webdav publishing from iis

12713314
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but in ie it only loads about 20 pixels in ie

12713316
clang	llvm
i had to get all the pieces to clang which relies on llvm and compile with vs2010

12713336
hash	md5
i m using os x so i have a md5 program that functions sort of like md5sum in linux though it puts the hash at the end of the line instead of the beginning

12713357
ssl	https
i want to implement my web app in ssl so it show https and have secured site icon

12713384
hmac	md5
nicely executed tool at showing hmac using md5 and sha1 sha256 sha384 sha512

12713396
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the drag and drop functionality for this method only works with google-chrome firefox and safari

12713397
submit	submission
and yes my form submission for all the other non-file-upload fields work fine with my submit action

12713408
for-loop	loops
in any case since i had to loops backwards i ended up having to write a for-loop that started at the end of the collection and worked its way forwards

12713414
prng	random
a generator that produces the same random-looking output for the same input is called a pseudo random number generator prng

12713429
int	double
if you need only integrals - use int if you need more precision use non-integrals double takes more space in memory and since you don t have any specific requirements concerning precision float seems to be the most reasonable choice

12713438
udp	tcp
for a programming project in school we have to design a basic client server setup using tcp protocol and then udp protocol

12713473
post	get
the problem is that the get method is simply passed as another param and not actually as a method so it resolves to a post

12713474
implements	extends
the id is then provided to the class that extends org.hibernate.service.jdbc.connections.spi.abstractmultitenantconnectionprovider which implements the method connectionprovider selectconnectionprovider string tenantidentifier and must return a c3p0 connectionprovider object to use

12713477
min	max
as noted you need to iterate over the list accumulating the min and max values as you go

12713477
min	max
you need a means of iterating over the loop and tracking the min and max values seen as you go

12713477
min	max
that leads to a min 3 and max 3 thus

12713477
min	max
here your public api predicate accepts a non-empty list seeding the min max accumulators the worker predicate uses with the head of the list then calling the worker predicate with the tail of the list

12713487
width	height
and then construct appropriate width and height measure specs and lay out mview before trying to query for the dimensions

12713531
min	max	aggregate-functions	sum
anytime you use an aggregate-functions sum min max .

12713544
folder	directory
in your solution explorer go to the xml file set copy to output directory to copy always or copy if newer this will put a copy of the xml file in c dev source project1 bin debug and have your program reference the version that is in the same folder as the exe

12713549
put	get
please tell me how to override the get and put methods yet still retain the other behaviour and functionality of this class

12713588
circleci	jenkins
that said there is a growing number of open-source jenkins or cloud-hosted circleci tools that might be worthwhile for you to look into

12713600
fflush	gets
i don t think hibernate gives any guarantees that the session created in your beforedelete handler will be fflush before the posting object gets deleted

12713612
kerberos	ntlm
because the credential type is set to windows that causes the security negotiation to check in kerberos if you are in a domain or in ntlm if it s a workgroup environment

12713624
dictionary	map
had to use integer so that it can be determined if there is no match when checking the dictionary map trygetvalue of suffixs in which case it ll be null

12713636
hide	show
since i m already using javascript to show or hide the elements i decided to use it to set the alignment as well

12713649
put	get
if your class has a defined interface in which put and get methods are defined then you may want to try to proxy the class

12713656
put	get
what are you planning to do with the get and put methods by overriding

12713694
ready	each	versioning	upgrade
that way you can just share the change scripts and each apply them when you are ready to upgrade the app versioning

12713695
portrait	landscape
my app supports portrait landscape left and lansdscape right orientation but in some places of the app i only support portrait

12713706
pop-up	dialog
i want to make spinner on android api 7 and higher which looks like this i don t any pop-up dialog things

12713717
apache	nginx
for production you need to run python manage.py collectstatic and then have your frontend webserver nginx apache etc. serve the directory at static_url

12713755
folder	directory
the book1.xlsx file has inside a cell which refers hyperlinks to some share directory i.e nhstxx1 test ms office excel - servername folder other folder

12713783
uitapgesturerecognizer	uibutton
uitapgesturerecognizer and uibutton are not working together

12713783
uitapgesturerecognizer	uibutton
uibutton alone is working fine without uitapgesturerecognizer

12713790
cos	sin
my code passes an angle in radians to the cos tan and sin

12713801
ubuntu	linux
i m using python 2.7.3 on a windows 7 64-bit machine currently also developing in linux 32 bit ubuntu 12.04 and am having odd difficulties getting python to communicate with the command prompt terminal successfully

12713804
folder	directory
i also created a .bin folder as another idea and put it under webapps directory for tomcat and modified the server xml like so

12713830
cos	sin
see these graphs of sin cos tan to see what i mean remembering that pi 2 radians is 90 degrees

12713851
pull	push
you can push and pull data from the console apps to the signalr server which can then in turn can act as a proxy to the browser clients

12713861
libs	buildpath
i wondered if it would still be possible to load all the resources into a jar i added the res folder to my buildpath and used jarsplice to add my libs and natives however the jar will not run because it cannot find the images

12713909
folder	directory
i want to get latest version from a directory projects name recursive and place it in a local folder d destination

12713938
hash	md5
i don t think storing the md5 hash value as a byte array will help much when i need indexing

12713971
width	height
if i use the original width and height than the video is with sound but when i use w 2 and h 2 the output file is without sound

12713990
gson	jackson
i am currently considering using jackson or gson but i am unable to find any concrete examples or tutorials to get me started

12714000
pop-up	dialog
if you want to scroll nothing other than the contents in the pop-up box why not have your pop-up use a 100 w x 100 h overlay like a jquery ui dialog does in modal mode

12714032
versioning	upgrade
if i deploy the code above and then we upgrade the global versioning to the not-yet-written 1.2.0 my script will be stuck running 1.1.7

12714130
google-chrome	firefox
i have a bug in the rendering of border-radius under all major browsers tested ie 9 google-chrome firefox

12714134
persona	browserid
the faq recommends i don t do local verification of browserid persona security assertions however i ve never been good at following instructions

12714162
for-loop	arrays
since you have multiple associative arrays within an outer arrays each item in your for-loop is one of those associative arrays that corresponds with the json object enclosed in braces

12714198
post	get
this will get you the post that appeared between august 15-20 2012

12714215
width	height
one possible solution would be to check the image s width and height properties to determine whether it is valid or not

12714219
ubuntu	centos
why the libuuid and the libfreebl3 are listed on the centos box but are not listed on the ubuntu box

12714236
put	get
demandware application periodically invokes the request to webservice to get put the message from mq queue

12714249
gif	png
the formatname can be either jpg png or gif

12714258
temp	tmp
the temp folder can then be found by adding .. tmp

12714289
istream	getline
that s how it works you probably want to use std getline std istream std string of std getline std istream std string char

12714289
istream	getline
edit others suggesting istream s getline are also right

12714315
hash	salt	put	get
i would like to put some salt on the hash before sending it in order to get a cyphered string representation of the file hash before sending it

12714318
decoder	encoder
you are better off using another base 64 encoder decoder such as the one found in the apache commons codec - which seems to have the best api available to me

12714419
vbscript	vba
basically the issue is that vbscript wanted a true parameter list and didn t like that i was trying to set the values based on the name of the param like it was in vba

12714419
vbscript	vba
i am trying to move some code over from vba to vbscript and am having some trouble with the publishobjects object when trying to export an excel range to html

12714454
put	get
one good practice is to create a class called utils.h utils.m and put methods like getmodel there so you can get this info from anywhere in your app simply by importing the class and invoking

12714470
width	height
width height of canvas

12714526
springsource	grails
third i ve found that using a grails ide such as intellij or springsource really adds a lot of stability to the grails development environment

12714573
implements	extends
class b extends implements c

12714573
implements	extends
b is a special obj since b is extends implements c

12714573
implements	extends
so a pojo should not have to 1 extends prespecified classes and 2 implements prespecified interfaces

12714573
getter	setter
javabean is a example of pojo that is serializable has a no-argument constructor and allows access to properties using getter and setter methods that follow a simple naming convention

12714573
stateless	stateful
it means it has the code for business logic but how this instance is created which service ejb.. this object belongs to and what are its special characteristics stateful stateless it has will be decided by the frameworks by using external xml file

12714573
getter	setter
these java objects are simple and come up with default constructor getter and setter

12714573
getter	setter
these pojos java class will have only states instance variables of each column and its getter and setter

12714602
int	double
to be an int double etc

12714613
innodb	myisam
i first looked into the differences between the myisam and innodb storage engines

12714627
titlebar	window
if you use the default frame type chrome you get a window with a native titlebar but no customization option

12714663
subtract	add
this on the other hand subtract numbers that are multiples of three of the primes once more than necessary -- so you have to add that count to the end

12714671
rss	feed
you wrote a method which generates rss feed with articles

12714679
ienumerable	ienumerator
what does foreach use if a collection or list implements both ienumerable t and ienumerator t

12714692
textview	imageview
you can use the textview for the same purpose but if you want to use the same with the imageview then you have to create a class and extends the imageview then use ondraw method to paint the text on to the canvas

12714705
portrait	landscape
if the app is in non-snap view or filled view landscape or portrait

12714736
actionscript	mxml
so in mxml or actionscript statements you should use the camel case versions of the style names

12714752
width	height
you could essentially create a blank div on top of the inputs and declare a width height for them

12714773
restkit	asihttprequest
there are also other kits such as asihttprequest abandoned but used widely now also restkit etc

12714776
pop-up	dialog
on the same page but separate from the form i have a button that pop-up a jquery modal dialog box

12714779
post	get
we can help troubleshoot this if we can get a link to the page that is breaking please post it here or file a ticket at

12714814
ienumerable	ienumerator
also notice that this is not a requirement for collection to implement ienumerable ienumerator in order be used in foreach loop

12714878
glut	glew
recently i have switch to c++ and visual studio and i am having a really hard time getting a project to compile using opengl glut and glew due to missing reference errors

12714878
folder	directory	glut	glew
some tutorials tell me i need to download the projects for glut glew and run them that didn t work some tutorials tell me i need to add a .dll file to my win32 folder others say just put the header files in the same directory as your project and some say i need to install these libraries in to visual studio itself not just to my project

12714904
serializable	deserialization
is it possible to somehow emulate this for your code so that you can dump it to disk and later on resume it without bothering to write serializable deserialization methods

12714924
google-chrome	firefox
as already mentioned by others this will work fine in google-chrome firefox but unlikely in ie

12714926
submit	submission
to be more specific in eclipse i would set debugger at the beginning of the controller and when submission the form by hitting a input submit button eclipse debugger will not trigger and i will see array index out of bound error in console

12714992
folder	directory
is it just the rails way to keep folder directory a small depth for this reason

12715009
jgit	egit
jgit gets a lot of use and stabilization work as it is the foundation for egit eclipse git integration

12715049
width	height
removing the height of the #menu div and specifying a width as you have done will cause the content to wrap and be displayed on a new line

12715049
width	height
alternatively specifying a width and a height will cause the content to overflow and a scroll bar to be added

12715054
r-tree	quadtree
on the other hand the wikipedia article on r-tree seems more specifically targeted towards mapping than the k-d tree or quadtree

12715068
onresume	onpause
you will be notified when your app is no longer visible via the onpause method and when it becomes visible again via the onresume method

12715165
nstextview	nstextstorage

12715167
triples	tdb
i am using jena apis to insert and update triples in jena tdb

12715188
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in firefox and in google-chrome

12715242
width	height
i want each of the internal grids to size to the actual height width of the usercontrol they live in like tiled pages won t need any scrollbars and will eventually be applying easing effects states to each of the scroll positions

12715275
hide	show
i also use this method to hide or show toolbar buttons depending upon the situation for example in inline editor mode the save and cancel buttons should only be visible while a row is in edit mode so when the user selects a row in the grid and clicks the edit button the hidden-by-default save and cancel buttons are show and the other buttons are hidden

12715311
rss	feed
are you willing to shut down your rss feed

12715311
rss	feed
we use it for free versions of our wp software with an if-statement so they can t hook into their rss feed to link to their main website it s an upsell opportunity for us it works well is my point haha

12715321
outputstream	inputstream
after that i do some stuff with inputstream and outputstream is taken from socket object

12715321
outputstream	inputstream
but i don t really understand inputstream and outputstream so much

12715323
aggregate-functions	sum
null values are ignored in the aggregate-functions sum

12715325
put	get
i get this error whether i put the jquery .ajax call in a or not

12715329
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
also rather than making a second arrays you could use a regular for-loop to loops through the values

12715408
outputstream	inputstream
inputstream and outputstream are two completely separate streams

12715416
put	get
more edits i get the same exact error when the folder does not exist and after i put if back into hdfs

12715428
button	checkbox
presumably item.findcontrol delete is returning a button not a checkbox

12715435
pop-up	dialog
a simple modal pop-up div or dialog box can be done by css properties and little bit of jquery.the basic idea is simple

12715499

normally i d just use pdo s prepare statements and execute them but i m unsure how i d go about sanitizing user input with db query without having to sanitize each individual variable

12715510
super	extends
this might be helpful to know about what is pecs producer extends consumer super

12715757
put	get
would you like to get all data from a table in the database and put in an array after that i would like to display the data in column 2 when the value of column 1 is equal to the value i determine

12715760
outputstream	inputstream
it uses its inputstream 2 to read from the network and its outputstream 3 to write the same data back across the network to your client which reads it again via its inputstream 4 completing the round trip

12715763
post	get
so the user will be logged for dashboard so i am thinking i could get the post url based on the currentuser id and echo it on the page

12715763
post	get

12715763
post	get
so thinking i could somehow get the post url based on this display name or another object i could query

as you can see guid 31955 is actually a parentitem i need to bring in all the children of this parent item within the same query

12715765
children	parent
so is there a way to combine these two queries together i only want to return fixed amount of rows using row_number function however those returned rows sometimes contain a parent item i would like to return the children for those parent items as well within same query

12715775
punctuation	words
i need to replace all words with 3 or more letters with the words thing while retaining capitalization and punctuation

12715785
post	get
this way you get both the post which were later than 3 months ago and the post which were posted on postdate

12715832
uiview	subviews
two advantages to this system it s built into uiview and you can use the parent view s viewwithtag method to find a particular subviews though that s somewhat risky due to the fact that tags aren t unique by default and nothing prevents you from assigning the same tag to multiple subviews

12715848
children	parent
i am trying to create a binary tree of processes in which each parent is connected to its two children through pipes

12715864
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox

width	height
a second way would be to do all the font measurements yourself based on the shape s width height and then set the font scale to the appropriate percentage

12715999
dictionary	map
map two lists into a dictionary in python

12716008
width	height

maven	m2e
the lifecycle mapping was introduced by m2e so that eclipse knows what to do with your maven plugin if you are building in eclipse

12716043
serializable	deserialization
in particular serializable and deserialization may fail unexpectedly if there is data using enums that aren t yet expected by the particular client

12716049
min	max
put your 480 square panel in the center and set its min max and preferred size to 480

width	height
i think you ll get those zoomed out width and height attributes if you try to access image.width and image.height

12716104
ramaze	camping
depending on the purpose of the exercise you might want to consider using a very simple web framework like camping sinatra or ramaze

12716104
thin	webrick
you might want to omit the framework and try to build something on top of rake an api for lots of popular web servers and a simple web server like webrick or thin

12716106
apache	nginx
how to deploy puma with nginx or apache is this possible or it s not necessary to use a web server like nginx or apache

12716108
accessor	properties
you could create a simple wrapper with a single object properties to clean it up a little and then you would get memory management from the properties accessor

12716226
google-chrome	firefox
in photoshop the images are naturally the same color since one is a slice of the other even in dreamweaver it appears the way it should only in firefox and google-chrome i didnt test any other browsers does the cta image look a few shades lighter

children	parent
each process must get input from its children and pass it to its parent

12716277
post	get
i couldn t get coreyward s solution to work but editing config application.rb as per this devise post and adding

12716292
rvm	bundler
fyi i eventually solved this by uninstalling everything from postgresql and the pg gem right down to bundler homebrew and even rvm before installing every piece again one at a time

12716312
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout should be setinterval

12716314
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
- bool shouldautorotate of uiviewcontroller under any container like uinavigationcontroller will not be called from ios6

12716322

12716415
uiview	subviews
this works fine for a simple uiview but as soon as i add subviews i have a problem

12716419
ubuntu	linux
i m running 64-bit linux ubuntu 12.04 if it matters

12716509
int	double
the function uses an int internally but returns a double so it s not clear whether this is constrained to int

12716520
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your windows versioning

12716527
sorting	filtering
if you wanted this sorting functionality to automatically apply to everywhere the_tags is used you could wrap the relevant code above in a plugin and add a wordpress filtering on the_tags

12716560
config	ini
you define custom shebang config in an ini to use pypy

12716565
width	height
for example the canvas would get a width of 500px to match the container and the height would automatically be set to 357px which keeps the same aspect ratio

12716586
opera	firefox
ideally we could just load firefox or opera into kiosk mode with a screen locker but after two days of struggling i have not been able to get this too work

implements	extends	super	implements	super	extends
no the left hand side can be any super class or interface that the right hand side object extends or implements

put	get
this would only be one call to mongodb to get all of the items and you could put the res.render call inside of its callback

12717027
put	get
second if you want to get really ambitious you can put the encryption into for one example a codecvt facet so you can automatically encrypt all the data as you write it to a stream and decrypt it as you read it back in

12717100
hide	show
on this event capture the values loop through your markers on the map and if some property of your marker falls within the slider s values show it otherwise hide it

12717100
hide	show
on your filter s change event you loop through these markers that are already on the client and show or hide them based on the filter no call to the server necessary unless the user navigates the map again then on idle you can make another call to the server and retrieve points again in the bounding box but that also match your filter criteria

for-loop	loops
shiffman shows this with a while loops and shows a similar code snippet with example 6-6 with it in a for-loop similar to the previous answer

12717858
children	parent
i should not need to know the id of data s parent to access its children

12717868

12717951
portrait	landscape
ios6 rotation issue from landscape to portrait mode

12717961
jndi	jta
if you start to include database connections in this you should perhaps instead grab the jta transaction manager from the weblogic jndi repository and inject it as p transactionmanager propery on the dmlc as the session transaction only supports one resource transactions

12718163
rss	feed
i create a connection with the podcast s rss feed with a url of the form

12718183
min	max
then you can change it s values the first number is the date in utc the second is the min and the third is the max

12718195
rss	feed
well the rss feed presumably contains urls that are the links to the articles so it presumably boils down to what you mean by read

12718203
hide	show
obviously your first thought might be to use a plain text entry field however the user has the ability to show or hide repeatedly at will

12718231
put	get
the problem here is that if i put the exported attribute as false i am not able to get the activity called from the outside intent which is supposed to trigger the activity via onnewintent

12718277
int	double
wouldn t work since one list may contain int and the other may contain double

12718369
draggable	droppable
i m using ember latest and jquery.ui s draggable and droppable

12718592
subtraction	addition
for addition subtraction it simply performs arithmetic starting from the least significant register and then carries the status bits over to the next significant register

12718592
division	multiplication
it can get a bit more complex with multiplication division but the main downside is performance

12718599
hide	show
mouseover events such as image changeing and show hide divs on mouseover aren t working anymore..

12718600
qmainwindow	qwidget
you don t need to subclass qwidget qmainwindow but the qtcreator assistant for creating new projects and new ui files does so

12718600
qmainwindow	qwidget
if you would simply instantiate a qwidget qmainwindow and add behavior from outside by connecting to signals of the widgets you need to create from outside those instances could have different behaviors which is clearly not what we understand by object oriented design

12718601
queue	fifo
queue are fifo fifo and stacks are lifo last in first out

12718630
children	parent
child type and it results in all parent documents that have children

google-chrome	safari
however federico viticci has posted an interesting hack that will allow you to call safari from google-chrome for ios

12719012
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
hyperlinks in other apps can be opened in safari using openurl see other answers but there is no scheme for mobilesafari itself which you would need if you were to open a link in safari using a hyperlink in google-chrome or opera for ios

12719015
getter	setter
it seems the .contents only works as getter not setter as you imply with .contents postcount see the api reference

12719025
accessor	properties
of course you could make the ean2an_type a class feed it in 8 bytes then have properties accessor that do the shifting shenanigans for you as well

12719043
google-chrome	firefox
i ve created some transitions for my web pages so that the site smoothly moves from one page to the other and this is working with no problems on google-chrome and firefox

12719069

the line will allow the www-data group to have access to sudo sbin shutdown without the need for a passwd - so make sure that your web-accessible script isn t public

12719098

if you installed ack known as ack-grep in debian ubuntu you could simply run ack -l --cc main from usr and you d get your result

12719154
integer	unsigned
this program will output the unsigned integer value from that string in uppercase hex for checking d2029649

12719160
eventlet	gevent
eventlet appears to do more of the bookkeeping that the hub is doing in gevent

12719160
eventlet	gevent
notably the header parsing in gevent is deferred to the standard library whereas they implement it themselves in eventlet

12719165
gtk	cairo

i m want to create an autosuggest field using twitter bootstraps typeahead plugin

12719442
getter	setter
2 access them via getter and setter

12719483
width	height
for example if one button was only 20-pixels square and another was 50 the height and width properties would be different

12719484
google-chrome	firefox
the reason why this works for google-chrome is that it triggers the click event down to the input radio level while firefox doesn t have this kind of behavior

12719504
cassini	iis
cassini and iis not express from vs2012 work fine including localhost and the same projects that fail in iis express

12719507
mvp	presenter
i think mvp falls under the forms view so typically one presenter per form

12719534
mouseup	mousedown
i can get mousedown and mouseup when i do not move the cursor but the instant i move the cursor i don t get mouseup events anymore

12719534

in both mousedown and mousemove handlers to no avail

12719555
width	height
try using the function bitmap.createscaledbitmap bitmap width height filter

12719578

tumblr deletes the meta tag if i try to put it within the post and facebook doesn t seem to recognize tumblr tags like photourl-500 or photoset-500 within the og image tag

12719608
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox but in google-chrome and ie the page gives an error for the code in the else block even if the condition is met and the else is unneeded

12719617
unification	inference
the reason this can happen with types without seeming as obviously absurd as the example with a lambda is because there are two notions of type variables floating around during unification you have variables representing undetermined types which are then identified with other such variables via type inference

12719649
width	height
i need some images only need to be fixed width and height

12719650
mvp	presenter
however the second solution doesn t feel like a good mvp in my belief since it seems to know what the presenter is doing and is just not letting the presenter do what it should do in the onresume method of the first solution

12719660
google-chrome	safari
i m not sure what the alert dialog is supposed to do but i got it to display fine in both safari 5.1.7 and google-chrome 22

12719669
hide	show
you can use jquery to show hide elements of the page

12719689
getter	setter
the objects themselves are simple vos with string and integer properties and their respective getter and setter

12719690
int	boolean
now it turns out that python lets do math with boolean which is what s in vowels gives you and int - true behaves as 1 false as 0 so true + true + false is 2

12719698
hide	show
so i basically check the length of the selected text and based on that i show or hide the context menu

12719731
cpu	irq
no the smp_affinity is a bitmask or cpu list of allowed cpus for this irq

12719731
cpu	irq
for eg if set to 0x1 it will pin that irq to cpu 0 .

12719760
versioning	upgrade
even if you succeed they will leave you with future problems if you need to upgrade the 3rd-party library to a new versioning

12719790
folder	directory
now if i build the application from visual studio it is generating the output in the custom configuration folder under bin directory

12719860
apache	nginx
in your nginx config or enablesendfile off if you use apache

12719860
google-chrome	firefox
i m probably not the best person to discuss the specs in this regard but it seems to me that u+200b should be considered white space according to that when in fact the implementations at least google-chrome and firefox appear to treat them as an unexpected token or part of one causing the syntax error

12719902
post	get
use ajax and send required data using post get method and then set it to the session

12719905
getter	setter
the same could be said about the proposed getproperty function which among other things gives an observer access to the functions that implement a getter setter property

12719917
textview	imageview
so to correct superm s example suppose you have a linearlayout with horizontal orientation that contains two imageview and a textview with

12719917
textview	imageview
you define the textview to have a fixed size and you d like the two imageview to take up the remaining space equally

12719917
textview	imageview
to accomplish this you would apply layout_weight 1 to each imageview none on the textview and a weightsum of 2.0 on the linearlayout

12719921
cassini	iis
note that iis and cassini had no probs with these headers so far i only had this problem in appharbor

12719956
gtk	cairo
cairo - cairo is a drawing library used either by applications like firefox directly or through libraries like gtk to draw vector shapes.

12719998
punctuation	words
first i had to get rid of the punctuation in all of the words

12720086
hide	show
read the record then based on selectedbuttonindex configure the ui to to show hide buttons as you wish

12720092
folder	directory
if you re on a nix box the accepted convention is to use symbolic links to a share a models folder outside your application directory

12720171
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
in my example below i m going to assume your iboutlet is called webview and thus i might advise getting rid of the nsoperationqueue and nsurlconnection and just have the uiwebview load the html for you

12720182
subtract	add
note that the badd and bsub functions simply add or subtract integers respectively

12720247
width	height
you should set it to the height of the view it is contained in same as the width

12720270
hide	show
you need to create a hidden element for each input then use jquery to hide the input show the hidden element and give it the inputs value

12720282
onclick	onsubmit
you usually attach an onsubmit event to the form or an onclick event to the submit button then when that happens you use javascript to read in the form values

12720282
textarea	textbox
edit if you just wanted a 1-line textbox it should be not textarea

12720298
width	height
you can achieve this by creating a jquery function with variables as height and width of the div elements as well as positioning

12720304
multiplying	multiplication
you should not be using the algorithm for multiplication of unsigned integers to multiplying signed integers

12720304
multiplying	multiplication
if you want to multiplying signed integers you can first implement multiplication for unsigned ones using unsigned types

12720408
listview	gridview
now when user launch the app the certain items not single should be pre-selected in gridview listview

creates a list of 123456790 integer lazily takes the remainder modulo 4 of each involving first a check whether the integer is small enough to wrap a raw machine integer then after the division a sign-check since mod returns non-negative results only - though in ghc-7.6.1 there is a primop for that so it s not as much of a brake to use mod as it was before shifts the integer 1 left the appropriate number of bits which involves a conversion to big integer s and a call to gmp takes the bitwise and with i - yet another call to gmp - and checks whether the result is 0 which causes another call to gmp or a conversion to small integer not sure what ghc does here

uilabel	uitextview
b the solution i tried was to use an invisible uilabel that i attached visually not programmatically over the uitextview

12737197
uilabel	uitextview
now the uigesturerecognizer singletap is added to the uilabel and not to the uitextview

12737197
uilabel	uitextview
the problem is that the uitextview can t be scrolled or tapped because the uilabel is over it and becomes an obstacle

12737347
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
anyway in my examples below i m going to assume your iboutlet is called webview and thus i might advise getting rid of the nsoperationqueue and nsurlconnection and just have the uiwebview load the html for you

12737347
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
by the way if you insist on using nsoperationqueue and nsurlconnection you still need an iboutlet for your webview

12737367
google-chrome	firefox
for whatever reason i cannot make it work in google-chrome but when i pull up my website in firefox it does have straight corners

12737371

i am trying to build a module of span8 width and varying height

12737458

if you grep out the lines that start with a tab and uniq that you will have a list of all paths you can filter-branch to remove or you can do something more complicated

12737514

i also want the text auditorium not to wrap onto a new line i would prefer that 13th - get put onto the new line instead i don t want to put n in there because then it would mean it goes onto a new line at that point on bigger screens landscape view

12737522
unsigned	short
another thought is that the use of unsigned char and short might actually be costing you performance

12737583

post	get
how can i get a table that has the column datevalue from dates and the number of post with that date

12738029
width	height
i ended up finding that i needed to float the h1 element left and give it a width of 340 and a height of 100 to match the other half

12738100
margin	height
i m not sure wat you mean by 100 of the height that shouldn t matter but i would just play around with the css margin attribute and assign percentages not pixels to it based on the parent size

12738104
min	max	range	max	range	min
my question is how would i find the range of values from min and max and put the info in a column if seen between solutions but i need to put it in another column

12738113
width	height
you can t return three values name height and width from one method

12738119
min	max	range	max	range	min
all we are doing is getting the smallest value from the column using min the largest value from the column using max and then subtracting the largest value from the smallest value for the range in the third case

12738172
post	get
one thing that didn t get suggested in your post to the forum actually i just checked the post this syntax was actually suggested but i ll leave it here for others in case they don t realize there are two syntaxes is to give the alternate syntax a try

12738190
google-chrome	firefox

i have the allocate and deallocate functions in there and i m getting a malloc error q1 9882 malloc error for object 0x7fff59daec08 pointer being free was not allocated

12738374
children	parent
if the children are float ed their size will not push the boundaries of the parent

12738374
children	parent
if you use display inline or display inline-block the children will be inline as long as the parent can be wide enough to fit them all and they will stretch the parent

12738375
gmail	hotmail
fix in my case i was using yahoo mail aol mail and msn s hotmail and gmail which is standard

12738403
getter	setter
with a method the value cannot be changed unless you provide a setter method as well as getter method

12738403
getter	setter
setter getter class methods are exactly the same as the pros n cons of an instance variable vs

12738403
getter	setter
properties setter getter instance methods

12738403
getter	setter
class setter getter allow for validation and other logic to be executed on each read write

12738403
getter	setter
therefore whether you use a variable or a setter getter depends on your application

12738403
getter	setter
it is the same question as whether you use an instance variable or setter getter property

12738430

12738471
awt	swing
painting in awt and swing

12738483
stdout	stderr
so to capture the error messages we must redirect standard error output stderr into normal standard output stdout which will then be captured by the expression

12738483
stdout	stderr
therefore in this example we redirect file descriptor 2 stderr into file descriptor 1 stdout

12738522
stdout	stderr
nix command generally have two forms of output standard output stdout and standard error stderr

12738522
stdout	stderr
only captures stdout and leaves stderr unhindered

12738522
stdout	stderr
if you want the contents of stderr with this syntax you need to postfix your command with so that stderr is merged into stdout

12738528
cos	sin
in java i m trying to operate on numbers with cos and sin yet i keep getting negative variables can anybody explain why

12738533

post	get
i ll get around to that and post the answer if i find one

12738557
ubuntu	debian
or use a packaged install of mongodb such as for redhat or debian ubuntu which will include a config file path in the service definition

12738593
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval may be your best bet - alternatively settimeout repeatedly resetting itself on ajax success

12738594

if we look to the documentation of istream and ostream we have the following functions

12738628
pop-up	dialog

google-chrome	firefox
this works great in ie and firefox but on google-chrome the page hangs for a good 30 seconds before the print preview pops up

12738780
mouseout	mouseleave
so keeping that in mind just use the jquery mouseleave event instead of the mouseout event

12738842
width	height
create a new class and set the min height and min-width equal to the width and height of the image that you don t want to shrink and add that class to those images

12738853
integer	unsigned
each chess piece is represented on the board via an obviously 8 bit unsigned integer

12738881
addition	modulo
in addition if the div is only used to branch from the modulo and the rest of the results aren t used speculative execution can perform nicely

12738888
int	chars
to start with return value of getchar is chars promoted to int

secondly to convert the input chars to int use something like

12738896
post	get
as per comments op was sending a get request as opposed to a post

12738904
setinterval	settimeout
i d recommend either removing the settimeout line inside of gettime or changing the setinterval to a settimeout to get the ball rolling so to speak

12738923
integer	fractions
the conversion to integer truncates the fractions part

12738975
width	height
firstly you would need to store the x y coordinates and width height of both objects

12738975
width	height
you can get your width and height properties from the image like

12739027
intersect	contains

for-loop	loops
so i suppose my main question is i m running into a wall concerning setting up the for loops underneath running simulation where i need to set up the first for-loop to run the internal for-loop 10 times with each of those 10 iterations of the internal for-loop coming up with random numbers for the range of acceptable results from the query for a random value

12739059

mdpi	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi
android has 4 resolutions ldpi mdpi hdpi and xhdpi and 4 generalized screens sizes small medium large and extra large

12739568
screens	tablet
so you have to make 4 layouts or 3 if you don t plan on supporting tablet since tablet come under the extra large category to support the screens sizes

12739568
screens	mdpi
generally i design mdpi images for a 320x480 screens and then multiply the dimensions as per the above rules to get images for other resolutions

put	get
my tshark out put give me table of ip s and i want to show them in decending order this is my code who get the process output

12739739
getter	setter
in that case the problem is that you ve overridden password -- the implicit zero-parameter getter -- with password pass a one-parameter setter

12739739
getter	setter
you should instead move your setter to and make a getter that always returns nil

12739786
google-chrome	firefox
edit i ve tried this in both firefox and google-chrome

int	double
the runtime difference between the last two methods is unexpected though -- it seems matlab s internals either do not cast the double to int of perform error-checking on each element before doing the actual indexing

12744520
int	double
otherwise we would have seen virtually no difference between the double and int methods

12744520
int	double
matlab converts double indices to uint32 indices explicitly before the indexing call much like we do in the int test

12744520
int	double
matlab passes double and performs the double- int cast on the fly during the indexing call

12744520
int	double
in our explicit conversion test we have to read double indices write int indices and then again read the int indices during the actual indexing

division	addition
next point you re using div which performs a sign check in addition to the normal division

12747555

12747760
mouseover	mouseenter
as for the why - the answer for what is the difference between the mouseover and mouseenter events

for the record i do think that the text on the apple docs re blocks variables here is a bit misleading...the only variables that it mentions as being mutable are the __block function-level variables whereas it says all others can be accessed which i took as meaning read-only i know that both getter and setter are accessors but the context was confusing

if i declare a new tcpclient and networkstream each time i call the send method about 60times per minute the data is sent seperately but thats not a very nice solution

12750214
folder	directory
finally and this is important you need to copy the index.php file .htaccess file and symlink your media skin and js folder to your root directory because they re only available to your subfolder magento base install right now - we need to let your main domain know where to look for magento

12750226

one solution i have seen is to rename roundedvalue to _roundedvalue and make it private and then add public methods to simulate getter and setter with rounding logic overriding setter on var

12750260
post	get
also there s a â â i take it it would be post when you submit your form or get otherwise if i understand your intention right

12750277
for-loop	arrays
of course if you initialized the arrays meaning that you filled the arrays with initial values explicitly using something like memset or a for-loop or a function call or whatever other means you ll get exactly what you expect the value with which you initialized it

12750329

width	height
if you do not specific a height or width it will expand to the proper size automatically i would recommend though you set a max-height or max-width and overflow hidden this is just for scenerios to control where the content came in way too big and over flow hidden will prevent scrollbars

12750596
put	get
you can call a ajax get to retrieve the html and get put it in your div

12750772

you can test this by forcing the listboxitem to be selected by clicking directly on it side-note you should always give it a background even if just transparent so it can receive mouse clicks which it won t if it s null or even just hitting shift-tab to set the focus there back from the textbox

in my experience glut can be very slightly faster than pygame for windowing by comparing glut and sdl

12755970
pyopengl	pyglet
pyglet isn t pyopengl although it is a python opengl implementation

12755975
firefox	safari
css3-mediaqueries.js by wouter van der graaf is a javascript library to make ie 5+ firefox 1+ and safari 2 transparently parse test and apply css3 media queries

12755975
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox 3.5+ opera 7+ safari 3+ and google-chrome already offer native support

12755976
post	get
you could use post instead of get

12756056
apache	nginx
we use to do following in apache but don t know how to do it in nginx

12756062
superclass	subclassing
you can refer to a subclassing by its superclass

12756083
google-chrome	firefox
this works for ie firefox google-chrome properly

12756094
puts	gets	puts	putchar	putchar	gets
the function getchar and gets a character from the console and putchar puts a character to the console

12756125
min	max
i want it to stop at certain limits or boundaries min and max in the x axis

12756131
int	chars
a chars value 0 does not equal the int value 0 on in ascii it has the int value 48

12756142
superclass	subclassing
it also allows you to pass in your superclass to a method instead of the subclassing for example

12756158
keydown	keyup
this all is assuming of course that it is alright if you fire your function in the keydown event rather than in the keyup

12756166
ienumerable	ilist
this is returning an ilist which again is polymorphed into the more general ienumerable because that s all the calling code is going to use

12756166
ienumerable	iqueryable	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	iqueryable
in the case of returning an ienumerable above the types moved from more specific iqueryable and ilist to more generic ienumerable

12756231
integer	unsigned
with 32 bit code your unsigned integer size will be too small after about 47 numbers in the sequence

12756238
int	chars
short byte or chars values may also be used as index values because they are subjected to unary numeric promotion â 5.6.1 and become int values

12756292
width	height
width height seem to always ahve to be set together

12756297
google-chrome	safari
wow64 applewebkit 537.4 khtml like gecko google-chrome 22.0.1229.91 safari 537.4 browser.version

12756313
google-chrome	firefox
but problem is that it opens in a pop up and google-chrome and firefox do block the pop up

12756362
pdfsharp	itextsharp
i m using itextsharp and pdfsharp they seem to not work well without one another

12756400
width	height
a 9th of the size of course means that both width and height is divided by 3

12756426
width	height
width height seem to always have to be set together

12756452
google-chrome	firefox
open the firefox content dialog or google-chrome developer tools and review all your links

12756458
int	boolean
this following set of code is my user defined class and the methods i will be testing are boolean add e e e remove int n void print_from_beginning and void print_from_end

12756477
width	height
i think it s referring to setting the width and height on the element that your targeting rather than in the .ir css class itself

12756542
google-chrome	firefox
also works differently for all main browsers ie firefox and google-chrome

12756561
put	get
you can put any attribute to any tag that you need and access them using selector .attr attr_name to get the value html5 defines some data- attributes to store thing like that

12756563
portrait	landscape
specifically looking at your storyboard i m inferring that your goal is to have one view controller for portrait and another for landscape

12756575
getter	setter
should it handle getter and setter methods or talk directly to fields

12756588
width	height
my generated textures only need to be 64x64 but because i m using my main renderer window width by window height for both it s unnecessarily rendering the webglrendertargets at a much larger resolution

12756612
width	height
i want to able to detect the position as in x y width and height of face s in a given 2d photo

12756630
post	get
the p commandbutton does a post and not a get so it can t use f param

12756645
fieldset	formpanel	formpanel	gridpanel
when i replace the gridpanel with fieldset or other type the formpanel does appear regardless of the bad format

12756664
ubuntu	linux
this is ubuntu linux for what it s worth

12756712
put	get
i know that the enumeration is working because if i put in i get ten for the devcount

12756745
post	get
then you just need to make simple get post calls to the server and parse the returned json in android using classes in package from android library itself

12756791
move	drag
yet another reason this might happen tonight i met the dreaded error and eventually discovered an errant mouse drag apparently move one of my own packages classes into the hierarchy of another

12756804
getter	setter
i am trying to create a property i with the following getter and setter

12756812
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i tested it and work for me in google-chrome ie8 firefox and safari

12756817
getter	setter
you need a backing field if you have any kind of logic in your property otherwise automatic properties are the way to go - currently you are assigning to the property itself which again calls your setter code likewise for the getter - that causes the stackoverflow exception

12756828
typedef	struct
then i went to use some typedef d struct from the library

12756832
post	get
most jsf requests are post s anyway so if you use the path to the jsf page you re intending to handle the post request you can then get the parameter within a managed bean that is backed by that page or get the parameter within the page itself

12756845
getter	setter
the problem in your code is that you specified i in the property which was referring to itself inside the body of getter setter turning to be cyclic effect and eventually stackoverflow error

12756847
for-loop	loops
but just an fyi - since you are learning - you can also do the exact same thing with a for-loop instead of the while loops

12756850
apache	nginx
it is solved via two complementary mechanisms 1 putting rails node behind a dedicated webserver written in c and tested to hell and back like nginx or apache lighttd

12756859
post	get
the response.redirect will make the browser do a get request for the page so if the user hits f5 they ll just redo the get and not post the form again

12756859
post	get
this approach is sometimes called the post redirect get pattern

12756867
subtract	add
if your goal is to convert an arbitrary datetime from utc to local time then it s more complicated because the offset that you need to add subtract depends on the original datetime

12756922
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
why do these 3d css planes overlap in firefox and google-chrome and not in safari

12756922
firefox	safari
safari firefox preview

12756926
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseleave event differs from mouseout in the way it handles event bubbling

12756937
min	max
you can do away with sentinel with a different setting of min and max

12756952
post	get
this way you can still post on their behalf and your app can get certain information from their profile to relay on to them without you ever needing to know their password

12756977
post	get
however when i try to do a get or post to the rest resource i get a - 404 not found error

12756994
typedef	struct
you have a declaration for a typedef to struct sp_session but struct sp_session is an incomplete type

12756995
prepare	execute
you need to execute the prepare statement before calling

12757017
min	max
min length of fishes was 34.5 and max length of fishes was 49.5

12757019
width	height
override methods which control width and height of your custom field

12757117
google-chrome	firefox
broken firefox 14.0a1 2012-04-12 -win7 broken google-chrome 20.0.1096.1

12757147
width	height
also one more problem is when you are in full-screen mode by pressing f11 the popup window is of full width and height as that of screen specifically on mozzila whereas i need that popup of size 600 600 overlapping the main window

12757185
namenode	checkpoint
there s a secondary checkpoint namenode that can you startup and configure

12757185
namenode	hdfs
this will help keep hdfs up and running in the event that your primary namenode goes down

12757187
put	get
and this is the code that i get access and put a string-grid..

12757231
post	get
fyi while asking questions post error log too then only you can get quick and proper answers

12757274
int	double
in this particular case the code won t compile if you try and take a double variable x and assign it s value to an int variable y

12757274
int	double
so you have to explicitly tell the compiler to cast convert the type from a double to an int

12757332
int	boolean
but this only seems to works for functions of type int boolean and not int boolean

12757382
folder	directory
so if your website is in the folder home ec2-user public_html you would then need to give access to that directory

12757403
snmp	mib
here it is defined as an adapted subset of asn.1 structure of management information smi is specified in snmp to define sets of related mib objects

versioning	upgrade	migrate	upgrade
note moreover we have a plan to migrate our website from asp.net 1.1 to 4.0 versioning in future.so it should be that much supportive for future upgrade

12757431
hide	show
the code folding feature is great to reduce a source file to just names of methods but there is nothing that hide common methods between two interfaces and show the differences

12757468
implements	extends
i know that probably get_fields method could become a method of metaclass but this would make inheritance much harder to implements you would have to define both new metaclass and class itself not nice to developers wanting to extends this classes

12757483
superclass	subclassing
however it is subclassing of uilabel and tried to change the color by using condition that it s superclass is uilabel and text is cancel

12757493
disk	ram
this buffer is not ram memory with file s contents copied but it s a virtual memory whose access directly maps to a file on disk

12757563
hide	show
decrease the height of the uitableview works when you want to hide the extra rows and only want to show the specific rows

12757574
gif	png
however how do you upload images gif jpeg png to s3

12757604

ubuntu	linux
i m trying to port an app built with code blocks in linux ubuntu to windows

12757669
post	put
it looks straightforward enough to extract the comments from the dotclear export file and using the post id associate them with the url of the original post and then put that in a skeleton wxr file

12757676
post	get
i dont know how this error comes when i try this lots of times so i saw differnt post in stackoverflow but i doent get solution

12757767

12757867
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on firefox and google-chrome

12757867
mouse	keyboard
the problem is that when a page loads up some of dropdownlists open up by clicking on them they also accept keyboard inputs but some of them don t accept inputs mouse and keyboard at all

12757887
getter	setter
do same whatever you have done foe username make it string instead of boolean in setter method like setter and getter methods

12757892

beanstalk	amazon-web-services
i ve deployed an application to amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk

12757994
int	boolean
in php you can use followed constructions string for string data int and float for numeric data bool for boolean data

12757996
memcached	apc
your question about apc and memcached is not very clear -- what kinds of issues are you concerned with

12757996
post	put
anyway you should not put unrelated questions in the same post

12758014
width	margin
for some unknown reason the container div which has a fixed width and a margin of 0px auto is aligning to the left and not the center of the page

12758035
post	get
so on the post back the grid up to the point you try to get the id from the cell is empty

12758035
post	get
two ways ether give again the data on post back and make databind right after the update or get the index of the grid view to make the update and not take the cell

12758060
piston	tastypie
i recommend to take a look on tastypie which turned out to work even nicer than piston it helps you also with things like versioning your api and mamange multiple endpoints nicly

12758062
cos	sin
c c cos angle c sin angle

12758065
width	height
if you just specify the width the height will be scaled automatically according to the aspect ratio of the original image vice versa if you just specify the height

12758072
width	height
it is only when my website is viewed through a mobile device that i want the categories page to be displayed in conformance with iphone width and height display

12758080
children	parent
when changing data ensure that it is valid at all times insert a parent before its child and delete all children before their parent

12758103
getter	setter
i don t really understand your idea but basing what i understood from your description i d recommend you to look into inline getter and setter on components which would also modify container

12758120
firepath	firebug
also do not forget to verify found locators in firepath firebug addon in ffox

12758161
postgresql	mysql
i am myself trying to find the answer for postgresql but here is what you can do for mysql

12758169
piston	tastypie
update use tastypie instead of piston

12758193
spaces	delimiter
i have the following spaces delimiter input

12758212
post	get
you can directly use wordpress in-build feature to get all post titles

12758213
width	height
when you set height only and not width or vice versa browsers scale the image so that the width height ratio is preserved

12758215
carrierwave	paperclip
i would recommend looking at using something such as dragonfly paperclip or carrierwave to handle file uploads in your application rather than hand-coding this

12758219
children	parent
now say i have a a parent-child relationship and each parent can have like 50 children and the ui requires partial data for all the children also to be shown when the parent is clicked

12758219
children	parent
the other approach is to have a separate api which will give out the parent as well as partial info about the children instead of just the uris

12758277
hash	salt
now if you re using only local cookies and store like a hash portion of the the clients password + combined with a salt that only your server knows a hacker can still gain access to his account by stealing his cookie from his pc

12758286
post	get
if a user does multiple post at once they may get them through since more than one process could read the count both increase their daily_post_count and both store the old value + 1 if they ran after each other they d store old value + 2 in the end not very likely to be a problem

12758295
versioning	upgrade
please upgrade or change your memcached versioning

12758305
junit	testng
which you can use in combination with junit 4+ testng and so on for

12758313
put	get
the problem is solved as i said before my program executed but with an error the problem was the picture directory i ve put it in the source file beside main.cpp the problem is that if u want to get a real result using debug or release mode u should actually put the picture in those two directories and then run make another time

12758317

alternatively you can simply display the rss feed on your site right away using an extension such as rss_display

12758336
textview	listadapter
and listadapter in method getview i m setting textview in asynctask using method settextview of asynctask

12758352
multiplying	multiplication
from the above explanation you can also understand that even in the first assignment if the result of your multiplication of integers before multiplying it with 365l goes out of range then again it will be truncated to fit in integer range or converted to 2 s complement representation if required and then only it will be multiplied with the long value - 365l

12758357
hash	salt
if you only rely on cookies for sessions it doesn t really matter if you use a session id or a hash of the user s credentials plus a salt unique to that user

12758363
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
all those try-catch statements for runtimeexception s like nullpointerexception and arrayoutofboundsexception are normally not needed

12758414
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade mysql to versioning 5.5

innodb	myisam
as i understand it mysql has changed the default engine from myisam to innodb which is now a requirement for joomla 3.0

12758414
innodb	myisam
will my existing databases remain in myisam format or will they be converted to innodb in the process

12758447
innodb	myisam
converted all tables to myisam some including the content table were innodb

12758450
floating-point	integer
while integer multiplication is associative when the operands are all of the same type floating-point multiplication is not associative

12758469

i have been testing the results with the nvvp nvidia profiler

12758498
jar	manifest.mf
the manifest.mf file in the meta-inf folder in the root of the jar file contains the following

12758498
jar	manifest.mf
the manifest.mf in the inner jar file the actual program is empty

12758503
folder	directory
my raw algorithm not yet implemented in c++ takes a lot of time and sometime might fail to search a file so i came up with the decision to search for files in the os file table directory because the location and names of all the files and folder are already present in it

12758516
guava	lambdaj
see for examples of how these closures will be used in the collection apis and how they compare with pre-java 8 solutions like guava and lambdaj

width	height
def reshape self width height

12758570
width	height
self.aspect width float height

12758618
ubuntu	linux
i don t get your question because ubuntu does not introduce new filesystems or other user-space-related things so you can code for ubuntu like you can code for any gnu linux os out there but there are really good utilities already in place like locate and find

12758634
ubuntu	linux
you should be aware that ubuntu is just a distribution of linux and that linux in turn has a standard unix system api often termed posix

12758634
ubuntu	linux
therefore you should better ask search using the term linux or unix or even posix instead of ubuntu

12758637
width	height
i ve tried setting width and height on the canvas attr and css scaling to devicepixelratio backingstoreratio and anything else i can google up -

viewdidload	viewdidappear
setting its size in viewdidload or viewdidappear doesn t work because later on the size will be overwritten by _applyisenginelayoutvalue

12758840
explode	implode
you can use explode + array_chunk + array_map + implode

12758885
int	chars
this is deliberate - it makes parsing simple get chars get int add them both to an array or linked list

12758905
filesystems	hfs
on a hfs filesystems the du command returns the size of the file as if it has not hole in it

12758918
tunnel	vpn
so replace ftp with sftp or better yet only ever access your server via a vpn tunnel to your server

12758944
getter	setter
put jsonproperty cse_image annotation on your image field or on your setter getter if you have and it works

12758983
post	get
so it is working just fine when request type is get but if request is post it just get to infinite waiting until i receive no data received

12758996
children	parent
if the data is ordered so that children of a parent always follow after it s parent you can solve this with one database-query over all data by skipping hidden nodes in the output

12759048
int	boolean
jsf and jstl both access boxed objects boolean int etc directly

12759093
put	get
put it in your index.php to save cookie when page loads - if i get your purpose correctly

12759135
inherited	properties
if container and objects have common properties then you could make a base table item which contains the common properties and your container and object tables which contain only the extra data inherited

12759148
width	margin
playing with css border margin padding and width i came across an extra pixel.

12759148
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
i know that the total width and height of an element is the sum of its width border margin and padding

12759148
width	height	google-chrome	firefox
now let s set a fixed width and height in remove width and height from active in firefox and google-chrome there is one extra-height and one extra-width pixels that move all the adjacent elements

12759166
post	get
i do not have a current solution but looking at other post i can see several examples of how to get the subdomain

12759219
stdout	stderr
in 10.8 they stopped automatically forwarding stderr to the console so might be an idea to pipe the applications stdout and stderr to a file to see if you have a stack trace

12759234
children	parent
so far with the help of other answers here i can get a plist of all the objects but all on the same level or a plist of the ultimate parent object but the children relationship is faulted

12759239
primefaces	richfaces
we are using richfaces but the solution that we used in this case may apply to primefaces as well

12759289
width	height
you also need to set the width and height fields

12759296

12759554
getter	setter
however you can make health private in entity and define a protected getter and setter there

12759559
width	margin	box-sizing	margin
you problem occurs because when you fixed the width for instance at 100px the box with its border will have a width of 100px due to the box-sizing property so your increase of margin is not compensated by a shrinking of the box which occurs when you do not set its width

12759559
width	border-box	width	margin	box-sizing	margin	box-sizing	border-box	margin	border-box
with a fixed width and box-sizing set as border-box you should not modify the margin property at all to avoid the other box moving

12760177
google-maps-api-3	infowindow
if you are using the google maps api v3 and not just google maps as is implied by your tags though you really should add the google-maps-api-3 tag to the post nothing prevents you from having multiple infowindow open at the same time

12760189
primefaces	richfaces
i think you should use primefaces datable they have a really nice out of box datatable with a lot of freatures including lazy loading or you can use richfaces or anyother component suite

you don t appear to actually be assigning the width or height to the canvas itself just the canvaselement object you have wrapping it

12760787
quicksort	mergesort
i have managed to implement insertionsort and quicksort in a couple of lines but selectionsort and mergesort still give me headaches

12760793
mouse	keyboard
this will allow excel to respond to mouse and keyboard input whenever the code hits the doevents command which should be rather often

12760795
children	parent
every invocation of a naive check will succeed since every parent is between its children

12760812

12760812
google-chrome	firefox
but in google-chrome 22 firefox 13 every time a new song begins the player stops playback

12760812
mp3	ogg	google-chrome	firefox
i m thinking this might have something to do with the fact that google-chrome and firefox use the ogg source while ie uses mp3

12760823

12761022
inline-functions	inlining
for the purposes of run-time performance the compiler probably does the right choice in most cases if it can see that a function is too big to benefit from inlining it is likely to generate a non-inlined version of any inline-functions independently of the function being a template or not

12761053
getter	setter
when we are defining getter and setter methods for name in the following code

12761132
cos	sin
the other uses cos instead of sin but is otherwise the same

12761156
public	protected
in addition it is worth to note that replacing the public keyword with protected is perfectly legal and it still works

public	protected
so technically it should be possible to advice protected methods exactly in the same way as public ones

to get around this problem i started to replace jsdom with cheerio however i have now realised it does not fully support the sizzle selectors i need to use to process the scraped data

12761504

now on post back i d like to get each individual lbattributetags selected value

12761532

the thumbnails must have 160px width and 240px height regardless what the actual size of the pictures are.some photos fit exactly after resizing them

12761582
width	height
others because the width is larger than the height doesn t fit properly.that s why i crop them they must be centered in order to make sence

12761627
comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two elements that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the set equals

12761695
post	get
you could use a combination of get and post parameters do achieve what you want

12762047
int	chars
this is why the chars in your third struct is being padded with three more bytes so that the following unsigned int starts at an address that is a multiple of the word size

12762058
super	self
although if you override a member of a self type you lose access to the original member which can still be accessed through super using inheritance

12762060

now we want to configure hadoop in a way that the namenode also as a datanode in this case has a copy of the entire data on hdfs such that the cluster can always recover data from it

12762166
cstdio	iostream
if we re not mixing cstdio and iostream we can turn it off and then iostream is fastest

12762181
width	height
i would declare a fixed height amount but it is going to be a mobile site and each of the images need to have a percentage width which means that the height will change depending on the mobile device

12762235
explode	substr
using substr instead of explode is just for illustrating another way to split up composite values like yours

when i run the program and select libatestplugin.so from the build directory of my library project in the file dialog that pop-up i see no message box which means plugin is null

12763290
stdout	stderr
strangely sox provides its output to stderr and not stdout hence the need for

12763311
udp	tcp
binding is not only used for tcp sockets but for udp sockets as well and other protocols too

12763335
tcplistener	tcpclient
in any event using either tcplistener tcpclient or socket you will need to loop on reading on the stream into a buffer

12763338
postgresql	mysql
several databases on different dbsm postgresql mysql oracle firebird etc

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
tested in ie6 7 8 9 firefox google-chrome safari

12763349
createelement	each
the simplest way to do this would be to make use of createelement and appendchild while looping over an array to create a form element containing a hidden input for each element of the array with a name such as to satisfy the algorithm php uses to populate and friends and then submit the form

12763379
powerpc	i386
the behavior appears to be a legacy of when arch was used to distinguish between powerpc and i386 platforms when intel support was first introduced in os x

12763395
alarmmanager	wakelock
the only effective way to execute something at a specific time is to use alarmmanager with a rtc_wakeup alarm type and a broadcast pendingintent where you do your work completely inside onreceive of the broadcastreceiver if it is short or use a wakelock and a service to do the work or possibly my wakefulintentservice

12763422
comparator	comparable
std map requires that the key be comparable either with or a provided comparator

12763446
post	put
and its friends post put delete head patch are only shortcuts and will fire a request immediately

12763473
hide	show
you hide this widget when collapsing and show it when expanding

12763498
hide	show
when using this in a form i want to advice you to take a look at this page show hide fields depending on select value

12763509
children	parent
in this system every node references at most two other nodes its first child if it has any children and its next sibling unless it is the last sibling of its parent

12763517
calloc	malloc
so you have to define the struct dynamically with malloc or calloc

12763580
domxpath	domdocument
you can use domdocument to parse that xml and get all items using domxpath then loop in all items and get the attributes based on position id 0 name 2 then create an new array that will hold all you item id s with their names

12763598
for-loop	arrays
i ve tried arrays and for-loop but can t get it to work

12763611
int	double
i am trying to split a string up into the farm name then a double acres and finally a int jars

12763631
submit	submission
at the moment it s local to your form submission so it cannot be accesses outside that form submit action

12763631
post	get
also please be aware that mixing get and post data is a very bad habit

12763631
post	get
there should only be get or post data present in a single request not both

12763632
pop-up	dialog
i m also using timeout dialog to set a timer that has a pop-up which will warn people before they are automatically logged off

12763657
google-chrome	safari
doesnt work on android ios native browsers and on google-chrome or on safari

12763706
mouse	keyboard
i prefer to use the keyboard instead of the mouse

12763715
int	chars
well the reason it s there is because windows is forcing it to a size other than it s normal size plus an int number of chars sizes

12763797
folder	directory
the implementation is very slow on a folder containing 50 000 files and 12 000 sub directory

12763800
decoder	encoder
the encoder is just a simple onetooneencoder that encodes an envelope type to a channelbuffer and the decoder is a simple replaydecoder that does the opposite

12763830
textview	imageview
inside the getview i assign relevant information for the textview s and use imageloader class to download image and assign it to the imageview

12763832
rank	percentile
so the equation would be something like 1 3 percentile column1sum + 1 3 percentile column2sum + 1 3 percentile column3sum where percentile is the percentile rank of the column vs the rest of the column

12763832
rank	percentile
in my case percentile is the percentage rank from highest to lowest of a given column adjusted for repeats

12763849
profiling	debugging
i was able to get symbolication back in the device profiling by going to edit scheme in xcode and changing the profiling build to debugging instead of release

12763853
onresume	onpause
put in some code in your onpause method to save your data to a db a file or sharedpreferences and then put code in the onresume method to retrieve that data

12763855
width	height
floated elements are taken out of the document flow and as a result their containers don t know anything about their width or height unless they are floated

12763857
equals	gethashcode
finally the whole method can be made rather simpler without even needing the hasduplicate flag or any overriding of equals gethashcode

12763874
getter	setter
i know i can create empty setter and getter for this parameters but i better not â for the sake of code cleanliness

12763938
put	get
however when i do a put i get the following error

children	parent
any node a that has children is the first node listed in a new graph and this graph is listed in its parent graph in a particular order to be determined later

12764062
children	parent
any node a that has no children is listed in its parent graph in a particular order to be determined later

12764062
children	parent
h is the first child of o but it has no children so it s listed in its parent as-is not as the start of a subgraph oh

12764062
children	parent
h is the second child of o but is has no children so it s listed in its parent as-is not as the start of a subgraph ohh

12764062
children	parent
h is the first child of h but is has no children so it s listed in its parent as-is not as the start of a subgraph o hh

12764062
children	parent
any node a that has children is the first node listed in a new graph and this graph is listed in its parent graph in a particular order see step 4

12764062
children	parent
any node a that has no children is listed in its parent graph in a particular order see step 4

12764067
realloc	malloc
i believe that since the gist of what i want to do is reallocate memory to the same variable i should have looked into realloc instead of malloc

12764083
division	multiplication
the bit cost of multiplication and division of two numbers with n bits is with arbitrary arithmetics o n 2

12764083
subtraction	addition
addition subtraction comparisons and assigning variables are all o n n being the number of bits for arbitrary precision arithmetic

12764085
ubuntu	linux
the issue here is that ubuntu linux has a default blocksize of 1024 not 512

12764137
subnet	packets
you can t sniff packets sent from someone unless you are part of the same subnet - you would have to be connected to the same switch and be on the same virtual lan as that user

12764160
hide	show
hey you can do one thing onload call an action of server side through ajax call into by returning javascript it will never show in your view source but it can be visible by firebug but its a way to sequre your javascript protuct from others to use it in a easy way i have done it one of my project even by this method you can hide your html too

12764173
hide	show
what s the best way to hide them make them not show up

12764174
folder	directory
itscurrently in my wedding directory i assume this is correct as the domain start folder is here

12764176
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie 9 and below

12764184
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
box-sizing border-box on all element ensures that width 25 includes padding and borders inside

12764184
children	parent
using font-size 0 on the parent and font-size 16px on the children eliminates the white space caused by line-breaks between inline-block elements

12764195
queue	fifo
i would like to implement a queue capable of operating both in the fifo mode and in the priority mode

background-color	transparency
background-color transparency

12764263
client-side	server-side
you have to distinguish between something you store server-side seen by all users and something stored client-side for every user separately

12764277
subtract	add
basically use dateadd day 0 datediff day 0 date1 to get the date by itself then get the number of milliseconds into that day by subtract the total date by the result of the above computation and add them to the new date

12764315
multiplying	multiplication
the cost of multiplying two int is o 32 2 using a naive multiplication algorithm for better algos look here

12764315
subtraction	addition
as far as addition and subtraction goes i would say that they both have a bit cost of o n where n is the number of bits of the smaller operand

12764341
hash	md5
md5 is considered broken and it is ways too fast to hash passwords

12764349
folder	directory
then you might also use file copy for moving things intot the temporary folder and even file chdir for managing the working directory

12764379
jquery	anythingslider
at start of code is anythingslider that i use on my newest theme at the end of code is jquery code to add css style to my table in themes

12764480
requestfactory	gwt
- requestfactory gwt 2.5rc2 before 2.5rc1 and 2.4 - makes no difference regarding the question

12764499
for-loop	loops
i do not understand why iterating through a container with a for-loop produces different results than iterating through it with a while loops

12764515
for-loop	loops
your while loops is not equivalent to the for-loop

12764544
pop-up	dialog
my application currently consists of an xna application embedded within a form and i have a button to open the preview panel which in theory should pop-up as a form dialog containing the xna renderer to allow me to draw the preview

12764596
google-chrome	firefox
trace.html does not open in firefox try using google-chrome

12764629
int	chars
im currently implementing a rc4 decryption and as this algorithm only operates on numbers between 0-255 i want to write as safe code as possible and properly use unsigned chars variables instead of plain int ones

12764649
integer	unsigned
the standard guarantees arithmetic on unsigned integer types to be arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of value bits in the type so the arithmetic will be correct

12764649
integer	unsigned
unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer

12764649
integer	unsigned
46 this implies that unsigned arithmetic does not overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type

12764655
versioning	upgrade
according to the nice folks at bryntum once i upgrade from the free-trial versioning of the bryntum scheduler i will be able to get rid of the shim and simply rely on the sencha.cfg classpath pointing at the bryntum src

12764686
post	get
it seems to me that model.fetch fires a get request and model.save fires a post request instead

12764686
post	get
how can i get the json object out of the post request fired by model.save so that later json library jsown can be used to parse it

12764693
maven	pom.xml
if your using maven put this in your pom.xml

12764701
for-loop	loops
in your second for-loop you are calling next cloc but loops is initialized as for each cdeptname

12764718
daemons	systemd
i also use a lot and have lots of systemd listening to a common spread daemons

12764723
for-loop	loops
you need to declare your variable outside the for-loop and keep on adding input numbers to it in loops

12764734

12764764
subclass	abstract-class
but urlstreamhandler is a abstract-class and method openconnection is not implement in it so when handler calls this method it should go to find a subclass who implement this method right

12764764
put	get
i googled this class and there is source code online i can get but why they did not put it and many other classes in the src.zip

12764775
restrict	shared
i don t see any reason to restrict it to images or video or something like that but for the life of me i can t figure out how to make it work for any random file some other app wants to shared

12764782
implements	extends
if you then give an instance of a class that extends urlstreamhandler with type urlstreamhandler and call the openconnection method it will call the one you have overriden in the instance of the class that extends urlstreamhandler if any if none it will try to call the one in urlstreamhandler if implements and else it will probably throw an exception or something

12764790
jobs	cron
i ve tought about using cron jobs but it seems messy either by using one cron job every 15 minutes and checking which task needs to be executed or having separated cron entries for each task

12764811
google-chrome	firefox
since i m doing all my work in a linux environment and therefore firefox and google-chrome right now i don t care that it is slower in ie

12764842

int	double
i have a parametric variable in a type class which i would like to represent any of the number types float int double etc

12764919
hide	show
i hide the actionbar why the actionbar still show for a while

12764941
put	get
i googled this class and there is source code online i can get but why they did not put it and many other classes in the src.zip

12764941
subclass	abstract-class
but urlstreamhandler is a abstract-class and method openconnection is not implement in it so when handler calls this method it should go to find a subclass who implement this method right

12764957
post	put
i want to add a widget which requires to put a in the post

12764975
post	get
instead of that you may use a jquery post call and get the data

12764975
post	get
you can determine whether the call is a get call or post call by inspecting the request.requesttype property value

12764986
radiobuttonlist	requiredfieldvalidator
however you can use the radiobuttonlist control instead validated by requiredfieldvalidator

12764987
width	margin
then you first need to give it a known width and then you can center it relative to its parent block element using css margin 0 auto

12764996
post	put
by contrast methods such as post put and delete are intended for actions that may cause side effect

12764996
post	get
if your get request changes the state of the server which it most likely does based on your post you are doing something wrong

12765006
hide	show
after both sides are connected to other widgets android will recalculate size of textview and scroller properly even if you change orientation or show hide soft keyboard

12765040
folder	directory
my tree is representing a directory structure starting from the root folder exercises so i want each node to store the path on the server where the directory structure is stored

12765085
super	self
the super background self .__init__ a b will invoke

12765092
superclass	subclassing
the second issue is that if a method defined in the superclass calls buildfield the subclassing version will be called

12765137
maven	pom.xml
removing the project and re-importing it into eclipse via the maven pom.xml file was not enough to fix the problem

12765144
ffmpeg	libavformat
what you need for this is a media processing framework like ffmpeg libavformat libavcodec libswscale or gstreamer

12765152
fragmentpageradapter	fragmenttransaction
in other words when i know that the viewgroup is no longer in used i would perform fragmenttransaction s somewhere perhaps in the fragmentpageradapter to remove those fragment s

12765192
portrait	landscape
refresh of the home screen from portrait to landscape or vice-versa

12765215
int	boolean
the boolean type is a subtype of plain int and boolean values

12765217
versioning	upgrade
what we need to look for if we have to upgrade from versioning 2.2.1 to 3.4 of primefaces

12765264
punctuation	words
i can t rely on splitting by stop words and or and punctuation

12765312
post	get
i too was running into this issue where post would return absolutely no data but get flowed without error

12765337
memcmp	strcmp
since your data is not null terminated you probably want to use memcmp instead of strcmp

12765347
jax-ws	jax-rs
if you want to continue with the standard java ee stack look at jax-ws soap or jax-rs restful instead

12765348
google-chrome	safari
i encountered same issue on safari and worked on google-chrome and found out two solutions you could take apart indicator into two element parent for position and child for transforming or you could add translatez 0 in transform -webkit-transform rotate 169deg translatez 0

12765406
post	get
in some cases the .htaccess is set to either redirect or block a post which wouldn t catch and block or route a get

12765406
post	get
you mentioned earlier that you were using a hosting provider so ask them specifically what rules they have set up on post requests you ll probably have to wait a bit on hold to get somebody who can actually answer the question or you can test this a bit from the command line with wget

12765417
explode	implode
but don t worry you can use explode and implode functions

12765431
express	node.js
i have a form for editing an object and i want to handle it properly using express 3.x with node.js

12765432
versioning	upgrade
how do i ensure my.class1 and my.class2 retain the obfuscated name of a.a and a.b across builds as i add remove other classes or upgrade proguard versioning

12765440
public	protected
one could use public inheritance is-a and demote those public interfaces to protected or private but this would violate the liskov substitution principle

12765440
public	protected
those public methods become protected or private with protected or private inheritance

12765464
for-loop	arrays
if the arrays are small then a solution with a nested for-loop scaryrawr s is going to perform best

12765488
int	chars
so i want to cast 4 chars i am reading from a buffer to 1 int

12765501
implements	modifiers
is there a modifiers that exists that implements something like this

12765521
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
it has to if you want to be able to read write it using objectinputstream objectoutputstream

12765536
int	chars
note i honestly can t remember if the implicit up-cast extends the sign from a chars to an int or not but if it does and any of the single bytes being or d together here are top-bit-lit you may be in for a surprise if p was not

12765564
range	infinity
but will still cover the whole range extending up to positive negative infinity

12765614
lz77	lz4
lz4 is lz77 family which is a few lines of code but i never did it myself but i guess you are right run length or delta code is the fastest and also good for images

12765624
wordpress	joomla
alternatively you could move your site to a cms like drupal wordpress or joomla and have it automatically create an alias for you

12765688
verilog	vhdl
do either vhdl or verilog have any of these kinds of constructs

12765708
lxml	beautifulsoup
two popular good ones are beautifulsoup and lxml

12765713
typedef	struct
so i did an array of the typedef struct of the elements and was hoping i could start with the first element of the array and point the next to the second element of the array

12765717
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
try temporarily tweaking the sudoers file to allow the arpspoof command to be sudo -ed without a passwd

12765725
uitableview	uipickerview
i ve implemented both the uitableview uipickerview delegates in this view

12765727
int	chars
there are probably more interesting algorithms but this just converts the chars to int and multiplies it by the position in order to weight them so that abc is different than cba

12765734
int	chars
i need to convert an array of number chars to int values in order to perform math operations in c

12765772
int	double
you want int and not in your data structure and the temperature should be a float or double rather than an int which greatly simplifies the input

12765783
int	double
the reason it may loop forever is that the double calculation of account is effectively truncated by casting to int so it may never change if rate is too small and the new value of account isn t made larger by at least 0.005

12765802
post	get
ps i ve been using jquery s .load method to perform get s and post s

12765846
strtol	atoi
also prefer to use strtol over atoi

12765861
istream	getline
i am wondering wtf my while loop which calls istream getline istream is string str

12765904
ready	each
each warp can contain at max 32 threads.the scheduler will try to execute the warps in parallel fashion inside the sm s.if the data for a particular warp is not ready it is held by the scheduler until it is available.now as far as your questions is concerned i believe it is possible to do what you are trying to achieve using cudaevent_t for measuring the execution time of a kernel

12765918
punctuation	words
you would like the pregmatch search to split what you provided in in to 4 categories words characters punctuation and white spaces

12765924
multiplying	subtract
your example appears to have done both - subtract 0x40 from each value and multiplying by 1.33

12765943
addclass	removeclass
i m using addclass and removeclass to indicate which link has been selected and that s working fine

12765986
google-chrome	firefox
use google-chrome or firefox to inspect element s that you like

12766038
width	height
change golbaloffsetx and globaloffsety according to your textbox height and width

12766098
post	get
to be more detailed we first call hunchentoot raw-post-data force-text t to get the post data as a string and then feed it to jsown parse

12766103
draggable	droppable
i m working on a small jquery plugin that mimics the jquery ui draggable droppable behavior with native html5 drag and drop events

12766105
concave	convex
after that you d probably be interested in tessellating those polygons so as to convert them into collections of triangles making the later shadow lighting intersection math a lot simpler the only problem in this case is if you end up with a concave polygon but a decent tessellator should allow you to break it up into convex polygons

12766121
implements	extends	super	implements	super	extends	super	abstract
i m working on an assignment where i m trying to implements a class that extends an abstract super class but by using

12766121
implements	extends
however that gives me the error that type b must implements the abstract method a.act is there another way in which i can do this without using extends

12766132
g++	gcc
3 there are many websites cautioning you to make sure you either use the -arch i386 compiler switch or change the links for usr bin gcc and usr bin g++ to point to gcc-4.0 and g++-4.0 instead of gcc-4.2 and g++-4.2

12766175
versioning	upgrade
ok after exploring this some more i finally came to the answer i had to upgrade the versioning of the nusoap library i was using

12766181
implements	extends
in second case when abstract class extends another abstract class use implements instead of extends

12766193
mouseover	mouseout	hide	show
i have to deal with canceling the default behavior of url links using an onclick event show the tooltip on a mouseover event and hide the tooltip on a mouseout event

12766218
box-sizing	border-box
box-sizing border-box

12766234
google-chrome	safari
for your information a good choice for a desktop user-agent string is that of google-chrome - it s also webkit-based as safari so webkit-specific extensions will work

12766234
google-chrome	safari
intel mac os x 10_8_2 applewebkit 537.11 khtml like gecko google-chrome 23.0.1271.6 safari 537.11

12766269
jaxp	stax
you can either use sax or stax to parse read the stream - reference jaxp

12766274
super	implements
google web fonts is a completely free and super easy way to implements non-standard fonts on your website in a properly licensed and widely supported fashion.

12766312
portrait	landscape
in my app i want to show master view in both landscape and portrait modes and it works fine with any special code

12766312
hide	show
but i want to be able to hide show master view with left right gestures similar to mail app

12766366
for-loop	arrays
in each case the for-loop causes i to take on each of the values in the arrays

12766373
mouseover	mouseout
im trying to make a generic script to change images on mouseover and mouseout

for-loop	arrays
the map view s overlays arrays contains objects of type the for-loop correctly declares overlaytoremove as such

12769452
int	chars
the good thing about this macro is that it should work with c89 and c99 compilers 1ll can be replaced with 1l and long long can be replaced with just long and ll with l of course if your c89 compiler does not have the extended long long type from c99 and it also correctly supports types smaller than int chars and short

12769452

onresume	onpause
these are the overrides for onpause and onresume

12769996
onresume	onpause
instead of backgroundmusic.pause in the onpause method however upon resuming the application the sound doesn t play even if backgroundmusic.play is present in the onresume method

12769996
onresume	onpause
i ve also noticed that the error is still there regardless of what i place in the onpause and onresume and i try to quit the application

12769996
onresume	onpause
i place system.out lines in the onpause and onresume overrides so that i can see when it is executed

12769996
onresume	onpause
upon starting the application onresume executes and upon closing the application onpause executes

12770021
width	height
i know how to do it by either resizing the image before or calculating the width and height and setting the values in pixels

12770041
width	height
the icon is a .png and the size is width 40 height 51

12770044
public	protected
i ve read through the controlling access to members of a class to get an idea of which modifiers should be infront of the getgameenginelog to make it only visible in the game engine project yet none of the modifiers public protected default or private suit my needs

12770116
tiff	bmp
clearly there are exceptions to this such as bmp and tiff images but you can probably build a whitelist of well-compressed filetypes pngs mpegs and venturing away from visual media - gzip bzip2 etc to skip and then assume the rest of the files you encounter will compress well

12770153
inherited	properties
it has array-like characteristics like numeric properties and a .length properties but it does not inherited from array.prototype

12770186
width	height
the first part where the frame height is set to be equal to the frame width is working as expected and the user is given a view that is square

12770206
post	get
i tried to read into many tutorials out there and many post here but didnt get around to found the right answer

12770225
gridview	rowdatabound
you can put chis code in your gridview s rowdatabound event.

12770236
lxml	beautifulsoup
for extracting data use beautifulsoup or lxml

12770313
profiling	instrumentation
using the time profiling in instrumentation will highlight the most expensive areas of your code but those are the most likely candidates

12770337
ember.js	backbone.js
use ember.js or backbone.js or some other framework to extract this for you

12770395
express	node.js
i m new to mustache.js and using it in express 3.0 in node.js and i want to use a helper function for formatting time in templates

12770421
lodash	underscore.js
lodash is inspired by underscore.js but nowadays is superior solution

12770443
docx	xlsx
i m working on a document ppt pptx xls xlsx doc docx and pdf splitter and overall i made it work

12770443
pop-up	dialog
also if i remove the property it gets stuck with the dialog save as if i try to finish the process manually by selecting a destination folder the save as pop-up comes up over and over again

12770510
width	height
i have been exploring the dom and the only attributes i can find relating to width and height give the height of the iframe itself which is smaller than the document inside it

12770511
uiview	subviews
uiview which using an xib file can also add in this class as a subviews you know what a mean

12770553
button	checkbox
also a toggle button makes the current state much more visible than just a checkbox so if a toggle choice is more important than the rest around it then it might make sense to use it

12770557
stdout	stderr
the exception may be getting written to stderr instead of stdout which the windows command line does not show by default

12770563
onresume	onpause
if you really need to save the state then you can save the current position of the track using getcurrentposition method in your onpause and in your onresume you can use seekto int msec method and pass in the value you obtained from getcurrentposition so that you can resume playback where you left off

12770586
for-loop	loops
i am unfamiliar with raise exception and the like but my instinct would be to add a raise exception or raise stopiteration to the for-loop after it is made into a while loops

12770609
short	base
in short set your base max_level properly and you won t have to worry

12770640
stdout	stderr
does qprocess waitforreadyread return when there is data in the process s stderr or does it wait only on stdout

12770669
children	parent
now if the parent consists on on element and has 2 children like

12770669
children	parent
if the parent consists of 2 elements a b and the children are q w e then qb and a

12770680
matplotlib	scipy
reinstalling numpy scipy and matplotlib with pip solved the problem

12770724
width	height
from what i can tell i am getting all the correct values for the height width of the photo and the height width of the photo but i am not sure where or how i can adjust the stretch factor

12770785
button	checkbox
however when posting the generatepdf button all i see in the model is if the checkbox is checked which is great

12770785
post	get	button	checkbox
when the form post using the generate pdf button i get the checked value of each checkbox but not the name of the template in the model

12770796
post	get
the clients use post data to present their actions and get to retrieve serialized game board data

12770800
for-loop	loops
i use the else clause of the for-loop that will be executed when loops is not exited by a break

12770810
portrait	landscape
you would have to develop your app in landscape mode and then rotate all your views content to make it seem it is in vertical portrait mode

12770816
stdout	stderr
will control whether your monitoring stderr or stdout so if you call

12770822
hide	show
also use show and hide function

12770837
serializable	deserialization
why not use colander for your serializable and deserialization

12770838
width	height
cgrectmake x position y position required height required width

12770851
hex	binary
while it s useful for hex-editors and other programs to display binary data as hex there s no reason to convert data into hexadecimal strings during programming

12770896
int	chars
as mortalus answered the reason for the difference was because in one case you passed an int to println in another case you passed a chars

12770896
int	chars
i just wanted to add that i can see that in the first case you were attempting to create a chars rather than an int however the syntax was incorrect

12770896
int	chars
finally you assign the chars to an int variable hex

12770896
int	chars
since 10 is valid for both int and chars an implicit conversion is performed the chars is converted back to an int and you end up with an int variable not a chars variable

12770908
nodevalue	innerhtml
nodevalue will return the innerhtml for your tag

12770922
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome media_err_decode is thrown when the playback stops while in firefox it just stops without any error

12770952
getter	setter
and have getter to read the values and setter or constructor parameters to set the values

12770983
int	boolean
i m already applying that and it works as if the int value from the database is 0 the java boolean variable becomes false and vice versa

12771071
int	boolean
if you want to keep simple structure for the configuration my suggestion is that you should not think about boolean as some different structure than int

12771074
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
i suppose that graph vertexes etc i should draw on qgraphicsview so i added it too also i add qgraphicsscene and bind them together ui- setscene scene

12771095
folder	directory
extract it copy and paste include folder from development package to opt lampp directory

12771117
int	chars
as the return type of fetgetc is an int and not chars

12771119
int	chars
by the way the reason why you need fgetc to return an int is because fgetc must return 257 unique values all the possible values of chars that is 0x00 thru 0xff as well as something unique to signify eof usually -1

12771120
put	get
i want to get a list of databases stored in mysql and put in java table using command show databases via a resultset

12771171
cpu	hyperthreading
actually the main purpose of arch_align_stack is to improve cache performance on cpu with hyperthreading or similar technologies

12771171
x86	64bit
arch x86 kernel process.c contains code common for both 32-bit and 64bit

12771174
put	get
this works fine on ios safari but if you try to get the last div and put into an ext.panel.html fields it doesn t work

12771260
fgets	getline
1 uses std getline std cin str to read your raw input analogous to fgets

12771276
memmove	malloc
ok i was trying to implement memmove just as a programming exercise and i get a memory access violation in the memmove function when i try to use malloc

12771302
int	chars
you should be using chars instead of int

12771340
width	height
i think the idea here is to get the width height of an

12771353
int	chars
a chars is 1 byte so chars pointer will really get moved by x bytes but an int is 4 bytes and an int pointer will get moved by 4 x bytes

12771354
int	chars
also an int is typically 4 bytes and chars is typically 1 byte

12771356
google-chrome	firefox
but while google-chrome doesn t have array.join defined firefox actually does and it can be invoked by array.join array string

12771377
portrait	landscape
if i load the application while the device is in landscape mode this still executes as if the device was in portrait mode

12771377
portrait	landscape
the second is that after load when i rotate the device from portrait to landscape i get a thread break as notated below

12771421
fontconfig	freetype
i noticed that fontconfig depends on freetype so i successfully installed that via brew

12771433
dbcontext	objectcontext
apparently i m now using dbcontext instead of objectcontext

12771436
rspec	capybara
would like to test this with capybara rspec using the poltergeist driver but since the select2 element actually starts out as a hidden field and then populates a once results are processed none of the normal select fill_in or choose helpers will work

12771438
post	get
read eli s post to get more details

12771504
istream	getline
this is incorrect use of std istream getline

12771525
goto	break
the same goes for other flow-control statements such as break continue and goto

12771542
portrait	landscape
beginning with android 3.2 api level 13 the screen size also changes when the device switches between portrait and landscape orientation.

12771571
comparator	comparable
either the element type t should implement the comparable interface or you should use the overloaded sort method that takes a generic comparator instance

12771571
comparator	comparable
neither your person class implements comparable nor you are passing any comparator instance

12771601
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
you should take a look at sqlconnection and sqlcommand and sqldatareader

12771633
box-sizing	border-box
you can use box-sizing border-box

12771636
unsigned	short
this is type safer that the acient va_list functions since it converts all the expressions in the list to unsigned short

12771674
ubuntu	linux
i am using ocamlc version 3.11.2 under linux ubuntu 10.04

12771689
put	get
now i put it on the internet at my host and when i load the site i get many warnings fatal error on the screen

12771723
comparator	comparable
alternatively you can implement comparable interface directly in person class and override comparator object obj method

12771749
highcharts	fusioncharts
i d recommend highcharts or fusioncharts

12771771
submit	submission
whilst there is a guide to submission it s not clear how to submit both arm and x86 configurations of the same app

12771786
fontfamily	font-size
when i wanna try to change the style like color fontfamily font size so on in the tinymce but it only print the tags like this without style font-size

12771788
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in this assignment where i can only use javascript my page displays fine in safari and google-chrome but not in firefox

12771805
int	chars
possible values are na the default when type.convert is used null when the column is skipped one of the atomic vector classes logical int numeric complex chars raw or factor date or posixct

12771806
superclass	subclassing
if you really want to then create a class hierarchy and implement methods like value actdirectly in the subclassing in addition to result act in the superclass

12771849
expandablelistview	expandablelistadapter
you can use fragmentactivity loaders but inflate expandablelistview directly and bind data to it via expandablelistadapter

12771888
highcharts	highstock
adding multiple points dynamically | highcharts and highstock jsfiddle

12771932
innodb	tokudb
i m trying to convert a 400 million row innodb table to the tokudb engine

12771983
int	chars
you don t need binascii to get the int representation of a chars in a string all you need is the built in function ord

12771986
int	chars
you can use ord to get the int value of each chars

12771987
submit	submission
on clicking to submit the form i want it to check the database for a duplicate entry with ajax and if there is already 1+ entries present a confirm window confirming another submission

12771993
cpu	processors
numbering cpu registers is the norm almost any processors does that

12772000
fast-forward	merge
git pull upstream master if master was the branch in which your fix has been integrated the merge will be a fast-forward one no rebase needed at this point

12772000
fast-forward	merge
before submitting anything back to the original repo upstream you need to make sure your work is based on top of the latest from said original repo or the pull-request won t result in a fast-forward merge once applied back on upstream repo

12772000
fast-forward	merge
and from my fork on github i can safely make a pull request knowing that it will only add new commits to upstream without needing any merge resolution merging those new commits in upstream repo will mean a simple fast-forward merge

12772010
google-chrome	firefox
it works great with firefox and google-chrome but ie8 returns localstorage is null or not an object when i call showstuff

12772045
int	double
another option would be to use a double but that will lose precision so if you need int accuracy biginteger is the way to go

12772045
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
then use the add multiplying divide and subtract amongst others to manipulate your values like

12772105
ostream	istream
in particular the c++ paradigm is to add overloads for and for ostream s and istream s respectively to handle input and output

12772105
std	ostream	ostream	istream	cout	cin
finally std cout std cin and std cerr are instances of ostream istream and ostream respectively which is why they get the and overloads

12772105
std	ostream
finally std endl is a special ostream that adds a newline and flush the stream

12772106
std	ostream
for example std ostream operator is overloaded for many types and you can add overloads for your own types as well

12772122
std	ostream
is overloaded as a member function of std ostream and std cout is an object of std ostream

12772202
portrait	landscape
i ve written a small app which creates a visual programmatically and i m trying to print it out on a page in landscape orientation it clips in portrait

12772202
portrait	landscape
when i print it does come out in landscape but my visual is still clipped as through it were limited to portrait orientation

12772243
width	height
i thought of getting the device s camera height and width

12772243
width	height
is there a function that we can call in java that gets the device s camera s height and width and the returned values will be assigned to the variables camera_width and camera_height

12772247
scatter	graphing
i m displaying in the same graphing a scatter plot and a bar plot

12772356
width	height
to prove this try some of the 2 bezier solutions above with equal height and width - they should ideally approximate a circle but they won t

12772371
redhat	fedora
tested with gcc 4.7.2 and gcc 4.1.2 on fedora 17 and another platform slc5 - redhat based linux in order to make sure it does not depend on the compiler

12772439
versioning	upgrade
furthermore you should upgrade to last versioning 2.7 or 2.8 of jmeter as it contains many fixes regarding jms

12772450
int	chars
i have an array of strings represented as 32 bit int where each bit corresponds to a specific chars in the input string

12772454
form-submit	preventdefault
you ll need to call preventdefault on the form-submit event and then submit the data manually after confirmation

12772481
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it looks the same in google-chrome safari desktop and ios and firefox

12772526
button	checkbox
i can link the code to a button push or a checkbox change but i d like it to be automatic since having the user click something to run the check defeats the purpose

12772542
jasmine	qunit
performing this asynchronous testing is actually possible in qunit but is handled better in another javascript testing framework jasmine js

12772542
setinterval	settimeout
edit also jasmine has several built-in methods of faking out the settimeout and setinterval functions of the browser without hosing any other tests in your suite that may depend on that

12772542
setinterval	settimeout
i would take a look at using those rather than manually overriding the settimeout setinterval functions

12772566
put	get
if you create a view that handles the get request you could put the updating code in that view

12772576
put	get
the only time i get this error is when i call the put function from the dynamicarray class

12772585
udp	tcp
we using it in production both with udp and tcp transports

12772661
decoder	encoder
this is incidentally why you can make a two-funcall utf-8 encoder decoder in javascript without any loops or garbage generation by combining these primitives to cancel out all but the utf-8-processing side effects as the unescape and decodeuricomponent versions do the same in reverse

12772705
carrierwave	fog
rails + carrierwave + fog + s3 socket error

12772705
carrierwave	fog
i m trying to use carrierwave + fog + amazon s3 as described on wiki and in few similar questions here on stackoverflow

12772711
folder	directory
the war directory was somehow getting cross linked to a same named game so no matter how many times i remade it it was getting linked to an old folder i had before

12772711
folder	directory
so even though all the directory s in the properties looked right the war folder was wrong

12772711
folder	directory
to fix it i had to un-check the this project has a war folder from the property s |google|web application tab apply it then i tried running it as a web app it told me i didn t have a war directory so it would not run

12772711
folder	directory
the next time i ran i got to re-select the war folder from a full directory and not just my projects directory

12772715
multiplying	add
a solution for usability would be to add your error text near the input we have found that a square is the optimal shape... have the user enter one attribute you really don t need both length and breadth if they always represent the same value and change your calcs to square that value rather than multiplying length breadth

12772723
uiview	calayer
i just want to replicate the same behavior as uiview calayer drawrect but in an opengl view

12772739
folder	directory
since your test resource directory is in a directory that compiles java sources you could move your test resource folder

12772745
subtract	add
i tried to write some jquery functions to change some variables values when options of a select item are selected add a certain value if option is selected subtract that value if option is not selected anymore but it adds and subtract values in a very odd way

12772745
subtract	add
odd behavior example clicking option 5 doesn t add 10 to pds1 but instead it subtract 10 to pds2

12772754
hide	show
on the app bar show event you hide the webview control and display the webviewbrush and you do the opposite on the app bar hide event

12772781
clang	icc
all modern compilers have extensions that provide these gcc and family icc opencc clang have e.g the series of __sync.

12772802
put	get
i m using andengine and i m trying to save game state somehow but i don t really want to put my objects to an array while creating level i d like to get those items just when i need to

12772827
pop-up	dialog
since you apparently have an activity i want to make a button you can display your message in your activity s ui or pop-up a dialog

12772834
int	chars
the r and g parameters to your rgb function are unsigned chars and you are not casting them to unsigned int before shifting

12772848
google-chrome	firefox
unlike the domparser +text html method the is supported by more browsers google-chrome 18+ firefox 11+ and ie 10+

12772862
std	ostream
std ostream is not copyable

12772903
recvfrom	datagram
the datagram checksum validation is postponed until a user code calls recvfrom or some other api capable of receiving udp datagram

12772903
recvfrom	datagram
when the code calls recvfrom and the validating code detects a checksum mismatch a datagram is simply dropped and recvfrom ends up being blocked until a next datagram arrives

12772924
post	get
reading your post i get a feeling that your reporting architecture might need a redesign and to be broken away from the base system

12772937
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome tend to be fine with xpath queries

12772940
webclient	webrequest
the line of code that takes so long is i ve tried replacing webrequest with webclient hoping that it would go faster but no such luck

12772949
public	protected
moving the inherited methods to public and the data members to protected in the orderedlist header file worked

12772960
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
fileinputstream and fileoutputstream on nix use the read and write system calls internally

12772977
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
you can t talk about happens-before relationship in terms of the java memory model between your fileinputstream and fileoutputstream objects since they don t share any memory or thread

12772977
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
however fileinputstream and fileoutputstream share a file which leaves things up to the os which in main stream ones you can expect to read after write in order

12773078
getter	setter
when the save button is clicked a new instance of backing is built and then there are a lot of calls to the getrecord getter before the setid setter is called

12773092
hide	show
also i m planing to implement a button to hide show rows that match the text from the first column and another one to highlight text from the second one

12773099
mouseout	mouseleave
but i need to hide menu when mouseleave or mouseout with delay

12773184
hide	show
in some places in our app we show hide the status bar with

12773234
jasmine	qunit
besides those already mentioned qunit jasmine i recommend mocha.js it adds a little bit more complexity but it s so much more flexible you need to load the file add a script tag with the configuration and start testing the plus is you can use any assertion expectation library you like if it throws exceptions if the test fails

12773260
post	get
as far as i am aware i cannot do a get post because the application cannot read php because it is for a smartphone so the data handling on the device is through javascript data sent from json and structure with html

12773288
for-loop	arrays
use above code in the for-loop and set the arr arrays

12773314
google-chrome	safari
apparently google-chrome and safari automatically promote elements with the float attribute set to display block or display inline-block

12773346
post	get
when i access the post data on the server i get nothing

12773364
audiotrack	audiorecord
im using audiorecord and audiotrack to play the sound output from the microphone to the speakers.but real-time playback creates sound echo .i need to only play mic sound and not the sound played by android system which in this case is the mic audiotrack which is played for the second time

12773379
getter	setter
i guess the error is pretty easy to spot but i ve tried any versions of static public static and using functions setter and getter to do the work but nothing works

12773403
filtering	grouping
if you need some post processing on the list of orders returned like filtering grouping or merging introduce another domain object between your customer and orderrepository and name it like a domain object not a service

12773426
post	get
however you could get the forum post on your domain with some server side scripting like php

12773443
post	put
but is rails you can put _method post in the form action to override the method

12773491
onmouseover	onclick
event handlers are stored as properties of elements such as onclick onmouseover etc

12773491
onmouseover	onclick
if the dom element referenced by has either an onclick or onmouseover event handler set replace this element in the array with an anonymous function

12773507
clang	llvm
ruby is not fully ready for llvm compilation this includes clang there is at least one known isue with fibers but depending on llvm version other problems might appear

12773567
getter	setter
this only generate getter and setter for all entity class properties

12773579
spaces	delimiter
which will place into broken all of the words that you ve typed in delimiter by spaces

12773596
focuslistener	propertychangelistener
it uses jformattedtextfield to enforce numeric input as well as a propertychangelistener focuslistener to update the sum

12773609
for-loop	loops
while loops block should end right after k++ and in first for-loop you should initialize b with j instead of i

12773626
carrierwave	fog
did you restart your server when adding in the carrierwave and fog gem

i m used to coding in asp.net mvc 3 so towerjs and geddy looks friendly and familiar to me because of the mvc pattern

12773652
factors	matrix
impute.knn uses khanmiss which is a data.frame of factors which when coerced to matrix will be character

12773652
int	double
despite the strange example mat1 will when it is int or double as well

12773684
fast-forward	merge
even if this is not a fast-forward mergeâ¹ there s nothing to commit as the merge commit is made automatically

12773684
fast-forward	merge
â¹because this is a checkout on your server there shouldn t be a need for a non fast-forward merge

12773689
opera	google-chrome
use rgb color syntax background-image instead of background and meter attributes to get it fully working in google-chrome and partially working in opera

using a parent interface and virtual methods then making your function call those methods presumably getter and setter to handle the field manipulation will provide more freedom later at the expense of slightly higher runtime and having to inherit from that interface it will however allow new objects to be passed to the function at any time so long as they implement the interface

12785274
free	memcpy
i thought the memcpy in getstringforsizeandcursor would fix the segfault since its copying bytes outside of subbuffer before i free right now i would expect those to then be cleaned up by my struct deconstructor but either things are deconstructing before i expect or some memory is still pointing to the original subbuffer if i let subbuffer leak i get back the data i expected but this is not a solution

we are a group of students of chemical engineering mostly proficient in matlab and simulink but with almost no clue of web programming

12786755
integer	unsigned
modulus operations on powers of two like 2 32 simplify directly to masking off high order bits and if you take a 64 bit integer and compute it modulo 2 32 the value will be exactly the same as if you had converted it to an unsigned int

12786755
division	modulo
programmers like to use this property to speed up programs because it s easy to chop off some number of bits but performing a modulo is much harder it s about as hard as doing a division

the performance gains you seem to be expecting with a port of the firefox webcl extension to the google-chrome browser are i would surmise unlikely though the v8 engine does indeed process javascript faster than other engines webcl is by definition processed primarily on the gpu so the javascript component of the code will more than likely represent a very small percentage of the processing time

also note the distinction between public protected and private methods private and protected methods have limitations on who is allowed to call them

the first example is like for like and can be useful for changing other css properties via jquery - however if you want to show hide or fade elements then use the native jquery methods as in the second example

12798240

instead of javascript jquery user hide show methods

12798246

uncaughtexceptionhandler	runnable
if you check the code for platform.runlater see below you will see that the exceptions are swallowed lines 146 147 so a default uncaughtexceptionhandler won t be able to catch them - based on that piece of code i don t think you have any options but to include try catch blocks in your runnable

12798526
int	chars	unsigned	short
the primitive int types are signed unsigned chars short int long long long as opposed to float or decimal types .

12798526
int	chars
however in addition to those int types there are four distinct unique fundamental types chars wchar_t char16_t and char32_t which are the types of the respective literals l u and u and are used for alpha-numeric type data and similarly for arrays of those

12798526
int	chars
those types are of course also int types and thus they will have the same layout at some of the arithmetic int types but the language makes a very clear distinction between the former arithmetic types which you would use for computations and the latter chars types which form the basic unit of some type of i o data

12798526
int	chars
so i think that char16_t and char32_t are actually very aptly named to reflect the fact that they belong to the chars family of int types

12798551
strtol	atoi
you should either terminate your strings put a zero at the end of them and stop using atoi use strtol instead

12798598

in this project setattr is used to set attributes and getattr is used to get attributes in profile log setattr was called 2700 times and getattr was called 3800 times

12798653

12798905
width	height
i think the main problem is the ipad wants to scale the page to full height and i want it full width

12798958
button	checkbox
at the bottom i have a button select all that selects all the email checkbox

12798995
fast-forward	merge

for-loop	arrays
i have been doing a for-loop inside another for-loop in order to get 2 objects from the arrays at the same time but there must be a better way

12799245
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
from ios 6 it is given that uinavigationcontroller won t ask its uiviewcontroller for orientation support

12799309
google-chrome	safari
this string contains safari so you have to check specifically if the string also contains google-chrome

12799319
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome has both google-chrome and safari inside useragent string

12799325
imperative	declarative
c++ is an imperative object-oriented strict impure language c++ templates are a declarative hybrid logic functional non-strict pure language which was never intended to be used as a full-fledged programming language and thus lacks many of the features necessary for programming in the large

12799329
google-chrome	safari
so your function needs to check for safari and make sure the string doesn t contain google-chrome

12799351
google-chrome	safari
wow64 applewebkit 537.4 khtml like gecko google-chrome 22.0.1229.92 safari 537.4

12799352

this is the version that uses addition but that has a negation at the end - might as well subtract and skip the negation

12799379
opera	firefox
now comes the strange behaviour when posting new messages opera firefox and even ie8 works well as intended like this

12799408

12799597
google-chrome	firefox
itâ s working fine on ios firefox when .ogg is used and google-chrome

12799603
operands	scalar
i tried something like but since the operands of are not scalar this doesn t work

12799627
put	get
my guess and that s probably the best kind of answer you can get here unless a linq to entities ms dev comes along is that they re doing exactly that generating the most effective query but leaving the head-hurtingly-difficult job of optimising the query to the bit they ve already put hundreds or thousands of man-days into the query optimiser in sql server

12799665
passenger	thin
restart start the thin server cluster no sure exactly here if it is similar to passenger which i use this operation is just to create some restart.txt file - i presume that you have your nginx as a reverse proxy in front of it right

12799666
width	height
my requirment is to calculate the height width of each image and do the following if the height width is 5000

12799666
google-chrome	firefox
for this i have tried the below script for handling google-chrome since i have managed to work for ie and firefox using some other method

12799676
portrait	landscape
with ios6 apple suggest now to use 2 differences xib file to switch between portrait landscape view

12799723
google-chrome	firefox
all current browsers maintain a single thread for javascript which can be per-tab google-chrome or per browser window firefox

12799724
jpa	javax.persistence
instead of using the ormlite annotations you can use the more standard jpa annotations from the javax.persistence package

12799729
portrait	landscape
so now my screen is landscape but the status bar remains in its place like the screen is still in portrait mode

12799749

i know there a lot of scripts out there showing you how to convert flac to mp3 but this is my script and i want to learn how to write the script using this method

12799794
cvs	svn

12799800
button	checkbox
i also tried to remove the edittext button and checkbox i put in there thinking it was may be creating a conflict .

12799801
cvs	svn
i ve worked mainly with git and svn cvs in the past so i assume that this is a problem of understanding not a technical issue

12799835
implements	modifiers
you should implements your security policy somehow not rely on the java language level visibility modifiers or caller package names

12799839
folder	directory
i don t think you ll be able to name the file 9 10 2012 05 31 15.jpeg as php will interpret the slashes as folder directory when you try to save

12799845
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
further investigation reveals a stack-based counter in a for-loop resetting itself to zero at random points in the for loops execution and the stack-based values in the arrays that the for-loop is inspecting change for the same index value

12799894
post	put
the standard behaviour is to send a post if the model is new doesn t have an id attributed and send a put if the model id is set

12799894
post	put
in your case it s working as designed if you want it to use post to send updates you have to override backbone.sync to work as you need but i think it s easier for you to make your backend restful and create a put listener controller method for updates

12799951
ubuntu	linux
os linux ubuntu

12799965
portrait	landscape
it will not use a split action bar regardless of whether it is held in portrait landscape or is being stepped on by an elephant

12800316
x86	64bit
i know that on 64bit windows 32 bit applications go into c program files x86 by default and 64bit into c program files

12800316
x86	64bit
i see the program files x86 directory as a legacy sandbox for old applications who were never designed for 64bit applications in mind

12800316
x86	64bit
to me the path without x86 is also more visually appealing and indicates that it s a modern application - adapted for 64bit operation where necessary

12800346
folder	directory
therefore i copied the contents of the plugin folder of qt into the application directory where collidingmice.exe is

12800375
ubuntu	linux
im have just deployed a rails app which uses paperclip to handle the file uploads to a linux ubuntu 10.04 server running apache2 passenger rails 3.2.3 and ruby 1.9.3

12800391
jboss	glassfish
maybe your transaction is in read-only mode under tomcat jboss but not under glassfish

12800427
ienumerable	iqueryable
neither ienumerable nor iqueryable linq queries will execute until you try to actually use the result

12800427
ienumerable	iqueryable
the general difference is that ienumerable is using funcs essentially delegates as the underlying storage of the query whereas the iqueryable is using expression trees so that the query can be translated to sql for example

12800436
qtcore	qtgui
from pyqt4 import qtgui qtcore

12800436
super	self
super treemodel self

12800438
x86	mips
if you use a mips cross compiler instead of a gcc that targets x86 you can complete this conversion compilation

12800438
x86	mips
the wording in your question seems to suggest you don t care as much that the output is mips but rather you want the output to be less complex than x86

12800451
google-chrome	firefox
i tested in google-chrome 22 ie 9 firefox 15

12800480
free	malloc
it then also checks for it being 0 - if it is zero it invokes - dealloc which is usually overridden by a subclass to free memory allocated by the constructor method - init or free memory allocated by malloc

12800549
portrait	landscape
i get this error cgimagecreate invalid image size 0 x 0 with ios 6 in an universal project only for new ipad simulator not for the old one or the iphone if i load a window with a uipickerviewcontroller over a splitviewcontroller and only in portrait not in landscape

12800668
free	malloc
the more interesting part is how free works and in this direction malloc too can be understood better

12800668
free	malloc
in many malloc free implementations free does normally not return the memory to the operating system or at least only in rare cases

12800668
free	malloc
this is also the reason why managing very small memory elements with the standard malloc free is not efficient

12800690
width	height
but i want to paginate the text based on page height and width

12800707
mdpi	hdpi
that is i don t want to create ldpi mdpi hdpi etc versions of every single graphic but rather i want to use the default graphics for most and then the specific graphics for things like this font

12800837
r-tree	quadtree
take a look at quadtree spatial index quadkeys and r-tree

12800841
equals	gethashcode
you could also do this with a system.string via type.name or type.fullname but it ll be slower because the string methods for equals sure and for gethashcode depending on their implementation are slower

12800877
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
and the jqxhr in jquery 1.4.x xmlhttprequest object

12800881
post	get
when the page post back you should get that variable back and it should also match the one stored in the session

12800885
trackbar	cwnd
in ms trackbar implementation you cannot just call cwnd invalidate for deferred redraw or even cwnd redrawwindow for immediate redraw

12800886
accessor	properties
after a number as a decimal not a properties accessor so it sees it as this

12800890
getter	setter
this requires defining mapping on getter and setter however

12800948
hide	show
here is an example which show hide markers based on their categories again translated from mike williams v2 tutorial

12800948
hide	show
also copied to how to show hide markers from xml file without refreshing the page with the part of the question it applied to

nunit	nmock
see testmetal a custom source build of nunit nmock and opencover with castle core for .net

12801002
hide	show
if you want to hide a string that needs to be show later you d need to use encryption instead

12801024
salt	md5
md5 hashing especially with a salt is a one way process

12801027
express	node.js
in node.js and express there are many examples showing how to get session data

12801027
post	get
so i asked him how we can get the session data and he said he doesn t know the best approach so i thought i d post the question here

12801051
for-loop	loops
secondly you will find a for-loop is easier than a do loops for implementing the logic as you don t need to keep track of loops counter manually

this will require potentially thousands of cron jobs

12807032

disk	ram
on systems with virtual memory and current resource demands on ram that exceed the amount of physical memory some pages just blocks of memory of a common size often on the order of 4-8kb can be written out to disk and given as ram to a program trying to allocate and use new memory

12807071
disk	ram
there are lots of other tricks the mmu os can do as well like sharing memory between processes making a disk file appear to be direct-memory-accessible setting some pages as nx so they can t be treated as executable code using arbitrary sections of the logical memory space regardless of how much and at what address the physical ram uses and more

12807090

12807338
post	get
problem is i don t really understand what the method should be post or get basically we need to redirect to the client with underlying parameters not query strings and then our current page that calls the request must be redirected to the client page with the parameters as well

12807359
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can loop through all your posts and add mouseenter and mouseleave events to each post

12807370
hash	salt
this salt is nothing more than a random arbitrary string that you concatenate to the passwords and it will make your hash password unique

12807370
salt	md5
i mean if someone knows what a md5 12345 is a string a this salt will make your users password 12345 as the string b in your db

12807370
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
so i d suggest that you hash your passwords with a custom function myhashmd5 that calls md5 adding the proper salt

12807380
division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
it may be somewhat slower than the combined multiplication because it requires real multiplication and division instead of only shifts and addition but i didn t benchmark it so far concerning the performance in an abstract language

12807682
getter	setter
i forgot to add getter and setter to properties of my model

12807708
bash	zsh
are you in any case running a shell that is not bash or zsh

12807708
bash	zsh
you can check user shell in etc passwd and change it with chsh -s path to new shell - list of allowed shells is available in etc shells - but make sure to pick bash zsh also note that links like sh- bash will not work as bash changes behavior based on the name that was invoked

12807724
vsto	add-in
i just create a vsto second edition project for word add-in and build the setup project

12807729
rss	feed
part of the project is clickthrough a set of add-on tools including a tool to automatically detect available updates via an rss feed notify users and install the update

12807730
getter	setter
the setter and getter methods will be individual for both the classes

12807730
getter	setter
apart from this there is nothing that much complex with setter and getter methods

12807739
getter	setter
with that in mind getter and setter don t have any idea or notion about any other class or instances unless they just happen to be a member of that class which i don t think is the case here

12807753
post	get
because no data i being sent in the body of the request i am debating whether it makes more sense for me to send a get instead of a post

12807761
int	boolean
creating mclassifier gives error con not find symbol constructor dynamiclmclassifier string int boolean

12807762
getter	setter
setter and getter are methods used to obtain the value of the field of a class

12807762
getter	setter
should you need to return something else or do something different the classes interacting with this particular class will still call a setter and a getter without being affected unless you make a major change like changing the type of the value...

12807762
getter	setter
the setter and getter are defined for each class because they re related to each particular context

12807901
ember.js	javascriptmvc
to be most compatible with practice restful service development and existing javascriptmvc frameworks like angularjs and ember.js that would be used to integrate with a restful service should a resource be deserialized to json from a restful put call that just updates a resource

12807901
put	get
but this means that another call must be made to get the resource to get any updates that may have occurred on the resource in addition to the ones that were specified in the put call

12807901
put	get
however having to make another get call to get the updated resource following the put though nice that it is intentional is additional overhead for a put where you need the updated resource you would have to put and then get

12807906
width	height
i also had to add some width height settings to the carousel because i think there may be a bug with jcarousel where the entire image is not displayed if you don t specify the height for example.

12807927
jboss	glassfish
is it possible to make a java ee 6 application deployable on any java ee 6 container like jboss or glassfish etc without using their modules libraries

12807927
maven	pom.xml
if for example i want hibernate or weld then add these in my maven pom.xml

12807927
jboss	glassfish
in other words is there any vanilla container or can jboss or glassfish be made vanilla

12807933
hash	md5
i know i can use an md5 hash to determine if they re different but i want to know how much different the two files are

12807937
getter	setter
if you have a class annotated with data it will generate the getter and setter for you based on the field names

12807937
getter	setter
if you use one of those getter in another class then decide the field is poorly named it will not find usages of those getter and setter and replace the old name with the new name

12807937
getter	setter
the lack of a declared getter setter can get annoying at times when you are trying to familiarize yourself with new code

12807937
getter	setter
if i javadoc the field i would hope the getter and setter would inherit that javadoc through the lombok compilation step

12807937
getter	setter
obviously you are not able to set a breakpoint in a getter setter unless you generate or code the method

12807937
maven	pom.xml
netbeans doesn t like it when you update your lombok dependencies in your maven pom.xml

12807946

i need to extract the files from an msi into a folder but change the directory structure of the files all from within a c# application ie not by doing an admin install or any other install of the msi

12808105

post	put
i got the idea that i ll transfer my files by post and on php side i ll put files on the server

12808183

12808425
awt	swing
for java the jdk has awt and swing

12808458
post	get
i think the choice of get or post is very personal as both of them will do the work but i would recommend you to keep a post instead of a get for two reasons

12808458
post	get
by default get requests are cacheable if there are no parameters present in the url a post is not

12808507

what s happening is that i ve put down a webview in my xib file and connected it with outlet but i stil can t get the image to show up

12808548
put	get
as an aside i also recommend that you put the code generation tool to the side and instead create your swing gui s by hand for a bit until you get a firm grasp of swing and java fundamentals

12808586
nsurl	nsstring
i ll note that instead of returning nsstring objects from -activityviewcontroller itemforactivitytype if i return just nsurl objects they show up with that paperclip with no body text in the post

12808593
udp	mtu
just make sure you don t send more then mtu sans ip and udp header sizes to avoid fragmenting on ip layer

12808594
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
another gotcha to watch out for is to make sure that your uinavigationcontroller s and uitabbarcontroller s have restoration identifiers

maven	pom.xml
all pom.xml files inherit from the maven super pom.xml

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uitabbars have some nice integration with uiviewcontroller and uinavigationcontroller but the benefits quickly drop off when you need more customizable behavior left to right scrolling for instance.

pull	push
git is a decentralized version control system where you can push up and pull down code repositories

12808933
pull	push
although you could use heroku as the place to push up and pull down your branches and do all commits i would strongly recommend that you setup a additional remote repository i d recommend github where you do the majority of your code changes and only use your heroku repository for deployments

12809017
getter	setter
you need to create public setter and getter method to access fields and to access book instance you need to

12809041

serializable	deserialization
the router is all about using serializable and deserialization to recreate it s state

12809090
serializable	deserialization
i think that dealing with one model makes the serializable deserialization process a lot easier to conceptualize

12809099
getter	setter
anyway assuming the simple case that you both read and write using the datacontractserializer all you need to do is to make addressline1 into a property with a getter and setter and mark it with datamember isrequired false

12809099
getter	setter
then in the addressline1 property getter put your address concatenation code and in the property setter just do nothing

12809099
serializable	deserialization
this way on deserialization addressline1 will just be ignored even if it s not present at all in the xml it won t cause an error but on serializable it will be correctly written out

12809230
pull	push
restart smartgit and you should be able to push and pull

12809246
google-chrome	firefox
maybe i m blind but i do not see any invalid characters in ie firefox or google-chrome

12809251
put	get
the answer is not unless you make modifications to the code yourself. which means to put a not-to-fine a point on it expect your web hosting provider to get religion somewhere along the way decide to upgrade out of a security hole by upgrading php which suddenly causes your website to crash

12809277
versioning	upgrade
from your sintax i assume you are using mule with versioning 3.3.0 so the example based on mel won t probably fit your needs although you should take this approach as soon as you d upgrade

the web arrays is already in use as the target of the for-loop you can t expect to redeclare it within loops

12809386
put	get
now i can obviously put the add person button below the entire table but then how would i get it aligned with the second table column

12809386
post	put
also i could have the add person button put some command in a hidden field and have the editpersons action check that to see if it should add a person or save updated data for existing persons but i feel that would somewhat defeat the paradigm of single purpose actions as opposed to the horrific old-school asp post to itself forms

12809388

packets	multicast	subnet	packets
in theory other subscribers on the same subnet could see each others services but afaik there s no provision for sending multicast packets over cellular networks

12809939
packets	multicast	subnet	packets
a bonjour service is generally visible to any other device on the same link-local network the same subnet assuming that the router doesn t filter multicast packets

12809939
bonjour	jmdns
you can use jmdns to do bonjour service advertising discovery with android it s pretty mature or you can even roll your own it s not that difficult

it is not panacea as it doesn t deal with freebsd but it is helpful in most cases when all you need is to support windows and and say debian

12810001
packets	multicast
and i found wireshark can see all multicast packets sent and received when using jdk 7 to run my program

i m using a fixed width in my container of about 1024px right now with a min-width of 1200px but it still cuts off part of the fixed navlist becuase i m using a -125px margin on the nav container to get it outside of the content container

12810132
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome everything is working perfectly

12810160
for-loop	loops
you need to use a self-evaluating closure here to capture the value of i at each iteration of loops because otherwise you get the value of i after control has left the for-loop arr.length

12810292
eventlet	gevent
your application simply provides a python server to respond to http requests.gunicorn gevent and eventlet are excellent options

udp	rtp
when i get a udp packet especially rtp i have a different phenomenon

12810428
udp	tcp
if you re running wireshark at the wire which is generally how you run it you should see all packets udp tcp w e else regardless of local firewall settings and whether or not a port is open

12810428
icmp	udp
however regardless of operating system before that icmp packet gets sent the source has no way of knowing whether the port is open or not and therefore you should see udp packets even if the corresponding port is open

12810428
packets	multicast
in particular this is probably done to keep your machine and any others in a multicast environment from spamming the sender with icmp packets

12810457
hex	binary
i doubt that you can reliably tunnel protobuf whose payload is pure binary not text through json without doing some type of encoding like base64 or hex encoding

when running that query the db engine does not interpret to be a pararmeter so doesn t pop-up the parameter dialog because the name of the parameter is the same as the field name

12822245
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
in case all your items within the grid do not have a width and a margin set your best bet is to resize the columns without any modifier key in vs2012 it should not destroy the layout visually it should just add the unecessary margin height and width properties and then in the document outline window multiselect all the elements and in the properties view klick the set to auto button

getter	setter
some books explain that you should only use getter and setter to access your ivar even if they are private

12822297
getter	setter
that could be annoying since sometime u need some simple ivar without any getter setter control

12822329
hide	show
just call fsetaccesswindow 0 to hide and fsetaccesswindow 1 to show

12822364

this qould mean that that player starts a server basically listens to a predefined port number and the other players send out multicast packets to find the servers

12822560

12822693
cpu	processors
the documentation does not explicitly state but the default value varies with the number of processors cores the platform has and i think the number is equal to the number of cpu cores

12822702

the page looks great in firefox and google-chrome

12822835
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
the problem is using rkobjectmapping instead of rkentitymapping when dealing with core data so restkit s instantiating an nsmanagedobject as regular nsobject

12822855
integer	fractions
the ideal option is to find the continued fractions that represents the monic root because this cf will be computable as an integer ratio of any desired precision thus elminating the problem of rounding

12822859
factors	mean
there can also be implications of changing a value once the object has been created a calculation factors or file name which might mean you have to provide functionality to reset the object - very messy

spaces	delimiter
the reason you re getting the delimiter spaces and underscores in your result is the parentheses they instruct the splitter to include the delimiter in the returned array

12824252
spaces	delimiter
if you want to treat any number of spaces or underscores as a single delimiter you need to add + to your regex - it means one or more of the previous thing

12824253
getter	setter
i ran into a problem using java objects in jython today because jython is trying to be intelligent and automatically creates properties for simple getter setter methods - for each method a field with the leading get set removed and the next letter converted to lowercase is created

12824253
inherited	properties
i need a list of all methods callable on the object which for my objects basically is the result of dir without these properties and filtered to exclude everything inherited from java.lang.object and things starting with an underscore the purpose of this is to automagically convert some python classes to java equivalents dicts to maps

12824678
try-catch	exception-handling
edit re-read and i should add that i have a lot of code wrapped in a try-catch block further up in the inheritance tree so if this produced an exception-handling instead of a fatal error i would be able to catch it and terminate the application gracefully

12824709

from there you can use the exec family to execute whatever executables you like or simply run c code in the child while the parent goes back and prompts for more information next command etc. use wait with the wnohang option at the top of the loop to check for terminated children and again this time without wnohang at the end for the rest of those children

keydown	keyup
i have tried this method which doesn t work because not all keyup or keydown events are handled especially when multiple keys are pressed

12826693
switching	screens
it will smoothly switching between pages displaying different picture on the full screens

12826727
getter	setter
my experience points me to having arguments in the constructor rather than getter and setter

12826730
width	height
this understanding comes from the notion that it will half the width and height and therefore quarter the size

12826730
width	height
i would check to see how big the images width and height is and if it is gl_max_texture_size it will do some math and make it under the balue

width	height
a.video has a href to a page with only a video using flowplayer with a set width and height

assuming your strings are really unsigned chars not int you could have a 256 byte lookup table of unacceptable chars which would make your test if table s i return e_invalid

12827130
mouse	keyboard
also you would need to handle all the nicities rich edit handles for you like highlighting text placing the cursor handling mouse and keyboard input parsing rtf text et cetera

12827135

google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome it renders as

12827213
ostringstream	std
personally i wouldn t use an std ostringstream or even an std stringstream for this at all

12827213
std	ostream
to also make sure that any output is sent immediately i d set up an std ostream to have std ios_base unitbuf set

12827216
min	max
if the number of intervals is small use a class with three members min max and message store them in a list and run a linear search

12827275
onfocus	onblur
or should i set a particularelementhasfocus property in response to onblur and onfocus events on that element

12827278
alarmmanager	countdowntimer
so if you want to do some operation every minute even your app is not on forground then you should use alarmmanager otherwise countdowntimer will do the job for you

12827295

xpages	lotus
lotus notes xpages for design and oracle or other rdbms for

12827458
getter	setter
so no you are stuck with this ball of setter and getter with no code--so you tend to add a bunch of--well essentially static functions to manipulate these things

12827458
getter	setter
this would mean eliminating setter and getter from your pojos so you can have encapsulation data safety and instead adding business logic methods

12827458
getter	setter
i d really love to hear from anyone who used the pojo pattern with business logic and without setter and getter for hibernate objects and had problems with it or had it work really well .

12827463
dwarf	mach-o
once you have a dsym bundle you ve got plain old standard dwarf that any dwarf reading tool which can deal with mach-o binary files can process

12827485
getter	setter
getter and setter in javascript are just normal functions

12827510
keydown	keyup
this article is a good resource explaining the differences between keyup keydown and keypress

12827516
keydown	keyup
note that keydown and keyup provide a code indicating which key is

12827516
keydown	keyup
example a lowercase a will be reported as 65 by keydown and keyup

12827588
ubuntu	linux
i ve made a custom linux kernel for ubuntu lucid and a live iso to be able to distribute it

12827680
queue	fifo
don t put messages destined for app1 and app2 on the same queue if the apps are reading fifo

12827680
queue	fifo
as noted earlier apps or app instances reading the queue in a fifo mode will compete for messages

12827681
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works fine in firefox google-chrome safari but not in ie7 8 work fine in ie9

12827736
union	distinct
or you can use union all instead of union the difference is you will not get distinct values

12827736
union	distinct
the union might be slower due to it attempting to get the distinct values

12827739
elementtree	beautifulsoup
it also gets pretty slow due to beautifulsoup but it needs to get used because elementtree and minidom don t find matching tags for some reason

12827751
getter	setter
so no you are stuck with this ball of setter and getter with no code--so you tend to add a bunch of--well essentially static functions to manipulate these things

12827751
inherited	subclassing
no one is stopping you from having your service layer be oo-designed with subclassing and inherited and all that

12827752
redhat	fedora
you haven t specified your distro here but on redhat and derivatives like fedora you ll generally do it like this

12827752

12827848
foreground	tray
i mean to use them when the app is active in the foreground nothing outside the app or in the software control tray

12827852
folder	directory
this means that the j.jar is located in a folder called localhost in the same directory that the html is in

12827863
google-chrome	safari
i applied this fix to my application but it broke other areas specifically it was identifying google-chrome and safari as uplevel which caused it to be detected in other areas as ie

12827871
width	height
you can see the open graph width and height tags for example

12827941
vim	emacs
of the clojureians i know all of them have moved to leiningen and connect to their project from an editor like emacs or vim

12827977
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
this feature allowed me to create both an upgrade only the changes since the last versioning or a full installation script if pointed at no target db

12827977
installation	upgrade
i cannot seem to find the correct combination of options to reproduce this script only behavior for upgrade and full installation when using vs 2012 or ssdt in general

12827996
post	get
you will need a programming mindset to think through what type of data is being sent in the post and what is being retrieved in the get

12828039
jar	war
exclusion in the jar or war ear whatever plugin configuration

12828039
junit	testng
i agree that shipping unnecessary classes is annoying i ve seen junit and testng jars in production deployments - brrrr... but for all practical purposes it s a rather minor one

12828080
fgets	fgetc
note i think i would probably have an easier time using fgets instead of fgetc to accomplish this task

12828080
fgets	fgetc
ok i decided to use fgets instead of fgetc to greatly simplify my function

12828137
keydown	keyup
i ve heard that keyup and keydown get missed in some browsers

12828164

12828255
mallet	lda
several lda approaches are implemented in mallet apache mahout and vowpal wabbit

12828261
versioning	upgrade
i know that probably issuing dotnetfx45_full_setup.exe q will have no bad effect if installing on a system that already has versioning 4.5 but i still would like to not install the upgrade if the upgrade already exists faster and less problems

12828319
google-chrome	firefox
when you resize the window in any other browser firefox google-chrome i tested with the footer moves with the window

12828368
put	get
the easiest way i found is to don t put the unit_price but the global price then make a division in the php code to get the unit_price but i was hoping sql could do something for me

12828376
switching	screens
sometimes after switching to the facebook app instead of the permission screens i ll end up on a blank page with cancel as the only button up top and pressing cancel does nothing i m stuck on that blank page

12828377
hide	fadeout
also instead of fadeout hide might work better again due to possible clashes with animation when mousing over quickly between the links

12828402
action-filter	onactionexecuting
given you want access to the model and parameters you can change your approach slightly and use an onactionexecuting filter action-filter scope instead and throw a 401 or 403 based on your validation

12828496
inherited	subclassing
and then two derived classes or instances of the same subclassing that inherited the same statusview but fill it with different images

12828498
getter	setter
as far as getter and setter i avoid them at all costs

12828514
burn	uninstaller
but during uninstaller action the burn log file says

12828514
burn	uninstaller
what should i do so that the burn bundle is freely able to uninstaller the msi which the user selected at the time of install

12828520
int	chars
you are truncating the fgetc s value of type int to chars

12828529
rfcomm	l2cap
so you have the following nested protocol layers to decode spp - rfcomm - l2cap - acl data

12828537
maven	m2e
heard of egit m2e in eclipse for maven github integration but not sure how to use it

12828541

i m trying to use opengl and glfw with derelict3 for the d language but i have some problems with the glfw3.dll and i m not sure about what i did wrong

12828541
glfw	derelict3
as derelict3 seems to need the glfw3.dll i cloned the git repository git glfw.git.sourceforge.net gitroot glfw glfw

12828606
setinterval	settimeout
iirc jquery animations are based on the date time it isn t handled primarily by settimeout or setinterval

12828635
super	implements
just remember in your -viewdidunload to remember to ask if the super class implements the method before attempting to call it on super if that s what you re currently doing using

12828636
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	x86	mips
gcl currently compiles itself and the primary free software lisp applications maxima acl2 and axiom on eleven gnu linux architectures x86 powerpc s390 sparc arm alpha ia64 hppa m68k mips mipsel windows sparc solaris and freebsd

12828681
stdout	fflush
the output from the loop is not appearing due to stdout being buffered the printf statement inside the loop contains no n and stdout is not explicitly fflush d and the call to execl in main which replaces the current process image and stdout buffer is not fflush as usual on a normal program exit

12828681
stdout	fflush
add a new-line character to the printf or explicitly call fflush stdout

12828681
int	chars
i can t see a reason for dynamically allocating this or even when it needs to be an array as the format of the lines seems to be a single chars followed by an int

12828700
folder	directory
as you can see i am deleting the directory then i am copying the folder back

12828700
folder	directory
i assume i can just do a file compare of each file and then copy it to the new directory iterating through each folder file

12828718
post	put
im trying to process a masqueraded put using spring s _metgod hidden attribute but the request is coming through as a post even with the hiddenhttpmethodfilter in place

12828733
children	parent
after a quick search based on javier hint i came up with this solution i could implement a single parent hash in redis where the value fields will be the string representation of the children hashes

12828788
client-side	server-side
you can always cache a server-side solution as well which you can t really do client-side

12828809
fast-forward	merge
you can use reflog to see how the references were moving that registers activity sometimes not visible from usual git log like fast-forward merge but i don t think it should matter in your case

12828842
range	minimum
for inclusive range setting the hard minimum maximum values works just fine

12828899
interbase	firebird
if you really need an embedded database there are several good alternatives including but not limited to sqlite ms sql server compact or localdb 1 interbase firebird etc.

12828900
folder	directory
i could technically make a folder called rails on my local computer so that they are both in the same directory structure but that doesn t really seem like an elegant solution

12828920
outputstream	inputstream
another problem is that you open the inputstream and the outputstream but you never actually read anything from the input nor do you write anything to the output so the file on your sdcard is going to be empty

12828932
postgresql	mysql
should work for you at least for mysql postgresql and sqlite3

12828948
floating-point	integer
you ll need to convert the result to some integer type anyway to avoid the insanity of floating-point equality comparisons

12828948
min	max
it s almost flat near the peaks and troughs so the quantisation step multiplying by some large number and rounding to an integer will produce many hash values near the min and max rather than an even distribution

12828960

appfog is a simple paas for java node .net ruby php mysql mongo postgresql and more

12828980
apache	nginx
if youâ re not using heroku and are using apache or nginx to serve static files then this wonâ t work in that case youâ d need to configure your webserver separately

12829015
inherited	properties
so i implemented the extension method for propertyinfo that will return all properties from all interfaces and base classes inherited by the type

12829015
ilist	icollection
the problem was that ilist does not have a count property however icollection does

12829100
temp	tmp
i have set my tmp tmpdir and temp to a writeable folder via renviron.site

12829142
rss	feed
i ve written a little class in php to generate a simple rss feed

12829229
hide	show
i did find that i could make the date-picker control close up by calling its hide and then show methods

12829260
try-catch	exception-handling
i need to make it possible for the users to send me back possible exception-handling messages which i show by wrapping the main method into try-catch but that also forces me to see that custom message instead of visual studio s exception-handling window

12829307
hid	joystick
i have been searching through how to do gamepad and joystick support on mac for some days and all resources that i found seems to suggest a pre-installed driver along with using apple s hid api which works

12829307
hid	joystick
the drawback about this approach is that each joystick and gamepad will require another kernel extension to be loaded so it can be recognized by hid manager or at least a code less info.plist saying it conforms to the earlier installed driver

12829307
hid	joystick
since iokit api actually provided keywords like khidusage_gd_joystick and there s an forcefeedback.h library i suppose apple designed their hid api with joystick and force feedback in mind

12829347
min	max
i want to select all records where month 10 and max start_date from prev month and min end_date from next month

12829355
viewmodel	caliburn
basically in caliburn you don t need to work vith usercontrols or views directly but if you pick the viewmodel first approach caliburn framework should be able to find the matching view for you

12829355
viewmodel	caliburn
in your case since you re loading xap files dynamically you need to add them to the list of assemblies caliburn looks to find a view viewmodel and bind them together and this is done through iassemblysource interface

12829386
versioning	upgrade
now if system.data.sqlite.org would come out with a visual studio 2012 compliant versioning i can check off my other big upgrade task

12829398
fast-forward	merge
one way to accomplish this without needing to type --no-ff is to disable fast-forward merge into master entirely

12829398
fast-forward	merge
however this is clumsy since it also prevents fast-forward merge when simply merging upstream changes in master to a local copy of master merge commits are created for normal git pull s.

12829398
fast-forward	merge
is there some way to configure git to prevent fast-forward merge into master only when merging feature branches into master so that fast-forwards are allowed when doing git pull s from master but merge commits are always created when merging feature branches

12829403
put	get
you can only generate pre-signed urls to get or put an object

12829431
int	chars
so if i have temp table #data groupid int item chars with

12829439
min	max	range	max	range	min
if you want to set a whole range to get one same color instead of getting a gradient between your min max values you ll have to change the call to makecdata

12829488
google-chrome	firefox
this will allow the js fullscreen api to work in firefox and google-chrome

12829538
gif	png
the supported formats are png jpeg gif and pdf

12829541
next	except
when you actually start playing the video the next request will look like this everything except the range header ommited

12829565
jar	war
there you can find extracted war folder and jar if you add it to deployments folder

12829581
range	minimum
given a query i k you can now binary search mp for k in the range 0 i - 1 using indirection to get the actual minimum value from the minimum index

12829622
post	get
but there is a big difference if you do not specify the type - serialize will do a get and serializearray will do a post

12829653
width	height
i am using below steps to know the width and height of contentview on my display screen

12829668
isnull	nvl
using isnull or nvl or whatever the appropriate function is in your database could be appropriate there

12829676
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve tested this in google-chrome safari firefox and node.js

12829676
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox the first iteration is slower than the 2nd iteration

12829762
width	height
can anyone think of a way even with an image if necessary that i can increase the height keeping the width of the arrow automatically based on the number of lines the menu item takes up to achieve something like this

12829774
width	height
the image will fill the width of the container and its height will scale in proportion

12829786
margin	height
here s a solution courtesy of this question css 100 height with padding margin

12829829
google-chrome	firefox
this does not occur under firefox or ie just google-chrome

12829830
subclass	accessor
you can have your subclass conform to the uiappearancecontainer protocol and then mark the accessor with ui_appearance_selector in your header file

12829880
margin	height
you need to stop adding to the margin the moment value of combined with height of the #menu_border exceeds height of the body

12829930
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is just faster than firefox which just faster than ie at bit-wise operations

12829964
move	drag
to move a breakpoint drag it to a new location

12830026
typedef	struct
i also have a mygraph typedef map which takes in a struct as value type

12830052
int	double
when we try to print an int value with format specifiers that are used for float or double and vice the versa the behaviour is unpredictable

12830052
int	chars
but it is possible to use c to print the chars equivalent of the int value

12830052
int	chars
also using of d to print ascii value int representations of chars is acceptable

12830058
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it work perfect in firefox google-chrome and safari return object file but ie return a error because files in e.target is undefined

12830094
fgets	strtok
so read each line with fgets and parse it with strtok

12830100
exponent	addition
all you really have to do is work out how you should do the calculating of exponent and addition

12830143
width	height
it is possible to get the width and height of an image from the server

12830143
width	height
better yet you could use list to retrieve the width and height

12830143
width	height
list width height getimagesize path_to_image

12830143
width	height
whereas the first two returns from the array are width then height they are then set the the variables oddly enough width and height and you can use those to re-size your iframes

12830167
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox safari and google-chrome is another story you need some javascript to get it work

12830169
layoutparams	viewgroup
it looks like this method gets called to to assign a layoutparams object for each child in the viewgroup

12830200
post	put
updates to the user resource should use the put method not post

12830206
std	ostream
the logger has to act like a c++ ostream with operator except that a stream manipulator function std endl for example will indicate the end of the logger s output

12830210
width	height
i believe systemmanager has a mousex mousey property and you can find the new width height in the screen property

12830227
mouse	keyboard
i created a program that controls the mouse using the keyboard

12830227
mouse	keyboard
for example when i select another window of another program a browser word etc the mouse won t move when i use the keyboard

12830237
implements	sealed
if the class is sealed it may implements iequatable for its own type in addition to doing the above

12830237
equals	gethashcode
with regard to your particular class i would suggest that since there are only 65 536 possible distinct instances you should simply store an integer which identifies which combination of bits is used compare that in equals and return it for gethashcode

12830242
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in google-chrome and firefox

12830251
post	get
when you click the new post link you are doing a get request on the page so the form is unbound and the initial value is used

12830279
put	get
the problem is that both the invoice_number and credit_memo_number get put into the invoice_number variable

12830289
hash	md5
md5 is so badly broken that it no longer takes so long to find an appropriate collision or reverse hash

12830299
children	parent	serializable	deserialization
sample code using redis-py assuming you already have redis and ideally hiredis installed saving each parent as a hash field with the children as serializable strings and handling serializable and deserialization on the client side

12830317
int	chars
for example chars are promoted to int thus printf c really expect an int which it then casted to an unsigned chars

12830317
int	chars
passing an int directly has the same effect as passing that int casted to an unsigned chars and is therefore safe

12830344
google-chrome	firefox
it s a lot like mechanize but controls actual browsers like google-chrome firefox so it will be a legitimate browser request

12830345
submit	submission
it s been changed in the new living html specification so that a submit event must not be dispatched if submission is from the form s submit method

12830376
atomic	interlocked
you don t have to wait for c++11 support in your compiler though most platforms provide some platform-specific atomic operations that also include any necessary memory barriers gcc s __sync built-in solaris atomic operations or win32 s interlocked functions

12830399
int	boolean
for holding down use a boolean int to record whether your game loop should increase or decrease i

12830408
nsobject	ivar
for instance i have a class myclass which inherits from nsobject it has two methods of interest setarg and getarg which set and get a float ivar

12830441
post	get
the http request will be a post instead of a get when the data parameter is provided

12830483
google-chrome	safari
this is a known issue with macintosh text rendering on google-chrome 22 and apparently safari

12830492
integer	unsigned
if is not representable it becomes complicated i think the easiest way except for using a big integer library of course would be to compute the high and if necessary low 64 or whatever width unsigned long long has bits separately by splitting the numbers at half the width and compare those

12830508
mouse	keyboard
the kcganyinputeventtype eventtype will report the last timestamp for any input event keyboard mouse or tablet

12830520
debian	linux
i m running linux debian and php5

12830541
division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
note that the addition is not the trickiest operation to implement wait till you hit multiplication and division

12830547
touchesbegan	touchesended
i m wondering if someone knows how to implement the touch up inside response when a user pushes down then lifts their finger in the touchesbegan touchesended methods

12830581
touchesbegan	touchesended
you can implement touchesbegan and touchesended by creating a uiview subclass and implementing it there

12830608
daemons	systemd
i recently experienced a similar issue in v8 on a production box and what we think was happening was the network time daemons was changing the systemd s clock -- as it s designed to do

12830615
width	height
the obvious problem with this is that the width of the rotated element grows along with the height of the parent element

12830629
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works in ie 9 firefox safari and google-chrome however it looks a little bit funky in opera there maybe a fix

12830688
width	height
currently i am using the following to set height and width

12830688
width	height
the only conclusion i ve come to is that this is setting the height and width like this

12830705
centos	linux
bigcouch 0.4.0 couchdb 1.1.1 erlang r14b04 linux version centos linux release 6.0 final on ec2 and centos release 6.2 final on vmware 5.0

12830716
inherited	properties
i was thinking about having all my objects inherited from a class called xmlserializable which would accept a struct as a single argument in the constructor and then assign all the values contained in the struct to the correspondingly-named properties

12830716
inherited	properties
but this doesn t work because if myclass inherited xmlserializable the code in xmlserializable isn t allowed to set the private properties of myclass related to how can i write generalized functions to manipulate private properties

12830724
post	put
say if i put in the search terms interesting and fantastic the above post should be there in the result set

12830730
width	height
regardless of the orientation of the device the width is the horizontal and the height is the vertical

12830730
width	height
i am pretty sure width should be before height

12830738
put	get
i ended up having to put the code for the ibaction in my prepare for segue method to get it to work

12830742
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
output in firefox google-chrome and safari is correct

12830758
inherited	properties
properties inherited from uiscrollview

12830789
folder	directory
the samples folder inside your openwatcom install directory contains a number of sample projects all with makefiles or build instructions

12830870
firefox	safari
also it would be nice to have a solution that supports ie but frankly firefox and safari are sufficient

12830871
freebsd	linux
this happens on linux and freebsd regardless of ncurses version and 32 64bit architecture

12830893
hide	show
hide row1 columng and rows and columns that show blank

12830897
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
on google-chrome safari and firefox 10 this rendered a full chart as expected which took up the whole white box

12830941
google-chrome	firefox
browser s i ve tested against firefox 16 and google-chrome 22

12830943
activemq	rabbitmq
and there s a lot of good choice these days such as activemq rabbitmq 0mq

12831039
hash	salt
i am trying to replicate the results of a .net function to create the sha-256 hash of a password + salt

12831115
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade to the latest versioning of geddy should be released tomorrow you ll be able to access the session directly from the template

12831116
width	height
scrolling can be applied to any element by adding overflow auto and fixed width and or height

12831125
width	height
you ll have to handle the degenerate case no height no width no depth no length no colour yourself

12831148
invokelater	invokeandwait
matter whether it uses invokelater or invokeandwait

12831151
folder	directory
you can get your total folder size and it sub directory like this

12831160
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
ios 6 uitabbarcontroller supported orientation with current uinavigationcontroller

12831185
width	height
you then know which images are at a clicked point by rectangle intersection - check your array of images and their x y points with width height for point intersection

12831196
implements	extends
the very first issue that i could find is the that you have declared a scale abstract method with no parameters but when you are extends the abstract class you are implements the scale method with parameters

12831213
opencv	emgucv
if the reason is caused by the format is not recognized by windows 8 store app does re-compile the whole dll project the opencv source code is in c++ and emgucv which acts as a wrapper is in c# under windows store - class library windows store apps will help

12831215
hide	show
the new problem still related with the same thing which is the query did not specify session so different question across session might be mixed together i suggest you query out the sessionid in your select list for grabbing correct data and hide it on the page if you don t want show it however keep in mind you need to record that if you have some other detail page to show the question you still need to pass sessionid and questionid altogether to that page for identify the unique data

12831243
put	get
you can redefine the the whole style i mean put some other control to redefine the content and use templatebinding to get the external dependency property

12831267
post	get
once you get this permission you can then make a wall post using page access token

12831312
jython	pypy
other implementations such as pypy or jython can have completely different behavior in regards to the memory location of each instances in the above examples but all conforming implementatons including these 3 will behave exactly the same from the point of view of the python program 1 it does have access to the instances it keeps a reference to 2 the data of these instances is not corrupted or mangled in anyway

12831358
width	height
for example is just going to have an image url but is going to have the width and has the height

12831371
nscoder	nsobject
for example uikit has categories on nsobject nsindexpath nscoder and more

12831405
int	chars
create table esm etud int 11 sess int 11 modval chars 3

12831426
filtering	grouping
in the first grouping you filtering it to leave only the first n open stores

12831426
filtering	grouping
in the second grouping you filtering out the first n open stores and you set it to be hidden toggled by a text box in the first grouping - of your choosing

12831426
filtering	grouping
in the third grouping you filtering it to the first n closed stores

12831426
filtering	grouping
in the fourth grouping you filtering out the first n closed stores and you set it to be hidden toggled by a text box in the third grouping

12831426
filtering	grouping
you could drive the filtering of all four grouping with your parameter and all four grouping are in the same tablix so it has the appearance of one table

12831439
width	height
you still need to take care of managing your layout in snapped and filled scenarios and assign the width height of your viewbox and other controls to fit those

12831463
client-side	server-side
the good news is once you get your caching right it ll work server-side and client-side

12831481
freebsd	linux
another note i m doing this in freebsd which uses a different sed from what you ll find in linux

12831492
hide	show
a simpler alternative you could put all of the content on one page and give each section a unique id and a common class and then make the links in the nav correspond to the unique ids and with jquery hide the other content areas and show the one that was clicked

12831502
box-sizing	border-box	height	border-box
the wrapper div has height 100 box-sizing border-box and top and bottom padding equal to the height of the top and bottom divs respectively

12831502
width	margin
lastly middleleft is positioned absolutely and middleright has a left margin equal to its width which causes it to fill the remaining horizontal space

12831522
inherited	properties
but i can t figure out how to set the default properties of the editor control of an entire column nor the properties of a single row column editor which according to the documentation are inherited from the column s editorcontrol

12831571
int	boolean
type mismatch can t convert from int to boolean

12831595
hide	show
all working great now i need to hide the div#nivoslider from my index.php file so the slider will only show with the shortcode option

12831620
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome 22 but not in firefox 15 or ie 9

12831622
cout	cin
i ve added a couple other cout s just to see along the way what s going on and it appears my cin is only taking in the the part of the given text to read in

12831670
mouse	keyboard
to control the rotation with the mouse and keyboard it may be easiest to add a mousewheellistener to the jslider so that you control thumb rotation with the mouse wheel

12831712
pull	push
in that model yo can work offline and push pull back to the cloud

12831746
children	parent
a node can have multiple children but only one parent

12831748
oncreate	setcontentview
however if you desire you can customize the screen layout by setting your own view layout with setcontentview in oncreate

12831771
google-chrome	firefox
if all of this is true then it would seem that google-chrome s behavior is invalid whereas ie and firefox are correct

12831785
pbkdf2	hash
pbkdf2 is part of the .net standard library too so there s really no excuse to use a general-purpose hash function instead of a secure password hashing function

12831791
put	get
is there one function to put in 2 timestamps and get the range

12831799
bmp	png
supported image formats are png and bmp but you can easily add more

12831814
hide	show
i have the ajaxloader show and hide in my ajaxsetup like this

12831845
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in your case maybe you used a uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller as root view

12831855
awt	swing
everything worked well because i tested the classes before adding some gui components such as in swing and awt

12831865
put	get
i need to write a python script where i need to connect to a server 2 and get certain files files whose name begins with the letters hm from a directory and put them into another directory which needs to be created at the run time because for each run of the program a new directory has to be created and the files must be dumped in there on server 1

12831870
16-bit	64bit
yes 64bit windows cannot execute a 16-bit program

12831879
jqxhr	deferred
caveat - this will work as long as no call to was expecting it to return the jqxhr object and there is no use of ajax deferred

12831892
ccscene	cclayer
it will create an instance of gamescene subclass of ccscene with your two cclayer subclass instances as children those being the backgroundlayer and gameplaylayer you instantiate in the gamescene -init method

12831896
rss	feed
i m parsing an rss feed using nsxmlparser

12831896
uitableview	reloaddata
in parser didendelement etc as each new item appears i fire another method that invoke s a uitableview s reloaddata method

12831919
setinterval	settimeout
first off i would use the settimeout function once ajax request has loaded with or without error instead of using the setinterval function which does not take into account possible connection problems delays

12831930
superclass	subclassing
in a long run this will definitely pay off by not forcing you to repeat what have been already implements in superclass and keeping your subclassing implementations more manageable

12831939
chown	chmod
i made chown and chmod to var lib and data db and log mongodb

12832023
goto	break
if i insert conditional goto break statements after lets assume every line in each a.c b.c and c.c and jump from one file to another during the code execution have i implement a simulated threaded environment

12832031
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you had a touchevent trigger a mouseenter the second touch pattern start end end sends a mouseleave assuming you don t randomly via subtle tap differences trigger a click combo

12832046
min	max
what i want is that whenever max or min is changed i want all elements currently in the elements array to update their color

12832046
min	max
but when an element is added to the elements array i just want to set the color of that element but that requires max and min and so i dont know how to separate the calls properly so that min and max updates will call one and an element update will call the other

12832058
happy	alex
i always install alex and happy from my distro s package manager apart from ghc and then use cabal

12832084
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
in a subclassing you can overload the methods inherited from the superclass

12832084
superclass	subclassing
such overloaded methods neither hide nor override the superclass methodsâ they are new methods unique to the subclassing

12832174
uicontrol	uibutton
note this solution runs through the subviews of the searchcontentscontroller which is one of the reasons i used ismemberofclass instead of iskindofclass uibutton is a subclass of uicontrol

12832246
button	checkbox
here is an updated fiddle with your code fixed as well as an example with 3 columns i also updated the javascript and added button for toggling the checkbox

12832250
width	height
and in particular it used to be that lack of width and height attributes was treated as sort of equivalent to setting them both to 100 except it didn t really play nice with actually setting a width or height in css and had some other problems

12832250
width	height
so now the behavior is that if you set width and height those are treated like presentational hints just like width and height attributes for and if you don t you get the default 300x150 intrinsic sizing which you can then override with style rules as desired

12832307
accessor	properties
as a shortcut you can dynamically assign the object value using the properties accessor

12832336
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
use a for-loop to loops over your 1d arrays

12832336
for-loop	arrays
inside that for-loop you ll need to figure out where each value in the 1d arrays should go in the 2d arrays

12832337
content-length	content-type
besides setting the proper xml document as request body don t forget to set the proper headers soapaction content-type and content-length

12832357
post	get
the reason being within the logic of the submit function there are variables i would like to pass through to another page but it consists of complex data structures objects arrays etc which would not be appropriate for post get data

12832391
google-chrome	firefox
i tested when running on google-chrome or firefox except on ie

12832434
post	get
you ll need to add to your dropdownlist to get it to post back

12832449
pop-up	dialog
a pop-up not dialog so please tell me the solution for pop-up not dialog

12832492
ssl	https
from the help menu choose install charles ca ssl certificateâ https traffic

12832699
xna	spritebatch
you can find the shader that spritebatch uses internally in the xna stock effects download

12832699
width	height
client space goes from 0 0 in the top-left corner to width height in the bottom-right corner of the viewport

12832750
getter	setter
the better approach would be to use a for dynamic getter and setter and a for anything that isn t a getter or setter

12832752
subtraction	addition
j.2 undefined behavior - addition or subtraction of a pointer into or

12832755
width	height
even for reducing the forma sheet height and width you can use

12832778
affinity	processors
that said the way to really do this is to set the thread affinity mask which controls which logical processors the thread is allowed to run on

12832801
ng-show	ng-hide
i would like to use ng-hide and ng-show directives of angularjs

12832807
client-side	server-side
but in any case you should never rely only on client-side javascript check server-side check is a must and client-side is nice to have in addition to that

12833392
stdout	stderr
if you d rather not edit the build.xml it is probable that ant is using stderr rather than stdout

12833392
stdout	stderr
find out what shell you are using and look up how to redirect stdout to stderr

12833405
noexcept	throw
noexcept was added because it s the one reasonably useful use of an exception specifier knowing when a function won t throw an exception

12833405
noexcept	throw
noexcept was added rather than just removing all throw specifiers other than throw because noexcept is more powerful

12833405
noexcept	throw
if the boolean is false then the noexcept doesn t stick and the function may throw

12833410
noexcept	throw
when a function that is declared noexcept or throw attempts to throw an exception the only difference is that one calls terminate and the othe calls unexpected and the latter style of exception handling has effectively been deprecated

12833801
hide	show
i added a bunch of custom styling to a textbox and other than a little js to show hide the ajax spinner hopefully this will get you part of the way there

12833845
int	chars	int	double	free	malloc
you cannot malloc an array of int chars double or any other struct - there would have to be a malloc free pair for any type possible including your own structs

12833845
int	chars
where type is the type you want to malloc int chars struct... and x is the number of instances you want to malloc

12833845
free	malloc
the free method just takes the pointer from malloc and frees it

on checking the explain plan i see that it is doing a index full scan min max on the table

12834212
google-chrome	firefox
should be able to work with almost all the web browser like ie google-chrome firefox etc

12834237
pop-up	dialog
3 the next dialog that pop-up is vitally important - you need to 1 define that the stored procedure returns a collection of complex types then you need to 2 get the column info from that stored procedure to know what columns it will return then 3 you tell visual studio to generate a new complex type based on that column info

12834239

however you may try firebug plug-in in mozilla firefox or google-chrome browser its built-in dev

12834526
uiview	subviews
since segment control is a subviews of uiview this should work

12834564
google-chrome	firefox
either use the firebug plugin with firefox - you can insert breakpoints there or use google-chrome s debugger

12834641
width	height
the width and height of the webpage html is 356x405px the problem is when i convert it to a4 pdfs size 8.5x11.69inches the html shows very small in pdf

12834641
width	height
so i have to increase the width and height of the html to fit the pdf size while increasing the html size to 8.5x11.69in

12834641
width	height
the content inside the html should also increase proportionally ie the text font size background image images width and height top left should also be increased proportionally

12834645
implements	extends
if you implements say a new tablemodel by extends abstracttablemodel the new model must be serializable but what if it contains internal data types which aren t serializable and which don t have to be since you don t plan to use this feature anyway

12834711
post	get
but is complicated for a beginner.i suggest you learn how to make post and get request using qt and then start developing an automatic forum poster

actually you don t have to use width and height attributes they are deprecated

12834918
width	height
in this method change bitmap size as per your height and width

12834939
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in google-chrome but i want to make it work for firefox as well

12834947
strlen	realloc
i could write a fairly horrible loop that keeps calling strlen on data and counting until length bytes have been encoded appending a 0000 string every time i need to encode some more bytes realloc ing some buffer to accomodate each extra chunk of encoded data

12834994
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i thought it would be easy just doing with touchesbegan and touchesmoved

12834994
touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended
so i thought i could create two integers which to one i will set value to in touchesbegan then in touchesmoved setting the another and lastly comparing them checking if the move is in the same view button - if it is not then it calls the touchesended

12834999
kindle	nook

12835231
hide	show
with javascript you just have to hide the one div and to show the other

12835258
int	chars
malloc is a memory allocation function which primary job is to return pointer to starting address of the memory block allocated by malloc .the problem is that malloc is designed to be generic not for the any single type so the address return should not be for a specific type e.g chars int it should be generic so malloc returned a void pointer which is giving an option to programmer to cast it to any type and use that memory

12835258
int	chars
for free it a memory freeing function which primary job is to free the content of the memory address pointed by the argument this also designed for generic by which it can able to free any memory type not for only chars int etc.so its argument type is void

12835286
getter	setter
the manager must be the owner of the list and would need the methods setter getter and deleters methods

12835325
integer	unsigned
but your test in your for-loop will fail for the case when is zero because count returns an nsuinteger which is unsigned and subtracting -1 to 0ul creates an underflow as -1 interpreted as an unsigned integer gives you the maximum value of an integer instead because -1 is negative and unsigned integers can only store positive integers of course

12835325
for-loop	arrays
so when you don t have any contact and is zero you are entering into your for-loop anyway thus the crash when trying to get the object at index 0 in your empty arrays of people

12835327

i thought that entitymanager of singleton bean does not hold state of entities correctly if it is injected by multiple beans.i thought that same singleton bean instance must be get from connection pool

12835425
des	rsa
it uses rsa and des however you can easily change it from the code

12835436
post	get
response.redirect with post instead of get

12835562
super	extends	super	abstract
what you could do is make an abstract super class which all of your classes will extends and then make a list of that

12835562

temp	tmp
it will be slower but it will not run out of ram unless tmp is on ramdisk in that case you need to change where imagick writes its temp files

12835774
width	height
when this happens the div loses any css defined width height and the grid is broken

12835799
getter	setter
if you have getter and setter for pagetools then in jsp it is as simple as that

12835869
touchesmoved	touchesended	uicontrol	uibutton	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended

disk	ram
the goal is to make imagick put its pixel cache on disk instead of in ram

12835966

12836200
width	height
however a height maybe width and overflow rules need to be added to a containing element in order to stop the text wrapping under the image

post	get
i add that if your request is an http request then you will not be able to alter parameters coming from get or post parameters

12837222
post	get
these parameters are virtually added to all parameters via overriden accessors so setparam on a these requests with a get or post variable key as parameters will simply do nothing because setparam tests whether the key is present in the intrinsic parameters of the requets not http ones

even if you have no garbage collector you still have a memory manager which is what lies behind malloc free realloc and so on and new also for that matter

12838110
int	chars
this is probably due to the arithmetic conversion rules first any int type of conversion rank less than int eg unsigned chars will promote to int or unsigned int

12838110
int	chars
whether the result will be int or unsigned int does not directly depend on the signedness of the original type but its range int is used even for unsigned types as long as all values can be represented which is the case for unsigned chars on mainstream architectures

12838110
int	chars
i would imagine that in the first case the compiler thinks i have a comparison operator whose operand types are unsigned int and unsigned chars

keyevent	onkeydown
within one of your own activities override methods like onkeydown examine the keyevent to see if it matches and start the activity if it does

it will look for a div for each of the options with all spaces removed from the text and perform a slideup for all non-selected ones and a slidedown for the selected one

12838158

ideally you would give each of the divs to show hide a class that you can use to hide them all and then it becomes easier to just show the one relevant one

12838159
pop-up	dialog
the error you have is due to a cross-domain request the pop-up is known as the cross-domain data access dialog

getter	setter
you can specify the property on the interface but you can t enforce whether getter and setter are used like this

12839104
getter	setter
in this example the interface doesn t force the class to use getter and setter i could have used a property instead example below - but the interface is supposed to hide these implementation details anyway as it is a promise to the calling code about what it can call

inherited	properties
in the oop world what you have implemented in terms of a type properties would normally be implemented via inherited

12841233
free	malloc
no without manipulating memory explicitely malloc free

12841233
free	malloc
if you need to modify the array dimension at run-time use std vector because it saves you from dealing directly with malloc and free

12841272
typo3	fluid
check typo3 sysext fluid classes viewhelpers translateviewhelper.php for sample of correct inline usage so for an example setting your label as a default value of the input field would look like this

12841278
int	chars	unsigned	short
arithemitc types covers int and floating types 6.2.5.18 and finally int types are chars short int long and long long which exist as signed and unsigned types 6.2.5.4 and 6.2.5.6

12841293

i m using chromium 18.0.1025.168 developer build 134367 linux ubuntu 11.10

12841554
put	get
then can t be a subtype of because you can t put any object of type base into a but can t be a subtype of because if you get an object out of a it might not be a derived

12841554
put	get
edit and if you had a collection that you could neither get data from nor put data into then it might be both co- and contravariant

12841555
post	get
when i press search submit button in the form then post data is sent to that script and i get search results

12841555
post	get
after login i get that page but no post data is sent to that page

12841622
width	height
i have noticed that _mousedrag method of resizable sets width and height to their actual values in the dom element s style attribute

12841683
post	get
then i get post query with code and signed_request arguments

12841703
getter	setter
to answer your original question you need to have a static variable that have static getter and setter

12841788
int	chars
thus in the c abstract machine unsigned chars values must be promoted to int before arithmetic is performed

12841788
int	chars
there is an exception for perverse machines where unsigned chars and int have the same size

12841788
int	chars
in this case unsigned chars values are promoted to unsigned int rather than int

12841788
int	chars
in this case using unsigned chars arithmetic to do the addition could yield a different result than converting the values to int and using int arithmetic

12841788
int	chars
e.g. if a is 250 and b is 200 then their sum as unsigned chars values is 194 250 + 200 256 but their sum in int arithmetic is 450

12841800
min	max	range	max	range	min
2b a combo of datum 1 comparison plot 2 plots sharing a combined range max min y of both

12841810
spaces	delimiter
my solution in the end was to hide additional data in the id tag separated by some sort of delimiter one underscore is a spaces two is the end of that arg the second arg there is an id

12841907
min	max
even easier is to use max and min

12841931
istream	getline
how can i verify that std istream getline reached the delimiter instead of just max-ing out the input buffer

12841944
getter	setter
yui compressor doesn t accept ecmascript features like getter setter

12841945
google-chrome	firefox
you can this post use in firefox google-chrome browser

12841966
inherited	properties
or if by stuff you don t need you mean inherited properties methods of your object you can check that with object.hasownproperty

12841969
hide	show
what i would like to do isâ to hide show a view when i click on the button and toggle the state of the button changing his text

12841969
hide	show
it hide show the view but it does not change the text on the button

12841984
post	get
i assume to use urlfetchapp.fetch url to get the image and getcontent to get the file but i can t find how to send post write the file to a server storage

12842102
textview	imageview
it is possible to add my own customized controls buttons textview imageview on the actionbar

12842106
int	double
define sum as int and average as double

12842161
sum	coalesce
or use right join and group on s.id in both case use a coalesce on sum t.points if you don t want null values you must also check for null transaction datetime or use the date predicate in the join

12842185
calloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	calloc
and free is called only if you need to free memory that you have allocated dynamically in the heap using malloc or calloc - which is not the case in your code

12842188
jar	war
on the other hand if you use an application server like tomcat you can either package the jar inside the war of your application of place it into a shared library folder of the server

12842196
free	malloc
you can only free memory which has been allocated using the malloc family of calls

12842196
calloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	calloc
1 you only need to free s if it was allocated using malloc calloc or another call from that family

12842283
filtering	grouping
the easiest solution is to move the filtering upstream can you put the filtering on the dataset instead of the tablix grouping

12842295
textview	imageview
it is possible to add my own customized controls buttons textview imageview on the actionbar

12842332
int	chars
would make sense and means take the second chars of the first in argv . imho the code is trying to detect a -q command-line flag and subsequently setting testnum to the int version of the next argument blindly assuming it is present but it s skipping checking for the - and blindly assuming it s there and no other arguments would ever have q as a second chars

12842333
implements	extends
i just tried extends socketchannel but it seems that socketchannel have some new api methods available starting from jre 1.7.4 problem is if i implements those methods my jar would throw the following error whenever i m using java 1.6

12842359
hide	show
external modules are useful in sense they hide the internal statements of the module definitions and show only the methods and parameters associated to the declared variable

12842360
google-chrome	firefox
why does this not work in ie8 but just fine in firefox or google-chrome

12842399
ggplot2	lattice
i m not sure if i understand the problem and you asked for a lattice solution but i thought it may be helpful to see this done with ggplot2

12842408
google-chrome	firefox
everything works correct in google-chrome and even ie but it doesn t work in firefox 15.0.1

12842425

integer	unsigned
â an object or expression with an integer type whose integer conversion rank is less than the rank of int and unsigned int

12842451
int	chars	unsigned	short
conversion of the various kinds of chars or short or _bool to int or unsigned int

12842470
children	parent
i have a parent model which hasmany children which belongsto the parent

12842470
children	parent
so a parent will have many children

12842489
thin	webrick
so i ve switched from my standard webrick server to thin evented server

12842536
width	height
again this works because i have defined the height and width of 1 1 square container

12842536
width	height
with responsive we can t define the height of the square container because the width changes

12842551
hide	show
in your html you d use those scope items to set show or hide your areas

12842551
ng-show	ng-hide
one thing to note is that ng-show and ng-hide are simply not displaying the html.

12842638
mouseup	mousedown
however in any other event mousedown slide of another slider mouseup click anything.. it does not respond

12842662
linefeed	delimiter
i think imap uses linefeed at least for some of its message delimiter

12842699
textview	imageview
small things such as a textview having an image source would be resized to the image in older versions of android but the image size being ignored in android 4.0 because it thinks you should just use an imageview instead

as you can see when comparing ios hmac and php hash they contain the same characters but once you base64 encode this the result is not the same

12842790
implements	extends
if you are calling a method whose parameter implements any type then you must ensure you generic type t implements extends that type

12842795
datagridcomboboxcolumn	datagridtemplatecolumn
i personally fought with datagridcomboboxcolumn for long time and i think the way is to use datagridtemplatecolumn

12842822
prepare	execute
prepare statements with bound parameters are not only more portable more convenient immune to sql injection but are often much faster to execute than interpolated queries as both the server and client side can cache a compiled form of the query

12842910
prepare	execute
in theory this should append -dskiptests to the arguments that the prepare and release goals pass to the sub-executions of maven that they execute

12842913
for-loop	arrays
your mapitems wasn t displayed in twig because you have to make your for-loop on pagewithmapitems.mapitems if you do it directly on pagewithmapitems it ll not work because your pagewithmapitems variable contain un object of page and not an arrays

12842919
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the most baffling thing is that the font works correctly in ie 9-7 but not firefox google-chrome and safari

12842930
temp	tmp
it is accessible via either drupal.respirometry.org or respirometry.org which have slightly different openbasedir settings so my options seem to be either set the temp directory to tmp or to change the openbasedir settings on both sites so they can access each other s temp directories

12842937
put	get
i put it all together to get this

12842959
rss	feed
it is the same problem for the links to rss feed

12842961
hash	salt
for the second part since you re authenticating your users you should also be worried about how you store their passwords use some one-way cryptographic hash for that with a salt

12842961
hash	salt
and check if calculating the hash again from the user-entered password using the original salt matches the database entry

12842971

imo flex and mxml is essentially just a markup language for actionscript

12843101
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
when you create your own ami from one of the amazon predefined beanstalk images and you don t actually make any changes to the file system install anything create files etc. amazon-web-services will not create a new snapshot while creating a custom ami

now my question is how can i create an object and call a method of motors class which is in war inside customers class which is in jar

12843142
post	put
i put some comments though to make it simpler it might be a tad to long for stackoverflow but i ll post it here anyway

12843382
put	get
i cannot just put it into the topic again since all subscribers would get it then

12843384
min	max
i don t know the reasons for the design decisions made in mysql but considering that you can get the actual related data from the same row s as the aggregate came from max or min with only slightly more work i don t see any advantage in returning additional column data from arbitrary rows

12843395
post	get
if you only route for a controller for instance comments id then you only need to use params id to get the params but if you have multiple controllers and multiple id s involved and accessible then it would be something like post id comments comment_id to avoid confusion between which id you accessing

12843439
folder	directory
then inside that directory there will probably be a folder with the database name

12843450
hide	show
the code essentially just show hide the given div

12843453
bash	zsh
i experience the same behavior regardless in iterm2 terminal and while using any of zsh bash or a normal login shell

12843467
dbcontext	objectcontext
when using ef code first it appears wcf ria services wizard that runs when adding a new domainservice in vs 2012 does not recognize the dbcontext defined in the project it only recognizes the objectcontext

12843470
equals	gethashcode
to change the equality behavior you need to override equals and gethashcode

12843489
equals	gethashcode
either override equals and gethashcode in your car class or define an class and pass that to contains

12843500

i was surprised to see that the generated code inherited from objectcontext ef 4.x style rather than dbcontext ef 5.x

12843517
inline	inlining
and then inline this in user modeladmin but i want to achieve the opposite effect something like inverse inlining displaying the fields of the model pointed by the onetoone relationship user in the page of the model defining the relationship userprofile

12843540
sorting	grouping
a key to make this work was figuring out how to inject my collectionview with proper sorting definitions and grouping definitions into my datatemplate

12843543
width	height
the reason mainframe.repaint forces the map to refresh is because repaint calls repaint 0 0 0 width height which marks the entire mainframe s area to be marked as dirty for the repaintmanager

12843547

everything sdl does has a language localization globalization aspect to it

12843558
google-chrome	firefox
i also tested firefox it also worked fine the issue is only with google-chrome

12843624
client-side	server-side
this is absolutely impossible to call a javascript client-side function from within c# server-side code

12843624
client-side	server-side
server-side code renders the client-side code

12843624
client-side	server-side
but for asp.net provides you a hook that actually transforms client-side html controls most html tags into server-side controls as the .net framework supports and then you can access their properties and some methods which only invoke at server-side

12843624
client-side	server-side
anyway using ajax at client-side you can still invoke server-side methods using ajax.net and or ajaxpro ajaxpro.info or a custom javascript lib jquery

12843648
hide	show
then you can use js as i prefer jquery to show the div or hide the div when applicable

integer division and modulo of a and b giving q quotient and r remainder respectively will always return numbers that satisfy and and q have the same sign and

12843827
uitableview	reloaddata
the correct way would be to modify your datasource to claim n-1 rows when you want to remove one then call uitableview reloaddata to have it regenerate the table and ask you for new cells for each visible row

12843850
wakelock	powermanager
you solve the problem by getting a partial wakelock from the powermanager which keeps the cpu from sleeping when the screen goes off

12843854

12843880
pull	push
so i do git pull origin master and then i can go and do my git push origin master this is all fine and dandy but then i get a secondary commit about me merging branch master how can i do this so that i can pull in new files so i can push again but not get the annoying merge commit message on github

12843926
superclass	subclassing
in fact you don t need to type cast explicitly from a subclassing object to a superclass reference

12843926
superclass	subclassing
but when you create an object of subclassing and make reference of superclass point to that object then compiler never has an problem with that

12843927
versioning	upgrade
if you do that you will run a strong risk of your code breaking if you upgrade your compiler build with a different compiler build a debug versioning instead of a release versioning etc etc

12843928
google-chrome	firefox
the page does not work in google-chrome but does work in ie and firefox

put	get
it sounds like you want to use an ng-repeat and index to get the index of the item to put in the form input field s name

12844364
int	chars
i thought the #define matched up the variable type with the input so if i put in an a #seed would be a chars and if i put in a 1 #seed would be an int

12844390
int	double
although matlab uses double everywhere you should try to use int data types when possible

12844390
int	double
differently than in c a cast of double to int implies a round operation

12844461
ant	maven
note visualstudio and msbuild will always run a makefile project - it does not check the timestamp on the output file but instead punts that job to what it expects to be some other build tool nmake cmake make ant maven etc.

12844461
pop-up	dialog
visualstudio always running makefile projects also means that every time you press f5 to debug your project visualstudio will annoy you with a poorly worded pop-up a dialog box if you haven t told it not to telling you that you your project is out of date and that you must build it again

12844494
int	chars
i maped them tostring to get the actual value when applied toint and not the int value representing the chars returned by tolist

12844711
folder	directory
is there a function in std boost filesystem or any other cross-platform library that can tell me given a string whether it is a legal directory path even just syntactically meaning it doesn t have to check if there is already a file or folder with that name but without creating the directory and deleting it in order to check

16-bit	64bit
it seems unlikely that any 16-bit machine has any hardware support for 64bit operations

12844820
16-bit	64bit
if the machine has no support for 64bit types it s possible to implement it in assembly language c or whatever other language you use using 4 16-bit hardware registers

12844820
x86	64bit
the machine may have no support but maybe someone has already written libraries that implement it this was is the case with the old x86 systems which had good libraries for 64bit floating-point type double

12844820
16-bit	64bit
the machine may have some 64bit capabilities the 32-bit arm has a command smlalxy that multiplies 16-bit numbers and adds the sum to a 64bit number

exponent	modulo
i have been researching this and have found rsacryptoserviceprovider but for encryption decryption that seems to want the key to be in an xml format with a modulo and exponent

12844839
exponent	modulo
my question is is there a way to generate the xml format with modulo and exponent using the data i have or is there another way i can decrypt the string using the data i have

12844844

this renders in ie7 ie8 firefox google-chrome

12844885

as a general rule don t upgrade your haskell platform or ghc until you know that all of the packages you rely on support the new versioning

12845067
post	get
the website doesn t have an api that i can find so i m trying to submit an http post request to their .aspx form and get a response back that can then be stripped and stored in an ios table view

12845067

i have the uiwebview setup and have tried composing various post requests but i always get the default page back

12845099
versioning	upgrade
i regret to say that you cannot upgrade your device to an older firmware versioning like ios 4.3 for which apple is not providing signed shsh blobs anymore

12845111
integer	unsigned
in this buffer blob there are unsigned 16bit integer numbers each distributed over two entries in the buffer

12845171
division	modulo
the modulo calculates the remainder after division

12845181
division	modulo
the modulo returns the remainder after integer division

12845209
int	chars
so if the high bit of is set it will be a negative value and when you use it in an expression it will first be promoted to a negative int effectively propagating the high bit of the chars into all higher bit positions

12845209
int	chars
the reason that -ing with 0xff works is that the chars value is promoted to int before the operation is performed

12845242
winpcap	libpcap
the byte order of data in packets captured by libpcap winpcap is the byte order in which the data is transmitted on the network

12845242

libpcap winpcap supply raw packet data except for pseudo-header information such as radiotap radio headers which don t appear on the wire and are in whatever byte order the software that generates them use little-endian in the case of radiotap

12845345
public	protected
also remember if you want your children classes to inherit this variable from your base class you will need to set it as either public or protected

12845365
public	protected
there are 4 of them public default protected private

12845365
superclass	subclassing
another thing to be noted is that a subclassing can override the superclass method if this method is not private

12845387
rtp	rtsp
i don t even know how you are sending them over rtsp there is no rtp payloader i am aware of for mov mp4 format

folder	directory
you could compile your source files to object files in different directory folder is not really the appropriate word on unix

12845438

originally called wgf 2.0 windows graphics foundation 2.0 then directx 10 and directx next direct3d 10 features an updated shader model 4.0 and optional interruptibility for shader programs

12845571
inline	inlining
the inline on the changebits function means that that definition is to be used only for inlining

12845577
public	protected
public keys are not sensitive information and may be known to anybody whereas the private key needs to be protected very carefully by a strong passphrase

12845584
inherited	properties
should you by accident have any inherited different css line-height properties the solution to set vertical-align -5px will need to be re-checked and re-adjusted every time

12845590

client-side	server-side
client-side app and server-side app are placing on different hosts but both domains are added as domain of app on facebook developers site

12845742
ready	each
one the client side the loop would examine each chunk of data for the keyword and if it found it then whatever is in the buffer would be written to file and the buffer reset ready for the next file

12845803
16-bit	64bit
the main usage of the mmx instruction set is based on the concept of packed data types which means that instead of using the whole register for a single 64bit integer two 32-bit integers four 16-bit integers or eight 8-bit integers may be processed concurrently

12845817
google-chrome	firefox
i m having problems with setting validations date format google-chrome in asp.net mvc for other browsers like ie firefox works correctly

12845868

unfortunately because keydown keyup do not show the ascii characters i can t use these events without having to write some sort of parsing algorithm

12845963
submit	submission
note that this won t prevent people who intend you ill from submission other things - jquery validate sits on top of the form and it s possible to submit stuff underneath it with a bit of hackery - but it will make sure that everyone who s trying to do the right thing is guided to the proper path

i need some suggestions on performance tuning this script which reads url headers dumped by the proxy on a temporary ram disk it reads the file and appends it to a list after some checks it reads the list and if the line contains user-agent redits and is flushed out using standard output.

when a new versioning of the app is released i d like to be a little smarter about copying files over during the upgrade process

12847017
min	max
also in your code it seems the min and max values are mixed up

12847027
inherited	properties
on the other hand sometimes a group of properties are only relevant to a subset of items that cannot be expressed via single inherited

12847064
mouseover	mouseenter
try with mouseenter instead of mouseover so it will only fire when the mouse first enters the element and not every time the mouse moves

12847168
onkeyup	onkeydown
i get the same result with onkeydown and onkeyup events as well

12847173

you may get even better performance if you put the limit 0 5 inside the reply_date subquery

utf8-decode	percent-encoding
when tidhttpserver decodes the arequestinfo.document in d2009 and later it requires percent-encoding data to decode into utf8-decode data which is then decoded into the final unicode string

12847495
utf8-decode	percent-encoding
in utf-8 the ã character would be utf8-decode as and thus percent-encoding as c3 b6 not f6

don t assume that because you re accepting an nsstring that it s not actually an nsmutablestring

12847502
for-loop	loops
i have been using for-loop while loops foreach loops in scripts

12847522
width	margin
to center the container div and so have all its children appear centered you need to use margin-left auto and margin-right auto shorthand margin 0 auto plus a set width on the div applied through the class span8 in my example plus removal of the float property which is bundled into all span- classed elements

12847555
for-loop	loops
placing the count all in the for-loop makes it calculate this statement for each loops

12847596
implements	modifiers
when implements the facade pattern in java i can easily hide the subsystem of the facade by using the package-private modifiers

for-loop	loops
to the best of my knowledge there is little to no performance difference between while loops and for-loop i don t know about the for-each loops

12847609

the existing versioning of the solution has a reference to entityframework.dll which is the one i had to add to use the include method but the upgrade versioning i m looking at in vs2012 does not have such a reference nor can i find a dll of that name in the location it was on the other machine

error-handling	exception-handling
in the called context i.e the defaultfunction that throws the exception-handling i could of course meticulously try to catch all exception-handling but these functions are hot-pluggable possibly ranging in the hundreds in the end and i don t want to burden each of these functions with 100 full-proof error-handling

12847948

12848663

an app access token which you get from the client_credentials call above should give you completely public post but many pages are demographically restricted or the post themselves are targeted only at certain countries in which case you need a user access token to retrieve them

12848695
width	height
given a div or other tag is it possible to add a large responsive image above the tag think site banner that has a max width and height and then scales to stay at 100 of the browser width while the height adjusts automatically using only css

12848695
width	height
i was somewhat able to achieve the desired effect but the padding-top is dependent on knowing the ration of the height to width for the image

12848695
width	height
this method does produce the desired result but i cannot always know the height and width of the image

12848704
folder	directory
if you need more information you can either calculate the value based on the mail folder or save some more on nsuserdefaults or even create a plist file on your document directory

12848716
width	height
if you want to do this on your own you would make a div that has 100 width and 100 height and you could set .1 for opacity so you could see through it

12848718
google-chrome	firefox
in previous versions of ie and apparently google-chrome and firefox getelementbyid would check for an object with the given id and if it didn t find it it would take an element with that name

12848719
getter	setter
then of course i assign it the usual getter and setter like so

12848744
int	chars
i believe i need to get all chars before a + convert them into int and then get the sum of some array of those values

12848779
getter	setter
1 in rare cases it might be clever with accessors to use for side-effecting operations as it will invoke both the getter and the setter - and the setter may contain logic

12848795
spaces	delimiter
the latter can only use spaces to break up the command arguments and so is parsed as the command open followed by 2 arguments delimiter by the spaces

12848805

the first 3 tests pass but the last 3 all fail weirdly the user.active.should be_false test only fails if i put a sleep 10 after delete destroy up above but let s not get into that issue now

12860294

in citrix seamless mode the mouseenter event is captured but mouseleave is not so the approach of closing the window if user mouse is outside the window for x secs is not achievable

int	boolean
so apart from being bad for readability of your code using int or long for boolean can lead to errors in your code

12860429
listview	gridview
in your .aspx-file you create both the listview and the gridview but set the visible-attribute of your listview to false

12860429
listview	gridview
in the click-eventhandler of your icon you can then set the visibility of the listview to true and the visibility of the gridview to false and vice versa

12860441
stdout	stderr
if you use the processbuilder api you can merge the stdout and stderr streams into one using redirecterrorstream true so you can read both outputs in a single inputstream

12860441
stdout	stderr
if you read stdout and stderr as two streams you will need nio or two java threads

12860441
stdout	fflush	stdout	stderr	stderr	fflush	fflush	gets
if the child process doesn t fflush the output and you use pipes then this gets worse because stdout will be sent to your process in 4kb blocks while stderr will usually arrive line-by-line

12860441
stdout	stderr
one approach might be to use perl or similar to run your command in a pty this causes stdout to become line buffered read stdout and stderr from there and prefix each line with 1 for stdout and 2 for stderr

int	double
all nice and well but unfortunately the array that gets returned does not only contain the literal text strings but also primitives of type date int double etc

12861148
width	height
there s more to it than just swapping the width and height values

12861148
width	height
if i take a square then rotate it by 45â then swapping the width and height will do nothing - the image is actually sqrt 2 times as wide and high as it was previously the length from one diagonal corner to another is sqrt 1 2 + 1 2 times the length between adjacent corners

12861148
width	height
it s unclear if you d like to rotate by 90â 180â or 270â - i suspect so by the simple swapping of width and height though i can t be certain

12861161
width	height
i need to have a box div with some text over multiple lines and this box needs to have a fixed width and a fixed max height

either you can use the -l flag see either manual for the compiler - i am assuming that you are using gcc or g++

super	implements	super	abstract
i d suggest you to implements something like a cloneable but not the standard java one here it might be okay to provide an abstract method in your super class interface

12861712
public	protected	inherited	subclassing
a subclassing inherited all of the public and protected members of its parent no matter what package the subclassing is in

12861712
inherited	subclassing
if the subclassing is in the same package as its parent it also inherited the package-private members of the parent

12861712
superclass	subclassing
you can declare a field in the subclassing with the same name as the one in the superclass thus hiding it not recommended

12861712
superclass	subclassing
you can declare new fields in the subclassing that are not in the superclass

12861712
superclass	subclassing
you can write a new instance method in the subclassing that has the same signature as the one in the superclass thus overriding it

12861712
superclass	subclassing
you can write a new static method in the subclassing that has the same signature as the one in the superclass thus hiding it

12861712
superclass	subclassing
you can declare new methods in the subclassing that are not in the superclass

12861712
superclass	subclassing
you can write a subclassing constructor that invokes the constructor of the superclass either implicitly or by using the keyword super

12861712
inherited	subclassing
a subclassing does not inherited the private members of its parent class

12861712
public	protected	superclass	subclassing
however if the superclass has public or protected methods for accessing its private fields these can also be used by the subclassing

12861712
public	protected	inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
therefore a public or protected nested class inherited by a subclassing has indirect access to all of the private members of the superclass

12861807
inherited	subclassing
once the subclass-outside-the-package inherited the protected member that member as inherited by the subclassing becomes private to any code outside the subclassing with the exception of subclassing of the subclass.

12861968
width	height
i set a width of 194dp and a height of 64dp

12861968
width	height
why doesm t this affect the actual width and height of my imagebutton

12861968
width	height
when using the graphical editor to resize the button by holding shift and dragging the corner this doesn t change the width and height values in the xml but just adds margins

12861978
inherited	subclassing
once the subclass-outside-the-package inherited the protected member that member as inherited by the subclassing becomes private to any code outside the subclassing with the exception of subclassing of the subclass.

12861995
int	chars
so in your example you have a chars which of course takes 1 byte and an int which takes 4

12861995
int	chars
then with no padding the chars would be placed at 0x1000 and the int at 0x1001

12861995
int	chars
so now you have chars 1 byte padding 3 bytes int 4 bytes total 8 bytes

12861995
int	chars
like say you had three chars s and three int s

12861995
int	chars
then the compiler will add 3 bytes after the first chars to align the first int and then three more bytes after the second chars to align the second int

12861995
int	chars
that gives chars 1 + pad 3 + int 4 + chars 1 + pad 3 + int 4 + chars 1 + pad 3 + int 4 24

12861995
int	chars
then you d get chars 1 + chars 1 + chars 1 + pad 1 + int 4 + int 4 + int 4 16

12861995
int	chars
years ago i read the advice to always put the largest elements first to minimize padding first put longs then int then shorts then chars

fadein	fadeout
jquery has a very good and simple way of doing fadein and fadeout you can check their site to see

12862352
int	chars
in case of chars only one byte just needed by the data so no need of alignment as each byte itself is available in ram there are pages and each page size is 1 byte but for int we need 4 byte and no 4 byte is avail able or there is nothing called accessing 4 byte at a time so compiler making a alignment rule by which the int data are in the correct addresses

12862724
portrait	landscape
in the function you have defined the position of each object in your view for both portrait and landscape

12862724
portrait	landscape
if you use two uiviews one for portrait and another for landscape in one uiviewcontroller you would change that first part of the code to look like this

12862724
portrait	landscape
in the original you have to code for every object in this edited sample this code is all you need however you need to essentially allocate objects twice one for a portrait view and another for a landscape view

the blurry problem will happen if you use css to set the canvas height and width instead of setting height and width in the canvas element

12862966
int	chars
i know that chars short and int get promoted to int while long long does not get promoted

12862966
int	chars
this implies that when reading the varargs va_arg args int should be used for chars short and int while va_arg args long long should be used for long long

12862981
calloc	malloc
c difference between malloc and calloc

12862981
calloc	malloc
why does calloc require two parameters and malloc just one

12862981
calloc	malloc
essentially the calloc call would allocate the same amount of memory as calling malloc nmem size so all that s really happening is the asterisk is replaced with a comma

12862981

now we re moving into a situation where a column may be hidden in multiple reporttypes and i want to avoid getting into if report type val1 or val2 or val3 then hide as it will make it very hard to see for any given reporttype what columns are meant to be show as all the logic is in each column visibility expression

integer	unsigned
the latter can happen if int contains padding of if size_t is an extended integer type of same width as unsigned int

12863700
integer	unsigned
assuming integer representations do not contain padding bits you can cover both edge cases by reading an unsigned int variadic argument which will work on all reasonable implementations of the c language despite possibly being undefined behaviour

cpython	pypy
it s also not something that could be merged - the python implementation that is provided by pypy is generated using a framework they have created which is extremely cool but also completely disparate with the existing cpython implementation

12867292
cpython	pypy
there are some very concrete differences between pypy and cpython a big one being how extension modules are supported - which if you want to go beyond the standard library is a big deal

cpython	pypy
pypy is not a fork of cpython so it could never be merged directly into cpython

12867428
cpython	pypy
theoretically the python community could universally adopt pypy pypy could be made the reference implementation and cpython could be discontinued

12867428
cpython	pypy
pypy and cpython behavior is not identical in all respects especially when it comes to implementation details behavior that is not specified by the language but is still important at a practical level

12867428
cpython	pypy
cpython runs on more architectures than pypy and has been successfully adapted to run in embedded architectures in ways that may be impractical for pypy

12867428
cpython	pypy
cpython s reference counting scheme for memory management arguably has more predictable performance impacts than pypy s various gc systems although this isn t necessarily true of all pure gc strategies

12867428
cpython	pypy
for instance django can run on pypy and that makes templating faster but cpython s database drivers are faster than pypy s

12867428
cpython	pypy
for cpython most of the cpu-intensive game stuff is offloaded to the pygame library which pypy can t take advantage of since pygame is primarily implemented as a c extension though see pygame-cffi

12867428
cpython	pypy
pypy and cpython have radically different approaches to fundamental design questions and make different tradeoffs so neither one is better than the other in every case

when targeting a csproj file it will also look for a nuspec file with the same name as your project file myproject.csproj -- myproject.nuspec

12867712
nuspec	csproj
this means that you can add extra metadata to the resulting package by defining it into the nuspec file whilst still targeting your csproj file

12867712
nuspec	csproj
in essence you ll end up with a package containing the merged metadata from your csproj file and nuspec file

any ideas on why the following code perfectly posts when using firefox i can see the db updated but fails on google-chrome

12868422
width	height
can you not calculate it using width x height x colourdepth where colourdepth is in bytes so 32bit 4bytes

12868422
width	height
presumably you re maintaining aspect ratio so you just need to scale down width height until you find it less than 200kb

i get an error in the apache error logs chunked transfer-encoding forbidden

12868523
width	height
my guess is you don t set the height and width of your container to be stage.stageheight and stage.stagewidth you would obviously need to take aspect ratio into account when you go fullscreen

i have this code to show hide canvas with some text boxes and when i press a button it submits data from textbox1 to database

12868622
getter	setter
the getter and setter work just fine such as plan_action.actiontype.name will correctly pull from the related model

12868626
udp	tcp
yes that is a wrapper over the kernels tcp ip and udp ip which is a layer over ip which is a layer of wwan lan and ethernet which is a layer over something else but unless you need such incredible and exact performance i suggest staying in the simple stuff in userland rather then writing the kernel modules you d need to use anything lower

12868675
division	modulo
you can get the remainder of this division by using the modulo

12868676

rubygems	bundler
rubygems does not allows good control of gem versions but together with bundler it allows a lot better control of version compared to apt-get

12869605
getter	setter
what i think can help you a lot is something like the revealing pattern which would be a way of doing the getter and setter you mentioned plus more if you needed it

12869620
division	subtraction	division	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication
for the long division you will need your multiplication operator as well as overloaded less-than and subtraction operators and an append digit member function to perform the operation

12869652
int	double
it should probably be possible to write a code generator which takes a templated class and generates multiple instantiations for different types eg for double and float and int and string

12869658
post	get
maybe this will spark some ideas but if you post a bit more of your code i can probably get more specific about a solution

you could perform arithmetic multiplication by 10 and addition of a digit with hex strings

12870413
accessor	ivar
the problem here is that your accessor and your ivar have the same name

12870413
accessor	properties
here you re not using the accessor to access your properties you re using the backing variable directly so it never gets initialize

12870413
accessor	properties
you might want to change your ivars to something you won t be tempted to use or that will be immediately apparent that you haven t gone through the accessor like _managedobjectcontext or even _privatecontext or whatever will stick out to you until you get used to accessing properties through the accessor

12870413
accessor	properties
i don t like this method as people forget that it s not a direct properties access and it is using the accessor so they think it s okay to interchange the dot syntax for a direct access when it s not like in your case

12870942
getter	setter
this will bypass the property setter getter method and assign directly to the ivar

12870942
accessor	properties
will use the properties accessor method actually the setter

12870946
superclass	subclassing
it s important to pick one of your initializers as the designated initializer and make sure all subclassing initializers call the superclass s designated initializer directly

12870948
hash	md5
besides that your function does not return anything for and 0 the final hash value does only consist of the md5 hash values of the hexadecimal characters 0 â 9 and a â f which are

12870948
hash	md5
this is because their md5 hash value does begin the same octet

12871064
salt	md5
like already linked by nulluserexception in the comments you should not do it by just adding a static salt to md5 if security matters

12871064
salt	md5
both static salt and md5 are not considered very safe approaches

12871064
hash	salt
a common mistake is to use the same salt in each hash

12871064
hash	salt
just have to apply the salt to each password guess before they hash

note that the image must have equal width and height for this to work

12871140
width	height
if the image doesn t you can set the width and height with css as well

12871159
width	height
child div - this should behave like a word fixed width cannot be determined but has a fixed height as image height css can be applied

12871159

getter	setter
once yo get your head around this it might be better to create a seperate class holding this variable and any others you need and create private variable instead with getter setter methods

12875487
post	get
ensure that you never pass paths as user submitted data via get or post to download as that can expose you to a path traversal attack

12875494

you re better off using jax-ws soap or jax-rs restful or maybe even plain vanilla servlet

12875706
setinterval	settimeout
i would love create javascript s settimeout and setinterval like functionality for c++ without boost

12875706

versioning	upgrade
if you re using the versioning bundled with glassfish 3.0.1 or below you will need to follow the upgrade instructions

12875875
calloc	malloc
if you re sure that you are not using any heap-functions then some of your dependencies is using malloc calloc

12875958
folder	directory
you can also use a .gitignore file for folder containing cache data or generated files you don t want to track but for which you want to keep the directory in the repo

12875986
noexcept	throw
note c++11 introduced the noexcept keyword to indicate that a function never throw it s much more intuitive.

12876012
post	get
i ve tried countless ways but i don t even get a response from their servers when it comes to post

12876054
division	modulo
this would cause numbermax - 2 to equal zero and using modulo with a rhs of 0 invokes division by 0 which is undefined behaviour hence the fair probability of a crash

12876063
getter	setter
descriptors just provides access to class s attributes through getter and setter

12876095

viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you don t say where you re doing that currently but probably you can move the code out of viewwillappear or viewdidappear or something.

12876164
google-chrome	firefox
edit tested with google-chrome and mozilla firefox

12876166
int	chars
can you explain their relevance for both int and chars data type variables and arrays

12876180
calloc	malloc
viz malloc calloc

12876231
openni	kinect
personally i think simpleopenni is really easy to start with the nicest openni wrapper i ve seen if you re just started with kinect development and want to easily follow the making things see example it will probably be simpler to stick to processing with or without eclipse and simpleopenni

12876231
openni	kinect
a bit off topic it might be possible to actually use both the official kinect sdk and openni using a bridge library but i haven t used it myself yet so can t advise from experience

12876250
put	get
you have to put and get from it

12876286
post	get
one application always uses post someone wants to validate get parameters as well and a completely different application doesn t even have http requests but does want to validate input from the commandline

12876323

which is might be causing you a problem as you can t free the memory which is not allocated either by malloc calloc or realloc

12876350
pull	push
i cloned the repo so that i could develop in one directory and then push to the repo and then pull in the live prod directory would be interested in suggestions for a better way to do this if there is one but that s outside the scope of this question

12876355
serializable	deserialization
unfortunately there s no specification for the serializable and deserialization of dates in json so this is really up to you

12876358
pull	push
i then used update project in intellij to pull the latest changes from the central repository so my upcoming git push would not be rejected

12876382
rss	feed
hello there im trying to figure out how i can parse rss feed with vbs and display the contents into cmd

12876382
rss	feed
this gets 1 news rss feed from bbc

12876390
rss	feed
i have been dealing with a problem where my rss feed simple for-loop sets it into valid rss formatting has been fetched by sites to send the posts to twitter facebook and when it is fetched it is crashing my entire server

12876390
rss	feed
it s confusing because the rss feed loads perfect on validators rss readers in firefox s built in url reader and i can t seem to figure out why only when the feed are fetched will it crash my server

12876390
rss	feed
an issue with my rss feed

12876402
ant	maven
judging from my experience i did it several times when migrating project from ant to maven you should take all the jar files that your project used to depend on and convert them into maven dependencies groupid artifactid version

12876408
post	get
i have achieved this with a single post but can t get it to work with multiple post

12876423
postgresql	mysql
when the _conn is mysql sqlite or postgresql i want to be run the testtwo method

12876425
fold	catamorphism
yes i think it is a fold catamorphism

12876441
int	chars
one minor thing in c a chars constant such as x 0 or n is actually of type int not of type chars

12876441
int	chars
will store a null chars value in c the int value is implicitly converted from int to chars

12876441
int	chars
chars and int are both int types and you can freely convert between them

12876441
int	chars
the reasons for chars constants being of type int are historical

12876478
excel	listobject
the solution would be to pivot over a listobject instead of a range - in excel when you select say range and format as table from the ribbon the table that results will span

12876478
excel	listobject
in excel you turn a range into a listobject by selecting the range in question and clicking the format as table ribbon button from the home tab

12876503
folder	directory
and the two header files are located inside the include folder which again is in the root directory of the project

12876548
apache	nginx
if you are using apache mod_wsgi is easy to configure for nginx use the uwsgi

12876553

12876662
google-chrome	safari
edit this happens in google-chrome and safari try searching for london or toronto

12876748
devise	sorcery
now i decided to make that authentication much lighter and add some logging so i decided to move from devise to sorcery

12876752
ostream	istream
the stl uses the operator for output and the whole istream ostream class hierarchy uses this operator to input output

12876810
folder	directory
os.listdir works with other directory so the cause of the problem is obviously some strangely-encoded file or folder within f music itself

12876818
post	get
it is basically goes to accounts login url and i check if its get or post then do the try to do appropriate action

12876851
google-chrome	firefox
those you can see javascript works client side so unless it s all been minified to make things harder you can go through and look at the included javascript via the developer console in google-chrome or firefox or even ie argh

12876876
post	get
this blog post is more detailed but unfortunately does also not mention where to get the product key

12876876
post	get
i asked this question to a microsoft evangelist i have contact with and will hopefully get an answer soon that i ll post here

12876895
pop-up	dialog
after the error pop-up my app shows up blank on my phone for a minute and then shows a dialog to force close it

12876898
try-catch	exception-handling
assuming you re handling exception-handling using try-catch you can make sure the wireshark process is closed in the finally block at the end of your topmost try-catch statement

12876920
uiview	subviews
so if you would want a line on top of image you would need to add to imageview an uiview subviews class in which you have corresponding drawrect with line drawing

12876927
put	get
the function then goes to the function comparecars to determine what elements get put where

12876929
int	chars	int	double
bool byte float chars double int long string ..

12876969
width	height	portrait	landscape
let s say i have an image that take up 320pt x 480pt in portrait and 480pt x 320pt in landscape width x height

12876969
portrait	landscape
if we create a single image file at a 480pt x 480pt resolution instead of landscape and portrait files it would prevent the app bundle from having two files that which each contain 320pt x 320pt area of duplicate image data

12876969
portrait	landscape
landscape or portrait

12876969
portrait	landscape
instead of four files ip4 landscape ip4 portrait ip5 landscape ip5 portrait there would be only one file in the app bundle giant square

12876969
portrait	landscape
iphone 5 landscape or portrait

12876982
put	get
i even tried to put the expression in a cdata element but i can t get this to work either

12876996
instances	transient
while a transient instances of nvidiagraphicscard will not be a proxy

12877019
portrait	landscape
then it works but i can t do it because user can rotate phone to portrait landscape

12877040
pop-up	dialog
essentially i need a dialog or window to pop-up containing a string of text a close back dismiss button and possible hyperlinks within the text

12877040
pop-up	dialog
those hyperlinks in turn launch other pop-up windows dialog of their own

12877042
min	max
note we are using the default settings for min max pool size 0 100

12877051
postgresql	mysql
this is very likely how all the other dbms work as well at least considering the major ones postgresql sybase oracle db2 firebird mysql

12877070
setinterval	settimeout
the solution is to use settimeout instead of setinterval

12877070
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout is only triggered once but it is easy to tell it to trigger itself again inside its own function so you can get the same effect as setinterval but with much more control

12877090
stdout	stderr
just use print statements as you see from the above snippet hoping for supervisord to catch it and send to stdout stderr logs

12877101
google-chrome	firefox
use json if possible with google-chrome firefox or most likely ie10

12877146
strdup	strncpy	strdup	malloc	strncpy	malloc
then a note in createrecord i recommend the use of strdup instead of malloc strncpy and friends

12877148
int	chars
i m assuming you have a reason for representing int chars int as a string rather than just define a struct to hold the data

12877192
membase	couchdb
there are several reviews on that topic by thoughtworks and some in fowler s book and some in cassandra vs mongodb vs couchdb vs redis vs riak vs hbase vs membase vs neo4j comparison

12877269
portrait	landscape
my live wallpaper crashes when it s turned into landscape and then back to portrait several times in a row

12877273
for-loop	arrays
the easiest workaround would be using a copy of the original arrays in your for-loop as

12877281
hide	show
now i know when crashes if i tap the screen to show the button and tap again to hide it it works as many times as i want

12877286
cout	cin
or could omit the using and refer to std cin and std cout

12877292
google-chrome	safari
so far i ve noticed this in google-chrome and safari

12877301
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the video will play in firefox ie and opera but not in google-chrome or safari

12877301
google-chrome	firefox
if you scroll down about half way there is a video that works in firefox and ie but not in google-chrome

12877301
google-chrome	firefox
also the disqus comments aren t loading on the bottom in google-chrome that also works in firefox

12877333
stdout	stderr
in my case the problem seemed to be that stdout is buffered whereas stderr is not

12877370
versioning	upgrade
no idea why i couldn t get the aliasing to work in the httpd.conf but i noticed the apache files were all pointing to older versioning of the mac os webserver from snow leopard when i upgrade

12877397
cout	cin
mostly all standard library utilities are inside namespace std as for instance the variables cout and cin

12877435
post	get
my project is too complicated to post but with the simple test case below i get the following output and it makes no sense whatsoever to me the result is the same

12877483
folder	directory
then finally once you are able to code sign you need to use bbwp to sign and package the zip file generated by the build the zip is in the build directory of the phonegap folder

12877537
integer	unsigned
in other way you didn t need but for a performance save as unsigned 10 integer in database instead timestamp or date time

12877563
int	chars
you can t directly because a chars automatically gets promoted to int

12877584
put	get
when we put it all together this is what we get

12877631
jruby	mri
i have a script written with jruby and i need this script to be executed from rails app which runs on mri ruby

12877638
tiff	png
they are removed when the heatmap is transformed to an picture format like tiff or png

12877689
typedef	struct
i suggest to code like gtk does something like typedef struct cell cell_t and declare because you really want to remember that value is a pointer to cell_t

12877697
nsmutablestring	nsstring
client code can assign an nsmutablestring object to an nsstring property

12877743
put	get
what i do is get the 15 or so js files that we use put them all into one file and hash it and make the hash the file name

12877755
post	get
to get an impression of what boo brings on the table ayende s post are a great starter

12877790
fgets	fgetc
do the file input functions in standard c like fgetc fgets or fscanf have any problems with nul 0 characters or treat them differently than other characters

12877790
getchar	fgetc
can i use fgetc getc getchar instead

12877824
cmdlet	start-job
you could take a look at the start-job cmdlet together with get-job wait-job and receive-job

12877855
floating-point	fixed-point
for floating-point and fixed-point types m is the total number of digits that can be stored

12877884
jar	war
a war referencing the interface so the interface hello jar is packed in web-inf lib

12877884
jar	war
if i put it in jar file i need to put in in the first war web-inf to use it right

12877895
min	max
e.g. 220 360 180 0 min 400 200 580 max

12877899
hash	md5
i maintain a sequence number and keep incrementing it along with some other variables and sum them up and want to get a hash of the total i am planning to use md5 for this and then pick the first 32 bits of the output

12877899
hash	md5
i have thought of sprintf ing the total and then calculating the hash but would like to know if there is some function to directly compute the md5 of the numeric value of total

12877921
inline	inlining
why would function boundaries be important if inlining even un-provoked no inline could eradicate them anyway

12877945
portrait	landscape
every thing is okay with displaying data but when i change the device orientation from portrait to landscape and vis versa an additional number of rows is added to my table view

12877977
filesystems	fat
collecting your session if you are stuck with a fat filesystems or any

12878056
superclass	subclassing
if the non-parameter superclass constructor is not defined and if the subclassing s constructor doesn t set the superclass fields then yes they will be null

12878068
google-chrome	firefox
however that doesn t work and produce me this error in firefox and a blank screen in google-chrome and ie9

12878116
fgets	strlen
and you really don t have a reliable way to get the length since fgets doesn t return it to you and strlen expects a c string

12878137
ubuntu	linux
for example on my ubuntu 12.04 linux system the following command takes about a second to complete and produces the output shown below the command

12878143
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome works perfectly

12878198
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari or firefox and possibly ie you have access to the debugger console

12878251
post	get
so i want to get all stories post for a child

12878260
getter	setter
setter getter

12878271
alarmmanager	timertask
timertask does same thing as alarmmanager you can repeat certain action of your code again and again

12878273
public	protected
remember private protected and public are also simply methods and not keywords

12878291
postgresql	mysql
i m not sure about mysql but in postgresql ids are only allocated once from the autoincrementing sequence and will be unused if a transaction is rolled back or aborted

12878335
post	get
i can see that this is most likely because although iâ ve managed to get the url and the links to work showing the full path wp and hence the walker donâ t see the custom post type project as sitting below mediums mediums-term and so doesnâ t create the nav items required to show this state

12878356
for-loop	loops
what you can do is either have a while loops inside the for-loop that continues until that condition is met or continue the for-loop but decrease the count variable with one so a new character is generated with that index so to speak

12878497
for-loop	arrays
i tried to run a for-loop which declares say 10 char arrays but by printing their base addresses i see the same addresses for all arrays

12878543
free	strdup
declare servip as a instead of or if that s not possible strdup 127.0.0.1 in the second case just remember to free it later

12878599
width	height
i need to implement 2 mapviews one displayed on the entire width and height of the screen and the other on top of this map but will be smaller

12878625
put	get
this means that things get put on your stack and then removed from your stack before your code runs

12878651
mp3	flac
a is download a file from an ftp server. b is convert from flac to mp3

12878676
verilog	vhdl
i am looking at developing on an fpga but it would be easier for me to write the code in python or scala and have it converted to vhdl or verilog

12878676
verilog	vhdl
there are two open-source libraries that can help make this easier in development but i am not certain which would be a better platform to use to convert a program to vhdl verilog

12878680
mp3	flac
in what way does io fail to represent both the operations of download a file from an ftp server and convert from flac to mp3

12878700
innodb	myisam
whilst this doesn t help you on innodb it s worth pointing out that myisam natively supports this functionality

12878765
post	put
how i can include a css that i put in public stylesheets into a view file in app views post

12878782
subtract	add
to add damage union it with the old region to repair damage subtract it etc

12878791
post	get
you can t post to an external url and get a response

12878829
put	get
if there is a 404 i would like to get the url that was attempted to be put into a text doc

12878880
free	malloc
i know we can use malloc free in c to allocate release heap memory and use new delete in c++ to do the similar things

12878889
solaris	aix
the option nm -a includes the library name and member object file name on linux mac os x and solaris hp-ux and aix not checked in conformity with posix nm which explains the uniformity

12878917
hash	salt
because your 3rd argument is true cakephp will salt the hash with the value stored in your configuration

12878947
subtraction	multiplication
having that implicit multiplication rule creates an ambiguity with the subtraction rule is x - log x the subtraction of log x to x or the multiplication of x by -log x

12878947
cos	sin
what does sin 2x cos 2x mean

12879083
mouse	keyboard
i know that making such things from scratch requires basically mapping textures to quads like the buttons writing stuff on them and testing mouse keyboard events which trigger other events inside the code

12879088
post	get
since you are using from_post_id and to_post_id you will have to find a way to group the post_links for from post and to post to get the total set of post_links for a post

12879091
maven	pom.xml
i need to make this plug-in work without having to add anything in the maven settings file only in pom.xml

12879097
next	except
the next step is to select everything in a except those that exist in the previous result of 1 4 which leaves 2 3

12879103
min	max
i ve written this program in python 3 that takes a csv file that finds the min and max death rates for particular states

12879124
folder	directory
this works most of the times but fails if for instance that file is in a virtual host directory or in a linked folder

12879132
gridview	rowdatabound
enter code here i have a gridview in some code i inherited that is using rowdatabound to add javascript to checkboxes

12879139

in postgresql comparing a boolean and an int fails

12879147
client-side	server-side
use a server-side or client-side approach

12879167
maven	pom.xml
both worked for me with a fresh install of maven 3.0.4 with a bare pom.xml

12879194
public	protected
you ll need to make it public internal or protected depending on the relationship between your form and the other class if you want to update it from outside your form1 class

12879204
hash	md5
if records exist it does a foreach and for each instance of this class it calls another class to do a curl to grab an xml transforms it into md5 hash and compares the hash with the current database

12879215
hide	show
you may simply need to click the hide show document outline button in the xib editor

12879299
udp	tcp
other ip protocols such as udp do have a broadcast mode where one packet can go to multiple receivers but there is no such thing for tcp

12879305
ioexception	printwriter
also avoid using printwriter as it hides any ioexception that occur and you have to manually check instead

12879314
metaphone	soundex
write a script to go through all the professions and convert them to a representation using the soundex metaphone version

width	margin
hence you have to set the left position to 50 and then set the left margin to be negative half of the width of the element

12881581
width	height
since .language2 is a block element div you do not need to give it a width and a height

opera	google-chrome
all works fine into opera but google-chrome have problem when i have scrolling top align gets too much y pixels.

12882405
int	chars
pointers only shows to pointers not to values of int floats or chars

12882409
min	max
your program should calculate and print the avg max and min weights of these people

12882454
min	max
after you gather the data you can loop over this array to determine the min max and average

12882511
min	max	range	max	range	min
there is an array of integers i have to find the number of sequences of k length having range max - min of the subsequence less than equal to r .is there a relation between number of sequences of length k and number of sequences of length k-1

12882511
min	max
i was thinking of a deque like structure to maintain min and max elements of the array upto a certain index.however when k is closer to n this would become close to o n n which is too slow i am ideally looking at o n solution or o n log n solution

12882512
rss	feed
then it ll work with other rss feed

12882516
getter	setter
setter getter expose data type of those data member

12882516
getter	setter
if those data member have to change their type setter getter function member have to change their interfaces too

12882610
getter	setter
if you want to avoid writing your own getter setter manually each time you can easily using templates extend c++ to allow property like modifiers

12882622
getter	setter
writing setter and getter means you can validate accesses to the private members and you can change the underlying implementation for example by changing the internal data types without affecting any of the client code

12882671
src	attr
you should use .prop instead of attr to set the src attribute of those elements you create

12882773
lxml	elementtree
use lxml instead of the standard library elementtree

12882790
nsoperationqueue	nsblockoperation
i would create a nsblockoperation and add it to a nsoperationqueue

12882818
getter	setter
getter and setter are usually only useful when you do something more than just assigning a member variable

12882818
getter	setter
when your class consists of data which do not share an invariant basically the class just collects different values but there are no rules between the members you can argue whether getter and setter are useful

12882818
getter	setter
for example in the case of a date class you should really use setter and getter because the members day month and year share an invariant when month is incremented above 12 year should be incremented aswell

12882818
getter	setter
however in the case of a point class where x and y do not share an invariant you can skip the getter and setter unless you really want to make it an interface and use polymorphism

12882829
maven	pom.xml
if it s maven then the concepts are the same but obviously server-side we d be talking about pom.xml files instead of ivy.xml ivy supports maven repositories

width	height
i first suspected this is because there was 0 width and 0 height on the widget

12884615
width	height
however the cout in the constructor tells me that the widget is positioned at x 0 and width 1000 and so i assume that since that matches my resize statement that the height is also 1000 as was specified

children	parent
this means it is possible to create a tree structure where the v are the leaves and the parent nodes are the and combination of their children

12884781
children	parent
however this isn t necessarily helpful - the parent node only ends up testing the bits common between the children so if there are only a few of those you still end up testing lots of leave nodes

with this i get an error #200 this post wasn t created by the application

12885425
rsa	aes
this is done mainly for speed public key cryptography is very slow so encrypting files using an algorithm such as rsa will probably not be a good idea besides aes is supported on the chip these days in a lot of the intel processors so it would be extremely fast to use it that is what bitlocker is based on

is there a way to convert actual input int to double

12886195
int	double
i dont want to get string values and use isdigit to check if it is double or int

12886213
int	double
if you have an int value that you wish to turn into a double simply use a cast

12886242
int	chars
by the way i should note that there is the string.charat int function too which returns the chars at the specified place.

12886272
integer	unsigned
each element of data is unsigned 16-bit integer

you don t have to specify the #pagewrap height and width

12886342
int	chars	int	double
or you can take input as int or chars type and then typecast it to double

12886364
int	chars
the question i have to ask is why chars is behaving like a signed int

12886364
int	chars
even though we are typecasting to int before outputting the first line in the result why is chars showing values similar to int even when chars is 1 byte and int 4 byte

12886364
unsigned	short
unsigned short showed different value because its memory requirement was 2 byte

12886364
int	chars
but why is chars also showing the same value as if its memory layout was the same as that of int

12886379
int	chars
and in the output from the compare method you get four bytes shown because you cast to int for the output so the chars value -4 gets converted to the int value -4

12886385
int	double
the error message tells us that you ve declared calculatepkg_c double double double but you implemented calculatepkg_c int int int

for-loop	loops
i am trying to optimize a chunk of code where speed is very important and wondered if checking the int that holds the number of times a for-loop is about to loops and not doing the for-loop if it is equal to zero was any faster or slower than just letting the for-loop execute 0 times

12886808
int	chars
also the output class may differ based on the class of your list elements logical int numeric chars

12886814

12886847
getter	setter
you can avoid reflection by using dynamic methods or expressions to create a custom property getter setter based on a selector expression like

12886847
getter	setter
the only hard part is creating a setter expression from the getter expression the setterexpressionfromgetterexpression method above but that s a known solved problem

12886847
getter	setter
in this approach the cost of compiling the getter setter delegates from the expression is incurred only once when you create the action provider not every time you create an action or invoke redo or undo on one

12886865

children	parent
counting the number of children parent has having name child and checking if the child is the way i am thinking of going about the problem

12886902
queue	fifo	children	parent
i have code that takes a parent node from a queue checks if it has been visited if it hasn t generates its children pushes them to the queue and repeats the loop taking the next parent node from the queue in a fifo fashion

12886902
queue	fifo
changing q to a queue fifo data structure is literally the only change i have made to this code

12886902
children	parent
the parent children are stored as tuples so feel free to ignore all of that work -- that doesn t seem to be where the problem lies

12886911
awt	swing
also this example can easily be changed from awt to swing by replacing frame with jframe panel with jpanel button with jbutton and label with jlabel

12887108
min	max
a heap is usually used to answer questions that revolve around what is the max min element in the set

12887108
min	max
while a heap could coincidentally efficiently answer who are the children of the max min node a heap doesn t stand out as a good data structure to use when you need to access an arbitrary node to answer your question a node that isn t the max node

12887108
children	parent
it s also not the data structure to use if there are specific parent child relationships that need to be represented and maintained because the children can and do get swapped between different parent nodes

12887119
folder	directory
i need to do the same thing for each file exist in a specific folder directory

12887210

12887607
hide	show
when some clicks a button it hide the old content and show the new but it doesn t reset the browser scroll position and thus the end user will get a bit confused

12887760
division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
for example sandy bridge has 6 execution units p0--p5 floating point multiplication division runs on p0 floating point addition and integer multiplication runs on p1

12887760
division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
also division takes 3-4 times more cycles then multiplication addition and is not pipelined the execution unit cannot start another instruction while division is being performed

12887760
division	multiplication
so in test2 while the vector code is waiting for the expensive division and some multiplication to finish on unit p0 the scalar code can be performing the extra 2 add instructions on p1 which most likely obliterates any advantage of vector instructions

12887800
google-chrome	firefox
i did some reading that functions defined within the document.ready are ignored by google-chrome and firefox so i removed that declaration from the top

when using the pdf function in r for saving a plot in an external file we can specify width and or height to adjust the size of the plot

post the code so we can get better idea

12889694
post	get
my suggestion to you is never give margin specially from left aur right direction.because for example if you give margin from left to 50px than it looks ok in normal device while not look well in high resolution devices beacuse it will take 50px in any resolution device.instead of margin use this kind of syntax android alignparentleft true and always have a habit of using such kind of syntax inside ur relative layout.with ssuch syntaxes your elements will be always at the position in which you get desired..goto the android developer site and check what is a difference between linear and relative layout and what is different properties of linear and relative layout study all properties like a meaning of fill_parent wrap_content match_parent than 100 you will get solution.if you have any query than join with me here you can ask me your issue here.and i will suggest you to post your image

12889697

getter	setter
in the answers to how to implement a generate getter setter for a java class in emacs

12892424
getter	setter
there are several yasnippets that solve the problem of generating setter and getter as you create instance variables in java

12892424
getter	setter
however neither appropriately handles sorting of setter and getter methods as they are created

12892424
getter	setter
for instance if you have two instance variables and add a third between the current declarations the setter and getter methods will end up directly after the second instance variable with the declaration of the third instance variable following the methods

12892424
getter	setter
is there a way to write a yasnippet such that it will insert the setter and getter at the appropriate place with the same sorting as the declarations of instance variables

12892524

uilabel	uitapgesturerecognizer
you can use a custom view for your headers thanks to the uitableviewdelegate methods so you can provide a uiview containing a uilabel and the image of your or v and a uitapgesturerecognizer to handle the tap that will open of close the submenus

12893085

12894053
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
if you re doing any kind of 2d blending or 3d shading or almost any image processing then you want your intensities in a linear color-space so you can just add subtract multiplying and divide numbers to have the same effect on the intensities

12894053
floating-point	integer
it s becoming conventional to follow the rule that 8-bit colors are always srgb so you do your srgb-to-linear conversion at the same time as widening your intensity from 8 to 16 bits or from integer to floating-point

12894053
multiplying	add
yuv is a linear color-space so if you double the number in the y channel you double the lightness of the color but you can t add or multiplying yuv colors together like you can with rgb colors so it s not used for image processing only for storage and transmission

12894078
cpu	processors
browsing the web i came across a assembly instruction in x86 which is used to give hint to a processors that a spin-lock is currently running on this cpu

i also tried with mouseover hover and mouseout with the same result

12894405
int	boolean
primitive they are not called unboxed types such as int or boolean usually map to their primitive counterparts as far as my jni experience goes but as there are no structs they don t need to arrange

12894418
post	get
since i didn t get the required xml file and required entry for the url i counldn t actually understand what balusc tried to tell in that post

12894430

the wav format is supported by firefox 3.6+ safari 5+ opera 10.5+ and internet explorer 9+ on the audio tag

12895351
pop-up	dialog
create applications modal pop-up window based only on dialog becasue jwindow doesn t alloved input to the jtextcomponent with jtextcomponent implements there keybindings for esc key the same for lost fucus for dialog then could be undecorated without any issue

12895363
super	self
in case you do not want a separate foo instance - you want normal inheritance - there s no need to create an instance of foo simply call foo.__init__ self hello or super bar self .__init__ hello in the bar constructor and possibly accept the value as an argument instead of hardcoding it

12895397
disk	ram
this caused windows to write the whole db file to disk each time while linux would only update the buffered version of the filesystem inode in the ram

the elements children h1 are as standard behaviour positioned at the top of their parent

12895443
onresume	onpause
well first of all i think that the reason for the crash is a nullpointerexception and you should check what happens in your onpause and onresume

12895494
getter	setter	accessor	properties
this is just a guess can t test it right now because i m not on my own pc but your problem is probably related to the somewhat underdocumented fact that jython generates properties accessor for javas getter setter methods which clash with your attribute names and thus shadow your actual attribute

12895494
accessor	properties
both of these solutions should cause the attribute to no longer be shadowed by the properties accessor

12895516
post	get
or should i try to pass a data array to each view and then store the info in hidden fields then i can get the values again from the controller via post

12895559
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
more robust and even better is to use nscalendar and nsdatecomponents like

12895563
int	boolean
value boolean isselected boolean hasfocus int row int column

12895583
sorting	filtering
creating the new person removing the form sorting the grid filtering the grid grid paging..

that way you only really have one form on the page in terms of the html but you hide and show one page at a time with javascript

12895787
put	get
use get and put to store value to the local storage of most modern browsers

12895849

12895947
width	height
suggestion when you set x y width and height properties convert the values to int for performance reasons

12895963
put	get
you would initialise your object with a filename to put the finished file in and the url to get the file from something like

12895966
ant	maven
a further step would be to write a maven plugin we use maven for our build cycle or an ant script ant still has its uses... to do this and possibly make this part of our build process - you cannot compile the project without ensuring all of the save xml files in its sub-project also compile

12895984
acaccount	slrequest
however on ios the access token is never set directly by the app as this is all handled under the hood by the slrequest acaccount classes

two calls of eglquerysurface for getting width and height take about 10 microseconds 100 milliseconds when called 10000 times so it doesn t reduce performance and it give 100 guarantee that screen rotation will be handled

ant	maven
there are a number of approaches for that we have a maven plugin for it org.mortbay.jetty jetty-jspc-maven-plugin and i know there are ant tasks for it as well

12897439
width	height
note how the container #background is set to 100 width and height with a min-height of 730px and the image inside is set to 100 width but is given no specific height just a min-width of 1200px

12897439
width	height
this basically says that it will scale up and height will change in proportion to its width but the width will never go below 1200px so at that point the container will collapse around the image and hide the excess that doesn t fit within its area overflow hidden

12897492
implements	extends
i know that the normal way of implements a servlet is extends the httpservlet class

12897582

mouseleave	mouseenter
the codes works fine as the bigger image is showed on mouseenter and hides on mouseleave

12897674

since the image showed on hover can have dynamic width and height it depends on the image size.. i want to decrease the image width and height to 75 of the actual width and height

12897795
jar	war
the only solution that deploys in jboss as 7.1.1 is to copy a.jar both in the ear s lib location and in the war s web-inf lib but then i have two copies of the same jar in my ear

ant	maven
once you get used to this process it s better to automate it using a build tool such as ant or maven

12897955
ant	maven
ant is a little easier to begin with maven has some additional capabilities that make it a little more complex

12897966
mouseleave	mouseenter	hide	show
you could set the size back again when you hide it but my advice would be to calculate the values on document ready and only show and hide the image with the mouseenter and mouseleave events

12897982
mouseleave	mouseenter
it just undoes in mouseleave what you did in mouseenter

12897994
submit	submission
in order to change the submission of a form to be triggered by a link as opposed to a submit button you must use javascript instead of raw generated html only

12898790
children	parent
there s only 1 parent in the sql server database and 25 000 children for that single parent

12898790
children	parent
load the parent from dbset 0 001 seconds then load the children from dbset 8 6026 seconds

12898790
children	parent
load the children from dbset 0 6864 seconds then load the parent from dbset 7 5816159 seconds

12899216
children	parent
i m a little confused as to what is the best way to implement initializing the children objects when a parent is created

12899260
