the extract class refactoring can help as can extract subclassing and extract superclass

900121
valgrind	callgrind
i would use valgrind and callgrind as a base for my profiling tool suite

900121
profiler	callgrind
callgrind is a profiler build upon that

900121
profiler	callgrind
even one second run is sufficient to get rock-solid reliable results because callgrind is a non-probing profiler

900154
post	get
might proxies convert post requests to get requests without the client making the request knowing about it

so for basic types chars short int long float double you should always prefer pass by value unless you specifically need to use a reference to store a value for use after the function exits

900305
actionscript	mxml
use states to swap out form elements unless the nature of the form itself is highly dynamic in which case you might want to go with a purely actionscript versus an mxml approach

900319
stdout	fflush
i realize there may be a buffer on stdout but shouldn t that be fflush automatically when it s filled

900336
packets	multicast
a client that detects a missing sequence number sends out a messge on the multicast group hey i missed packets 12345

900352
pull	push
you can pull push between slave clones and master clones like normal since they are well... just normal clones

900361
allocator	stl
allocator internally but unlike stl it returns a error code when it can t allocate more

900377
cairngorm	mate
although no green threading frameworks exist at the moment which enable you to run ui and logic in separate threads you can use a good architectural framework such as cairngorm or mate there are many which uses commands instead of straight up methods so that functionality execution which may take up processing cycles waits until the ui has finished responding to the user

900397
mp3	wav
at worst you will require an extra tool to decode re-encode mp3 files from raw audio wav files

900468
waitpid	posix
there are various options to waitpid to help you quotes from the posix standard

900471
post	get
the data option is passing the parameters as querystring get instead of post and the content-type needs to be application json

take an md5 hash of each image as it comes in

900528
hash	md5
write that md5 hash in the database where you are keeping track of these things

900528
hash	md5
store them in a directory structure where you use the first couple of bytes of the md5 hash hex string as the dir name

900529
firefox	safari
you can fake the user agent string using the instructions great_llama provided but remember that firefox is not safari and it probably won t lay out the page identically

900626
lisp	scheme
the let construct is similar to the let construct in lisp and scheme

900638
min	max
just define a min of 0 and a max of x where x is the number of distinct values you need

900654
versioning	upgrade
any change or upgrade to a new versioning of a library can add bugs in very subtle and unexpected ways

900662
post	get
ideally for high performance you should post ahead 3-4 buffers and post new buffers as soon as you get one back before you process the one got back so you ensure that the socket always has somewhere to deposit the data coming from the network

900662
kerberos	ntlm
ntlm kerberos authentication and traffic encryption or at least traffic tampering protection

900738
jruby	mri
deploying a rails app with the glassfish gem is very easy and jruby performs better than mri ruby 1.8.x

900870
disk	ram
or a ram disk so that downloading and installing tools with big file to unzip can be a lot faster

900874

900893
disk	ram
be careful with ram disk

900908
hide	show
i have an nstableview and i have the ability for the user to show or hide columns dynamically with a mail-style header context menu

hash	md5
that said if you actually will use the file s md5 hash in the described way your service will become vulnerable to attacks

901084

this gives you full control over serializable and deserialization

901186
versioning	upgrade
what you can upgrade and when is determined mostly by how hard or easy it is to test the new versioning of the system

901191
equals	gethashcode
the system.string overrides gethashcode because it overrides equals and then gethashcode has to be kept consistent

901202
hide	show
i d like to be able to show and hide different entries but they re in the form

901207
move	drag
next time i drag an image from #products to #container the image will fall into the normal flow of elements without being aware the elements has been move around

901224

901267
width	height
i am using getimagesize to get image width and height

901268
hide	show
to add functionality to expand a row to display detail you can wrap that information in a div tag and attach a click event to show or hide the content

901278
firefox	safari
because the opener property is definitely lost in firefox safari and most browsers when you navigate to a different window

901311
post	get
in particular this post will get you started

901325

this is my first post and i am fairly new to javascript but i was hoping to get some help on creating objects and arrays using javascript

901351
firefox	safari
webkit safari has been supporting it since version 3.1 microsoft since ie4 mozilla since firefox 3.5 browser support overview

901356
memcached	apc
i m currently implementing memcached into my service but what keeps cropping up is the suggestion that i should also implement apc for caching of the actual code

901357
nsstring	nsdata
how do i convert an nsstring value to nsdata

901374
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient s downloadstring is a simple wrapper for httpwebrequest could you try using that temporarily and see if the speed improves

901395
memcached	apc
on our website we use a combination of apc and memcached

901395
memcached	apc
apc to speed up the above mentioned steps and memcached to enable fast and distributed storing and accessing of both global variables precomputed expensive function calls etc that can be shared by multiple clients for a certain amount of time as well as session variables

901395
memcached	apc
if you have a need for multiple frontends somewhere down the line i would try to go with memcached for such caching and storing and use apc as an opcode cache

901409
ant	maven
ant maven hudson

901438
toolbar	tabs
also it would be confusing for the user as most iphone apps have a stable set of tabs even if they are sometimes hidden or replaced with toolbar

901446
hide	show
edit if this solution is not appropriate some comments below points out that that this solution is non-standard and only supported by the big-three you might have to re-think whether you should make the non-ajax version the standard solution and use javascript to hide show the information instead of fetching it via ajax

901543
iboutlet	ibaction
check interface implementations for ibaction and iboutlet and implementations for proper load sequences

901557
profiling	instrumentation	profiling	debugging
one of the great things about the xcode debugging tools is that they can be run against an application executing on the device so you can use instrumentation to do profiling of your application on the actual hardware

901588
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
n3 for web my preference will be vwd but for other stuff i ll prefer monodevelop and sharpdevelop

901638
pull	push
you will then see progress bars on clone push pull and other operations

901639
hash	md5
option #3 seems the most convenient to the user but since i save passwords as an md5 hash i don t see how option #3 would be available to me since md5 is irreversible

901701
apache	lighttpd
in production environment you want to skip this and make your http server apache lighttpd etc serve static files

901712
hide	show
for example if the age checkbox is checked then i need to show a textbox to enter age else hide the textbox

901826
vmware	virtualbox
i use vmware workstation at work and sun virtualbox at home

901826
ubuntu	linux
at home w ubuntu linux virtualbox is easier to maintain performs as well as i require and is free

901826
ubuntu	linux
without debating one linux distro s merits over another suffiuce it to say ubuntu meets all my needs

901826
vmware	virtualbox
if vmware delivers only token ubuntu support i ll use virtualbox

901865
ubuntu	linux
you can test my assertion w any linux distro livecd i d suggest ubuntu 64-bit desktop

901890
put	get
you want to be careful to put the most important options above the fold so they don t get lost

901900
hash	md5
you mentioned you used md5 to hash stored passwords

901934
ienumerable	iqueryable
the gridview is capable of taking and traversing an ienumerable and iqueryable inherits ienumerable

901986
int	chars
create table table_1 id int identity 1 1 primary key state_name chars 10

902000
formview	detailsview
the best suggestion i can think of is using something like the detailsview or formview

902127
post	get
i want to send the vote value to savestar.php and then i will get the the value using the post method and insert it into database

902171

i d like to code a scrobbling utility for grooveshark using last.fm s api but i don t know if it s possible to get the song information from the grooveshark s flash frontend

902198
sharepoint	spsite
whenever you ask sharepoint to find a site collection using an url it ll do it s best to return a spsite even if it means that it ll have to ignore part of the url

902198
spweb	spsite
if you have the full url of a list and want to find the corresponding spsite and spweb

902221
bazaar	svn
although some centralized vcs like svn are usable in local on the developer s computer i was seduced by distributed vcs and after briefly testing mercurial which is good i found bazaar better suited to my needs and taste

902277
jobs	cron
preferably without using cron jobs

902320
int	double
i understand that a double cannot hold the accuracy of a 64-bit int but at this time the performancecounter only required 46 bits and a double should be able to store 52 bits without loss

902369
bazaar	git
i just wonder why nobody mentioned distributed version control systems in this context if you could manage to switch over to a distributed system git bazaar mercury most arguments of your second group would become pointless since they can just start their repository locally and push it to the server when they want and they can also just remove it if they want to restart from scratch

902393
put	get
from what i understand the only operations supported within a transaction for the java api are get and put

902453
put	get
i don t know if the problem is related but all i get when i put a url into ie8 is this message

902471
onkeyup	onkeydown
use the onkeydown or onkeyup event to fire a handler function

902490
onkeyup	onkeydown
you would attach an onkeydown or onkeyup event handler to the global document object

902490
onkeyup	onkeydown
w3schools has more information on using these events onkeydown and onkeyup

902531
mouse	keyboard
have your program open a second window which displays underneath your main window but is maximised then your errant mouse clicks will all be received by the maximised window and it can receive your keyboard input

902538
postgresql	mysql
i can t speak for mysql but postgresql has transactional ddl

902541
folder	directory
over the years i have vacillated between having my project source folder in a directory one level removed from the root d projects and keeping them in the default location for visual studio

902541
folder	directory
i finally switched to storing them in the documents folder since vista shortened the path and i got tired of changing default directory for my dev tools

902542
bash	zsh
i have not found a tab-completion script for rubygem in bash zsh

902611
folder	directory
i havenâ t tried it myself but i guess you can put your projects in my documents and use a symbolic link to the directory in your root folder

902639
profiling	debugging
individual configuration properties rarely change on their own but you will almost always have a set of profiling usually for different environments debugging production etc

902644
put	get
then i can put my stuff anywhere and move it around and yet i always get to refer to it by y or q or whatever

902698
width	height
create img links to the images at the end of your document and set the width and height to 1x1 pixel and additionally put them in a hidden div

902712
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
yes there are the nsdatecomponents class be used to convert time intervals to and from nsdate objects along with an nscalendar to handle localization issues

902736
put	get
put it all together and you get this

902767
keydown	keyup
i would set the booleans to true in the keydown event and to false in the keyup event

902767
keydown	keyup
i think this is because the second key triggered the keydown event and upon its release the keyup event was fired and the keydown event stopped firing completely even though the first key is fired

902774
decoder	encoder
it s a pure python no dependencies open source png encoder decoder and it supports writing numpy arrays as images

902788
implements	sealed
this probably isn t necessary until you get into some of the cooler aspect-oriented programming features but if you ve forgotten to make a method virtual sealed off that method s class and it doesn t implements an interface and you re uncomfortable making those changes because of existing dependencies then making the switch isn t quite as appealing

902802
hash	salt
e.g. header with salt and sha1 hash of salt+password.

902807
profiling	benchmarking	udp	tcp
benchmarking test profiling prove that tcp is your bottleneck only then consider udp

902815
floating-point	fractions
for example the fractions 1 10 cannot be represented exactly as a binary ieee standard floating-point number

902815
decimal	ieee
for this reason the ieee standard also provides for a decimal representation but this is used primarily by handheld calculators and not by general-purpose computers

902818
put	get
in other words how do i get from a clean install of windows 7 with visual studio to a working gadget that i can install and put on my windows 7 desktop

902831
post	get
the button_to helper is implemented as a form post by default which means it s a bad choice for actions that aren t idempotent regular get actions

902836
dictionary	map
or others yet after values you could have 1 2 3 or named styles fee fie fo or fee s fie s fo s where you pass a dictionary instead of a map as the second argument to execute

902842
width	height
then you can refer to element x y x is along width y along height like this

902868
super	implements
i recommend that you implements -didrecivememorywarning and after calling super at the very least print a log so you can see whether it s happening to you

902891
textblock	visualstatemanager
i want to add a state called textblock and i want the visualstatemanager to go to that state when the istextblock property dependency property is true

902896
unsigned	short
old_string is an array of char and new_string is an array of unsigned short so given two chars 42 and 43 this will put 4342 into

902914
post	get
thought i d post these thoughts now to see if i can get a jump start on next weeks work

902938
udp	tcp
tcp and udp sometimes use a simple checksum to make sure the contents are correct

902952
public	protected
basically it has to do with the view of a package as an api controlled unit hence the recommendation to start your package with your domain name - guaranteed global uniqueness so visibility grows from private - package-private - protected - public

902956
public	protected
given progressive levels of access private package protected and public it would be unnecessarily limiting if it went protected then package since that would force me to allow subclasses access in order to grant other members of the same package

902956
public	protected
so protected is between package and public in that it allows a wider exposure of access

902957
keydown	keyup
you should only be tracking the state of the keys during the keydown and keyup events and handle movement elsewhere

902957
keydown	keyup
if you use the second option you will need to look into doevents because if you have code that s constantly running without ever finishing the function the program will not process any other events such as keyup and keydown events

902959
put	get
thus if you want to get the same behavior for both login shells and interactive non-login shells you should put all of your commands in either .bashrc or .bash_profile and then have the other file source the first one

902971
typedef	struct
instead windows provides a typedef for pointer to struct for that struct

902999
int	chars
a chars set is an abstract list of chars with some sort of int chars code associated

903052
perl	tcl
it s a bridge between perl and tcl tk so it can use all of the modern tcl tk features like tile while still having application logic coded in perl

903059
filtering	grouping
logging to public folder makes search filtering easy grouping ...

903063
abc	subclassing
i don t see why an abc couldn t properly have per-instance aka non-static data members as needed to support the methods it supplies to subclassing

903127
ready	each
then create a function that each computer calls to check if the response is ready

903150
put	get
where would i put onclick changelist to get the values from the list

903157
hex	binary
the previous answer to this which i can t link to because of my member status - sucks can be easily countered since the signeridentity string can be looked for and replaced in the binary using a hex editor

903165
post	get
the params scope is a combination of url form get post fields and it will be printed out in the log as part of the normal output processing so you might not need your own dumping of it - any development or production log contains the params dump at the top of the log line

903179
junit	testng
i m not sure about junit but for testng the strategy would be to define a suite xml file with only the one test and then in your pom configure the surefire plugin to only run that

903185
junit	testng
examples of this include pmd bnd junit testng and so on - no serious projects seem to package the maven plugin with the library proper

903202
mechanize	hpricot
so i am trying to extract the email of my website using ruby mechanize and hpricot

903254
fink	macports
otherwise you ll need to either build it from source -- which does require the mac dev tools -- or install it with macports or fink

903306
put	get
to put it above all and check how many pixels you need to position your button so that it does not get above the tabs

903325
width	height
why does the width work but the height not

903334
super	self
to the current one but forgot that with super self is passed implicitly

903345
extjs	gxt
extjs has debug console but i was not able to find something similar for gxt

903384
division	subtract
i just remember the performance counter of when my program started and subtract this from the current counter before converting to double and doing the division

903433
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i ve tryed to add clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml to

903435
inherited	properties
the problem here is that static members are properties of the class itself rather than of individual objects while virtual declarations and inherited are about handling individual objects that may not be of the same class uniformly at a higher level of abstraction

903472
post	get
i need to log all post and get requests on web site in the database

903548
bitarray	bitvector
what is the difference between bitarray and bitvector 32 structure and what are the advantages of bitvector 32 structure over bitarray

903548
bitarray	bitvector
why is the bitvector 32 structure more efficient than bitarray

903553
inherited	subclassing
if all of your classes are subclassing of loggable you ll inherited this identification function in all classes

903566
int	boolean
bitvector32 is more efficient than bitarray for boolean values and small int that are used internally

903576
hide	show
this code hide and show a div in a td using jquery ui s toggle function same result with the show and hide functions

903579
int	boolean
bitvector32 is more efficient than bitarray for boolean values and small int that are used internally

903595
folder	directory
the problem is that the build process takes a very long time because the deployment process copies my images folder to the deployment directory

903633
folder	directory
register the folder as a virtual directory in iis

903659
background-image	background-color
what i am trying to do is to show both background-color and background-image so that half of my div will cover the right shadow background image and the other left part will cover the background color

903726
hide	show
using slidetoggle instead of toggle or hide show actually solved the problem

903768
background-image	background-color
you set the background-color and background-image styles

903768
background-repeat	background-position
if the image is smaller than the element you need to use the background-position style to place it to the right and to keep it from repeating and covering the entire background you use the background-repeat style

903804
google-chrome	safari
gives a dashed line in google-chrome 2 safari 4b but loses the line break which unless anyone can come up with a way to reintroduce that makes it less than useless

903804
google-chrome	safari
ie8 test google-chrome safari test and another

903808
uiview	subviews
i call -release on the uiview that contain the uiimageviews as subviews

903816
bash	zsh
shell independent occurs with bash and zsh

903834
fflush	gets
sounds like a good application for a memory-mapped file since you can control when your in-memory view gets fflush back to the file on disk

903842
onresize	onmouseup	onresize	onscroll	onmouseup	onscroll
catch mouse-drag and viewport events onmouseup onresize onscroll

903864
execvp	fork
before this i create a fork of the current process and i call the execvp in that child process right after that i call exit 0

903893
emacs	jedit	notepad++	jedit
i ve tried slickedit notepad++ emacs jedit and visual studio

903893
emacs	jedit
jedit is probably the best gui cross-platform editor almost-ide and emacs is probably the best terminal cross-platform editor almost-ide

903910
int	boolean
methods that take boolean just as it does int and so on

903933
chm	winhelp
use chm files instead of pretty much deprecated winhelp files

903955
inherited	properties
when you call a function this way this is initialized to a new object that inherited methods and properties from your function s prototype properties

903990
google-chrome	firefox
however for some reason there s a small gap at the right end of the bar in firefox and google-chrome

904001
post	get
in web work i have done with other technologies i only ever used get and post methods

904009
ssl	https
authentication should ideally be left to the webserver as spliff recommends and ssl https is generally good for that

904013
post	get
in practice though most browsers only support http get and post

904013
post	put	post	get	put	get
rails uses some trickery in html forms to act as though a put or delete request was sent even though rails is still using get or post for these methods

904015
post	get
http has supported verbs other than get post forever but the way soap evolved kinda twisted the original meaning of those verbs

904022
jobs	cron
i was previously using dapper drake with these cron jobs in the etc crontab file directly and when i upgraded to hardy i moved them to user-specific crontabs via sudo crontab -e - u mongrel_appnamegoeshere which was the point where they appear to have stopped working.

904082
quicksort	mergesort
for example a sorting algorithm like quicksort or mergesort really only needs to know one thing about the things it s sorting how to compare them

904140
filesystems	fat

it is possible to call these from vbscript and jscript

904155
gif	png
and there are various image file formats jpeg png gif

904166
children	parent

904203
vbscript	jscript
4 vbscript jscript allows me to use either dao or ado

904220
pull	push
automate and push don t pull useful info

904313
vbscript	jscript
for what its worth you could use either jscript or vbscript

904358
hash	md5
even if you do an md5 hash in javascript this does not help because it is trivial to submit the hash to the login page and the hash effectively becomes the password

904397
post	get
you re seeing it for your site and not for others because livehttpheaders shows the url for get requests but doesn t show the content for post requests

904397
post	get
sending login information through get requests is a minor extra security hole over sending them post in that the urls for get requests are often logged in various places whereas almost no one logs post content

904397
post	get
however as others have pointed out unless you re using https for login data is going across the network in plain text whether you use get or post

904397
post	get
still as an intermediate measure i would change your app to send username and password stuff as a post not a get so that you don t end up storing usernames and passwords in your webserver logs - it s no use using https over the wire if you re doing something that then writes the username and password to an insufficiently protected logfile on the server

904402
cvs	svn
as for the mercurial side the recommendation is also to refactor large legacy cvs svn repositories into smaller components

904420

904550
uiview	subviews
i have an uiview that acts as an grouping for some subviews

904598
monodevelop	sharpdevelop

child directory solution folder which are logical collections of projects

904709
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
if you need to access the db sequentially let s say you do a select then another select and then an update you may reuse the connection i mean the same sqlconnection instance but if you need to access the db while reading from a sqldatareader then you ll need 2 different connections

904715
haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml	ocaml	sml
haskell actually does this but in languages like f# and ocaml and sml which have unrestricted side-effects this is a bad idea because it might reorder the side-effects too

904728
for-loop	arrays
after you get it sorted you can create the last arrays in another for-loop

904759

i m trying to get the result in and put it in a progress meaning 140 1058 100 bar on my application the second value 1058 is actually ulong type in my application but that doesn t seem to be the problem

904792
width	height
although i don t really need to specify the width and height here because i can access these through the stage variable

904792
width	height
the scene width and height updates when the stage width and height changes

904792
width	height
i ve found that the canvaswidth will update a lot better when bound to the scene width and height rather than to the var width and height which only update once the resize is complete

904807

i m trying to put my old wordpress powered site into expressionengine just for giggles and i m stuck with my project layout i want a grid of my projects each a div with a set height width

not sure if you can mix get and post type requests

904949
int	double
decimals and double can represent int exactly so there will be no representation error

904979

905000
disk	ram
if you have lots of ram you can mount a ram disk

905024

google-chrome	firefox
when in tinymce i press anything that is supposed to open a new window such as color picker or a link dialog firefox google-chrome seems to start opening the window and then all of the sudden it opens a standard file download dialog asking if i am sure i want to download the requested html file

905028
google-chrome	firefox
same firefox google-chrome with all same plugins is completely able to run all tinymce samples correctly on their example page

905052
junit	jmockit
i am trying to use emma to measure coverage of some junit tests that use jmockit

905132
put	get
and besides all of this is moot if folks can get physical access to your machine and put in a key logger

for-loop	loops
instead you must use an index in the for-loop or a while loops

905193
ubuntu	linux
for linux i m still using ubuntu 8.04 lts not 8.1 and certainly not the 9 alphas

905208

when reading it off the camera roll a landscape shot turned left comes up uiimageorientationup while a portrait shot comes up uiimageorientationright

905298

i figure the data could be passed into a some getter setter type functions inside the xml object which would solve my global public variable problems but still raises the question on whether i should store the response inside the object itself

905302
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the simple application uses a uinavigationcontroller onto which new instances of uiviewcontroller are pushed

905302
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
as far as i know the uinavigationcontroller owns the pushed uiviewcontroller instance which can then safely be released from the client that allocated it

905317
put	get
so say i put in happy i should get an array back of

905387
client-side	server-side
i do understand that javascript exists client-side asp vb exists server-side and never the two shall meet

905454

905597
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if so i think ie 6 and above firefox safari google-chrome all follow this behavior accurately

905663
folder	directory
i m not sure whether they explicitly support adding folder rather than just individual files to zip files but it should be quite easy to create something that recursively iterated over a directory and its sub-directories using the directoryinfo and fileinfo classes

905668
hide	show
i have an asp.net web application where i have a page signup.aspx and a home page.aspx.in my home page i have link to the signup.aspx page.i want to hide the file extension.aspx from the addressbar when someone clicks on the signup link in home page.i want to show it as

905687
ienumerable	ilist
so an ienumerable or an ilist as an input parameter would mean that the method can run off an arraylist or a listitemcollection

905687
ienumerable	ilist
if you choose to return an ilist or an ienumerable the number of things the caller can do with your return value drastically reduces - if you return an ilist over an arraylist to get the number of elements returned - use the count property the client must downcast

905764
int	double
how do i copy a double int bool or other built-in type to a byte array in c#

905765

it is more related to ant convention upon which maven is built

905906
onmousedown	onmousemove
this can be done by overriding methods such as onmousedown or onmousemove

906009
int	chars
you ll need to restrict how many chars come after the decimal based on the sizes of your int

906009
integer	fractions
however there are ways to handle this by further processing the fractions part shifting it by four decimal digits each time and using subtracting the integer part until you have the precision you desire

906018
for-loop	loops
please correct me but the test2 for-loop executes only 1 step because of the throwing exception and test1 caught the exception inside loops and is executed 2500000 times

906038
uitableview	uipickerview
i recommend you use the a row in uitableview + uipickerview to do this

906092
getter	setter
the idea is to have duplicated getter and setter for a field which is lazy loaded

906092
getter	setter
the idea is that the private getter setter pair is what hibernate uses internally and the public getter and setter are transient and used by the developer

906109

906379
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the block that you are using can only be configured inside the httpd.conf file main server config and will not work inside .htaccess

906382
viewdidload	viewwillappear
load the data in the table in the viewwillappear method instead of viewdidload

906658
versioning	upgrade
if i install the all new and latest versioning when i save the rpt file it tells me that the original file was from an old versioning does not specify which and that the save will upgrade it to the latest format thus previous versioning of the application will not be able to use it

906690
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
if you are self hosting the wcf service you cannot solve this because they require either a clientaccesspolicy.xml file or a crossdomain.xml file allowing access to the services from your silverlight url however there is no way to serve an xml from the root of the self hosting wcf server

906699

907262
setinterval	settimeout
any function called from settimeout or setinterval runs outside the main loop and therefore won t block other scripts

907276
getter	setter
since you only need it to work on the mozilla platform you can define a getter with no corresponding setter

907291
hex	binary
not sure but i think to remember the default max for the querystring is 2048 bytes so anything close to 1k of binary data would be your maximun if you serialize to hex string

it seems not possible because the body element has some margin and it seems like there is no easy way to style the div to include that margin width and height of the body element

908126
post	get
the reason post is so common is that historically at least web browsers only supported get and post

908126
post	get
since get is defined to be safe and idempotent even though many applications don t adhere to that the only safe way to modify data was to send a post

908147

filewriter	bufferedwriter
in a java program java 1.5 i have a bufferedwriter that wraps a filewriter and i call write many many times.

908232
iboutlet	ibaction
the pattern i try to stick with is making the controller in code adding iboutlet and ibaction for the things in the xib nib that interact with that code and a thing in the controller s constructor which loads the xib nib with self as the owner and in ib i connect stuff to the file s owner placeholder whose identity i will have specified to be the my controller s class

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
yes document.write is bad it blocks additional loading any js executing before your pages has finished loading basically requires all other processing to stop -- modern browsers like safari and by proxy google-chrome and firefox do a degree of content preloading in order to prevents loads from blocking but subsequent style resolution etc is largely blocked

908571
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
oh for animations you should look at css animations and they perform much better than any js implementations but they re only present in safari and by proxy google-chrome and firefox 3.5 -- definitely not in ie -

sqldatareader	sqlconnection
here is an example to chew on using the nerddinner database and some sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader objects

909002
post	get
i can t send it using get because of the url length limit so i decided to post it instead

909031
inherited	subclassing
you re global.asax file is much more than some events you can put static data in any class that subclassing system.web.httpapplication and inherited that in your global.asax file

909048
post	get
first and foremost - to track get post headers and values you should start using firebug an extension for firefox

909069
ienumerable	iqueryable
the extension methods .skip and .take are available on all iqueryable t and ienumerable t objects along with a whole bunch of others

909069
ienumerable	iqueryable	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	iqueryable
this would require that you change your domain somewhat and start passing iqueryable t or ienumerable t around in place of ilist t and only convert to an ilist t at your higher-level publicly facing services

909077
google-chrome	firefox
however flash player plugin for firefox google-chrome etc has a bug which breaks usage of international characters when its using wmode for the html embed

909117
mp3	wav
i would have left it at that that is - i would have convinced the client to convert all wav s to mp3 and use mootools

909121
post	get
in the first page i get a search result and i have used a post action to get the search criteria

909125
button	checkbox
you have more pre-defined templates to use such as checkbox button hyperlink command and image

909126
post	get
you should use the post redirect get pattern

909131
width	height
there gadgets are basically sort of custom control which have 80 of the properties common like height width color type etc

909194
jdom	xom
however it you are using specific package like xom or jdom etc it might not be a bad idea to ask this question on their user list

909239
hide	show
i want to use jquery to have a text on the page that allows the user to click and show hide the last 5 columns of the table

909480
actionscript	mxml
i prefer to see my code in action and i find actionscript 3 not 2 or 1 along with flex which is mxml great for quickly demoing visual concepts

909480
actionscript	mxml
actionscript 3 very similar to java syntax mxml for being able to express you code visually very quickly

909485
mouse	keyboard
i think a cleaner way is to hook up a iotaeditornotifier to each editor and have your iotaeditor.modified method called by the ide whenever the contents of the editor is modified whether by keyboard mouse or programmatically from another plugin

909525
google-chrome	firefox
it s perfectly ok to have multiple browsers of different types installed on the same machine such as ie8 firefox 3 and google-chrome all at once

909603
ienumerable	ilist
binding ienumerable to an itemscontrol forces wpf to create a wrapper ilist of t object which means your performance is impacted by the unnecessary overhead of a second object

909623
width	height
height width attributes are ignored on inline elements

909740
jquery	scriptaculous
i have moved from jquery to prototype scriptaculous for this specific project don t ask why -d and i need to convert this code to prototype scriptaculous

909757
nginx	lighttpd
most people would go with nginx or lighttpd

909792
int	chars
so for example there could be some int or another array in the memory after the chars array and those would get overwritten with the text

909860
stdout	stderr
if it writes directly to the display buffer instead of stderr stdout then it might not be possible without a lot of work

909889

910047
ant	maven
why not use the ant scp task which you can run within maven

910086
serializable	deserialization
the basic idea is the use of type handlers which enable serializable and deserialization of objects

910086
post	get
you may wish to post this question on db4o forums to get a more detailed explanation from the developers

910090
hash	salt
username is the username password_hash is the hash of the password with a grain of salt

910102
rss	feed
configure feedburner on the rss feed subscribe yourself to the email alerts

910136

moreover if you need strict squares width height as opposed to just rectangles there are even less since you have to divide the original square of side l by the same integers on both sides otherwise you ll be getting rectangles as well

910186
int	boolean
its member variables include boolean int nsstrings and one nsnumber

910208
folder	directory
i have added everyone with full rights to the folder - but i am still unable to access and i can see using process monitor from sysinternals that the networkservice account gets a name not found when trying to create a dll-file in that directory

910221
width	height
height or width

910275
folder	directory
this is because the temporary asp.net files gets written to this temporary folder first before being moved to the asp.net temporary internet files directory

910292
kerberos	ntlm
the only thing i would change about my current setup is moving the sql server off to its own hardware as that reduces overhead and also allows you to investigate the ntlm kerberos double hop issue with regard to separate services such as sql server reporting services and the business data catalog

910305
uiview	subviews
i also tried to put a uiview as subviews there

910358

then you can use a dictionary to map from the wall locations to the images

910362
vtk	itk
for a current project i have to use and do mathemetics on information provided in matrices as well as use itk vtk functions for displaying medical information renders

910362
vtk	itk
basically i have to use both matlab routines and vtk itk in a i guess 50 50 way

910362
vtk	itk
import itk and vtk libs into matlab

910362
vtk	itk
import matlab functions in itk vtk environment for this i would use a language probably python to do matrix calculations

910362
vtk	itk
pros cons itk vtk imported in matlab

910362
vtk	itk
pros cons matlab imported in itk vtk environment

910362
vtk	itk
+ itk vtk environment already set up in this case currently using it this way but never with matlab matrices .mat

910362
matlab	simulink	vtk	itk
- i have tried simulink for matlab in combination with vtk itk libs but i do not like it

910365
getter	setter
i would declare that grosswage is a property and synthesize the getter and setter

910368
google-chrome	firefox
there is no such problem in ie6 ie7 firefox or google-chrome

910400
for-loop	arrays
the idea not sure how good or bad this is is right now is to do a for-loop through all the excel.area selected fields and add the content of that field to the multi dimensional arrays

910425
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
we have the touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended methods for this purpose

910459
folder	directory
lately i ve noticed that this file shows up in several different places so my first thought was of course to always set the current working directory to the folder i want the log to show up in and this works fine

910462
int	double
so if you are converting a double to an int the number is within the range of int and the required rounding-up is toward zero then it is enough to simply cast the number to int

910487
versioning	upgrade
i have recently upgrade my asp.net mvc application from beta to versioning 1

910505
profiling	debugging
if you use the sql server query profiling you can still see the exact sql that is run on the database so you re not really losing anything in terms of debugging your sql statements either

910518
width	height
but i want to access not only the screen width and height but the appearance settings also

910522
persistent	transient
the thumbnailimage field is marked as transient so only the original image is serialized rather than persistent both the original image and the thumbnail image

910522
serializable	deserialization
at the time of deserialization the readobject method is called to perform any operations necessary to restore the state of the object back to the state at which the serializable occurred

910546
inherited	properties
the profiles properties contains items of type incomeprofile costprofile investmentprofile etc which all of course inherited from profile

910557
bmp	png
assuming that you are loading bitmap images which includes bmp jpeg png etc

910557
width	height
since wpf triggers only check equality we need a converter to compare two values - in this case our actual pixel height width and the pixel height width we ve determined makes an image low resolution - and return a true false value we can trigger on

910557
width	height
then when an image is loaded the rectangle s style checks its triggers to see if the image has a height or width that is less than 100px

910563
width	height
as far as the width height unless your running your silverlight app in fullscreen what should be more important is the browser window width height as that will not always be the same size as the screen itself

910563
width	height
you should be able to google for code for how to get the browser window width height rather easily

910583
google-chrome	firefox
the table renders differently in firefox from ie8 google-chrome

910596
put	get
the simplest way to get the modularity you seek is to put those portions of controller code into separate methods set_up_graph1_data set_up_graph2_data etc. which you simply call from your index action to set up the variables for the view

910617
hash	md5
i need to hash md5 all the password in our sql server 2000 database

910617
hash	md5
i can easily generate a c# vb.net program to convert hash all the passwords but i was wondering more for my education than for a real compelling need if it was possible to calculate md5 hash directly in t-sql

910650
hash	md5
no there is no native tsql command to generate md5 hash s in sql server 2000

910690
mouseleave	mouseenter
another thing that i usually do is that i hook up event handler for the mouseenter and mouseleave events for the splitter control and add this code there

911019
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
ok microsoft removed strongly typed html.actionlink from the main asp.net asp.net-mvc assembly in beta because of some features that can still evolve in future release of asp.net asp.net-mvc

911019
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
but now asp.net-mvc is officially released why the strongly typed html.actionlink is still not back

911058

it caters for client-side and server-side page development

911207
keydown	keyup
first use the keydown event instead of keyup it catches enter before submit better

911243
listview	gridview
i have a listview with a gridview with 3 columns

911244
war	manifest.mf
maybe your war is inside an ear so you should reference the driver in manifest.mf

mp3	flv
regarding offering a final mp3 to the user you will need something else because these 2 tools only record to flv format due to the licenses needed to encode mp3s

911264
exponent	modulo
admitedly the documentation isn t explicit but i would venture that you can just send the modulo and exponent components to any other rsa engine in order to reconstitute the public key

911366
x86	64bit
the nearest related question on stackoverflow dealt with getting nunit to run on vista x64 in visual studio 2005 nunit.exe cannot work on vista 64bit if x86 build stackoverflow.com questions 208985 nunit-exe-cannot-work-on-vista-64bits-if-x86-build

911468
post	get
otherwise if youâ re looking for a way to get the list by its internal name you can have a look at this post instead

911526
free	malloc
you can t free file it wasn t allocated by malloc

911538
free	malloc
you shouldn t use free f as the memory is not allocated by malloc

911538
free	malloc
otherwise i think the thumbrule would be for every malloc call free explicitely

911539
free	malloc
in general only free pointers that were allocated directly by malloc

911553
int	chars
the language types string int chars are simply aliases for the clr types system.string system.int32 system.char

911553
int	chars
personally i tend to choose the c# language types int string chars etc because they involve less typing - i suppose i m just lazy

911556
post	get
in that case why don t you get the value of the select box disable it then post the value yourself

911569
gridview	objectdatasource
i am currently attempting to implement a custom gridview interface to display data from an objectdatasource frontend to asp.net membership

911642

911683
mouseleave	mouseenter
in addition mouseenter and mouseleave on the window buttons are still active but when mouseenter on the window border

911725
strcpy	strncpy
use strncpy because strcpy is naughty

911754
wxpython	pyqt
one marked advantage of matplotlib is that you can integrate it with python guis wxpython and pyqt at least and create gui application with nice plots

911766
pull	push
the greatest advantage of jms is that it uses the push method the server notify new messages rather than the pull method the clients keep asking for new messages each x milliseconds

911781
implements	sealed
if you re calling a method on a sealed class and the type is declared at compile time to be that sealed class the compiler can implements the method call in most cases using the call il instruction instead of the callvirt il instruction

911825
cassini	iis
you don t need to specify baseaddresses in the config file when hosting in iis or cassini - the base url is provided by the web server

912097
submit	submission
when normal users click submit on the exam form page i am doing all my logic and submission info the the db

912116
post	get
in your view when you get a post with a formset you have to check each form to make sure it has changed this way empties will get disregarded

912181
iprincipal	iidentity
you might see if just creating classes that implement iprincipal and iidentity will satisfy your needs since they entail a lot less overhead

912189
int	double
the problem is i dont know what type the arguments will be int long double etc

912233
pull	push
why do you think that push is far more scalable then pull for starters

912279
multiplying	add
and if i do this multiplying by 10 and add the digits solution what precautions should i take

912286
required	placeholder
required js and placeholder divs

912288
memcached	ncache
i have seen another commercial option in the form of ncache but memcached seems perfectly acceptable to me and apparently is used on facebook myspace etc.

912288
sorting	filtering
if i where to sort the items descending then items 1-10 would be different products so i would not want to store the actual objects each time the paged data sorting filtering changed but instead stored the ids of the objects so i could then perform a trabsactional lookup in the databse if some of them do not already exist in the cache or are invalid

912294
addition	multiplication
your best bet is the multiplication by 10 and addition of the value

912319
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship studio is awesome for database diagram and documentation - it is capable of holding multiple diagram for the same entity - logical sub diagram multiple physical with denormalization and dimensional diagram for your data warehouse and cubes

912352
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception	runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception aka runtimeexception - very often a programming error such as a nullpointerexception or an illegal argument

912367
pull	push
whether push or pull is appropriate for a given problem depends greatly on the latency requirements the amount of data being transferred node availability and other specific attributes of the problem

912395
rss	feed
as youâ re parsing rss feed probably via http you should read the encoding from the charset parameter of the content-type http header field

912437
hide	show
as you can imagine this becomes a pain as every state needs a show hide statement for each control

912477
uninstall	upgrade

tao	jacorb
we use tao for c++ and jacorb for java

912643
firefox	safari
tested in safari 3 firefox 3 and ie7

912729
getter	setter
that is why short functions like getter and setter are almost always defined inside the class definition

912729
inline	inlining
the inline keyword has almost nothing to do with the compiler actually inlining functions

912752
move	drag

912900
sorting	filtering
yes i really do need to use sql to do the sorting and filtering

so with one simple line of code you have a collection of objects that support inotifypropertychanged ieditableobject ichangetracking interfaces

912974
nginx	lighttpd
non-forking aka single-threaded or select -based webservers like lighttpd or nginx are

912975
sorting	filtering
in answer to 1 and 2 check out swingx which already includes a table class with built-in sorting and filtering

913030

913051
valgrind	memcheck
valgrind can also output xml for memcheck the --xml yes option

913108
pull	push
this can t happen when you push only when you pull confusingly pull isn t quite the opposite of push fetch is the opposite of push- a pull is a fetch followed by a merge or a rebase

913108
pull	push
so if you re in this situation whoever is trying to push their changes first needs to pull back from the updated origin master merge or rebase their version of master and then push

913108
pull	push
or the two of them could cooperate beforehand one of them pull the other s changes do the merge and then push the result

913137
postgresql	mysql
if you find your application has more users down the track you re going to want to transition to postgresql or mysql however

assuming area is the id of your textarea and text the id of your textbox

913243
versioning	upgrade
this causes ridiculous situations like users of a new versioning being told to upgrade downgrade to an older versioning

913253
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
you very rarely create subclasses of anything other than nsobject or for model objects in core data nsmanagedobject in cocoa

913273
int	double
to test this out further i thought i d try varying-sized spacers and use an int instead of a double to keep the object without any added spacers smaller

913282
filesystems	xfs	solaris	aix
log-structured or journaled filesystems such as those supplied with aix and solaris and jfs reiserfs xfs ext3 etc.

913330

i just tested the code from the original post in firefox 3.0.10 opera 9.64 ie8 and google-chrome 2.0.181.1

913380
typedef	struct
you declare a new struct and the typedef keyword isn t used for that

opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this includes ie firefox opera google-chrome and safari

913393
allocator	stl
you need to look into std allocator - the second template parameter of almost all stl containers

913402
children	parent
attached properties on the other hand are associated with a particular dependencyobject grid but are set on a completely separate dependencyobject often a child of the dependencyobject that defines the attached property grid.row an attached property is set on the children of a parent grid

913632
apache	nginx
in a production environment running nginx reversing back to apache mpm-prefork mod_wsgi im seeing 90 apache child processes when i would expect that 40 would be the maximum as configured below

913632
apache	nginx
nginx is reverse proxying to apache via proxy_pass and serving static media

913676
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
for example your static content could be served via lighttpd or nginx while still serving your dynamic content off apache

913707

913817
stdout	stderr
is there a shim or something to let you invoke a fastcgi program from the commandline and hook it up to the terminal so you can see its stdout stderr

what s a good solution to parse an rss atom feed and present the content in a rails view

918528
pull	push
in a basic jsp servlet app you d have a backing servlet which will do almost all the logic in your program push the model into a request and then redirect the user to a jsp page that will pull the model from the request and will only format it by using jstl if you want

918532

918741
nsstring	nsobject
every objective-c class like nsstring nsobject nsview etc

918741
cfstring	nsstring
cfstring and cfstringref are interchangeable with nsstring this is called toll-free bridging although the compiler will probably appreciate it if you cast it first

918744
getter	setter
a straightforward solution that is good enough is to create sort of a valuebox class with a single value field and a getter and setter

918744
getter	setter
the anonymous class will use its getter and setter to write read

918747
hide	show
you would then hide or show the frames based on which one you want to be active

918796
integer	unsigned
an unsigned integer type is size_t

918796
integer	unsigned
so the size of size_t is not specified only that it has to be an unsigned integer type

918825
vtk	itk
if you don t already have a lot of code in matlab i m guessing you d have a much easier time seamlessly integrating vtk itk with python s numpy matplotlib etc

918825
matplotlib	scipy
depending on what you re doing scipy a bundle of python packages including matplotlib numpy etc. does a lot of what matlab does

918829
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stderr separately from stdout in a .cmd or .bat file

918857
sorting	grouping
are you grouping or sorting

918857
sorting	grouping
if you do not use the grouping header footer it is basically the same as sorting and you should simply use the record sort

918909

problem 2 the second script doesn t seem to be included at all in either opera or google-chrome

918946
opera	google-chrome
i don t actually know that the script isn t working in opera google-chrome but nothing happens

918966
getter	setter
i agree that disposability could have been elevated out of the pattern world and into the c# language proper as we did with say property getter and setter which are standardizations of the pattern of having getter and setter methods or events which standardize the idea of storing a delegate and calling it when something interesting happens.

918966
filtering	grouping
linq for example moves the concepts of filtering projecting joining grouping and ordering data into the language proper which adds a lot of expressive power to the language

919011
rss	feed
in .net 3.5 i know of the system.servicemodel.syndication classes which can create atom 1.0 and rss 2.0 rss feed

919137

now it works perfectly at least on google-chrome firefox and opera

919326
mouse	keyboard
there is actually a windows hook designed for computer based training applications called wh_cbt and it provides notification when windows are activated minimized moved resized commands are executed mouse keyboard events etc

919343
stdout	stderr
your best bet is to change the startup script to redirect stdout and stderr to a file

919429
int	double
here s a little example that uses int and double as the two types and their common ancestor as number

919452
getter	setter
so using regular ognl you can access all getter setter in the controller when the jsp executes unless you have used a servletredirectresult which is slightly different

919482
disk	ram
the buffers cache line tells you how much ram the kernel has currently used for various buffers and caches mainly for disk i o i think

919606
post	get
jian you may be able to know such a thing by calling a timer each 4 or 5 seconds which calls a dynamic page with post or get fields that contain the guest ip the page name and the timestamp of the page onload event and compare it to right now

919638
arp	tcp
if the remote address of the google web server was locally cached in dns and the arp nd6 cache contains an entry for the ipv4 ipv6 address respectively of a default router then the first transmitted packet will be a tcp syn packet sourced from the interface address attached to the router and destined for the cached remote ipv4 ipv6 address

919638
tunnel	packets
alternatively the default router could be reachable over some kind of layer-2 or layer-3 tunnel in which case the syn packets will be appropriately encapsulated

919638
subnet	packets
if the first dns resolving server address in the resolver configuration is in one of the local ipv4 subnet ranges or in a locally attached ipv6 prefix with the l 1 bit set in the router advertisement and the arp nd6 cache already contains an entry for the address in question then the first packets the host will send is a direct dns query for either an a record or a aaaa record matching the first fully-qualified domain name in the domain search list

919707
hide	show
now here is the problem this inserted content inside this div with id childparent8351 wont respond to the hide show toggle only in ie v6 v7 and v8

since i couldn t explain really well i ll be specific i want it to work inside outlook rss feed

920039
rss	feed
perhaps having a authentication page where they log in using their company credentials and from then on they can access their rss feed from that ip

920039
rss	feed
you could even send the auth messages through the rss feed

920164
hide	show
i need a way to get notified that a modal dialog box has been show and i should hide the progress dialog

920181

currentculture.currentuiculture has to do with localization that is translation

920384
hide	show
it correctly hide upon load but i cannot get it to show again

920410
integer	unsigned
it seems you want to store the cast function that takes a void and produces an unsigned integer

920445
mp3	aiff	mp3	wav	wav	aiff
if you are using audio files you could consider using mp3 instead of aiff or wav at the possible price of a slightly higher processing overhead

920447
int	double
sounds like you might be able to use the built-in functions int.tryparse string out int or double.tryparse string out double which both return a bool but in any case go for ck s suggestion

920453
ienumerable	ilist
make entity implement an interface ientity and make entitycontainer hold a ilist and unless you have a very specific reason for using ilist you should considere ienumerable it would make it easy for the consumer of the entityclass you use

920465
bindparam	pdostatement
bool pdostatement bindparam mixed parameter mixed variable int data_type int length mixed driver_options

920470

920501
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
2.use getelementbyid getelementsbytagname or getelementsbytagname instead of relying on position in the dom

920543
httphandler	httpmodule
the breaking change for ajax.net professional is that you have to move the httphandler and httpmodule if used to a new section system.webserver and rename httphandler to handler

920556
disk	ram
or perhaps exposing that array as a file that is actually stored in memory like a ram disk i guess

920625
ienumerable	ilist
in a response to this question runefs suggested that unless you have a very specific reason for using ilist you should considere ienumerable

920645
for-loop	loops
i am finding problems in when i should use a while loops or a for-loop in python

920673
ienumerable	ilist
basically if you re defining a method for external consumption then the parameters should be the most basic type that gives you the functionality you require - in the case of your example this may mean taking in an ienumerable instead of an ilist

920673
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
on the other hand if you are exposing a property for external consumption then do so with the most complex type ilist or icollection instead of ienumerable since this gives the client the most flexibility in the way they use the object

920673
ienumerable	ilist
imagine if microsoft had decided that the controls collection of a winforms control should appear as ienumerable instead of controlcollection - you d no longer be able to pass it to methods that require an ilist work on items at an arbitrary index or see if it contains a particular control unless you cast it

920819
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

portrait	landscape
before when i was taking a picture in the landscape mode the picture in the preview when the buttons retake and use photo were present was always automatically rotated so as to appear correctly in the portrait mode

920899
integer	fractions
for example for number 1.33334 my function gives me string 133334 and set up special integer variable decimal_part in this example will be 1 which means in decimal part only 1 symbol everything else is a fractions

920915
public	protected
if you push the include of a type that is in your public or protected interface outside of the header you will be creating dependencies on the order of includes

920918

920929
inherited	properties
if i only inherited from two properties the size of particle is 1 beyond that the size increases by one for each additional emptybase why is that

920947
firefox	safari
the issue is that nothing renders in ie 6 7 but ie8 firefox and safari are all fine

920958
min	max
you could also use not exists or subqueries with min and max instead of the left outer joins on yc_bot2 and yc_top2 if you wanted to do that

921003
width	height
the image is a bitmap and is sized at 500 width and 250 height

921003
width	height
this however only changed the resolution tag for the image and did not properly according to my third party technical contact adjust the image height and width

921003
width	height
is there a ratio that i can use so that for each x units i increment the resolution i merely increment the corresponding height or width y units

921003
width	height
i thought that i could just increment resolution without having to increment height or width

921022
listview	gridview
if you don t need the built-in sorting editing deleting that the gridview offers might i recommend the listview control

921039
lwjgl	jogl

921086
hide	show
use the option kieveli suggested and show and hide the subreports depending on the user s choice if you want a more dynamic solution

921161
hide	show
the hacky version is to show a fake form field in its place that looks like it s disabled grayed out style and onclick hide it and show the correct field enabled but that s ugly

921166
mouseup	mousedown
if i recall correctly mousedown event doesn t happen until the mouseup happens at which point both fire

921172
ant	maven
although these packages were written for maven and ant specifically with some work you can adapt them to just about anything

921179

921380
jar	war
it has webapps packaged as war which depend on components packaged as jar files

921380

firebird	pervasive
i can t speak to some of the other less-enterprise databases out there sqlite firebird pervasive but i expect that all databases will perform these steps when they parse the sql statements into database operations

921501
try-catch	exception-handling
usually that is due to the ide offering a helpful quick fix that wraps the offending code in a try-catch block with that exception-handling handling

921521
pull	push
note that this creates a new repository foo and you cannot push pull between your-big-repo and foo

921543

post	get
by using cookies or a post request you minimise your worry about having the url hijacked allowing someone to get into the asp.net site without username password

921588
children	parent
not sure if leaf node is still proper terminology since it s not really a tree each node can have multiple children and also multiple parent and also i m actually trying to find all the root nodes which is really just a matter of semantics if you reverse the direction of all the edges it d they d be leaf nodes

921588
children	parent
each node has a list of it s children and it s parent

921630
google-chrome	firefox
can someone confirm that browsers ie firefox google-chrome don t cache anything unless told to in the html header

921658
nstimer	nsrunloop
ok i ve read the articles about why it s a better idea to use an nsrunloop instead of an nstimer call to run a game loop and maintain a nice frame rate

921679
children	parent
so long as the nodes in general have more parent than children this direction will be much faster

921687
ord	chr
also you don t need some conversions ord and chr

921723
children	parent
if parent has_many children must child belongs_to parent

921747
put	get
as a general suggestion throw in some memory get a velociraptor put only sources and build directory there measure again

921765
gridview	datalist
for displaying a list of things repeaters are typically faster than gridview datalist and their other counterparts

921770
put	get
is there something i need to put into either the parent or sub class to get it to run

921809
children	parent
the only places i reference these children are where i iterate over their parent

921809
children	parent
if the parent are cleared then they should have no children that the code is aware of correct

921814
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	show	hide	fadeout
and i use the jquery method fadein and fadeout to show and hide it

921815
sorting	filtering
my way of doing this was to first query the tablerows table - for filtering i then filtering out the rows who s columns did not match the criteria and for sorting i sorted the rowids based on their column s content as specified by the sorting specified

921821
width	height
how can i also get the values of the selected items like width height and top left offset

921834
width	height
use width height and position or offset

921851
width	height
but for height and width you are better off using height and width functions

921893
tabcontrol	tabitem
i don t know how to block a tabitem because there is no dependencyobject command in the tabcontrol to tie into do i need to roll my own tabcontrol and build an icommand around the selectionchanged event

921939
implements	extends
yes it is but dbconnection itself extends and implements component idbconnection idisposable

921942
post	put	post	get	put	get
is there a javascript library which allow me to perform all the rest operation like get post put and delete over http or https

921947

you can represent each node with a reference to its parent and then join against the parent to get the children back out

921985
opera	google-chrome
i ve tested in ie8 ie7 ie6 ff3 google-chrome and opera

922055
metaphone	soundex
in addition to the other good info here you might want to consider using the double metaphone phonetic algorithm which is much superior to soundex

922094
put	get
then in the sql that tests validity if something could be put in that would fail if the connection is in the dbms_flashback enabled mode that should get jboss to discard the connection

922121
post	put	post	get	put	get
you can replace put with get post delete or whatever

922128
width	height
let s say i have a size class which has height and width properties in reality the class is a bit more complex than this but size makes a good example

922128
width	height
i want to display this as width x height in my ui

922128
width	height
the obvious way to do this is to bind to a dimensions property which is dependent on width and height

922138
jar	war
i m having a hard time to make my maven2 multi module project with a deep project structure appear as a single ear with its dependencies - which includes 1 war 2 ejbs and 1 jar to be deployed in my jboss 5 server inside my eclipse ganymede tab servers

922138
jar	war
my project has 1 war 2 ejbs and 1 jar that must be packaged inside an ear each of the subprojects is a separate module

922138
jar	war
is there a way to tell eclipse ganymede that all those projects ejbs war and jar are inside the ear module so i can deploy the ear in the server

922299
128bit	64bit
as most of the other posts have already pointed out converting between 128bit decimal and 64bit floating point representations is not a conversion that will always maintain accuracy

922366
vbscript	vb6
ideally i need to do this in vbscript ado but can take a vb6 based solution if available

both work pretty much the same way in boost and stl contexts

922429
width	height
the source buffer is the size of the image data width height

922429
width	height
it s close - i m finding if height is greater than width the left position of the rotated image is incorrect

922429
width	height
similarly if width is greater than height the top position of the rotated image is incorrect

922457
width	height
if want to display this composite value as a string then bind display pattern 1 of a text field to the width property and display pattern 2 shown when you bind display pattern 1 to the height property

922457
width	height
this will give a text field that displays width x height and will update on changes in either property

922457
width	height
the downside of this method is that the text field will not be able to edit the bound width and height values

922533
comparator	comparable	treemap	treeset
for cases where your keys are a complex type that doesn t implement comparable or you don t want to use the natural order then treemap and treeset have additional constructors that let you pass in a comparator

922533
treemap	treeset
remember when using a treemap or treeset that it will have different performance characteristics than hashmap or hashset

922600
hide	show
when you show and hide a div will it re-adjust surrounding elements automagically

922600

your systemd may have a start-stop-daemon script and for c code it may also have a daemons 3 call in the c library

923730
post	get
rest only makes sense by using it fully but as to convincing you to actually stretch your brain a bit further and do something clever i can only dare you to cut through the fud that it s all about rpc only get and post necessary you don t need it all equivalent to json soap and other ilk etc. and be smarter about how you make applications

923764
hide	show
routing hide you application structure and makes you think more of your urls as path to the content that you want to show opposed to the path to some page with params

this doesn t really fall under the remit of your question since here the submit button is unambiguous but i thought i d include it for people who read the first part and wonder how to make a submit button successful via js form submission

925387
submit	submission
the specs don t say anything about submission a form using the enter key while in a text entry field if you tab to a button and activate it using space or whatever then there s no problem as that specific submit button is unambiguously used

post	get
some options i considered were to send the query parameters via post instead of get but this is often not interchangeable on the server side and the clients will treat this differently in that the url can t then appear in a hyperlink or be bookmarked or entered manually and if the user wants to refresh they ll get the send information again warning which makes sense since post is meant to update information on the remote server and it ll only work if it s the query string pushing it beyond the limit rather than some ungodly url

926366
disk	ram

int	chars
for numbers especially there is no comparison between a binary int and a string of digit chars

927362
width	height
sadly the only way i know of to address this issue is to use javascript to determine the width and height of the viewable window in pixels then set min-width and min-height stylings to these values

927375
sorting	filtering
you should care about datatypes when it comes to filtering where clause or sorting order by

927979
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
you prolly know how to test out firefox opera safari with without scripting

927980
bazaar	git
newer distributed source control systems like git bazaar and mercurial aka hg all tend to be better at detecting broad changes done in the file system such as moving directories renaming files and even replacing large chunks of the file system

927980
bazaar	svn
from my reading bazaar and mercurial were essentially built from the ground up to handle this sort of free-form editing specifically because of how explicit svn required you to be

927985
inherited	subclassing
i m playing with python class inherited and ran into a problem where the inherited __init__ is not being executed if called from the subclassing code below the result i get from active python is

928013
inherited	base-class
it s also one less place you need to change code if when you change what a class is inherited from for example you factor out a base-class and change the derivation and don t need to worry about your classes calling the wrong parent constructors

928014
nspopupbuttoncell	nscell
i ve created a custom subclass of nscell with an nsimagecell some nstextfieldcells and an nspopupbuttoncell

928028
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
so for it seems to me like functional languages such as ml haskell lisp arc scheme etc

928033
interpreted-language	compiled-language
to me the interpreted-language already seem to have passed up the compiled-language at least in jobs available

928099
whiptail	ncurses
you could use dialog that is ncurses based or whiptail that is slang based

928109
perforce	cvs	daemons	systemd
something else to know is that most newer source control systemd require some kind of daemons program running on the server subversion git perforce microsoft team foundation server while the older simpler systemd just use the file systemd directly visual source safe cvs and don t require a server program

928124
ironruby	ironpython
hooking into .net to allow proper integration between f# c# vb ironpython ironruby etc - really shows the strengths of each

for only printing the one that meets a specific size use getimagesize and compare the width height with the one you want so basically use the code above but wrap an if around the lines inside the foreach loop

928280
width	height
specify no width or height

928299
merb	ruby-on-rails
for reasons beyond my control i m being tasked with ruby web development that does not use ruby-on-rails or really any other heavyweight framework such as merb

division	multiplication
as another example there are the little things to think about like working with integers instead of floating point variables whenever you can and using multiplication instead of division whenever you can

928370
x86	64bit
the vm does all this with a single short instruction possibly one or two bytes instead of 4 or 8 bytes per instruction in machine language depending on 32 or 64bit architecture which guessing should mean around 16 or 32 bytes of x86 for 1-2 bytes of machine code

928389
union	distinct
insert b col1 select distinct col1 from a union select distinct col2 from a

928395
submit	submission
client side form submission control can be achieved quite elegantly by having the onsubmit handler hide the submit button and replace it with a loading animation

928471
post	get
i have this exact same issue with dependency injection through reflection i get around it with post build events and when deploying nant scripts sorry i couldnt be more help look forward to seeing a solution you can always just add the refs to the startup project directly can get into some fun issues with that long term but it will work

928499
post	get
this ms kb article explains get and soap are disabled for asmx by default while post is enabled by default but doesn t say why other than security reasons. is this just superstition

928499
post	get
it seems that having post enabled is just as insecure as having get enabled

928526
svg	vml
this is a js drawing framework that renders in svg canvas or vml depending on browser capabilities

928540
expander	togglebutton
you would have to override the expander s controltemplate and change the contentcontrol with the templatebinding of header this is usually a togglebutton with your header content

928540
expander	togglebutton
since you re using a very specific orientation i would just borrow the togglebutton+contentcontrol interaction that the default expander contentcontrol combines and create a new style controltemplate for the togglebutton instead

928570
uiview	subviews
the tableviewheader property of uitableview is a uiview so i thought i would be able to add multiple subviews to it

928615
passenger	thin
it s compact a joy to code with and it deploys on rack which means you really get it running in whatever stack you fancy most mongrel fcgi thin passenger etc.

928620

try including the iostream header and say std ostream instead

928624
std	ostream
then you probably need to say std ostream

928748
vim	emacs
most people use either vim or emacs as their command-line editor

928752

with forms if you show hide dynamic fields alot of times you have to have hidden values to store the values in and then have your php or whatever look for the hidden field value instead of the dynamic html value

928758
for-loop	arrays
accesslv is an arrays of bools fileread is a function i made to decrease the syntax involved in reading from a file i is because the statement is within a for-loop

jruby is one of the most complete ruby implementations there are a lot other ones out there such as ironruby maglev rubinius xruby yarv macruby

928808
implements	extends
you can even extends and implements with inheritance

928827
allocator	stl
also i understand intrusive list may be used for better cache locality along with appropriate memory allocator for the contained objects than stl list

928855
innodb	myisam
the actual cause was that the main db table was in myisam and the innodb tables couldn t create a foreign key connecting to it

928858
put	get
if you get frustrated just put it down for like 10 minutes

928860
ready	each
main program opens a file containing an id and another word in each line and keeps it ready to be read from

929001
put	get
i m solving uva s edit step ladders on an uva sub-site named programming-challenges.com but since i didn t get at all the format in which i m supposed to test-input i simply took their sample input put it into a text file and tested my code from there

929014
width	height
i know exactly where i want to position my uilabel in a uiview but i don t necessarily know what height width i want it to have at compile time so setting a width height in initwithframe is useless

929014
width	height
i want to be able to just init its x y point and then use something like mylabel sizetofit so it can automagically set the width height based on my break mode and content

929014
width	height
the solution i m looking for is how to set the uilabel s point of origin while setting it s width height to a dynamic number based on the text set to the label

929023
chown	chmod	chown	sudo
a chmod -r 777 images seemed to fix it as well as a sudo chown _www images

929083
tolower	toupper
the key is to implement the standards faithfully with respect to your users locale settings or get the same effect by using system libraries that handle the general case of toupper tolower correctly

929092
postgresql	mysql
i don t know what your work policy restrictions are but it s pretty easy to install and use postgresql mysql and oracle xe

929103
range	max	range	min	min	max
i d prefer an algorithm where the min max or either range can be adjusted ie the second range could be -50 to 800 instead of 0 to 100

929122
georss	kml
google maps s api object ggeoxml is able to access cross-domain xml files usually kml or georss

929128
getattr	subclassing
once you have somehow identified a child class of interest maybe all of them if you want instances of all child subclassing etc getattr parentclass s_set childclass.__name__ should help if the child class s name is foo this is just like accessing parentclass.foo_set -- no more no less

929184
versioning	upgrade
see this wordpress artice which advices not publishing the wordpress versioning you re using due to the multitude of past vulnerabilities and the fact that people are very slow to upgrade

929229
post	get
for example that the web service responds to get requests as opposed to post or other http verbs

929250
tolower	toupper
using unicode-aware tolower toupper -type functions is the better way to go

929251
selecteditem	selectedindex
if no item is selected selectedindex is -1 and selecteditem is null

929259
prepare	execute
you can use the prepare feature to execute dynamic sql

929332
getter	setter
in this case you could implement setter and getter functions which will operate on a matrix like so

929357
width	height
of course you can change the flt_max to constrain to a specific width or height

929360
imagemagick	magick++
it relies on the magick++ imagemagick api for most of its image handling

929367
post	get
i ve written a blog post that uses some basic codedom that may help those wanting to get started with it

929382
children	parent
if i create a new parent and its children how should i save both

929389
width	margin
as i understand width padding margin properties only work on block level elements

929409
post	get
i seem to have a problem with getting mvc to fill in my custom model parameter when called through get instead of post

929413
width	height
this allows you to specify width height and other block-specific properties without the need to break the flow of inline elements

929444
put	get
you might want to put that off until you get some entries which don t match any of the normal letters.

929457
toolchain	binutils
all of these produce a resource script and you should have a resource compiler in your toolchain rc.exe for visual studio including the express editions or available as part of the sdk or windres as part of the binutils in cygwin or mingw

929475
libtiff	freetype
of course you could also use some combo of freetype and libtiff but you ll have to build those libs for win32

929481
qcodo	qcubed
i ve been using qcodo for 2 years and now i m with qcubed

929481
qcodo	qcubed
remember that qcubed is now growing in acceptance and it s good for all qcodo s community

929482
serializable	deserialization
in both serializable and deserialization there are callback points where you can execute additional code to fix-up objects for deserialization

929489
put	get
you should put field nonserializable attribute on events so event handlers don t get serialized too

929536
ubuntu	linux
but ubuntu is not the only linux distribution that uses this method

929548
emacs	aquamacs
there is also aquamacs and carbon emacs for an emacs-flavoured mac editing experience

929548
emacs	aquamacs
carbon emacs is closer to the unix emacs experience whereas the aquamacs people have put considerable effort into os x integration

929568
rpm	yum
then it s a matter of using apt yum rpm windows msi or whatever to deploy a given version

929590
opera	firefox
we just have to wait for it a but since it will be available only in firefox 3.5 and opera 10

929614
cvs	svn
cvs or subversion.tigris.org svn to decentralised distributed source code management with tools such as www.selenic.com mercurial wiki or git-scm.com

929656
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i just loaded a visual web developer â express edition to help my development and this after two hours of installation time it appears that it gave me an upgrade to my iis to versioning 7 without notifying me if i wanted to load that

929660
curb	libcurl
curb and libcurl multi provide libcurl bindings for ruby

929679
versioning	upgrade
if you have anything below proffessional you probably got upgrade to ii6 and not ii7 - there is no ii7 for lesser versioning

929725
for-loop	loops
we may never enter the for-loop at all or if we do enter it the compiler can t be sure that we reach a return statement before we leave loops

929739
onkeyup	onkeydown
use onkeydown and or onkeyup for the other keys

929775
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
before trusting xcode snaphot feature too much may i suggest you to consider source code management with cvs svn or perforce integrated in xcode

929864
jms	jta
atomikos is the inventor of java ee without application server so if any open source jta xa does well in java se then it must be transactionsessentials it was designed for java se right from the start and includes jdbc and jms connectors pools so you don t need any application server functionality

929885
hash	md5
now a days md5 hash or any other hash for that matter are pre computed for all possible strings and stored for easy access

929885
hash	md5
though in theory md5 is not reversible but using such databases you may find out which text resulted in a particular hash value

929903
jms	jta
consequently it offers premium jdbc and jms pools as well as jta xa functionality and you will find it very easy to integrate into your applications

929904
libcurl	typhoeus
if you like it less low-level there is also typhoeus which is built on top of libcurl multi

929919
range	minimum
i woul define unwanted vibration or shocks as acceleration values that change very fast by an large interval of values or an permanently changing accumulated value that does not exceed an specified treshold range in an specified minimum period of time

930006
multiplying	add
this means that counting the frequencies of words that aren t in both sets is a waste of time - we multiplying the frequency by zero and that will add nothing to the score

930065
free	malloc
i think if you define a malloc and free in your own .c file included in the project the linker will resolve that version

930079
formview	detailsview
your choices are the formview or detailsview controls

930079
formview	detailsview
the primary difference between them is that detailsview does all the work for you whereas formview requires you to create your own templates thus allowing greater control

930081
prepare	execute
so you ll have to execute your drop table statement first and then prepare and execute the create table statement separately

930096
int	chars
another reads a single chars returning an int which will be -1 if you ve reached the end of the reader

930174
uitableview	nsindexpath
you can iterate through the button s superview hierarchy until you find a uitableviewcell then call - nsindexpath indexpathforcell uitableviewcell cell on the uitableview

930174
uitableview	nsindexpath
the event delegate can then call - nsindexpath indexpathforcell uitableviewcell cell on the uitableview to get the index path

930183
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby do let you leverage all of your .net experience and codebase they don t answer your objection to learning new languages however

930197
inherited	subclassing
if you have an inherited form or any class for that matter you would be able to invoke this function from within the subclassing

930210
cvs	svn
i have just started to use svn for version control but there always is a lot of talk going on about version control system like git mercurial svn cvs etc

930215
cvs	svn
the centralized svn cvs etc. versus distributed git mercurial etc. repository is a fundamental difference that reflects the way your development team operates

930217
bazaar	cvs	bazaar	svn	bazaar	git	cvs	svn
distributed version control systems dvcss like git mercurial and bazaar do collectively have advantages in flexibility of workflow and operation compared to centralized cvss such as svn or cvs

930217
bazaar	git
on a horses for courses basis you might pragmatically pick hg mercurial if you re going to be using code.google.com bazaar if you re going to use launchpad git if you re going to use github for example

930264
wordpress	joomla
basically i m in the midst of creating a website where users can search for and buy website layouts wordpress joomla themes etc

930281
atomikos	bitronix
i ve elected to use the bitronix transaction manager to solve this problem although apparently there s at least one other option that wasn t apparent to me at the time atomikos

930336
put	get
you have to actually put statements in the if blocks to get it to step in

930359
width	height
with the colorbox plugin that you are using you can specify the width height of the dynamic image

930368
disk	ram
more ram more disk more cpus

930418
superclass	subclassing
when you derive from a class and instance the subclassing the runtime also instances the superclass right

930418
subclass	abstract-class
since abstract-class can t be instanced are they not created by the runtime when a subclass is instanced

930471
accessor	properties	getter	setter
where the intended implementation language s support properties it s perfectly correct to use them in your interface s as well of course you d have to stick to getter setter accessor if your intended target was a language that s lacking in support for properties

930512
width	height
if possible i would like a border for the user to stretch to edit the width and height

930578
post	get
but what happens is that it doesnt even get to that action coz is nothing in the post

930578
put	get
i know i could put something in the session and check for it in the get action of the guestbook but i wanted to check if someone could come up with a better solution

930583
kde	gnome
kde or gnome - it s like deciding which fat girl you want to date

930604
post	get
in particular try to understand datatypes server settings like timeouts post versus get etc. security and database interactions as they exist beyond javascript ecmascript

930673
folder	directory
it doesn t run the tests in the regular output bin folder and it doesn t respect the project s file inclusions copy to output directory

930734
vbscript	jscript
internet explorer supports pluggable scripting languages although the only one reliably included with ie besides jscript is vbscript

930742
versioning	upgrade
i got a segmentation fault error i googled and some say upgrade to latest versioning of ruby

930752
versioning	upgrade
well based on your own question i d say upgrade to the latest versioning of ruby

930761
queue	fifo
using single-writer single-reader fifo or queue

930766
implements	extends
i m working on some effects and things to get a handle on classes implements extends

930766
implements	extends
the second class mooslidesfx.elements extends mooslidesfx to likewise be implements but rather than just animate the element passed in it will animate it s children in order not looking for a lesson chain right now but it s next on my list

930850
post	get
i would like to get your opinion about whether or not this kind of layout can work on a site like this many categories browsing searching post reading description etc

930856
public	protected
same for public protected private public first so everything that can be used from other files is quickly visible when opening the file

930866
cvs	svn
in the long term it would be cool if such a script would support different types of backends cvs svn or git or at least be implemented generically enough so that it is easily extendsible

930869
put	get
ok so i am going to put this solution out that will get you started but please note that this is only a rudimentary implementation of a mediator pattern

930892
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
however i tried this in plain old javascript and it worked just fine in ie firefox safari and google-chrome

930892
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
edit the following works in firefox safari and google-chrome when using window.load

930958
uilabel	nsstring
you can t assign a joke object to a uilabel s text propertyâ it takes nsstring only

930982
ironruby	ironpython
with silverlight 2 you can run client-side code you ve written in c# ironpython ironruby vb.net etc

931022
vbscript	jscript	ironruby	ironpython
as already said you have flash actionscript which is a derived language from javascript and silverlight moonlight ironpython ironruby jscript vbscript c# that can run in the browser via plugins the first one being much more ubiquitous

931030
post	get	webclient	webrequest
you can continue using webclient to post instead of get which is the http verb you re currently using with downloadstring but i think you ll find it easier to work with the slightly lower-level classes webrequest and webresponse

931030
post	get
there are two parts to this - the first is to post the login form the second is recovering the set-cookie header and sending that back to the server as cookie along with your get request

931034
post	get
the problem is self.redirect cannot carry along the payload of a post http request so from a post method the redirection to the login-url c is going to misbehave in fact i believe the login url will use get to continue when it s done and that there s no way to ask it to do a post instead

931034
post	get
if you don t want to stash that post payload around somewhere session or otherwise you can make your code work by changing the def post in your snippet above to def get and of course the in the html written in other parts of the example that you haven t snipped to

931034
post	get
there are other minor workarounds you could accept post for normal messages from logged-in users and redirect them to the get that perhaps does something simpler if they weren t logged in yet but i think this info is sufficient to help you continue from here right

931098
versioning	upgrade
so unless you upgrade your os it will remain the old versioning

931157
postgresql	mysql
straight_join is a mysql enhancement by postgresql are you referring to a postgresql database

931161
bazaar	svn	tortoisegit	svn
because switching to tortoisegit bazaar hg you will not be able to access svn repositories

931176
lisp	scheme
you may just find out that you ll learn the other later also happened to me -- i had to learn more scheme after one year studying common lisp

931176
lisp	scheme
so it was either scheme or common lisp to me

931187
rss	feed
pipe that attempts to transform an html page into rss but the resulting feed contains no items

931197
lisp	scheme
cs teachers at colleges and universities today particularly the young ones were educated using java c and c++ and they probably learnt either scheme or common lisp in a course called comparative studies of programming language or programming paradigms which was probably taught by someone who doesn t like any lisp language and taught them about functions lists symbols and higher-order functions

931214
lisp	scheme
i do not know lisp but heres why i think plt scheme is a good choice

931234
children	parent
in the same breath i would also like to be able to run a specific number of child processes at any given time say for example n children running concurrently whenever one exits the parent process starts another child if needed but has no more than n children at any given moment

931243
children	parent
it looks like your parent process is finishing before the children and therefore never getting a chance to reap them

saves onchange and or onblur

931283
mp3	ogg	mp3	wav	wav	ogg
it s located at and it does play ogg wav mp3 and a whole other bunch of formats

931312
int	chars
the type casting from chars to int is a little awkward though

931364
g++	gcc
this might be because gcc is being used to link not g++

931370
dictionary	map
naively i ve thought of inserting a key in a hidden span and using a dictionary object in the controller to map edits creation

931468
rss	feed
but i ve seen it used to access non-local web pages in vista gadgets for instance for rss feed without using a proxy.

931476
int	double	int	chars
so far i can only think of maybe having a string array of data types int double chars etc search for that in the line and then search for the parenthesis and then search for the absence of the semicolon so i know it isn t just the declaration of the function

931494
typedef	struct
anything between a toplevel and is a function body except after typedef class struct union namespace and enum

931544
nsis	prerequisites
check framework prerequisites 2.0 - check nsis system func

haskell	ocaml
for those who are familiar with haskell the ocaml syntax

931578
submit	submission
you can use the fieldserialize method to submit only a subset of the form and iframe true option to make it work with submission files etc

931605
uiview	subviews
the navigation bar is a uiview so you can simply create a regulat uibutton and add it to your navigation bar as a subviews

931621
serializable	deserialization
without a deserialization constructor and the serializable attribute your exceptions won t function in a distributed environment and could possibly cause other problems

931634
postgresql	mysql
mysql sql server 2005 2008 oracle postgresql sqllite maybe others

931643
submit	submission
this means it s possible for two users to be assigned the same record to edit and we favor the first one that submit failing silently on subsequent submission

931656
filtering	grouping
in my current application i have a full domain model linq to sql extremely lightweight repositories and then use extension methods across iqueryable to filtering sort order based on business requirements and then a service layer which contains services based on grouping of responsibilities such as iregistrationservice register users check availability of login names etc.

931724
inherited	properties
all objects in javascript have the prototype object and all instances of objects you create inherited methods and properties from their object s prototype object

931724
inherited	properties
this allows the childclass object to add methods and properties to its prototype object from the parentclass object which creates an effect similar to the idea of inherited present in class-based languages

931743
opera	firefox
well works the same for me in opera firefox and ie6 8

931826
jsr311	jax-rs
jax-rs jsr311 does not define a client api but most jax-rs implementations have one like jersey resteasy or apache cxf

931866
calloc	malloc
note that if you also divert calloc and its implementation calls malloc you may need additional code to check how you re being called

931877
inherited	properties
javascript has no built-in support for inherited hierarchies as type extension is supposed to be done via aggregation ie adding desired functionality directly to the object itself or its prototype if the properties is to be shared between instances

931893
post	get
2.- that code above will give a no post action wait or something like that if i add method get i will get a no route matches

931895
pull	push
whenever you commit push new stuff in main repo you just git pull them back into project

931913
ubuntu	linux
you could use ubuntu server which a variety of hosting providers offer among other gnu linux distros

931915
int	chars
map can contain any arbitrary type as a key while switch is very limited to c++ primitive types chars int enum etc...

931968
google-chrome	firefox
if it s just the colour you are after in firefox you can use colorzilla which lets you eyedrop any colour off the viewport including the google-chrome

931986
postgresql	mysql
mysql doesn t implement any join methods except for nested loops but postgresql does

932031
cassini	iis
i have a mixed app asp.net webforms later mvc added and it runs in iis 7 on vista but does not run on cassini on the same box and with the exact same files in the webroot

932061
implements	extends
if you want to derive a class to extends or change the name of init you should implements your class and have your method call init

932116
qapplication	qwidget
you can probably use qapplication setstylesheet or qwidget setstylesheet to get it done

932132
dxcore	coderush
dxcore is the freely available engine that runs developer s express s coderush dxcore can be found at

932202
icmp	telnet
however if the site blocks icmp echo then you can always do the telnet to port 80 of some site wget or curl

932253
freebsd	linux
freebsd can already run linux executables

932253
freebsd	linux
there are a whole lot more linux programs than freebsd programs so freebsd implemented the linux compatibility layer

932253
solaris	bsd
however don t expect the reverse solaris bsd executables on linux since there is just no demand for it

932255
postgresql	mysql
i m thinking of choosing between postgresql or mysql

932255
post	get
i have gone through several post on internet about search solutions nevertheless i d like to get opinions for my simple case

932255
xapian	whoosh
should i use an external search library such as whoosh sphinx or xapian

932263
hex	binary
given wikipedia s article on radix point how would one calculate the binary equivalent of 10.1 or the hex equivalent of 17.17

932287
post	get
maybe you can get something out of looking into this post on my my blog

932313
typedef	struct
typedef struct

932359
curb	libcurl
curb-fu is a wrapper around curb which in turn uses libcurl

932360
postgresql	mysql
i can t tell whether you need full-text search on description as i have no indication of what it is -- nor whether you need the reasonable but somewhat rudimentary full-text search that mysql 5.1 and postgresql 8.3 provide or the more powerful one in sphinx.

932360
postgresql	mysql
edit so it seems the only possible need for full-text search might be on description and that looks like it s probably limited enough that either mysql 5.1 or postgresql 8.3 will serve it well

932360
postgresql	mysql
me i have a sweet spot for postgresql even though i m reasonably expert at mysql too but that s a general preference not specifically connected to full-text search issues

932360
postgresql	mysql	innodb	myisam
this blog does provide one reason to prefer postgresql you can have full-text search and still be transactional while in mysql full-text indexing only work on myisam tables not innodb except if you add sphinx of course also see this follow-on for a bit more on full-text search in postgresql and lucene

932365
put	get	viewdidload	viewwillappear
put your table updating code in viewwillappear in stead of viewdidload - that way each time you go back to your parent controller from the child controller the data get reloaded

932455
for-loop	loops
rather than bitswapping the index every time through loops you can manually implement a ++ equivalent that uses bits in the wrong order to do a double indexed for-loop

932459
hash	salt
what about treating it like a regular password and using a salt hash

932502
graphics2d	bufferedimage
the reason being a graphics2d object of the bufferedimage can be obtained in order to produce a better quality scaled image

932502
graphics2d	bufferedimage
then using that graphics2d object an image can be drawn to the bufferedimage using the rendering hints specified earlier

932520
min	max
the problem is that i ve run it more than 100 times and it s always giving me the same answer when my min 0 and max 1

932520
min	max
i did re-run the test with min 0 and max 10 and the first 50ish times the result was always 5 the 2nd 50ish times the result was always 9

932527
min	max
the min is inclusive but the max is exclusive

932530
min	max
the problem with min 0 and max 1 is that min is inclusive and max is exclusive

932531
hash	md5
delicious.com provides feeds to query information about urls but the function only accept an md5 hash of the url you want to look up

932544
min	max
also as mentioned by others the max is exclusive so if you want a 0 or 1 you should use 0 2 as your min max or some larger max and then do a binary and with 1

932583
yacc	bison
i m creating a compiler with lex and yacc actually flex and bison

932666
google-chrome	safari
furthermore we tried using ie google-chrome safari to show the same document directly

932668
integer	fractions
to convert decimal 10.1 to binary separate the integer and fractions parts and convert each separately

932668
integer	fractions
to convert the fractions part use repeated multiplication by 2 subtracting off the integer part at each step

932681
maven	m2e
i am sure m2e maven plugin for eclipse - the other way around - can do that

932707
folder	directory
the main thing i am trying to achieve is setting an existing websites home directory to a different folder

932738
subtraction	addition
it is just addition and subtraction

932746
hash	hmac
briefly some mac algorithms hmac use a hash function and include a secret key as part of the hash input

932760
width	height
the trace redraw seems to happen once the image is loaded but the border still does not get redrawn with the correct height and width

932784
decoder	encoder
i once wrote a custom encoder decoder that encoded bytes 0-255 to unicode characters 0-255 and back again

932797
hash	hmac
these concerns may seem overkill but if this is an application you sell for instance then all it takes is for one hacker to break your hash sequence or hmac secret

932860
setinterval	settimeout
use javascript s settimeout and setinterval functions

932940
width	height
for instance height and width could be two different domains

932940
width	height
although both might be stored as numeric 10 2 a height and a width column could not be compared without casting

933001
daemon	cron
in a high traffic situation i would have a separate script that runs a a daemon or cron job and fetches the weather every specified interval and overwrites the public website page when done

933004
put	get
however when we put that string in a text node and call toxml on it we get amp

933014
nsmutablestring	nsstring
any idea from a code design standpoint why does the internal implementation of uitextview uses an nsstring but not an nsmutablestring when its content is meant to change often

933037
superclass	subclassing
i understand why this exception is made but is there any way to cast a superclass to a subclassing

933047
superclass	subclassing
you can t cast a superclass in a subclassing because the subclassing may have a bigger interface than the superclass means the subclassing can have functions like getunixtimestamp that the superclass doesn t have

933050
super	implements
if you re keen on having your subclass implements a constructor in your date class taking a java.util.date foo and in it call super with foo.gettime

933095
try-catch	exception-handling
try-catch statements are used to handle exception-handling

933100
uiview	subviews
i want to draw text into uiview s subviews using drawinrect withfont linebreakmode call but that operates on the current context only

933100
uiview	subviews
the subviews is a generic uiview instance and i don t really want to create a new uiview -derived class just for this purpose if i can avoid it

933120
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
so you already can inherited and add properties fields methods to your subclassing that will all be handled by reflection if the dynamic path doesn t do the lookup

933144
multiplying	multiplication
filtering in the time domain is just multiplication in the frequency domain so you may want to just apply a filter which is just multiplying each frequency by a value for the function for the filter you are using

933199
hash	salt
my understanding is that plaintext passwords should be appended to a random salt and that whole phrase should be hash by some hashing algorithm such as

933222
pascal	delphi
other than that if you like pascal delphi s compiler can produce native exes

933238
postgresql	mysql
they all support mysql and postgresql among others

933250
pascal	delphi
pascal delphi maybe

933291
crypt	salt
the way you check your user s password is that you take their clear text input and crypt it with the salt and then compare the crypted_passwords if they match they are authenticated

933301
nswindow	nsapplication
you would need to look at the appropriate methods of nswindow such as -setframe animated or nsapplication

933309
uiview	subviews
you can always make your subviews a uiview subclass that overrides -drawrect to display the text you want.

933334

for-loop	arrays
this way the for-loop will not fail as the constructor in the for-loop uses all the parameters of the arrays

934002
for-loop	arrays
i could accept another parameter called size which will be used in the for-loop but that doesn t solve my problem if parameters 1 and 2 are of size 10 and the 3rd parameter is an arrays of size 9

935426
children	parent
for a parent-child entity relationship when and why would you use a dao interface for only the parent and when would you make also make dao for the children

935426
children	parent
to me it makes sense to only make a dao for the parent if the children must belong to a parent and should not exist as orphans

935426
children	parent
so if i wanted to delete a child i would modify the parent s set of children and call parentdao.update parent

935432

your problem is that you are trying to extends an interface rather than implements it

935520
error-handling	exception-handling
the useful thing about exception-handling is that they immediately leap out of the current method and head up the call stack until they re caught and handled which means you can move error-handling logic higher up although ideally not too high

children	parent
i am talking about the number to the right of one of the rows in the circle which is displaying how many children the parent has

935828
width	height
the only time that i m aware of that this can cause issues is if there is some constraint limited space available explicit width height with oversized contents etc. which makes automatic scrollbars undesirable but that isn t common

935849
filtering	grouping
in management studio you can right click on the tables grouping to create a filtering for the table list

935862
width	height
what then happens is that the height is not good enough for most readers so i copy the image and duplicated it above it so it now is the width i want and double the height of the generator

935920
ubuntu	centos
check vmware server out and install centos ubuntu

935921
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i tried implementing viewwillappear and viewdidload in the view controller but those didn t get called

935943
gendarme	fxcop
i have used gendarme like fxcop to determine which code wasn t called

935945
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i know that when you assign a delegate to a uinavigationcontroller the component uiviewcontroller delegate methods are not called

935948
gridview	rowdatabound
it looks like you are binding the same data on each rowdatabound event of the gridview

935981

the first get works fine but the post fails with the webexception above

936023
post	put
but i found another way that is a bit more complicated but will achieve what i put in this post

936125
fadein	hide	hide	show
i presume if it is hidden hide then fadein will automatically show it

936217
gmail	hotmail
the best part of their services is that they have whitelist agreements with the major email providers hotmail yahoo gmail etc so your emails don t end up in the junkmail box

936218
g++	gcc
i am using eclipse in linux and i didn t have any problems compiling after i added -lpthread to the compiler arguments to g++ gcc and linker

you need to be careful with fast-forward merge though

936269
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a custom control that is derived from tabitem and i want to databind that custom tabitem to a stock tabcontrol

936272
division	modulo
the easiest way is to use the modulo division operator

936272
division	modulo
modulo division returns the remainder

936296
int	boolean
instead of addperson returning a boolean it can return an int 0 success non zero equals failure and the number indicates the reason why it failed

936307
submit	submission
when i want to create a new comment i put in the view in a hidden field the contactid and it was submission with everything else on the submit button

atomic	interlocked
the interlocked operations are still atomic

936455
websphere	ibm
websphere ibm s app server has its own bundled web server

936467
apache	lighttpd
if you know what you re doing in apache lighttpd or whatever you re serving files with you could set your cache headers just like google s and significantly reduce the amount of data your end user has to download by serving it from your own server

936531
folder	directory
it s in the root directory of the www folder

936549
sudo	chgrp
sudo chgrp -r www-data home kollar apps kinfonet current

936612
int	double
if there were a math.pow double int it could probably be more efficient

936633
umdf	wdf
since the wfp seems to be for win2k8 vista or better you can use wdf - when you see references to umdf user mode and kmdf kernel mode this is what they are talking about

936645

sorting	grouping
also you can continually do card sorting exercises right down to page and function levels - you do one card sorting session to understand user needs then you take one grouping of cards and ask users to break that down into ranks of importance

937007
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
web fonts are supported in safari 3.1 the upcoming firefox 3.5 and the upcoming opera 10

937007
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
at this point the biggest problems with the implementation in safari firefox and opera is that they require you to upload the original font file to your web server

937058
mousemove	mouseout	mousemove	keydown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mousemove	keydown	keyup	keydown	mouseup	keydown	mousedown	keyup	mouseup	keyup	mousedown	mouseout	mouseup	mouseout	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
before jquery 1.4 this was limited to the following events click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout keydown keypress keyup

937211
disk	ram
at some point if you re doing randomish queries and your working set is sufficiently larger than ram then you ll be limited by the small number of random iops a disk can do

937230
multiplying	add
you can then use this value to transfer it into the other range by reversing this calculation with the other bounds so to speak multiplying it by d - c and add c

937251
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have different tabitem in a tabcontrol

937280
put	get
i just don t know how to run a query which would get data from oracle and put into mssql on regular basis without manual interaction

937296
folder	directory
the simplest way without changing a lot of configuration is to put everything in the public folder you mention into your public_html folder then place all the other contents like the application and library folder into the directory up from public_html

937351
client-side	server-side
since ms appears to have killed managed javascript in the latest dlr for both server-side asp.net futures and client-side silverlight has anyone successfully used non-obsolete apis to allow scripting of their application objects with jscript.net and or can explain how to do so

937364
gridview	objectdatasource
the gridview gets data from an objectdatasource which is set via the datasourceid property in the code in front

gridview is loaded with list data from objectdatasource

937374
icq	xmpp
it provides a way for xmpp users to log into and communicate through their legacy im accounts such as aim icq msn yahoo and friends

937376
queue	fifo
you should probably wrap it to protect the integrity of the queue fifo only

937418

as ichiban noted these supported events are click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout keydown keypress keyup

937472
width	height
i get strange width height values mc._width 601.95 mc._height 261.15 when what i actually want is the stage size of the loaded swf file which in this case i know to be 300px x 250px

937492
x86	64bit
why not just always compile for x86 does the 64bit runtime give you any benefit

937533
post	get
i seem to remember reading some hack to get it look like the native widget but searching for it know i can t seem to find it again i came across post that suggest using java.awt.filechooser but that class does not seem to be in the distribution

937557
filtering	grouping
grouping indices are filtering according

937557
filtering	grouping
words grouping filtering has higher

937559
jobs	cron
for this reason cleanup code like this is either best handled by a cron job which looks for stale jobs on a periodic basis and cleans up the db

937560
tcplistener	tcpclient
this is made to work directly with tcpclient tcplistener so it s very easy to encrypt a data stream using this

937635
cpu	processors
for instance i have a network-intensive java process -- it s the only thing running and the cpu is at 99 but only 55 of that is reported as processors cpu

937647
gridview	objectdatasource	gridview	formview	gridview	sqldatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource	sqldatasource	formview	objectdatasource	formview
a gridview or a formview can support automatic updates only if it is used with some kind of a properly configured datasource objectdatasource sqldatasource etc.

937654
width	height
when requesting the size of the loaded swf like you do it will return the width and height of the entire surface of the first frame not that of the stage

937663
hide	show
when the user does another search that returns results you hide this control and show the results in the list view normally

937684
folder	directory
the image is in the same directory as all of my source code and it s under the resources folder in the xcode project

937694
perforce	svn
to be fair i have limited experience with git and none with hg but one thing i miss about svn perforce etc the few times i do use it is a nice low integer revision number i can report to other developers

937713
processors	hyperthreading
for context assume that the code would be required to run on any type of processors single core hyperthreading multicore etc

937775
int	double
once the size of an int is exceeded every added bit to the original bit-fields will double the storage space

937775
int	double
once the size of an int is exceeded every added bit also double the number of and operations needed to implement the logic

937800
public	protected
finally access specifiers public private protected grant the compiler certain leeway with packing of data members

937810
width	height
secondly i donâ t want to define the height and width of the grid

937810
width	height
i want it to take as much as possible and show scrollbars just like we do in html table by setting width and height as 100

937818
hex	binary
also the value of the mask in hex when converted to binary doesn t have zeroes in the least 5 significant places as the question says so i am not sure how it will mask the least 5 sig places

937870
bazaar	git
i chose bazaar and git for the experience

937921
rss	feed
i ve discovered there is a helper to aid in the parsing of rss feed on the kohana framework

938023
hash	hmac	hash	salt
alternatively store a hmac salt hash of the important columns in each row when saving your data and in your initial sqlite db

938023
hash	hmac
when loading each row verify the data against the hmac hash and if verification fails act accordingly

938038
division	modulo
i need to implement a simple macro that finds the modulo of two numbers on a processor that doesn t have a division operator think arm

938038
division	subtraction
i could use division by repeated subtraction but i don t know if this was the most efficient or easiest to work with

938045
post	get
i think what you re thinking about without really knowing it is the post redirect get pattern

938047
debian	linux
i have debian linux installed on the server

938073
hash	salt
it might be overkill but you could hash their email address with sha1 using your guid newguid is fine as a hash salt and place that in the url

938073
hash	salt
even if somebody were to know what email addresses to try they would never be able to generate a hash collision without knowing the guid you salt with or it would take them a hell of a long time

938073
hash	salt
of course you would have to save their email and the hash salt guid in the database

938075
division	logarithm
a b 2 log2 a -log2 b if you can get the logarithm of the values you can closely approximate the division

938076
put	get
not to mention that if he puts in his own email he can put in any random address too flooding some poor shmuck s inbox and possibly causing your mail server to get blacklisted.

938084
post	put	post	get	put	get
what it certainly doesn t do is check if the http verb is a post or a get which most people assume you can see this if you set up a simple page and put the viewstate and eventvalidation if present fields in the query string then check ispostback

938087
width	height
bitmapbuffer width height hasalpha are the out parameters

938090
prepare	execute
it s faster pdo caches the query in the prepare and then uses the parameters passed in execute

938095
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i have an nsstring or nsmutablestring and would like to get the number of occurrences of a particular character

938154
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
this is why apple defines delegate methods like viewdidappear viewwillappear otherwise we would not need them as we would know precisely when these events occur

938165
onmouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseout
the requirement is that i need img1 on mouseover and img2 on mouseout which is working fine but on click i need the div to be opened and img2 get frozen and in again click div disappears and onmouseover and onmouseout states working

938177
extjs	mootools
mootools jq extjs have their own growl notification projects

938184
vim	emacs
in practice i ve found that to be a pain in linux more less harder to grep emacs vim and in windows notepad i have to go through menus to enable auto-wrap for example

938227
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
while it works just fine in firefox google-chrome safari and opera

938287

the problem was that i had a div-element with fixed height width but the content got larger than calculated

938321
gmail	hotmail
facebook they let you type in your email address and if they know it yahoo gmail hotmail etc they will ask you for your password and retrieve your contacts automatically

938326
subtract	add
semaphore at the very simplest is just a counter you can add and subtract from with a single atomic operation

938332
width	height
the biggest thing that +imagenamed does is decode the image data from the source file which almost always significantly inflates the data size for example a screen sized png file might consume a few dozen kbs when compressed but consumes over half a mb decompressed - width height 4

938403
mouse	keyboard
losing keyboard focus to flash basically removes my browser s functionality until i use the mouse to click elsewhere i use mozilla firefox

938403
mouse	keyboard
normal browser shortcuts are rendered useless by having to use the mouse to return keyboard focus to the browser

938408
nsstring	nsdata
now within this method i pass the nsdata object into the following command to get a nsstring representation of the data received

938511
post	get
overload the detail action missing the fullroute param and have the overloaded action be a get action so that the post fullroute value is not required for when users are ok with the generic back link

938511
post	get
this should serve both generic get requests to the detail page and the post request which will include the specific back to results link for the filtered list

938649
put	get
if you don t have an upper boundary for the total size use pool on a rope - when the big chunk of memory runs out get a new one and put these chunks in a list

938657
onfling	gestures
watch in awe as your overridden methods are hit both the onclick view v of the activity and the onfling of the gestures listener

938703
profiler	yourkit
yourkit java profiler commercial

938795
post	put	post	get	put	get
for example if i perform a head request to your web service and one of the http headers in its response is www-authenticate ntlm then the credentials stored in defaultcredentials would be encrypted using ntlm and then sent up with the full get post put whatever

938826
mouse	keyboard
i am a big fan of shortcuts in vs2008 it can save a lot of time and keep your fingers on the keyboard instead of the mouse

938859
int	double
double tjd int ipl int32 iflag

938884
ienumerator	idisposable
the non-generic ienumerator doesn t extend idisposable but the c# compiler still generates code to call dispose conditionally

938897
folder	directory
at the moment i m getting a list of directory by using my.computer.filesystem.getdirectories however this obviously fails when the folder is password protected

938898

938944
gridview	repeater
in the itemdatabound event of the repeater bind the gridview to something that enumerates all the events for that month

938999
free	realloc
would be fine of course you need realloc free also to be setup as appropiate

938999
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
if you want to get fancy make free realloc auto-detect which heap handle on it s own by evaluating the address of the pointer or even adding some logic to allow malloc to identify which heap to use based on it s thread id and building a heierarchy of per-thread heaps and shared global heap s pools

939023
sorting	filtering
no filtering sorting and page 1 - this will help in a small way for performance

939023
sorting	filtering
for navigation back to the list you may need a new small controller which accepts simply the listresult.key hash value and redirects re-creates the state of the list view paging filtering and sorting included from the lookup in the repo

939120
pull	push
this is the hg-git plugin for mercurial adding the ability to push to and pull from a git server repository from hg

939150
inherited	properties
the pdfsettings properties would be defined in your base printjob class and each of the specific print job classes would inherited from that base class

939155
mp3	ogg
once you have your pcm data using a ogg c lib or managed code something like this of course there are licencing issues with mp3 you will need a way to play it unfortunatly .net does not provide any direct assess to your sound card or methods to play streaming audio

939155
wav	ogg
you could convert the ogg files to pcm at startup and then use system.media.soundplayer to play the wav files generated

939189
ddms	adb
you can examine your log via adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse

939193
actionscript	mxml
i mean for example if i have my actionscript and mxml files and compile them to a swf can i get the source back out of the swf file

939227
nsstring	nsdata
you don t have to retain the nsdata array since its content will be converted copied into the new nsstring object

939237
pull	push
to do this kind of thing i would prefer to use message queues and a consistent storage engine like a database with processing clients that pull work from the queues perform the job and push results to another queue with jobs not being executed in some timeframe made available for others to process

939263
hide	show
hide each page as a tab so they are actually there but just not show

939418
memcached	ncache
to answer your question i have heard excellent things about ncache and memcached

939487
innodb	myisam
it s also harder to backup innodb tables than myisam because with the latter if the table is flushed you can just copy the files but the former has issues

939495
komodo	radrails
the ruby edition of netbeans 6.5 is the best one i ve used so far and i ve pretty much had a go at all of them komodo the various eclipse plugins ruby-specific releases like radrails beta release of e might be usable nowadays but i assume it has no debugger which is key for me arachnoruby some others i don t recall

939637
getter	setter
you can prevent changes to the reference by using a private or internal setter but you cannot prevent changes to the object itself if it s exposed by a getter

939639
put	get
you can put that into the get part of the url such as yourpage.jsp

939653
rss	feed
google s feedfetcher claims it polls rss feed slightly less than once per hour

939693
filtering	grouping
i want to write queries that do things like get data from multiple tables sum quantities compare dates grouping filtering etc

939696
disk	ram
or trade some disk ram space for speed or if you can give up some time upfront during the loading of your program you can precompute lookup tables instead of doing calculations - that way the processing is fast

939709
rss	feed
try to adapt to frequency of new items in each single rss feed

939738
nsmutablestring	nsstring
as i think you re overwriting an nsmutablestring pointer with an nsstring which might cause a memory leak

939755
post	get
and then you could find them all by post.all but you would get back photo and video objects and post objects if you have post that are not photo or video

939769
hide	show
i would say the best way if you absolutly can not use the flash cs4 would be to have a series of loader objects and the hide and show them on every in sequence

939770
valgrind	memcheck
also run valgrind memcheck and see what that says

939784
antialiasing	transparent
png colors transparent background and antialiasing are all included

interpolation	splines
in particular i need a way to represent a curve splines that passes through a set of known 3d points and a way of finding other points on the curve splines by subdivision interpolation

939887
stdout	stderr
it s worth knowing the difference between stdin stdout and stderr - they all have their uses

939887
stdout	stderr
in particular stdout should be used for normal program output whereas stderr should be reserved only for error messages abnormal program execution

939914
hide	show
i want to use an image of a calendar to show hide the jquery datepicker

939943
public	protected
the constructor is protected - if you make it public or use getdeclaredconstructor instead of getconstructor it should work

939944
put	get
one important practice is to make sure things you put in application log files or the windows event log also get logged to the trace system with the same details timestamp

939950
hide	show
disable or even hide the link in the onclick handler and then reenable or show it when you get a response

939951
src	attr
i attr src arguments i

939989
g++	gcc
for example i know that invoking gcc through the name g++ instead of gcc causes gcc to behave differently it treats .c files as c++ source and links-in the c++ standard library

940087
integer	unsigned
size_t is defined as an unsigned integer but the size of it depends on whether you re on a 32 or 64-bit machine

940120
setinterval	settimeout
how is the value returned from setinterval and settimeout the ones used to clear the timers calculated

940126
free	malloc
if you have done any kind of study in algorithmic efficiency big o notation and the like you d know or be able to work out that most free store implementations can make no guarantees on the lower or even upper bounds of the algorithim iterations that will be executed to find an available block in the free store to satisfy the new malloc request

940135
setinterval	settimeout
in firefox itâ s just integer incrementing on each call of settimeout or setinterval

940148
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval are from

940158
width	height
after extending the pixel height and width to accommodate the file i apply and publish

940192
subtract	add
the idea i use in this is to extend the hours a day have from 24h to 27h +3 but only where cardeventtime is less or equal to 03 00 00 24h i add 24h and to cardeventdate subtract 1d

940198

how would make a status item when the actually button is clicked in the menu bar not in a drop down menu show or hide a window

940536
boost	stl
c++ boost stl

940544
width	height
the salient part of such a control would be a 9 part grid in which 4 parts were of fixed size the corners two parts had fixed height and variable widths center top and center bottom two parts had fixed widths and variable height left center and right center and the final part had variable height and width the middle

940604
folder	directory
i created wsp solution added my class file and changed the output directory to the bin folder

940615
postgresql	mysql
sqlserver probably has an equivalent of the explain plan statement that oracle postgresql and mysql all support in one form or another

940665
put	get
in other words if i put a bunch of stuff into google base if any of it shows up in a regular google search is there a way for me to control what parameters get passed to the landing page and thus what search is performed on the landing page or is that out of my control

940782
boost	stl
please note that boost python offers some built-in mechanism to convert python containers to stl compatible containers

940787
for-loop	arrays
when ever you need to you could then iterate over the arrays in a for-loop looking for the first item with a value

940797
cassini	iis
i haven t had any trouble with cassini but you might try iis just for grins

940802
int	chars
you could either treat them as chars then concatenate them then parse back to int

940802
multiplying	add
or you can add each item to the result then multiplying the result by ten to set the magnitudes

940825
width	height
with this itemrenderer it s possible that the contents could exceed the width and height of the datagrid cell - and when this happens scroll bars appear letting me scroll the individual cell

940907
webkit	gecko
i have considered using a rendering engine like webkit or gecko and somehow adapting these to do this however this is a fairly large task and i don t really want to duplicate something which has already been done

940957
children	parent
how would you make a checkbox which is on a parent groups row in an outline view become checked when all it s children s checkbox s are checked

940980

i think if i don t find something i m going to rewrite our grammars with ocamllex ocamlyacc

940998
hide	show
show hide nodes

941027

941046
put	get
is some of the articles are too long and get truncated when i put them into my mssql database

941142
versioning	upgrade	stateless	stateful
instead of making a stateful script that always checks the current state and acts based on that state deploy via a series of stateless scripts that upgrade from well known versioning

941188
profiling	instrumentation
for more general profiling like object allocation you want to use instrumentation which is also part of apple s developer tools suite

941292
mouseleave	mouseenter
here s a little code snippet i used with an image map and mouseenter mouseleave events

941323
inject	interceptor
spring for dependency injection transaction management security and for adding interceptor and for getting the possibility to inject different implementations of interfaces when in unit-test as oppose to deployed on a server

941325
quicksort	heapsort
the canonical example is quicksort which has a worst time of o n 2 while heapsort s is o n logn

941325
quicksort	heapsort
in practice however quicksort is usually faster then heapsort

941325
quicksort	heapsort
each iteration in quicksort is a lot simpler than heapsort

941326
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
what would happen if you call close on a sqlconnection object before you call close on a sqldatareader using that connection

941386
getter	setter
if i need a constructor i ll add one and the same goes for special getter and setter

941425
vb.net	vb6
in either vb6 or vb.net just add the com+ dll to your references and you can call the object in this manner

941439
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
however you should close dispose the sqldatareader also otherwise it will keep a reference to the sqlconnection object keeping them both in memory

941439
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
eventually the finalizer will dispose the sqldatareader object if you don t do it and then the sqlconnection object can also be collected but you have no control over when that happens

941497
disk	ram
to better analyze algorithms which handle data in excess of available ram the i o-model was born where you count the number of disk reads

941498
hide	show
i would like to use tabs but i m stuck with .net 2.0 and from what i can gather the only way to hide show tabs are to remove them and re-add them

941498
hide	show
i could make custom controls for each and either have them all loaded and hide show when necessary which i have done in the past on projects or dispose and re-instantiate them.

941545
folder	directory
an easier approach would be to create a solution that contains all the projects you need modify the references between them to use project references change the projects so their output folder all point to the same directory and then setup the project references so that copy local is set to false

941560
boost	stl
regarding c++ the he boost library is the most used library so you should start by looking there if you already know c++ contrary to what i saw in some of the previous answers you must understand that the stl is now part of the standard and so part of the c++ language

941569
pop-up	dialog
if i m generating a binary file inside flash player how do i pop-up a save dialog for the file without sending it up the the server first

941603
int	double
i don t know for sure but i assume that int longs and double are given more space because they are pretty large as it is

941634
many-to-many	many-to-one
actually this looks like a many-to-many mapping rather than a many-to-one as there is no code that prevents a category from belonging to more than one page surely you want something like

941637
pop-up	dialog
the filereference.save method will pop-up a dialog for the user to choose where to save the file so the filename given is just a suggested filename

941651
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
and my application crushes apparently because of having a uinavigationcontroller in uitabbarcontroller

to put it simple it makes sure that the put post delete methods that can modify content requests to your web app are made from the client s browser and not from a third party an attacker that has access to a cookie created on the client side

941685
xna	spritebatch
in xna when is it appropriate to render your game content using more than one spritebatch

versions supporting 16-bit real and protected modes 32-bit and 64bit are all supported

941778
post	get
i would like to be able to launch the debugger from firefox so that all get and post variables were automatically passed to the debugger

941857
free	malloc
if for some reason unknown to me you need to store your pointer in a void then free it you should use malloc and free

941862
keydown	keyup
it does however detect enter on the keydown and keyup events

941862
keydown	keyup
keyup keydown fire on all keys

941900
boost	stl
it wouldn t hurt to know use stl boost though

941907
boost	stl
there it would be more productive to go with stl and specially boost

941911
boost	stl
about libraries first learn about the stl and learn to use boost as a standard stl extension

941927
folder	directory
do a ls -l on the parent directory and see what user and group has access to this folder

941990
hex	binary
that being said you can always recode any data to say base64 or hex or binary or whatever you prefer that doesn t have a pipe character

942005
nant	cruisecontrol
so i guess solutions that work with .net in any of various version control systems or build environments msbuild nant cruisecontrol are fair game

942017
x86	64bit	16-bit	64bit
in fact for x86 64 processors performing 32-bit or 16-bit operations are less efficient than 64bit or 8-bit operations due to the operand prefix byte that has to be decoded

942022
free	malloc
if you want to use void why don t you use just malloc free

942022
free	malloc
the bottom line is use malloc free if you want to use void

942025
prepare	execute
strut 2 will execute prepare everytime before it invokes your action method

942027
junit	jmock	nunit	nmock
the n j-series of frameworks nunit junit nmock jmock etc. are typically parallel ports of each other or are based on the same starting principles

942051
inherited	properties
now after thinking about it you most likely do not want the masterpage properties set....but just the class inherited

942094
firefox	safari
this was working but unfortunately both firefox and safari show up as netscape

942110
x86	64bit	folder	directory
for instance call it to convert the path for a folder in program files to a path in program files x86 or vice versa when running on a 64bit system. i need to do this so that when the user is presented with a directory in the gui as when browsing for files or directory he sees the real directory rather than what the app itself thinks it sees

942110
x86	64bit
by default the product is installed under program files on a 32-bit system while on a 64bit system it s installed under program files x86

942111
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
that checks out in google-chrome firefox opera safari.

942123
min	max
this is one way of ensuring only one row per name - you can substitute other functions for min like for eg max

942145
post	get
as mentioned in other post there are a loot of good books on c++ programming.applying design-patterns and techniques from these books into real coding situations will get you back on track quickly

942149
mouseleave	mouseenter
what i want to do is to be able to handle the onmouseenter and onmouseleave events for listboxitem which will start the doubleanimation for that listboxitem - i want to enlarge its font on mouseenter and restore to original size on mouseleave

942216
inherited	properties
i prefer to create a page base class inherited from system.web.ui.page and expose a datacontext properties

942223
punctuation	words
this matches words digits and a number of punctuation characters though by no means all

942239
rss	feed
they have an rss feed with links to individual stories as html but i would like to get the data in a structured format such as xml etc

942267
folder	directory
however i discovered that the checkout directory -setting was wrong it pointed one folder above where it should be hence adding all new files from svn in the wrong place but still building on the old ones

942276
button	checkbox
in this example if the button is clicked the checkbox is set to false however if the user attempts to check the checkbox again the checkbox is unresponsive

942285
getter	setter
if you annotate the methods hibernate will use getter and setter

942307
post	get
if you could post the errors you get from your chmod commands that would help

942327
inherited	properties
do the types match up between the properties within iforumthreadpost and forumthreadpostdetails and does the details class inherited from this interface if it even is an interface

942357
mouseup	mousedown
in this wpf dragdrop sample they call capturemouse on mousedown and release it on mouseup

in ie8 while fadeout is doing its thing the entire text block shifts up 2-3 pixels and then back down 2-3 pixels upon fadein

942481
onmousemove	onmouseup
the switch is used in several other functions onmousemove onmouseup and it seems like bad design big switch copied in several functions

942620
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
the development version of django has aggregate-functions like avg count max min stddev sum and variance link text

942633
min	max
avg count max min stdev sum and variance can all be calculated with constant storage needs

942633
min	max
fwiw the variables you need to track are min max count avg avg of the square of the values

942647
cvs	svn
scm if i m using cvs svn git

942653
disk	ram
in other words save it to the disk but don t reload it just operate on it from ram

firefox	safari
i am experiencing the error in safari 3 and firefox 3.1 for os x

942685
rss	feed
ok i still don t know why the hell it s doing this but i m going to solve it by running my feed through feedburner and then parsing it s rss feed

942728
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
for example if you normally use firefox try safari or opera or google-chrome or msie instead

942743
temp	tmp
one of them deals with mcaffee but the other says that it can occur if your temp or tmp environment variables point to a non-existent directory or one that mysql does not have access to write to

942750
std	ostream
if you really want to keep using std clog for the tee instead of sending output to a different stream you need to work one level lower instead of deriving from ostream derive from streambuf

942775
cvs	svn
collaboration infrastructure svn cvs hg + ticket req-system + wiki + forum + mailing list + xyz

942786
swt	swing
depending on who you ask it is either wonderful or evil since it competes with swing and makes use of native os widgets swt

942803
boost	stl
stl and boost

942810
postgresql	mysql
this is admittedly similar to but not a duplicate of comparison of full text search engine - lucene sphinx postgresql mysql

942825
button	checkbox
here i ve moved the button.click eventtrigger to a surrounding stackpanel and added a new eventtrigger on the the checkbox.click to stop the button s storyboard when the checkbox is clicked

942825
button	checkbox
this lets us check and uncheck the checkbox when it is clicked on and gives us the desired unchecking behavior from the button as well

942834
width	height
in the debugger in viewforheaderinsection it seems that the width of the uilabel object is zero and the height is 1079574528 and the text is null

942859
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the unchecked-exception classes are the class runtimeexception and its subclasses and the class error and its subclasses

942881
post	get
note i used get but it works for post too

942940
postgresql	mysql
see for example the list of postgresql aggregate functions and the list of mysql aggregate functions

942976
post	get
i have it mostly working except i don t know how to past get and post data to the php executable when i pass the file to it

942976
post	get
i ve been testing with get since i haven t gotten to getting post requests handled on the server and i have the string of the arguments that gets passed separated but i don t know how to feed the information to the php parser

943000
post	get
this works perfectly on the development server but whenever i post to this url on apache the django request object comes up empty-- no get post or files data

943059
sudo	passwd
if you want to maintain the chroot jail yet still need the privileges to chmod the current directory you re going to have to figure out how to use sudo with the -s option and pipe the root passwd to stdin in order to get the priviledges

943061
post	put
if you put your own name on a post or something when dealing with a troll you re opening yourself to personal attacks especially if it s in any way debatable

943110
hide	show
i quickly slapped this together but it does show the second console briefly and then hide it

943161
versioning	upgrade
when the api releases a new versioning and you need to upgrade

943267
int	chars
another way is of course define the data as int and cast it to chars array whenever necessary

943294
int	chars
to allow a single type of data to be accessed in several ways as in your example accessing a colour as an int or as you probably intended four chars

943307
vb.net	vb6	vbscript	vb6
if all you are wanting is to check the component responds when called then use a quick vbscript rather than building something in vb6 vb.net

943359
portrait	landscape
another reason for excel instead of pdf is that users can do some minor tweaks and modifications before printing changing landscape portrait layout line numbers adding a custom memo etc.

943366
post	get
it looks like that sid is the session id which presumably is a cookie that you should send back in your next post get

943374
stretchblt	bitblt
try using stretchblt instead of bitblt

943395
strcpy	strncpy
using strncpy rather than strcpy to copy 123456 will ensure that any extra space beyond the end of string null terminator is also initialised to null as long as you specify n as being 100 for your example

943395
memset	malloc
otherwise without initialising the memory allocated by malloc to null memset num 0 100 then it is conceivable that you could step beyond the end of the string

943475
trac	bugzilla
the bugzilla and trac systems mentioned are nice but geared towards bug tracking which is just very different from a tool you d want to use in a helpdesk-type setup where end users would raise incidents

943494
ant	maven
having said all of that i do think that maven is a very interesting and useful system i m not calling it a tool like ant is maven is broader than that for software development configuration and build management

943499
prng	random
well it looks to me like you forgot to seed the prng pseudo random number generator

943507
children	parent
meaning where 10 is the parent and all of it s children and upwards where 10 is the child and all of it s parent

943532
filesystems	fat
fat or fat32 filesystems st_mtime

943532
filesystems	fat
is it possible that you re using files on a fat filesystems

943534
mbunit	nunit
perhaps it can be found in nunit also but i found it in mbunit first

943552
google-chrome	safari
if your ie google-chrome or safari do not show a warning when visiting your secured page it means that you have added this new certificate to trusted certificates database of your account

943563
filesystems	fat
for example for entries in a fat filesystems the finest resolution for modification time is 2 seconds

943682
subtraction	addition
completely un-tested but that s a hell of a reduction for the addition of a one-line method to array and performing a single extra subtraction in a model

943699
scrollable	panels
the following code produces pretty much what i want but the scrollable panels on the left doesn t scroll

943827
hide	show
as i don t think we can explicitly control the show hide of the context menu strip i decided to trap the right mouse button click on the control with which the contextmenustrip is associated

943846
button	checkbox
significantly button checkbox richtextbox and radiobutton and a few others don t raise and event on right click

943995
post	get
google help says that this auth code should be used to send future post get requests

944025
fink	macports
that appears to do everything you want and is available on macports and fink

944029
post	get
this is so that if the user hits refresh on the home page after logging in then they don t get that browser warning about resubmitting a post

944030
for-loop	loops
just a quick note i would do what schnalle does but in your code i would change the for-loop to a while loops as you are not doing anything with the i

944031
jar	.war
this meant the jar files would now be exported in the .war when deploying to tomcat

944031
jaxp	saaj
however i don t like this because the jar files come from a few different libraries in jwsdp-2.0 and copying them like this meant the were all just tossed in together rather than nicely seperated as jaxb jaxp saaj etc

944041
sorting	filtering
check out sun s tutorial for jtables and look at the sorting and filtering section

944045
children	parent
so in a typical model where you have a parent that can have many children and a child that can have only one parent how do you manage the adding of children

944045
children	parent
i could just add an addchild method to the parent class and make that responsible for adding children - the problem now is that there is 2 ways to add a child through the children property and the method

944125
children	parent
i just expose a readonly-copy of the children list so that you can easily iterate over the children of a parent and get the number of children that the parent has

944125
children	parent
adding and removing children to the parent has to be done using the addchild removechild member methods

944138
hide	fadeout
hiding the row either by hide fadeout slideup applying a class setting a css value or by way of an animation

944232
range	minimum
range is the minimum to maximum value supported for that datatype

944236
range	minimum
range is the range of values an datatype can use defined between its minimum and maximum values

944239
range	minimum
range means the maximum and minimum value that can be stored inside the variable of a given type

944245
implements	extends
in other words it would extends arrayobject or implements arrayaccess or something along those lines

944253
hide	show
you change the value of the radiobuttonlist and the textbox will show hide accordingly

944281
range	minimum
in the case of an integer the variable definition is restricted to whole numbers only and the range will cover every number within its range including the maximum and minimum

944296
inherited	properties
when i derive a new type of order class it will inherited the delivery properties of type deliverystrategy

944298
range	max	range	min	min	max
the definition of range is the difference between the max and min values the type can hold

944301
arrayiterator	arrayobject
why don t you change the function signature to allow only arrayobject s arrayiterator s arrayaccess s iteratoraggregate s iterator s or traversable s depending on what you d like to do inside the function

944303
scrollable	panels
now here is some code stolen from perlmongers that creates a scrollable panels with a bunch of buttons

944379
inherited	properties
if there isn t then i would suggest just making the delivery properties virtual so it has to be defined by inherited classes instead

944386
width	height
my code is different to yours as it supplies a width and a height for the window so it opens as a pop-up but if i set ie to always open pop-ups in a new tab it still focusses on the window for me but i have pop-up blocker completely turned off

944399
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
you can also use svn simultaneously with git mercurial bazaar - some projects actually do so

944435
submit	submission
however if you want the user to feel like they are submission a form place a normal button not a submit button on the page that will act as your ajax submit button

944479
int	double
rather it is a way to declare pointer to a function which takes int as argument and returns double same as the prototype

944509
serializable	deserialization
apple provides the nsarchiver and nsunachriver for object serializable deserialization but this can not handle any custom xml schema

944513
post	get
now the issue to get certain functionality i have to post to a page from the old site to make it render differently and thus provide a response to the post

944513
post	put
in old asp the previous developers put a lot of functionality into 1 page and by using the post message i can call upon these functions rendering a different page each time

944541
queue	fifo
i read that you can queue up actionscript events somehow so that events are processed in a fifo basis

944553
range	max
this means that the loop min+ range max enters a for all intents and purposes infinite loop

944553
min	max
db 10 print self- max - self- min

944587
width	height
iframe true width 800 height 530

944602
persistent	transient
i couldn t create a transient which is not persistent to the database property

944636
versioning	upgrade
if you bought your copy of dterm the upgrade to the next versioning is free regardless of when you purchased dterm

944642
peer	p2p
other extreme p2p radio system source peer

944706
inherited	properties
however if your derived class is not sealed classes that inherited from it could introduce the same types of problems by hiding the delivery properties with a version of their own

944751
min	max
in your case the min and max values are exactly adjacent representable values so there can t be more than one partition

944760
int	double
this works since modf takes the int part of the double and returns the fractions part

944769
floating-point	fractions
if you re dealing with an actual floating-point number as opposed to a string representation of such you should use modf for splitting out the integral and fractions parts

944773
jlist	jtable
you should be able to use a similar process to find child components in jlist or jtable which also use this renderer pattern

944780
free	malloc
if you just want a buffer use malloc free

944786
post	put	post	get	put	get
there is an add-on for wcf called the wcf rest starter kit which will also be included in wcf 4.0 with .net 4.0 which allows you to use get post put delete http commands to query wcf services and such

ubuntu	debian	uninstall	upgrade
this way you should get the maximum benefits 1 all the bleeding edge features you want 2 proper debian ubuntu package which you may easily uninstall upgrade and deploy to any number of debian machines

944925
mp3	ogg
i was wondering if anyone knew how to convert an mp3 audio file to an ogg audio file

944931
apache	nginx
use nginx over apache especially

944966
cpu	processors
in a multiprocessor system or a multicore processors intel quad core core two duo etc.. does each cpu core processors have its own cache memory data and program cache

944983
superclass	subclassing
one of the requirements is that you have a group of related classes a set of subclassing with a single superclass

944990
mp3	ogg
you will need to decode mp3 then encode into ogg

944990
mp3	ogg
one possibility is to use liblame for mp3 decoding and libogg libvorbis for encoding into ogg

945003
post	put	post	get	put	get
it takes in a url and a request method get post put etc and i want to be able to parse the url and open a httpsurlconnection or httpurlconnection based on whether it is https or http assume the given urls will always be correct

945003
post	get
then that will automatically create a urlconnection that can accept both http and https but if i do this then i can t find any way to set a request method get post etc since only the httpsurlconnection or httpurlconnection classes have the setrequestmethod method

945009
mp3	ogg	decoder	encoder
you need a mp3 decoder and a ogg encoder and a little bit of glue code around that opening files setting up the codecs piping raw audio data around ect.

945012
folder	directory
in this case the settings.xml file is in the current directory but i normally put it in the user s app data folder because you can always write to that

945024
richfaces	tomahawk
my application also uses facelets tomahawk and richfaces

945039
mp3	ogg
it would take only a few clicks to convert from mp3 to ogg

945039
mp3	ogg	mp3	flac	flac	ogg
keep in mind that moving from a lossy format to a lossy format will reduce the quality of the audio more than moving from a lossless format flac cd audio apple lossless codec to a lossy format mp3 ogg m4a

945073
x86	64bit
x86 - 32bit - can not be loaded into a 64bit process

945110
rss	feed
i suggest giving them the java rss feed from stackoverflow

945196
paradox	bde
connecting to bde paradox from c#

945211
g++	gcc
i am trying to link a .a library that was built with gcc to a program built using g++

945293
min	max
this is the version with group by min .. and max ..

945293
min	max
if your cardeventtime is sting not integer then you must ensure that it has leading zeros 020000 not 20000 otherwise the min max will not sort it properly so that 20000 is higher then 150000

945355
firefox	safari
silverlight is cross browser compatible what you see in ie is what you ll get in firefox safari and the same on the apple mac versions of the browsers

945363
versioning	upgrade
try clearing the option always upgrade to the installed versioning of office

945398
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
i also have an nsarraycontroller in each of the sub-view controllers which is bound to the nstreecontroller via some overly-complicated keypaths

945416
awt	swing
this is often called the swing or awt event thread

945416
awt	swing
build a list of items and be able to do something else you should use a thread other than the awt event thread the main swing one

945416
awt	swing
so in these cases you spawn a new thread and do what you have to and when the results finally come back you then somehow have to create an event that can be executed by the awt swing dispatcher

945428
opera	google-chrome
i need to do google-chrome opera hacks because of a font replacement script wanted by the client that breaks things.

945463
profiler	hprof
hprof java profiler

945482
ubuntu	debian
tested on the default installations of ubuntu intrepid jaunty and debian lenny and those are affected too

945509
int	double
say you have a function with 3 parameters that are int and it returns a double

945522
hide	show
honestly i d just make a regular window and hide show it as appropriate - just have an itemscontrol whose datatemplate is a menuitem

945545
gif	png
i allow them to upload png gif and jpeg images

945571
webkit	gecko
that said most browsers you ll encounter today safari webkit gecko ie will have decent xslt support

945572
paradox	bde	paradox	dbase	bde	dbase
the bde could work with several file types foxpro dbase paradox ascii and sometimes even access

945585
serializable	deserialization
unfortunately the .net serializable engine at least by default totally ignores automatic properties on deserialization and only cares about the backing field which is obviously not present in the javascript object

945618
versioning	upgrade
upgrade are defined as full versioning releases not content or add-ons

945627
response.redirect	redirecttoaction
i m guessing that the response.redirect and server.transfer throw errors because in mvc you should be calling the redirecttoaction methods from the controller

945641
hash	md5
the md5 function is over twice as fast and the sha1 hash is about 35 faster

945655
int	double
however the chance that you re going to run out of bits when working with int or longs or double etc

945655
int	double
automatic conversion from int to long float to double etc

945674
calloc	malloc
does this have something to do with scope or do i need to allocate memory using malloc or calloc for the pointer to pointer

945691
pop-up	dialog
my friend insisted that the best you could do was pop-up the print dialog for the user they would have to click print themselves

945692
junit	testng
i would recommend switching from junit to testng

945692
junit	testng
testng has a lot of advanced features over junit

945695
implements	extends
i ve solved this problem by implements a base class that test classes should extends if such functionality is desired

945746
int	double
you can define lua_number to be a double default float or any int

945764
sqldatasource	objectdatasource	sqldatasource	linqdatasource	linqdatasource	objectdatasource
expects a column with the name of item which you would have if you were binding to one of the datasource controls such as sqldatasource objectdatasource or linqdatasource

945768
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
nsarraycontroller and nstreecontroller are treated more as view objects than true controllers so it sounds like you re on the right track

945768
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
i would have started about the same way you did giving each nsviewcontroller its own nsarraycontroller or nstreecontroller as needed and configuring the bindings between them at runtime through the window controller that s responsible for putting all the pieces together

945768
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
if you think it would simplify things it doesn t sound like there would be anything wrong with moving the nsarraycontroller and nstreecontroller objects to the window controller

945774
hash	md5
addendum when i measured i saw a factor of 2.6x comparing your crc32 to the md5 hash when the app was compiled with debug+ and optimize-

945775
public	protected
some of these classes are not public protected as such in the api docs they wont have links to the class documentation

945820
int	chars
this includes things like the data wrappers int string chars etc... data classes and collections

945839
versioning	upgrade
you have features requests inquiries and schedule items too you might have to upgrade to the latest versioning to take advantage of those

945846
matlab	simulink
some of those models have been converted to c++ but the current trend is to create these models using matlab simulink

945846
matlab	simulink
from a computer science perspective i have always felt matlab simulink was not a good solution

945899
opera	firefox
on my computer even firefox and opera failed completely .

945921
set	bag
attributes however are naturally a property bag - a set of values rather than a sequence

945942
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested in ie firefox google-chrome .

945948
gif	png	tiff	png
so as you can see the name of the image is file.png and this works correctly it saves the image as png also works with jpeg tiff gif and it can be loaded with any image processing application

946017
temp	tmp
so combining that page with your post i would guess that either one of the tmp temp or userprofile variables for your administrator user points to the windows path or else they re not set and it s taking a fallback to the windows temp path

946018
ssl	https
if you just want to transmit data safe from outside snoopers why not just use ssl https

946110
ninject	spring.net
what is spring.net ninject with respect to ioc and aop

946114
wtl	atl
so my question is how can i use idispatch in c to create the com object without having to depend on mfc .net c# wtl or atl

946128
put	get
going further if you mean to get optimal with really large scale networks and are ready to put in some time and effort -- consider a structured p2p mechanism like dht

946183
rss	feed
also there is a application called blog rss feed reader if you wanted to go the rss route

946189
google-chrome	firefox
i have a code that works only in ie anb i was looking for something similar in firefox and google-chrome to set user s default homepage through a link click here to make this site your default homepage but so far i didn t find anything

946208
inherited	properties
inherited from panel add a properties that represents the text you need to write and override the onpaintmethod

946210
int	double
i read somewhere about other data structures similar to hashtables dictionaries but instead of using int they were using floats double etc

946218
restrict	shared
while it is not good to be restrict to a least common denominator and hopefully your management will realize this you should not overlook the benefits of shared experience

946228
width	height
you can create a 2 views one for each line set the background color of that view to whatever you want the colors to be and then set the height to 1px and the width to fill_parent

946251
winpcap	wireshark
i d only like to use something like wireshark as a last resort if no other method is available as i d like such dumping to be available on the clients machines without having to install winpcap and stuff

946297
ninject	spring.net	autofac	castle-windsor
spring.net ninject unity castle-windsor autofac are all ioc containers which are configurable in different ways many of them do also support aop

946330
opera	firefox
my endless tweets user script works equally well in firefox webkit and opera

946348
boost	stl
it may be a bit much for a newbie but it is a great next-step after learning stl and boost

946366
post	get
basically i need to simulate a response.redirect but do so with a post instead of a get and also set a couple request parameters

946404
floating-point	integer
it s not hard to write a simple polynomial type hash function that outputs a floating-point value rather than an integer value but it s difficult to ensure that the resulting hash function has the desired properties without getting into the details of the particular floating-point representation used

946404
floating-point	fractions
doing the same for a calculation with a bunch of floating-point fractions would be a drag

946415
equals	gethashcode
as others have noted implementing equals and gethashcode is a step in the right direction

946474
accessor	properties
inside the class methods i always use the properties accessor with the dot syntax and never access the private ivars directly

946474
accessor	properties
however i ve seen some sample code that uses declared properties to expose the relationships do not implement the kvc accessor methods yet are still key-value observable

946474
accessor	properties
so the question is if i use properties to model to-many relationships do i still need to implement the kvc accessor mutator methods

946488
put	get
if you put just the full name in as the recipient you won t get anything

946523
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the microsoft model is used in internet explorer and the w3c model is used in other browsers firefox opera safari google-chrome etc.

946547
firefox	safari
this works fine in ie and firefox when the user hits the back button they are presented with a page expired message and are forced to login but in safari the last page the user was working on shows up

946555
filtering	grouping
inspired from query anything with sqlite article i would like to let sqlite engine to do the dirty work grouping filtering etc

946574
children	parent
this is the parent canvas so it has no parent only children

946580
hash	md5
md5 hash collisions

946590
gmail	hotmail
sure people can create dozens of email addresses using gmail or hotmail or even if they have their own private domain

946591
viewdidload	viewwillappear
on any load after that the viewdidload will not fire letting the viewwillappear to do its loyal flipping job

946593
put	get
i have a byte array 8 bits in each position of the array and what i need to do is to put together 2 of the values of the array and get a value

946600
width	height
the canvas should do this automatically unless you are manually setting the height and or width

946614
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
if this doesn t work then what you could do is bind the width and height properties of the canvas to the actualwidth and actualheight properties of the containing window

946624
filtering	grouping
then you can use different querys on that temporary table to do your grouping filtering etc

946628
winpcap	wireshark
there is microsoft s netmon or as you said a winpcap based product like wireshark

946642
int	chars
chars index const chars int will always be true

946642
int	chars
and index would be a function to the chars index const chars int function in the standard library but what does the index function do

946649
rss	feed
i wanto to build a wcf service that read rss syndication feed .net 3.5 sp1

946651
hlsl	glsl
if glsl is anything like hlsl directx s equivalent which i suspect it is i think you are stuck with passing attributes

946717
adplus	cdb
i have done this in the past on xp machines but with my current vista ultimate setup - the adplus script doesn t spawn the 2nd window with cdb running

946717
adplus	cdb
has anyone managed to setup adplus cdb crash dumps for iis 7 in vista 64 ultimate

946718
int	boolean
boolean are meant to be used for specific purposes flags and shouldn t be mixed with int else the uses of variables can potentially become quite confusing

946729
jquery	jqtransform
i am using the jquery form plugin the jquery validation plugin and the jqtransform plugin

946739
cassini	iis
i have a wcf web service that i am hosting in iis actually running within the visual studio web host cassini

946750
int	boolean
in c int are frequently doubly used as a normal number and a boolean such as for loops that run while a certain number is not zero

946750
int	double
this kind of double nature allegedly frequently leads to problems and it makes the code less readable since you have to judge from the context whether a given usage of an int is intended as int or bool

946750
int	boolean
if you absolutely need to use a boolean as an int you can either use

946782
cos	sin
then you can calculate your carthesian position with the sin and cos of the angle

946864
post	get
use your favorite search engine to search for what you want to do or post examples of your test here and get comments - this will help you improve what you are doing

946876
int	chars
if your variable is a primitive type int chars etc.

946896
width	height
the problem is that you re specifying the height and width

946932
folder	directory
under c c++- general- additional include directory add the folder where you have your .h file

946943
multiplying	add
after that multiplying each input pixel value with the corresponding scaling value and add the results together to get the value of the output pixel

946952
int	boolean
it does not apply to java because it has special treatment for it s basic types int boolean etc for operators cumbersome syntax that makes clear what is built in the language and what is library etc

947025
free	malloc
in c you just have malloc and free

947039
put	get
as far as other objects like tables you can put them in model and new databases will get them when you create a new database

947094
folder	directory
on my host i set the folder as an application directory since it s a subfolder of my root

947094
folder	directory
each folder is it s own application directory where i put different sites

947103
pop-up	dialog
if i put the uri into a browser it pop-up a dialog asking for credentials and then works

947120
children	parent
traversing children parent

947136
uiswitch	uibutton	uilabel	uibutton
but this is a series of special-purpose controls an odd assortment of various uisliders uiswitch uilabel uibutton etc. that wouldnâ t readily fit into a standard table view without a bunch of customizing anyway

947225
post	get
if your app is not performance sensitive and your requests aren t post of large data you probably won t notice but to get around it i had to manually build the http basic authentication header and set it on the httpwebrequest manually by manipulating the headers collection

947241
sorting	filtering
i d also like to add sorting and filtering capabilities to these objects

947263
accessor	properties
in any case you would not gain anything from creating a real properties with set and get accessor since it would be created only at run-time and you would not be using it in your code.

947263
sorting	filtering
here is an example showing a possible implementation of filtering and sorting no error checking

947271
put	get
the thinking is that you could put your click handlers outside of document.ready so they get executed right away

947279
sorting	filtering
for filtering and advanced sorting ibindinglistview

947292
client-side	server-side
in addition to creating server-side validation you can use the clientvalidationfunction property on the customvalidator to provide client-side validation as well

947311
jobs	cron
one of the biggest headaches is cron jobs etc running in local time zone this means that some cron jobs will get missed once a year and all the rest run at a different time gmt for half the year i m assuming you re in a time zone which has daylight saving time here

947319
width	height
if you add a width height you ll fix that up

947343
directx	directdraw
i need to be able to set an overlayed graphics area via directx directdraw methods in any place on the screen or at least to use it inside a windowed area

947398
put	get
also put a file share on and store all the installers for development tools you d use - so you can easily get all the bits you need to set up a new development workstation

947403
clang	llvm
another tool i ve found invaluable is clang from the llvm project

947440
implements	extends
by extends the application class and implements it as a singleton you get an object that will exist whenever any of your application components exist providing a centralized place to store and transfer complex object data between application components

947455
post	get
use get for getting data and codeigniter post function to store data on server

947461
quicksort	heapsort
in addition to the above the stl s sorting algorithm is introsort which is a mixture of quicksort and heapsort it fails over from quicksort to heapsort if the former is doing poorly

947473
profiling	debugging
many people recommend this for the debugging project profiling

947503
uilabel	uibutton
you are simple wrapping the uilabel in a uibutton allowing you to add anything you want to a tool bar

947513
mouseover	mouseout
i am halfway there but when you mouseout it disappears before you can mouseover any of the items

947514
innodb	myisam
if you tried to change the storage engine for this table from to myisam innodb and something went wrong then indices in this table could have been screwed up

947530
post	get
the remote site has looked at their logs and they say my code is doing the post and then immediately doing a 2nd get request

947530
post	get
does anyone have any idea why they are seeing a 2nd get request right after my post

947530
post	get
i m definately not doing a get i m only doing the one post

947534
typedef	struct
typedef struct _myoverlapped

947539
free	malloc
it turns out that in the c runtime a counter used to aid debugging was being incremented each time a malloc free was performed

947570
set	bag
depending on your feature set and user interface there may be some other session state for the user but that shouldn t need to apply to the direct rp-op communications and you can use your standard bag of tricks

947581
sorting	filtering
also if you are looking at sorting and filtering i m guessing you re going to be using some kind of grid

947618
hash	salt
note to clarify my post i understand the techniques of securing the password hash salt etc

947620
put	get
i then put in variables like #username# into the html that get replaced in code

947641
rss	feed
an rss feed of the last 15 errors from the log

947703
width	height
the plugin assumes in the iframe case that there are no other important parameters in that url and removes all of them after parsing out the height and width

947744
hash	salt
for each credential set store a salt along with the hash data

947750
hash	md5
avoid the use of a fast and cheap hash such as md5 or sha1

947750
hash	salt
in addition to hashing salt the hash with a randomly generated value

947765
getter	setter
however synthesized getter and setter do more than just retaining and releasing

947873
width	height
the core application should contain information that will be shared by all other projects link to database data manager which loads data from the database application information like height width colors fonts.

947880
uiview	subviews
use the subviews property of the uiview containing the buttons

947928
superclass	subclassing
normally equals in general should not be implemented to return true between itself and its subclassing although there are plenty that do due to covariance issues the superclass will think it equals the subclassing but the subclassing won t think it equals the superclass so this type of implementation of equals is tricky no matter what you do

947999
dictionary	map
for the example given where the strings are used as keys to a map or dictionary i would lean toward use of an enum or other object instead

948000
gridview	repeater
bind that datasource to a control like a repeater gridview details view or similar

948058
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
what i ended up doing to solve the problem was to create a uinavigationcontroller and push the uiviewcontroller based class onto it and then do presentmodalviewcontroller to the navigation controller s instance

948080
single-quotes	double-quotes
try removing the double-quotes since it s already quoted with single-quotes

948115
children	parent
in most scene graphs you ll have parent nodes that each contain children in this case each ship would be a node and the people rooms furniture etc inside the ship are children

948115
children	parent
the positions of children are specified relative to their parent

948125
mouseout	mouseenter
i want to bind a mouseenter event to each inner div respectively and eventually a mouseout once i see what s done it will be easy to expand upon

948127
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
you ll have to do a little work with nsdatecomponents converted using an nscalendar typically the user s default calendar to figure out the start and end nsdate values and compare use those to compare your time interval to

948127
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
i would definitely spend some time looking over nscalendar and nsdatecomponents in the docs though you might find a better method than what i m suggesting for what you need to do

948138
jflex	cup
when i ve ported a lalr grammar to java i ve used jflex cup

948190
dia	visio
dia is inspired by the commercial windows program visio though more geared towards informal diagrams for casual use

948195
jboss	weblogic
typically we use weblogic or jboss to deploy our apps

948207
firefox	safari
the first is watir which is an automated testing framework that will control both firefox and safari on mac os x

948214
stdout	stderr
note that on windows you cannot set close_fds to true and also redirect the standard handles by setting stdin stdout or stderr

948262
jboss	weblogic
the clustering failover and session synchronization features of weblogic and jboss still make them worthwhile in large data centers

948262
jboss	weblogic
if you don t use vendor-specific extensions in theory your code can be moved from websphere to weblogic to jboss without changes

948310
packets	multicast
i have proprietary application sending out multicast packets to the network

948313
implements	extends
if you re writing your own collection class and you re extends any of the existing classes or implements any of the collections framework interfaces you basically have no choice but to use iterator

948350
r5rs	r6rs
neither r5rs nor r6rs defines empty

948367
children	parent
looks reasonable though it really needs to fix leaking std and aux to the children and after the loop and the parent s original stdin is lost forever

948372
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
if all you care about is the date on the calendar then you ll create the nsdate then use an nscalendar to get nsdatecomponents for the date

948423
abc	subclassing
for example header files that declare classes need to be imported directly in subclassing header files and header files declaring protocols might well be imported directly although youy can use protocol abc

948503
rss	feed
one last question is there a php and mysql plugin that will create a database and index all my web pages from my site in order to create an rss feed

948530
children	parent
it is far from a nice solution it messes with the parent process standard descriptors does not recover the standard input descriptors leak to children etc

948540
int	double
similarly this can be extended to int long float double types as well

948540
int	double
floating point types such as float and double are also represented by a bits in memory but their data representation differs from int data types such as byte and int in that they will store a value in memory as binary fractions and exponents

948550
stretchblt	bitblt
you could as has been suggested use stretchblt rather than bitblt to scale up your image

948554
rss	feed
as for the second question if you are asking in the context of migrating your existing site to wordpress wordpress automatically will generate the rss feed so long you port your pages into their posts and pages mechanism

948554
rss	feed
do let us know and provide more information on what you want to achieve if you are asking the last question on a different context as in you have a set of webpages which you are not migrating to wordpress but needing a means of needing an automatic means to translate those existing pages into a dynamic rss feed

948564
factors	matrix
there are n 2 relationships in a matrix that would determine if character a could attack or use ability m on character b ignoring other factors for now

948569
rar	zip
for other compression formats the docs say truezip ships with archive drivers for zip tar and all derivatives jar tar.gz tar.bz2 tzp ... . no rar that i know of

948576
profiler	visualvm
the visualvm which comes with jdk6 has a basic profiler inside it

948602
udp	tcp
this is why tcp is different to udp

948618
folder	directory
but in sharepoint users from active directory can also login but temp folder is only available for users on that machine

948640
dictionary	map
some oo languages have multi-dispatch common lisp and dylan are the two that come to mind at the moment but for all the vast majority of languages that lack it this is a good approach in some cases you ll find that a centralized map dictionary is restrictive and refactor to a dynamic visitor design pattern or the like but thanks to the getter function such refactorings will be pretty transparent to all the rest of your code

948668
integer	unsigned
shifts the bits in c one to the right which ends up being the same as doing an integer division by 2 for unsigned or positive integers

948728
telerik	componentart
telerik and componentart are good too

948755
folder	directory
navigate to that directory and delete all folder in it

948755

the inherited properties should be set to your partial class s name in your .aspx.cs code-behind file

948796
mouseleave	mouseenter
check out this article on the mouseenter and mouseleave events

948799
factors	mean
presuming you mean precise since accuracy would depend on the hardware clock and many other factors the docs seem to indicate second precision

948815
post	get
something like the cookie session post get objects

948846
profiler	hprof
java has a basic built in profiler called hprof

948912
unsigned	short
note that behaves differently on unsigned types whether char short long or long long than on signed types

948927
post	get
it transparently maps urls onto python functions and handles all the cookie and session stuff and of course the post get parameters for you

949012
wan	lan
is it for a lan or a wan for example

949019
mouse	keyboard
it supports scrolling with arrow buttons along with mouse wheel and keyboard arrows

949059
src	attr
to always get the full resolved path use element.src not element.getattribute src which seems to be the equivalent of attr src

949071

i think i need to make some changes in the .htaccess file present in the public folder of my rails_root directory but i am not sure

949155
redmine	trac
is it possible to migrate a trac database to redmine if the two systems are in different machines any other way than by copying trac to the other machine

949165
width	height
report viewer width height is not display properly in mozila firefox but perfectly displayed in ie

949165
width	height
dispaly size in mozila is 450 width and 175 height and perfectly in ie shown in full page

949169
kde	gnome
look at kde and gnome for instance

949183
kde	gnome
it s the offspring of dcop from kde primarily and to a lesser extent bonobo from gnome so if it s older you might look one of those things up

949192
rss	feed
i have created a basic xml feed which works fine in my web browsers but i was hoping that someone could point me to some instructions on making an rss feed properly that is more likely to work in any program

949231
cruisecontrol	teamcity
we changed from cruisecontrol to teamcity and there are a lot of new and useful features like cancelling a build etc

949242
mergetool	winmerge
see git mergetool winmerge

949287
hash	md5
thus a 128 bits md5 hash value would result in a 128 bit 8 bit byte 16 byte long string

949298
add-on	xpcom
it should be a part of our already existing xpcom dll add-on

949304
pull	push
this is assuming that the fork will create a project for him where he can push his changes to github then you can pull from his github project then push it to the main one where he pull from

949311
hash	salt
on hashing algorithms sha384 is probably a sufficient algorithm but ensure that you salt your hash

949346
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
raphaã l currently supports firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ opera 9.5+ google-chrome 2.0+ and internet explorer 6.0+

949351
svg	vml
it is a javascript cross-browser wrapper library around canvas svg and vml an ie-only vector markup language that predates svg used in ie6

949364
hash	salt
you should add a salt to your hash data

949364
hash	salt
then store the salt value with the hash value so that you can regenerate the hash value

949364
hash	salt
the role of this salt is to prevent building dictionnary mapping common passwords to hash values

949364
hash	salt
with a 16bit salt you have 65536 different hash values for the same clear text password

949364
hash	salt
better pick a 64bit salt because it won t add much more effort to hash and verify passwords

949378
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
does for firefox opera safari etc

949386
inherited	properties
how ever a good solution that will not make you have to keep this mapping in mind is to create a class inherited from combobox with its own dataprovider properties

949412
debian	linux
if you work in non-debian linux another way to set up a default font for emacs is to add emacs customisation to the file .xdefaults in debian any file in etc x11 xresources is used

949429
octree	quadtree
something like a quadtree or octree is common in 3d worlds although you could overlay a grid too or track arbitrary regions etc

949431
google-chrome	firefox
this piece of javascript code works fine in firefox and google-chrome but fails with the error object expected in internet explorer 8

949459
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox google-chrome and opera browsers

949543
rsa	aes
i have to implement a digital envelope using aes and rsa but i am having problems with the .net implementation of the rsa algorithm

949543
rsa	aes
i have managed to encrypt the data aes with the random symmetric key but now i have to encrypt the key with rsa

949543
exponent	modulo
the key is an array of bytes and the public key i have tells me only the modulo and the public exponent both arrays of bytes

949543
rsa	aes
using only those two parameters how can i encrypt my aes generated key with rsa

949543
exponent	modulo
afterwards the public key is read from the public key file and the modulo and the exponent are in their appropriate byte arrays

949543
exponent	modulo
currently the modulo is 128 bytes and the exponent 64 bytes

949599
hash	salt
oh and dont forget to salt your hash if its a password you are hashing and anything smaller than sha384 is a security risk if we talk about password because is so easy to get quality rainbow tables for sha1 and other common hashing algos

949601
exponent	modulo
so what you need are the rsaparameters but all you need to set are the modulo and the exponent to encrypt

949611
folder	directory
the easiest thing to do is set the target directory for the 64-bit dll to be a x64 subdirectory of your target folder

949654
firefox	safari
works in firefox and browsers with webkit core safari konqueror

949659
folder	directory
d libs orm subsonic_2.1_final_source src subsonic bin debug directory to that command line tools folder .

949713
tax	shipping
and i don t want to put the satchmo apps product shipping tax etc directly into the python django path

949731
content-disposition	content-type
if you wanted to determine what a given url resolved to you could issue a head request and inspect the content-type and content-disposition headers to see if the content is of a type that implies an underlying file but even that s not bulletproof since images pdf etc

949764
post	get
in our application we often have a button that will perform a post back get data convert it into excel pdf and stream it to the client via response.write or response.binarywrite

949771
verilog	vhdl
vhdl verilog and other hardware description languages are essentially dataflow

949776
printf	strlen
you can fix it by testing how many strings you have and the greatest strlen of them and start by allocating chunk to output before you enter your printf loop

949845
disk	ram
express messages are only stored in ram and not persisted to disk so restarting the msmq service will destroy them

949890
arduino	avr-gcc
in order to ensure that some initialization code runs before main using arduino avr-gcc i have code such as the following

950014
vbscript	jscript
if possible vbscript or jscript via windows scripting host

950027
jobs	cron
a cron job not likley - if there s not even a database then there are no cron jobs

950084
coalesce	nvl
are there non obvious differences between nvl and coalesce in oracle

950084
coalesce	nvl
the obvious differences are that coalesce will return the first non null item in its parameter list whereas nvl only takes two parameters and returns the first if it is not null otherwise it returns the second

950084
coalesce	nvl
it seems that nvl may just be a base case version of coalesce

950103
coalesce	nvl
nvl always evaluates both arguments while coalesce stops evaluation whenever it finds first non- null

950106
paradox	dbase
based on experience with shared file databases dbase paradox and the like this doesn t scale well

950107
ubuntu	debian
when i compile the 2.6.24-24-generic ubuntu kernel according the alternate build method the old-fashioned debian way i get the appropriate modules directory and all my devices work except those requiring firmware such as my intel wireless card ipw2200 module

950146
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
according to this stackoverflow answer they are supported but behind flags in google-chrome 60 firefox 54 and ms edge 15 with only safari 10.1 providing support without flags

950165
folder	directory
with maven and axistools-maven-plugin the generated sources are places in a different source folder in the target directory

950194
post	put	post	get	put	get
look into why using put post get and others is important

950198
post	put
c not required because you use curl encode the parameters and post put them

950258
for-loop	loops
if it s limited to the scope of the for-loop definitely declare it inside loops

950296
bazaar	git
distributed version control systems are just for you look for bazaar git or mercurial

950395
ant	maven
i m interested to move a project based on seam 2.1.1 from ant to maven to integrate some tools in the build process like testability explorer and others

950440
children	parent
but you may be better using a really structured list for your parent children relationship

950471
serializable	deserialization
the serializable and deserialization should be very fast

950525
lambda	first-class-functions
not really used unrealscript but you could surely achieve the same thing in any language that supports first-class-functions lambda

950538
cassini	iis
yet when i rebuild and run the site again on my local machine with iis not cassini the value of system.configuration.configurationmanager.appsettings prod still returns true instead of false

950549
post	get
anyway those are some places to start if you post some more detailed information on the issue you may get some more responses

950565
serializable	deserialization
for partial or split deserialization which i have been looking sime into myself such as dynamic and static parts in a game level i think you will have to write your own serializable engine

950584
range	max	range	min	min	max
if it is an incremental refresh then you need the pk range to work with anyhow so you would want something like your high water mark data except you may want to store min max pairs

950594
pop-up	dialog
if you interact with an http api be it that it s https or not and the dialog box pop-up it means its using http authentication either basic or digest

950600
serializable	deserialization
the key point being to watch that between serializable and deserialization we only create one extra object

950626
cassini	iis
the comment with iis not cassini could mean you have a published separate version in iis

950680
strsplit	substr
strsplit string regex is convenient but if you don t need the regular expression handling then go with the substr .. example java.util.stringtokenizer or use apache commons lang 1

950697
int	double
as far as i know though any numerical type int double decimal etc. will

950717
typedef	struct	getter	setter
you start by typedef ing a struct providing create destroy functions and then other setter getter doers to operate on that struct

950717
typedef	struct
typedef struct

950717
int	chars
mytype_t mytype_create unsigned int x chars y

950717
typedef	struct
the important point is this as soon as you typedef a struct users of the type are not allowed to access its members

950717
typedef	struct
a typedef struct means private keep out

950740
mockups	balsamiq
i use screen mockups in balsamiq

950794
implements	extends
if you create a class extends uiview then you can make the file s owner for your xib implements the extended class

950856
nsis	prerequisites
then i use nsis to pack the msi the bootstrapper and the prerequisites framework sql ce... into a single setup.exe

950872
post	get
i get the impression from this and the previous post that you may be over-architecting your code

950877
getter	setter
you also can add more properties to the person domain object and not have to write more getter setter type statements

950878
put	get
and i have a servlet which tries to get the parameter that i put in the ajax method but isn t finding any parameters in the request object

950936
math.h	sqrt
if i include math.h it coudn t find sqrt

950992
hex	binary
when i open such a binary formatted serialized stream using a hex viewer a simple drag ndrop into vs will do i can see there s assembly information contained in this stream

950995
dictionary	map
map dictionary collection stack

951016
int	chars
establishdefaultdtr chars comportname int dtr

951025
getter	setter
if you use setprice to do this then setproduct would also do this and they would forever call each other in the second line hence i create an explicit link method instead of using the setter and getter

951033
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval do everything you need

951138
hash	salt
i suggest a salt hash of the id

951152
strcpy	strncpy
basically you can t write a drop in replacement for strcpy that takes the same arguments and hope to avoid the problems that produced strncpy in the first place and better replacements beyond that

951153
stdout	stderr
try iirc the log output of cvs is to stderr not stdout so the pipe doesn t catch that by default

951184
jquery	scriptaculous
scriptaculous provides some nice effects but in my opinion has been surpassed by jquery and its available plugins

951189
arraylist	treeset
i too typically use arraylist but i will use treeset or hashset depending on the circumstances

951192
jquery	scriptaculous
prototype and scriptaculous jquery mootools or moofx are some

951195
serializable	deserialization
serializable and deserialization of datastructures

951214
jquery	scriptaculous
i d personally say that mootools and prototype scriptaculous are the two best libraries if your only interested in the gui aspect of it although jquery has also recently seriously stepped up its animations and effects

951236
getattr	setattr
using getattr and setattr

951273
affinity	processors
assuming that the web server has multiple cpus i suppose that you could assign this web app to its own application pool and set the affinity to a particular processors to limit the impact on the other web applications

951320
width	height
what i want to do is if the actualweight is not null then return the actualweight for the actual weight dims or else use the actual_dims_lenght width and height

951320
width	height
the actualweight adcutal_dims_lenght width and height are all int integer value but the output for actual weight dims should be varchar 50

951320
width	height
edit the user can only pick either weight or dims on asp.net page and if user selected dims then they must supply length width and height

951325
postgresql	mysql
i m contemplating the switch mainly because of the more permissive license and tend to hear a lot of internet murmuring about how much better postgresql is than mysql but not many specifics

951330
avr	microcontroller
i need to build a prototype for a simple data collection device using an avr microcontroller

951333
min	max
when you are sure a test will ever only have a max min and mean - use design 2

951354
jquery	scriptaculous
my vote goes for prototype scriptaculous combo or jquery as well

951368
postgresql	mysql
postgresql s most useful features which mysql lacks in my opinion are

951376
put	get
what i want is to get vehicles assigned to x user and put it in a drop-down

951440
min	max
in this specific case -- aggregated data mean sum min max -- you have ambiguity because you re not dealing with atomic objects you re dealing with aggregates

951514
getter	setter
if you really have all those getter and setter then you need to validate your class better than in the constructor

951539
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter
what is the right way to avoid errors on insert and updates with a sqldataadapter sqlcommandbuilder when the sql statement used to select has a computed column as one of the return fields

951556
google-chrome	safari
ie6 7 8 ff3 safari google-chrome

951573
put	get
with this you will get an runtime error if you try to put something into list that is not assignable from objtype

951643
maven	pom.xml
given a maven project with a parent pom.xml - including mostly plugin and dependency versions - how can i generate a pom.xml which takes the information from the parent places it into the child and removes the reference to the parent

951659
width	height
you should be able to make the textbox have a smaller width and just give it a bigger height and it should print on one page

951662
mouseover	mouseout
if you use the jquery library you can use the .hover event which merges the mouseover and mouseout event and helps you with the timing and child elements

951772
ant	maven
i assume you don t already have an ant or maven project for your web project

951772
ant	maven
if you did you would just import a maven project or create a web free-form application and wire it up to your ant script

951822
icmp	snmp	icmp	dhcp	arp	dhcp	arp	snmp	arp	icmp	snmp	dhcp
pascal stang s avrlib provides libraries for basic networking arp ip icmp dhcp etc. which could be built upon to provide http and snmp if you find nothing pre-coded

951895
many-to-many	one-to-many
how do i ensure my many-to-many link tables and my one-to-many columns are up-to-date when changes are made to the referenced tables

951927
strcpy	strncpy	strlen	strncpy	strlen	strcpy
by declaring strcpy and strlen forbidden and taking 2-3 days out of the project to replace them with custom strncpy strnlen in all these projects we suddenly could run for days instead of hours

951939
rss	feed
my boss wants me to provide an rss feed to get updated content

951991
hash	md5
prf generation in ssl uses both md5 and sha1 in a bid to prevent the system from being compromised if one of the hash algorithms were sufficiently compromised

952035
rss	feed
rss is xml but it s xml meant to syndicate data with a consistent format there s a pretty good overview here and that allows feed readers and other consumers to know how to process and display them

952035
rss	feed
so if your boss wants to look at this data in his or her feed reader of choice then go for rss

952058
try-catch	exception-handling
this produces a cost during entering and exiting a try-catch block however when an exception-handling is thrown the runtime mechanism can quickly pop off the stack to find where to go

952080
width	height
does setting the width and height of the image force it or does wpf simply resize the first icon in the ico file

952107
subtraction	add
thus since the result of the subtraction is an int you can then add 7 to it

952126
lua	scheme
most naturally written in lexically scoped languages scheme javascript lua

952137
floating-point	integer
longer since python 2 s is integer division while perl s is floating-point

952170
post	get
you might wanna post this on uservoice cause its going to get into server details quickly but it seems to me that the file already exists

952183
aggregate-functions	sum
collation settings can affect some aggregate-functions but admittedly i don t see why it would alter the results of sum

952185
width	height
i was searching a solution to get height and width of an image using javascript

952185
width	height
finally i found a solution to get the image height and width even if the image does not exist in the browser cache

952195
width	height
i am trying to pass a pointer rgb that is initialized with memset to 0 and then looped through to place a 32 bit integer only in the bounds that i create with height and width input h and w as well as offset from the top left corner of the 2d array x and y

952204
ncover	fxcop
ncover nunit fxcop sandcastle wix lokad shared libraries autofac fxcop etc

952227
for-loop	arrays
to reverse an use enumerable.reverse - but if you need to iterate in reverse over a collection which is indexed by position such as an arrays or then it would be more efficient to use a for-loop starting at the end and working backwards

952264
folder	directory
the code above works well for recursively finding what files directory lie in a folder on my c

952266
datalist	repeater
if you get tired of that learn to use a repeater or a datalist control or even the old datagrid control

952267
submit	submission
i want to use the standard multipart submit method rather than submission the file in an iframe

952279
vbscript	jscript
implement such as vbscript jscript

952319
protected-mode	real-mode
wsh can be run from either the protected-mode windows-based host wscript.exe or the real-mode command shell-based host cscript.exe

952333
jsf	seam
also since seam knits together jsf and ejb3 so the next step is to learn each of these

952384
int	double
typedef std list std pair int double pairlist

952444
httphandler	httpmodule
control of html is yours through httpmodule and httphandler and some of the issues mentioned above are fixed in asp.net 4.0

952460
put	get
that can get you into trouble if you maybe have oracle.dataaccess installed on your dev machine which would put it in the gac but when you deploy you just copy the .dll into place on the production machine

952467
gridview	rowdatabound
i have a gridview that i create a dynamic footer wired up to the rowdatabound event

952518
width	height
if i give textrenderer.measuretext some text to measure and width to use it will return the height needed to display that text

952518
width	height
if i give that text width and height to a linklabel it would display the text in the width and height provided with nothing clipped off

952544
mouse	keyboard
is there a way to open that menu with the keyboard so i don t have to reach my mouse

952595
int	double
with value types any struct including int float double etc the type is passed with zeros so the following are equivalent

952599
children	parent
when a class is created in java all its parent class constructors are called in order parent before children

952599
swt	swing
examine the documentation for swing or swt for information on the event models of those gui toolkits

952625
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
the page break works in firefox and ie but not in safari 4 nor opera

952625
opera	safari
i can t seem to find a way to force a page break within a table in safari and opera

952657
int	double
edit i ve experimented a bit and i noticed that performance improved a bit by converting the coordinates which were previously in double to int to prevent wpf anti-aliasing sub-pixel lines

952659
hash	md5
the best way would be to use a hash function such as md5 or sha1 to generate it then you can truncate it at the desired length

952668
integer	unsigned
i used an unsigned integer to prevent entering negative ages and put the input into a loop

952686
udp	tcp
any kind of proprietary communication protocol running over udp or tcp would fit this description

952686
udp	tcp
we have a handful of applications that communicate with embedded systems using tcp and udp all using specialized protocols

952706
.htaccess	httpd.conf
to my httpd.conf in the hope that my .htaccess in the htdocs folder will be picked up with the following rules

952710
udp	tcp
this would mean udp tcp peer-to-peer etc

952720
udp	tcp
that ranges from third party communication products like tibco to fix over tcp sockets to in-house frameworks over udp multicast

952727
direct3d	directx
edit changed directx in original answer to direct3d

952742
firefox	safari
tested in safari 4 and firefox 3

952845
post	get
you can define a whole path with get and post and the cookies follows the path which means stuff like going to xx.com simulate valid button then go to xx.com valid.php with all the cookies and so on set then simulate something else.

952882
interbase	firebird
textolution fulltext search for interbase and firebird

952910
vim	emacs
in fact that was the main reason i switched from emacs to vim

952959
post	get
well i probably should not be answering this post because i am not sure that i fully understand your question but sometime you can get around namespace conflicts like the one i suspect you may be having by using the â œglobalâ directive

952964
for-loop	loops
the most common scenario for update is when you change a property say label1.text which will invalidate the label in a for-loop and that loops is temporarily blocking the message-loop

952976
fgets	strstr
that reads thousands of transactions files using the normal fopen fgets etc which we parse using normal c functions strstr strchr etc and return back a normalized char

952988
integer	unsigned
so far the only difference i see is that addroledef takes a 64 bit unsigned integer as one of the parameters and addrole takes a 32 bit unsigned integer

953079
innodb	myisam
innodb enforces foreign keys myisam does not

953145
integer	fractions
the integer portion is the number of whole days the fractions portion is the fractions of a day

953145
integer	fractions
round or floor to resolve fractions minutes into integer minutes

953153
ubuntu	linux
i tried to install the linux jdk 1.4 from the sun download site on ubuntu 9.04 but it wouldnt install

953173
activemq	rabbitmq
for implementations that can run on the windows platform activemq runs on windows as does rabbitmq

953185
javacc	recursive-descent
i ve implemented parsers for various different kinds of languages before using antlr javacc and custom recursive-descent parsers and when the language gets really big and complex you usually end up with one huuuuuuge grammar and the parser implementation gets really ugly really fast

953191
inherited	properties
if i set modifiers properties of tabcontrol on baseform to private then inherited forms will not be able to add new tabs

953191
inherited	properties
if i set modifiers properties of tabcontrol on baseform to protected the inherited forms can remove the tabcontrol from the baseform

953244
typedef	struct
therefore it s fairly common to typedef struct foo as foo

953250
gridview	objectdatasource	gridview	sqldatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource
bulk edit with gridview without xxxdatasource sqldatasource objectdatasource etc.

953251
georss	kml
ve has some nice capabilities of late including georss and kml support simple layers etc

953293
submit	submission
one possible solution i found for other s reference basically duplicates the form fields the same way i am but on the form submission submit button click he s calling a method that updates a hidden form field with the appropriate data from the dynamic data

953303
children	parent
i need each object to be closed because i want to be able to pick any parent and have all of it s children closed

953355
wordpress	phpbb
for example a blog running off wordpress a forum phpbb a store etc

953400
post	get
does javascript require some working around with when encoding strings to be post ed or get

953405
getter	setter
in the following setter i can access the property backing field directly or through the getter

953431
getter	setter
in this case the difference between the syntax is that in one case the getter setter get invoked while in the other case they don t

getter	setter
this way only the getter setter have access to the unprotected variable and you can confirm any invariants about this value looking only at the getter and setter rather than at the whole class

953435
button	checkbox
this continues until the user gets to the end of the hierarchy at which time the window displays the parameters using the appropriate controls text boxes option button checkbox

953439
getter	setter
in the following setter i can access property backing field directly or through the getter

953587
vb.net	vb6
as3 c++ c# vb.net vb6 delphi java or similar languages will be fine for answers

953602
textarea	textbox
i m using tinymce textarea or textbox for an event logger app and i need the text to be formatted a certain way

953602
textarea	textbox
i can t figure out how to do this without a table which i cannot nest in the textarea or textbox

953609
post	put
if so with which method put or post

953613
libpcap	wireshark
someone told me that there was a java wireshark library out there that used jni to wrap libpcap

953630
post	put
one of my working understadings of a restful architecture is that a rule of thumb on deciding between put and post is that post is used for creates and put is used for updates

953635
hide	show
i m trying to hide show items based off of their workflow being approved using moss 2007

953647
nullpointerexception	classcastexception
if you were to search the java bug database just before 1.5 was released you d find seven times more bugs with nullpointerexception than classcastexception

953687
winpcap	libpcap	winpcap	jnetpcap	jnetpcap	libpcap
on your libpcap question look at the winpcap links page and you will find jnetpcap

953689
textarea	textbox
you cannot -layout- content in a textbox or textarea

953710
put	get
for some reason if i put the inline keyword in either one of the implementation and declaration as well as in both places i get linker errors as shown

953711
hash	salt
and you can choose what salt size and hash function to use

953716
google-chrome	safari
you d need to look at google-chrome ie safari and any other browser you re interested in

953769
min	max
haven t you ever written a method or a class where the key concept of the method class wasn t tightly bound to a specific data type of the parameters instance variables think linked list max min functions binary search etc.

953810
keydown	keyup
handle the keydown and or the keyup event on your root grid

953813
keydown	keyup
silverlight 2 supports the keyup and keydown events only i believe - not keypress

953814
postgresql	mysql
postgresql has more established support for this but mysql has played catch up in the last year or so and has a working method of this in the latest versions

953814
postgresql	mysql
mysql s version is apparently marginally faster than postgresql but lacks some of the more advanced spatial features therefore it s pretty much limited to finding records that match a certain range of coordinates

953814
postgresql	mysql
i can t speak for microsoft s sql solution but for huge amounts of data you are going to want to stick with postgresql mysql for performance--unless you want to go with oracle but even then the performance difference would be negligible

953828
ssl	https
that error means that the tidssliohandlersocketopenssl.passthrough property is being set to false which would happen when posting to an https url before tidssliohandlersocketopenssl.init has been called to intialize the ssl context first

953850
fgets	fread
if the file is unicode you cannot read it with fgets you need to use fgetws or fread

953862
nofollow	noindex
to that i would think that a reasonable strategy would be to set 404 pages and placeholder pages to noindex nofollow and noarchive in their meta tags

953874
hide	show
this is a callback function for a jquery ajax function basically what is does is when all ajax is finished .ajaxstop it hide the loader then show the content

953893
hide	show
a solution we have done commercially in the past is basically the daemon writes to a log typically db with a date time stamp about what its doing and the web frontend just show the latest x amount of entries from the log with a little toggle to hide all of the looked in directory no file found messages worked fairly well we upgraded it later on with ajax timer that reloaded every 20 seconds

953898
postgresql	mysql
now if i want to put it on my own linode vps i have to configure mod_python or mod_wsgi as well as memcache ngix mysql or postgresql etc

953900
coldfusion	railo
of course this means that some frameworks are going to have to be rewritten for railo since this breaks full compatibility with adobe coldfusion

953927
width	height
you said you specified the height to 800px and wanted the div not to stretch when the width was greater than that.

953931
width	height
the width and height of the sidebar will vary from page to page so i can t use any hard values

953931
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i don t completely understand why i have to have the sidebar div first but it this code works fine in firefox google-chrome safari windows and ie8

953941
width	height
it appears that x y coordinates that are returned to me are from the center of the image instead of from the top left if i drag something to the top left corner of a room it shows x y as being half of the width and height

953950
hash	md5	int	chars
this has to be unique and usually not sequential - examples are a uuid guid or a hash md5 of the int id but be careful of chars that are not compatible with http

954024
switching	screens
no switching to full screens mode

954040
firefox	safari
html5 defines a contenteditable attribute that can be applied to any element including the body element it s supported in ie which i think invented the attribute safari 2.0 and firefox 3.x where x is at least 5

954047
google-chrome	safari
tested and confirmed in ff3 google-chrome safari win and most importantly ie6 ie7 even though i still hate ie

954069
cpu	processors
core two duo etc.. does each cpu core processors have its own cache

954080
post	get
i have a fairly simple scenario where i have a strongly typed view that is correctly populated from the controller on the get but then when it post the form to the controller the reqeust is full of all the right values and right key names for the default model binder to correctly populate one of my model objects and the dmb creates the correct opject but it never populates any of the properties they re all in their default state

954154
ssl	ntlm
you can also use ntlm ssl certificate mapping or digest authentication

954170
width	height
would it be reasonable as a work around to simply translate the location using the height and width of the object

954170
width	height
on import can you simply add half the width and height to the x and y respectively

954185
min	max
this says that you might want to set min max for all but the last columns then set min preferred on the last column and either not set max or set a very large value for max

954198
for-loop	loops
this allows a for-loop to be written as a foreach loops

954230
post	put
edit replaced incorrect method put with post given the request is not sending the entire resource just an update of a part of the resource

954251
codeigniter	cakephp
i also know that i18n is supported in zend cakephp and codeigniter

954330
lisp	scheme
scheme macros hygienic macros are completely different from traditional lisp macros

954330
lisp	scheme
some implementations of scheme offer lisp macros in addition to scheme macros but this is not required by the scheme standard

954338
jobs	cron
if your team is small five or fewer and not dispersed over great distances or multiple timezones a reasonable first approximation is to make test a git workspace on a server upon which your toolchain has been installed along with some cron jobs so that this workspace is updated and rebuilt every night usually

954380
folder	directory
go into iis find the virtual directory that contains your project go into properties for that folder and in the virtual directory tab you ll see application settings near the bottom

954395
post	get
post is non-idempotent meaning if you send the same post request many times you will get many new items

954414
post	get
if you re not getting that warning you might be using get instead of post which is not a good idea for actions which change or insert data

954418
opera	safari
yes this attribute first appeared in ie then it was added in mozilla about the end of 2003 then in opera 9 and safari 2

954445
typedef	struct
typedef struct #39

954481
rss	feed
i am generating an rss 2.0 feed using system.servicemodel.syndication.syndicationfeed for outlook 2007 sp2 clients and i would like to know if it is possible to set the update limit for the feed in order to be recognized by outlook client

954507
profiler	yourkit	yourkit	jprofiler
as the others have mentioned it is a memory leak if you are using java you can use profilers like jprofiler yourkit profiler to see where the memory leaks happen

954524
post	get
another solution is to make two different controller methods for get and post operations

954534
ssl	https
either the conversation between those two is secured by ssl https but then both ends need to participate or not

954568
ssl	https
when you connect to a server marked with server side ssl server marked with https it sends a copy of its cert to the client your browser which verifies if its a genuine cert

954597
udp	tcp
however i m looking for more than just what s below tcp udp sockets

954605
nsstring	nsdata
m stuck m trying to create an uiimage from a byte array which i get from a webservice.it comes embedded in a xml.i can parse the xml and get the byte array as a string.then i convert the byte array which is in nsstring to nsdata

954613
post	get
the difference between a get and post request is that in the former all data passed is part of the url string

954613
post	get
this assumes the receiving end is capable of receiving data through get requests not only post requests

954613
post	get
most decent server-side libraries allow data passed through both get and post request although ymmv

954620
udp	tcp
if you need to know this type of information you need to build it into the format that you layer ontop of udp like the tcp sequence number

954620
udp	tcp
also note that the tcp sequence number implementation also helps to detect out of order packets take may happen when using udp

954648
width	height
if you are adding a new view you should be sure to set the frame property to a position and width and height that will not cause it to be bigger than it should

954649
factors	mean
not sure what you mean by low activity but i believe the major factors would be how much you actually need to do to handle each request

954675
getter	setter
a and b don t have any behavior - they are java beans with getter and setter

954724
getter	setter
instead access their getter and setter using reflection

954762
stateless	stateful
i recently took the time to change all the stateful skins to stateless skins and my cpu droped from about 40 to about 3-4

954804
jar	manifest.mf
you can try looking inside the jar s manifest.mf in the meta-inf directory - it should indicate what version yo re working with

954851
hide	show
or alternatively i need to hide show details on my existing masterpage dependant on the active theme hope that makes sense

954904
firefox	safari
the contenteditable property for ie firefox and safari

954911
post	get
most people know about the get and post methods because that s what they use when building forms

955058
mouseover	mouseout
bind a mouseover event handler to the env. elts.content element that will set the env.paused value to true and a mouseout event handler to set it back to false

955092
equals	gethashcode
you d definitely also want to implement and as well as all the corresponding operators and overrides of equals gethashcode etc

955117
post	get
i thought the problem was that the request had the host set to the requesting server not the remote server but then i noticed in firebug that the request is sent as get not post

955137
spaces	delimiter
it s confusing me slightly because the field delimiter appears to be a spaces but the fields themselves are sometimes quoted with quotation marks and other times by square brackets

955154
inherited	properties
you can create your own principal class with the required properties that inherited from a generic principal and then set the user properties of your current context to be the a user of that type

955168
spaces	delimiter
then you should be able to use a standard parser using spaces as a delimiter respecting quotes

955182
hex	binary
if that still doesn t do what you want in terms of hex binary i suggest you email its author preferably with a patch

955217
post	get
if i remove datatype json or use post it s synchronous again but i m dependant on using both json and get

955240
liferay	web-inf
this is not sufficient to deploy the portlets since liferay needs to augment the web.xml in my portlets web-inf to insert servlet mapping tags

955264
youtube	vimeo
my client has come back saying he wants to play mp4s on the site - plus being able to embed some other videos from youtube vimeo etc..

955265
versioning	upgrade
however it can be a bit fiddly to set up currently due to it requiring newer the latest versioning of the air sdk see the release notes on how to upgrade

955269
width	height
you can do that by adding width or height to your div or zoom 1

955282
mouse	keyboard
there are many managed wrappers for doing global system hooks for mouse and keyboard

955283
inherited	subclassing
i need to add the specific parameters of corresponding subclassing that inherited the class pointed to in the service of the wsdl

955286
youtube	vimeo
now if you re client is only really talking about embedding videos in blog entries or articles that s a very trivial task youtube vimeo and other video sharing sites already supply the html embed code that s needed to display a video on a page

955384
post	get
if you do a post or remove the datatype you will get an access error because of same-origin policy

955438
jquery	scriptaculous
in time i got more and more into jquery and now i want to replace my current scriptaculous scripts with jquery scripts

955470
.nettiers	codesmith
normally page-aware select stored procedures created by for instance .nettiers codesmith template return a multiple result

955575
vb.net	vb6
the second biggest issue i have personally observed is vb6 developers writing vb6 code in vb.net

955592
inherited	properties
in winforms form had a clientsize properties inherited from control which returns the size of its client area the area inside the title bar and window borders

955604
x86	64bit
flag it s a x86 64bit cpu even if you have 32 bit linux installed

955610
pascal	delphi
free pascal compiler lazarus is not close to the latest delphi features but it is quite stable even though there are still bugs to find out

955613
width	height
function imageloop images speed width height inc

955645
int	chars
if you use a id int or a chars referential integrity is preserved in both cases

955645
int	chars
an int is 4 bytes long so it s equal in size as a chars 4

955645
int	chars
if you use chars x where x 4 your chars key will be shorter than a int one

955645
int	chars
if you use chars x where x 4 your chars key will be greater than a int one

955645
int	chars
anyway when talking about tables with - say - 500 records the total overhead of a chars 5 over a int key would be just 500 bytes a value hilarious for database where some tables could have millions of records

955645
int	chars
considering that countries and currencies are limited in numbers a few hundred at most you have no real gain in using an id int instead of a chars 4

955645
int	chars
therefore though i usually use an id int key for most of my tables in several circumstances i choose to have a pk fk made of chars countries languages currencies are amongst those cases

955672
actualheight	actualwidth
as trent said actualwidth and actualheight are also viable solutions

955679
post	get
i can successfully post the data and get a response from the server however it is simply returning the code for the home page instead of the xml

955692
pop-up	dialog
the providers try to prevent this id images browser certificates call back verification etc but it doesn t help when the black hat site pop-up a dialog page that says enter your openid user name and password and the genius user complies

955693
yslow	pagespeed
google just released pagespeed a plug-in for firebug just like yslow and it s got some pretty cool features

955776
terminate	timeout
you can also set an idle timeout in minutes after which a worker process is terminate

955801
post	get
i found a few forum post that seem to be from people having a similar problem but they never get a clear answer

955823
mvp	presenter
since the mvc framework isn t an option then i would take a look at model view presenter pattern mvp with either the passive view approach or superviser approach as described here

955841
ironruby	ironpython
i ve been reading up on f# ironruby and ironpython

955841
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython seems to catch my eye the most although i m not completely closed to ironruby

955841
ironruby	ironpython
f# as i understand it is still more of a research language so i m a bit wary of writing production code using it - ironpython and ironruby have also pre-existed for several years whereas f# is completely new

955864
uiview	subviews
in this uiview i draw custom subviews with labels etc it s a scoreboard with various colors

955881
dom4j	xom
here s yet another solution using the xom library that competes with my dom4j answer

955881
dom4j	xom
this is part of my quest to find a good dom4j replacement where xom was suggested as one option.

955881
dom4j	xom
now adding the child node is simple and similar as with dom4j except that xom doesn t let you add the original root element which already belongs to newnodedocument

955922
x86	64bit
adding true support for enc to the 64bit clr is unfortunately a large work item and other features were prioritized over this given the work around of changing the platform target to x86

955953
getter	setter
while most answers focus on the design encapsulation standpoint and i agree to the general consensus why not use setter getter

955953
getter	setter
i d like to add that once you ve hunted for a bug in some large legacy code bases with public members you ll never ever ever write a class without setter getter

955953
getter	setter
1 setter getter you put a breakpoint 5 minutes later bug is solved

955960
versioning	upgrade
i ve tried everything from deleting the msadc folder from iis and re-adding it i ve uninstalled sql native and reinstalled it and subsequently upgrade it to the newest versioning

955987
stdout	stderr
stream stderr stdin or stdout

955993
ironruby	ironpython
additionally f# will be included in visual studio 2010 whereas ironpython and ironruby require extra steps to integrate them with visual studio

955993
ironruby	ironpython
that said asp.net and mvc support for f# is pretty much non-existent whereas ironpython and ironruby have various efforts underway already

955999
textarea	textbox
this is working fine with textbox controls and dropdownlists etc however when i add the htmlattributes to the textarea it stops working claiming that the best overloaded method has some invalid arguments the code that is failing is

956043
equals	gethashcode
the tuple needs to override gethashcode equals and iequatable

956098
hide	show
a general strategy is to place the loading image in a div or span tag and show or hide it when you want to show it

956098
hide	show
if you want to show it initially just place a jquery hide function on the div or span in the jquery on ready function

956098
hide	show
see the jquery docs on show and hide

956109
hide	show
the following will show a loading image pre-existing then load some html retrieved via ajax then upon completion it will hide the loading image

956114
implements	extends
to accomplish this i also had to create a new class that implements com.adobe.cairngorm.commands.icommand that i extends for all commands in my projects

956124
getter	setter
in some cases for visibility you might want certain parts of the code to see the concrete class and have access to the setter and some others to see only getter give them access to the interface only

956124
public	protected
this cannot always be achieved with public protected private

956155
getter	setter
however i ve noticed that getter and setter aren t really used in c# as they are in java or php and and i suspect that there is a better more succinct standard way to do this in c#

956166
folder	directory
so something in the .svn folder for that directory is amiss

956172
xstream	xom	xstream	jdom	jdom	xom
you can use any decent xml library like jdom or xom or xstream

956180
getter	setter
i ve noticed that getter and setter aren t really used in c# as they are in java or php

956180
getter	setter
yes and the reason is simple .net s properties offer a special syntactic sugar to express getter and setter

956184
versioning	upgrade
today i got an update notification asking me to upgrade internet explorer to versioning 8

956186
getter	setter
properties are just syntactic sugar for the getter setter methods you would normally do in java

956206
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i m currently developing web sites for ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox safari opera and google-chrome all on the same machine

956206
firefox	safari
to get back to ie6 i use the beta of microsoft superpreview if you haven t seen it check it out...they re going to offer firefox and safari rendering to it last i checked

956224
width	height
#8 causes the width to be larger than the resolution i see the window s right edge show up on my secondary monitor and the height is slightly too large so the window partially overlaps the taskbar area

956224
width	height
#9 seems to have the correct width but the height is too short

956233
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome firefox i get back something like bar note the leading forward slash

956254
versioning	upgrade
after trying ie8 s developer tools press f12 and seeing how nice it is i can say that its a must to upgrade and you have many other ways to test on previous versioning as previous answers listed

956274
opera	google-chrome
i have also this to say the sites i build usually don t have display problems under ie8 and look the same as ff3 opera konqueror google-chrome etc.

956309
voip	sip
it s full java it s comprised of mobicents sip servlets and jain slee to build powerful sip voip or converged applications and media server for all related media stuff such as conferencing ivr and so on .

956314
toolbar	tabs
i try to hide it by calling the removeallcategories function and then minimizing the ribbon the problem is that the bar that holds the categories tabs stays visible and right clicking on it it always display the option minimize the ribbon this is almost ok if i managed to remove this option from the context menu but what i m asking if there is any proper way of removing the ribbon bar and all its dependencies bug again let stay the orb and the quick access toolbar

956322
int	boolean
by flags i mean small boolean or int variables that just tell you if something is true or false

956372
put	get
my thought is to show my own search results and at the same time call google s search with the same query in an iframe so i can get the ads and put them in my page

956404
hide	show
as far as i know you can use the tiddlers aspect of a tiddlywiki to show hide small amounts of web content without having to make trips to the server

956423
qobject	qwidget
that s how qt handles it with qobject and qwidget

956536
ubuntu	linux
this computer is quite old so i want to use ubuntu linux

956588
pingfederate	siteminder
that can recieve and process these tokens issued by the third party or do we need to implement a vendor application like siteminder pingfederate etc on our side even to be able to act as a relying party in this federation

956649
versioning	upgrade
how do you select which versioning of the api to use - through a preprocessor define in the code or does updating to the latest platform sdk simply upgrade to whatever is the latest versioning can t imagine this last option but you never know...

956662
hash	md5
you re effectively doing an md5 hash of the password and then using the algorithm defined in a global constant encrypt_algorithm

956662
post	get
you d have to post the value of that variable to get a better answer

956662
hash	md5
by the way using a straight non-salted md5 hash of the password can be bad

956665
portrait	landscape
if i go to any view on portrait and then try to go to landscape the iphone performs the animation for rotation but my controls don t seem to move to the right places

956675
createfile	getlasterror
it s only safe to check getlasterror after a function fails but it looks like you might be checking the last error when createfile has succeeded returned zero

956684
allocator	stl
however as binary worrier pointed in the comments this won t work with stl containers since they have 2 template parameters one for the elements type the other one for the type of the allocator used for managing storage allocator which has a default value

956700
versioning	upgrade
so forgetting those that need it how would you convince an individual or organisation to upgrade to a newer versioning of ie

956718
put	get
just put it in terms of other things like cars and tvs to get them an idea of how old it really is

956751
dbvisualizer	toad
so probably you can connect with some visual db manager plenty of it exists see toad data modeler dbvisualizer and try do do some sql work.

956765
folder	directory
you should exclude the test reports directory in your root folder

956777
serializable	deserialization
it sounds like you re more after just parsing rather than full xml serializable deserialization

956807
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
download ie8 google-chrome safari or firefox and show them how much faster they render a page than ie6

956839
subtract	add
one reason is that it is not easily extensible - you have to physically modify the table if you add subtract the markets that you are recording correlation for

956946
pop-up	dialog
when it is invalid an error message should pop-up alert or -even better- modal dialog and the form should not be submitted

957014
imagemagick	pdftk
you can do this in 2 steps using pdftk and imagemagick ghostscript

957110
ienumerable	iqueryable
i went with returning a list but i could have returned an ienumerable or iqueryable

957110
ienumerable	iqueryable
in my reading it seemed iqueryable had more functionality for linq to sql but since i am returning a simple two column list then i only need to return an ienumerable or list

957110
ienumerable	iqueryable
aka - should i just have returned and ienumerable or perhaps gone with iqueryable

957151
gif	png
i got gif png banners on my site that sometimes loads very slowly so i put them into iframe and that made whole site and onload event to work faster

957158
ubuntu	debian
i run into this every now and then on a new ubuntu debian server

957187
icefaces	woodstock
for future development or migration of existing woodstock projects sun is officially endorsing icefaces as the replacement technology for woodstock

957196
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome but has issues in firefox

957208
folder	directory
all class library projects would build to a commonbin folder at the root of the source directory

957239
multiplying	subtract
now granted i realize that this depends on what each of the decorators do...for instance if your are multiplying or dividing in your decorator instead of adding or subtract it will of course warrant a different result

957257
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i pulled this open in firefox safari opera google-chrome ie6-7 and 8 and could not replicate it

957266

so if you use the instance variable post you can put all the form code into _form and just call the partial and it will handle the rest based on if you pass in a new record or an existing record

957271
versioning	upgrade
the only way that you will be able to force upgrade is to create a must-have application for enterprise that requires the latest versioning of internet exploder to function

957306
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
they go into a grid on the window using xaml with height width margin attributes

957306
mouseleave	mouseenter
my current work around is to set clear boolean flags in the mouseenter and mouseleave handlers but there must be a better way

957329
versioning	upgrade
i think the best way is to repackage your site only for ie7+ displaying the old versioning for ie6 and advertise it on your ie6 site in an attractive way like new upgrade to go to v2 the new featured thing and other deceptive but harmless ways of marketing p

957405
postgresql	mysql
if it matters i m using postgresql but i d also like to know how mysql fares and if it s any different

957501
getter	setter	organization	naming
property getter and setter can go by whichever naming convention you desire or that your organization has standardized

957501
getter	setter
that said most in the java community use getsomething setsomething as the naming convention on getter and setter

957522
inherited	properties
i have an object that can t inherited dependencyobject or use notifypropertychanged and i ve binded it to quite a few controls so when the properties change i don t want to go to each control and change it s value on the code so i m thinking there must be a way to tell the xaml to rebind all that it s bound to with one or two lines of code instead of going

957533
equals	tostring
using equals or tostring work on valuetype object but not with referencetype which can be null and therefore do not allow equals or tostring

957575
vsto	add-in
i really would like to stay within the vsto project-types add-in workbook template since my overall goal for my current project is to establish whether or not c# udf execution with vs2010 excel2007 works at an acceptable speed

957594
put	get
i use gridviews pretty often and sometimes i get confused to where to put certain code

957601
versioning	upgrade
i personally prefer option 1 since this is the cleanest way of separating code libraries and it allows you to swap upgrade versioning of cairngorm without having to recompile your library

957655
postgresql	mysql
in general postgresql knows more tricks for how to optimize complicated queries than the mysql optimizer does but it also relies heavily on your having given the optimizer enough data to work with

957776
portrait	landscape
when i build and the iphone simulator switches to landscape the font size stays the same as in portrait and doesn t fill the view

957793
dictionary	map
map collections or dictionary

957847
inherited	properties
since uibutton inherited from uiview you can just set the hidden properties on the button via uibutton doc

957880
stdout	stderr
my cron logs extensively to stdout directed to logfile in .crontab using stderr only for things that cause the script to stop i like getting emails from cron when bad stuff happens

957930
treeviewitem	treenode	treeview	listviewitem
there isn t a treenode any more in wpf instead a treeview has treeviewitem listview has listviewitem etc

957960
folder	directory
the anti-virus security software mcaffee viruscan enterprise was preventing visual studio tool csc.exe to dynamically compile code and create the entity data model dll in the directory folder above which falls under the windows directory folder

957960
folder	directory
there is a section in mcaffee called access protection that has a rule called maximum protection that prohibits creating executable files in the windows directory folder

958025
matlab	simulink
i don t recommend you old matlab 6.5 because guis and simulink designs don t run in matlab 7x

958041
feedback	review
once they have that and the product manager is receiving time-boxed review sessions then you can start to move away from the managers making the commitments and have the team members receive the feedback and make commitments directly

958067
prepare	execute
and also check for false before trying to execute any member function on what you think is an object returned by the prepare function

958088
hide	show
i have an application that uses a frame extensively and needs to hide show certain buttons depending on which form is active at the time

958088
hide	show
in order to keep the buttons neat and organized appropriately i have put them on panels and show or hide the panels as needed for each form

958109
codeigniter	cakephp
the solution is to use an established framework such as codeigniter cakephp symfony or any other so that you ll essentially never be repeating common tasks and all your applications will have the same structure and flow

958138
maven	buildr
buildr maven on a couple of projects i didn t want to convert plus nexus and hudson

958147
for-loop	arrays
because your for-loop iterates 3 times as the arrays size is 3

958209
menhir	ocamlyacc
if you decide to settle for ocamlyacc or menhir these tutorials may be a little easier than the reference manual

958363
daemons	systemd
a daemons or daemons is a process that is started by the systemd when it starts up it runs till shutdown no user asked for it explicitly

958375
next	except
since months are so varied in size wouldn t the best way to set the next month be something like this day next month except if this day doesn t exist next month

958419
textarea	textbox
i ve been attempting to create a resizable textbox asp.net multiline textbox html textarea and use jquery ui to make it resizable but seem to be running into a few issues involving custom drag handles

958419
textarea	textbox
of course i can t make the resizable handle div class resizable-s a child of the textbox textarea but this should not be a problem according to the jquery docs

958434
qstring	qlist
value of qstring and qlist

958467
int	boolean
you can store up to 64 boolean variables into a single bigint column as a mask with one bool per bit and compute the match extremely fast as bit_count the_column user_preferences which will count how many bits are equal between the column and the mask giving the user s preferences should php give you problems manipulating 64-bit int you can use two columnns of 32 bits each summing the two bit counts will still be very fast

958472
width	margin
its just using the width of the browser but pushed over a bit with a margin so its actually hanging over underneath the sidebar

958618
codeigniter	cakephp
it would be easier to compare a php framework such as cakephp or codeigniter to ror than just php to ror

958678
width	height
the number in a cell can range from 1 to the width height of the puzzle

958699
g++	gcc
it s gcc g++ for windows

958752
post	get
i m not a .net guy but it looks very much like uri.query would only show the get data because post data isn t part of the uri

958755
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
i m a .net developer but have dabbled in linux a bit so i m not completely turned off to the idea of an ubuntu or debian server.

958784
width	height
i would assume that you are doing all of this with the flash ide because had you loaded this all at runtime with purely code you would have went out of your way to force these to center by specifying an x and y that is half it s height and width

958784
width	height
if your bitmaps have negative values of half their width and height as their x and y values this would center your bitmap in the middle of the movieclip sprite as opposed to having a top-left registration

958822
yacc	bison
the main problem with regular bison the gnu implementation of yacc stems from the c typing

958867
ant	maven
i have a c development folder with eclipse java jboss workspace ant maven svn etc

958907
stateless	stateful
what about stateful stateless architecture

958912
debian	linux
usr lib git-core git-svn on debian linux

958999
for-loop	loops
if you re not creating cr whatever it is inside the for-loop then you re modifying the same object over and over each time through loops

959012
children	parent
to achieve what you re looking for you could assert that the person types a class of parent who have three children or less

959014
imagemagick	libjpeg
imagemagick uses libjpeg a.k.a independent jpeg group library

959014
imagemagick	libjpeg
if you improve the speed of libjpeg imagemagick jpeg speed will increase

959015
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
vista ie8 firefox 3 google-chrome safari

959036
opera	firefox
came up with this and it seems to work at least in firefox and the opera browser

959054
ubuntu	linux
here s the tcp_info struct for my up-to-date ubuntu linux

959061
post	get
if i find something i ll edit this post with it sorry -- it might take me a few days to get to it

959072
post	get
for more advanced get post requests you can install the curl library

django	web.py	django	web2py	django	turbogears	turbogears	web2py	pylons	web2py	pylons	turbogears	web.py	pylons	web.py	web2py	web.py	turbogears
there are several frameworks available django web2py - similar to django but many say it s simpler to use there is also turbogears web.py pylons

959105
winpcap	libpcap
try winpcap then it gives you a lot of features along with the popular nix library libpcap api

959107
mechanize	hpricot
so the problem here is that mechanize 0.8.5 has a dependency on hpricot instead of nokogiri which works flawlessly

959107
post	get
yet i can t get it to post the form as multipart

959152
profiling	debugging
i suggest you also learn how to debugging and profiling your program

959160
gif	bmp
there is no information in the xml file about whether the image is jpg gif bmp

959162
punctuation	words
in this model each words is a feature - this requires tokenizing the sentence which means separating words and punctuation from each other

959183
int	chars
i need to read several chars from the serial port two int into a string

959183
int	chars
tldr how do i append an int to a and then clear the string after it has two chars

959191
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
delphi 2009 comes with built in support for jpeg bmp gif and png

959191
gif	png
for earlier versions of delphi you may need to find third party implementations for png and gif but in delphi 2009 you simply add the jpeg pngimage and gifimg units to your uses clause

959214
int	chars
you can t use a chars to represent an int longer than 1 digit so i m going to assume you did in fact mean chars

959227
google-chrome	firefox
after talking to paul o b a css guru this is a good solution that works in ie 6 7 8 firefox 3 and google-chrome

959256
yslow	pagespeed
you may also want to look at tools like yslow or pagespeed if you re looking for other ways of improving the performance of a web page

959276
inherited	properties
the best advice i ever received for ood was to look to the smallest object that each logical branch of your app can be distilled to it probably on has native types for properties with .net there no point in reinventing framework objects either so they can be in your base class and then using inherited polymorphism and encapsulation to expand on those base classes until you have an object that encapsulates the logical branch

959280
int	boolean
as for the int and other numerical and boolean types - those have a fixed system-given length - no problems there

959296
free	malloc
free is for use when you malloc memory at runtime not for freeing memory allocated by the compiler at compile time

959298
free	malloc
it was not allocated with malloc so you cannot free it with free

959302
jquery	scriptaculous
if you want animation then you can use jquery scriptaculous or other javascript libraries

959305
sharepoint	cqwp
i have been looking into the crosslistquerycache object and contentquerywebpart cqwp as part of the microsoft publishing infrastructure sharepoint

959308
free	malloc
in your example you are populating the entries of this array by allocating memory using malloc and setting each element of the array this is the memory that you should free and not the statically allocated array itself

959313
google-chrome	firefox
but my neither firefox nor google-chrome reflect the recent changes

959318
debian	linux
this is happening on os x when on linux debian it works

959324
bazaar	git
examples include git-bisect in git hg bisect in mercurial earlier available as hbisect extension and bzr-bisect plugin for bazaar

959368
nunit	mstest
our 200+ developer shop just moved away from mstest to nunit and so far we ve not encountered issues with lack of tool support in fact rather the opposite it seems that the support infrastructure around nunit is very extensive

959390
folder	directory
netbeans at least on my mac runs c++ programs via a script called dorun.sh which is under the .netbeans folder in my home directory

959437
fadein	fadeout
this is working fine with the fadein fadeout effects

959437
fadein	fadeout
my ultimate requirement is to fadeout the current content.show the loading message.show the data coming from server with a fadein effect

959441
inherited	properties
well you can inherited from the checkbox control add the two commands as properties dependency propertiess and then override the onchecked and onunchecked methods and trigger each command in the appropriate place

959449
hide	show
i haven t tested this but why not just show hide a gif animation

959483
expander	grid
i m trying to force a grid expander to reevaluate whether it needs a scrollbar as it s showing emptiness

959483
expander	grid
invalidatemeasure and updatelayout on the problem expander and invalidatearrange invalidatescrollinfo invalidatevisual and updatelayout on the grid above it but it won t shrink back

959494
postgresql	mysql
then you can install apache and mysql or postgresql on that vm just via the standard packaging tools apt-get install and there s no danger of polluting your windows environment

959500
hide	show
it helps us creating interfaces that always look good no matter if we show or hide certain groups panels

959509
yacc	bison
bison yacc can generate a glr parser if you specify glr-parser in the option section

959518
base	fractions
it had replaced an in-house ajax-based chat system but with a fractions of the client base using it that ajax client was responsible for 72 of the http hits against the website and without it we did 700k+ hits day

959522
width	height
ideally the 0.1f in the x axis would be be the width and 0.1 in y the height of the window

959531
firefox	safari
unfortunately ie7 floats the image outside the rhs boundary of the parent div see whereas firefox and safari display the float and wrapped text within the parent div s boundary the black vertical lines are the lhs rhs boundaries of the parent div

959626
width	height
model 5 keepthis true tb_iframe true height 300 width 850 modal thick box link a

959637
mouse	keyboard
you obviously need to support mouse clicks which is fairly easy but you should make sure your keyboard support works too and that s a little more tricky you ll need to run timers to switch the tab after no keyboard access after half a second have a look at the way os x does it

959642
getter	setter
please make dpart1 to dpart1 and change the getter and setter again

959650
put	get
those pixels then get put on the current draw buffer screen backbuffer render-to-texture whatever

959650
hlsl	glsl
shaders are processed in an assembler-like language but modern directx and opengl versions have built in high-level c-like language compilers built in called hlsl and glsl respectively

959686
awt	swing
swing and awt are based on this

959699
hash	md5
a quick search on google found javascript implementations of md5 and sha1 hash algorithms

959733
width	height	submit	submission
essentially you submit a url of your page of interest digg then crawl s the dom to find all of the img tags likely only selecting a few that are above a certain height width and then creates a thumbnail from them and asks you which you would like to represent your submission

959738
notepad++	scite
other people like scite notepad++ or any of a slew of others

959807
width	height
the rectangle should be the same width and height as the image and it should overlay the image

959882
int	chars
tip for deciding between float and int try anum float chars first

959931
int	double
how about trying to use a double or long instead of int for product

959964
openbsd	linux
see the openbsd faq specifically section 9.4 - running linux binaries on openbsd

959967
int	chars
url shortening services rather use a auto incremented int value like a supplementary database id and encode that with base64 or other encodings to have more information per chars 64 instead of just 10 like digits

959985
gmail	hotmail
it works great with gmail hotmail and many other e-mail clients - displaying the html content without a problem

959986
hash	md5
shortest hash is 32 character length how ever you can use first 8 characters of md5 hash

960028
getter	setter
rather use getter setter

960035
cpu	processors
assuming this isn t a question in reference to some crazy low end processors you take a tremendous speed hit to access memory outside of your cpu caches so unless you re algorithm is doing math on a very few numbers enough that they all basically fit within the l1 and l2 caches you re not going to notice any speed up from optimizing any of your arithmetic

960084
pdcurses	ncurses
if it has to be console only i would suggest using something like ncurses or pdcurses to create a text based interface

960111
ssl	https
if the browser is viewing an page in ssl through https then it ll request that asset with the https protocol otherwise it ll request it with http

960126
int	double
if all your math is in the int domain double and floats do exactly the same as int and also can be compared safely

960169
ant	maven
typically modules are stored in the same project as the main application but each app module is compiled into a separate swf either by flex builder or an automated build tool such as ant or maven

960173
bde	dbase
otherwise you can use .db files dbase - xbase bde should be able to handle them directly

960204
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
in foo a nullpointerexception is thrown if the caller passes in null whereas bar throws illegalargumentexception

960204
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
you throw nullpointerexception in foo but illegalargumentexception in bar

960211
post	put	post	get	put	get
method can have get post put and delete

960226
put	get
can you do that or would you get blasted demoted put on the to be laid off pile

960240
folder	directory
i have tried setting specific directory permissions for the sql server agent account on the databasebackups folder but still get the same error

960255
portrait	landscape
what i would like to do is be able to is have the main view load in landscape and the flipside view in portrait

960255
portrait	landscape
edit to clarify i want to lock the main view into only a landscape orientation and the flipside view into portrait - these views shouldn t be able to rotate

960287
put	get
you could put the binary value in an array lets say i 64 iterate through it get the power depending on its position and keep adding it to the double

960301
jobs	cron
i am developing an application on google app engine and was just checking out cron jobs

960332
put	get
i went ahead and set a var to the name i put the hashmap in the modelandview under top line but i m not sure if that s the right way to get at that object

960354
pascal	delphi
so if your read the original gof design patterns book you can easily apply its concepts to delphi 2009 and all its previous versions even some of turbo pascal

960369
width	height	onfocus	onblur
cant remember off hand if divs support onfocus and onblur but you could try making one div absolutely positioned to the top left where the width the body width and the height the body height then put another one on top of it which only covers the object in question then set an action to the big one s onfocus

960375
width	height
are your textures all powers of two in width and height

960375
calloc	malloc
changing malloc to calloc in the texture2d source fixed the problem

960389
avr	microcontroller
i have encountered a problem in a c program running on an avr microcontroller atmega328p

960389
free	malloc
all malloc ing happens on startup and all free ing happens at the end of the application which in practice is never since the main part of the application is in an infinite loop

960470
profiling	instrumentation
i m looking for profiling techniques for evaluating and reducing image size waste in the same vein as shark and instrumentation help for run-time evaluation

960481
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
a crash in realloc or malloc or free can be triggered by writing past the bounds of a memory block -- and this can happen anywhere else in your program

960483
directx	directwrite
this will be fixed in beta 2 once wpf integrates with the directwrite code in the latest versions of directx

960501
put	get
currently it copies a file from the first fpt server to the local computer where it runs using ftp get and then copies it to the second ftp server using ftp put

960501
ftp	telnet
one idea is to create a java telnet session and and send a couple of ftp commands

960583
queue	fifo
to dequeue doesn t mean to release. it means pull off the queue of cached no-longer-in-use reusable cells. it s called dequeuing because it s a fifo queue of cells and you are pulling the first one off

960591
int	boolean
because it generalizes better to any number of columns with linearly growing instead of quadratically growing amount of coding it s even neater in sql dialects that don t require explicit casting of boolean aka bit to int but i m not sure if sql server is one of those

960594
pull	push
and rebasing commits is not okay cause i push to a bare repository which then has a hook that pull that to a working directory that is the testing server that is accessible by others

960608
getter	setter
now if i want to customize the getter or the setter the field must be explicit as it was in c#2.0

960609
cpu	processors
note also that using maximum cpu is generally a good thing especially on modern processors

960618
squash	branch	squash	merge
why can t you make small commits on a development branch then squash them into a single commit that gets merge back to the main branch which gets pushed to the server

960622
subtract	add
now that vb has this feature would clscompliant attribute care if you have normal static methods like add subtract instead of operator overloads only

960633
postgresql	mysql
i would use normal database say mysql postgresql firebird etc. on server

960688
spaces	delimiter
the spaces are interpreted as delimiter and the entries should be relative

960697
mouse	keyboard
3 do the same thing hooking the various mouse and keyboard emulation functions

960706
google-chrome	firefox
that works in firefox and google-chrome but not ie7 i don t know why

960716
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
take a look at the eventwaithandle manualresetevent autoresetevent classes

960720
entity-relationship	diagram
it can generate sql for several different databases as well as entity-relationship diagram and even code

960742
int	chars
then for array of int chars float you have the biggaray library a pointer p to an already-allocated c or fortran array can be wrapped and returned to caml as a big array using the alloc_bigarray

960754
calloc	malloc
make sure that all your variables have a default value and that all dynamic memory is zeroed out before you use it use calloc rather than malloc

960758
width	height
modifying width height seems really ugly because fixed sizes in wpf are almost always a wrong way to go and also it s absolutely unflexible

960758
width	height
how do you tell wpf to animate width height of an element from 0 to as much as needed

960774
sum	coalesce
i m pretty sure the linker will coalesce equivalent strings so the total will be less than the sum of the parts for these sections but i guess typically not by much

960853
put	get
you can put your class in a module and then you won t get the error because you ll be defining set within a namespace

960866
for-loop	arrays
it s trivially easy to construct a new arrays from an arguments object with a simple for-loop

960870
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately array.from and rest parameters are currently only implemented in newer versions of firefox and google-chrome check the browser compatibility table in the above links but you can use a transpiler like babel to efficently write es6 code with really low compatibility issues

960888
int	double
int to object or int to double

960895
int	double
your oggplayer is an iplay double not an iplay int

960895
int	double
you can t cast an iplay int to an iplay object or an iplay double to an iplay int like that

960907
int	double
note however that regardless the second will not work because there is no inheritance relationship between double and int

961015
super	self
you can use super description instead of self to avoid the infinite recursion like so

961033
post	get
there are a number of nasty little details around mez s post we don t get to see that would define the company s need more completely

961051
implements	extends
public class mainclass extends whateversuperclass implements whateverinterface

961054
width	height
the innder div is absolutely positioned to left 50 top minus the height of the div and has a margin-left of minus the width of the div

961068
svnadmin	visualsvn
you can just dump the repository from visualsvn with the standard svnadmin tools and load it into something else very easily

961150
getter	setter
the getter would work as a is also a b but the setter wouldn t work since the implementation expects an a while the interface allows you to set theobject to b

961159
firefox	safari
firefox and safari however simply ignore the comma

961183
addition	multiplication
what is important to note about the ackerman function is it essentially defines the heirachy of additive functions on the integers a 1 n is addition a 2 n is multiplication a 3 n is exponentiation a 4 n is tetration and after 5 the functions grow too fast to be applicable to very much

961183
addition	multiplication
another way to look at addition multiplication etc is

961217
put	get
i m a serial unfinisher - repeatedly i put very skeletal open source code out mostly on code.google.com and see if i can attract other developers to get synergy

961244
int	chars
chars whose int representations are in the range from zero through 31 are not allowed

961244
filesystems	ntfs
if you know that your program will only ever write to ntfs filesystems you can probably be sure that there are no other characters that the filesystems does not allow so you would only have to check that the file name is not too long use the max_path constant after all invalid chars have been removed or replaced by underscores for example

961312
put	get
so its better to put the validation inside foo even if it will get called repeatedly

961349
division	modulo
the modulo tells you the remainder of a division of two numbers

961352
division	modulo
it checks if the modulo of the division

961377
hide	show
i then use animate instead of hide and show to try to solve the problem

961417
hide	show
may be you tool also have drawing setting to hide some part of the operation to reduce the width for instance to show or not the parameters or their direction their type etc

961435
consistency	acid
consistency in acid means only valid data will be written

961444
openbsd	freebsd
the freebsd openbsd sys queue is another good option for a generic macro based linked list

961458
xslt	schematron
jing supports pre-iso schematron validation note that jing s implementation is based also on xslt

961458
xslt	schematron
apply the skeleton xslt on your schematron schema to get a new xslt stylesheet that represents your schematron schema in xslt

961487

962320
octal	binary
the ratio you noticed octal binary is log base 8 n log base 2 n 3

962339
int	chars
note that the worst case for the buffer size happens when you convert to binary which gives you a buffer size of 32 chars for 32-bit int

962352
hide	show
note that you could just as easily use create free instead of show hide

962357

962399
vbscript	vb6
my issue with vbscript and vb6 is when i use them to script windows or office applications the right domain for them - i find myself struggling with the language they fall short of being the right tool

962399
vbscript	jscript
while there are certain things that work better with vbscript such as passing arrays back and forth from com objects is slightly easier although it is easier to pass event handlers into com components with jscript i am still surprised by the amount of coders that still use vbscript to script windows - i bet if they wrote the same program in both languages they would find that jscript works with you much more than vbscript because of jscript s native hash data types and closures

962399
vbscript	vba	vbscript	vb6	vb6	vba
vb6 vba though a little better than vbscript in general still has many similar issues where for their domain they require much more boiler plate to do simple tasks than what i would like and have seen in other scripting languages

multiplying	multiplication
multiplying is just multiplication and scale and propagate the integer overflow

962806

a number bigger than 64bit can never occur in a multiplication because c is an unsigned integer of 32 bits and k is a unsigned short of 16-bit

962806
integer	unsigned
if you try to multiplication an unsigned integer with unsigned integer you get another unsigned integer

opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
one of the methods i came across while surfing the net was to have an intermediate page that shows the animation while loading the actual page using javascript location.href .so i figure use a couple of ajax calls from the intermediate page to a servlet to get the feedback.problem is it works fine in ie 6 7 and firefox 3.but the ajax callbacks dont seem to be getting executed in case of google-chrome and opera the location.href part seems to mess it up and the callbacks never get executed

963449
post	get
you could do this in one call by getting a whole html page as a response with the ajax get or post methods and carving up parts of it to dole out in the success callback function or if you wanted to do it for each piece of the page you wanted to update separately you could use jquery s load method

963488

if anyone else that reads this post is looking for similar guidance i d recommend the following resources to help you get up to speed more quickly

965151
inherited	properties
create a separate class to hold your data properties then do something like this.datacontext new myaddressclass . you ll notice that the datacontext propagates all the way down the control tree so that nested controls inherited their parent s datacontext as you d expect

965164
hide	show
and if i hide it this way it also doesn t show correctly afterwards

so despite of codeigniter and kohana itself what else is worth looking at that makes life easy and not harder

965500
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
if i want to use a key why can i not just pass in a salt hash of my secret key an md5 hash

965519
post	get
get the variable from post or get

965539
inherited	properties
update inherited + properties hiding as a potential solution

965539
inherited	properties
i m now investigating another possibility which is to create a fakeperson class which inherited from person but hides the properties with new read-write properties

965539
inherited	properties
my last solution of hiding the properties through inherited does in fact work however by using moq i get a standardized set of functionality that is more maintainable

965563
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
if you wish to pass the md5 hash of your salt key to des you should use some key compression technique

965563
hash	md5
for instance you could take the top 7 bytes somewhat undesirable or perform des encryption on the md5 hash with a known constant key and take all but the last byte as the key for des operation

965590
post	get
when i post my own headers which are required for an external server they then get prefixed my header batch_type shows up as http_batch_type

965636
try-catch	exception-handling
what i m wondering is if there is an issue with output redirection to stdout and the way powershell traps exception-handling - or if it is my try-catch code to begin with

965641
width	height
note that i ve changed the parent relativelayout to a height and width of fill_parent as is generally what you want for a main activity

965686
post	get
when the form values are accessible via or which contains both post and get values

965709
inherited	properties
the css opacity properties is not being inherited although it may seem so

965709
children	parent
so if the parent has an opacity of 0.5 then visually all its children can only ever achieve that opacity no higher

965721
width	height
if i m reading your question right this is just a consequence of the way opacity works right now child elements inherit opacity as a range so the value of their opacity is normalised against the parent similar to how height width can work

965751
coalesce	isnull
for the remaining cases you can generally use functions like coalesce or isnull functions to return something that s easier to process

965757
command-pattern	mediator
you might also try having the gui give the mediator a callback object that handles retrieving return values or setting whatever values you need a version of command-pattern

965760
wxpython	pyqt
there are two gui toolkit for python which we know wxpython and pyqt

965764
pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt	hash	salt
at its heart pbkdf2 is combining salt and the password through via a hash function to produce the actual key

965769
inherited	subclassing
projects are just a way to create an assembly full of usable types - they don t in and of themselves inherited anything nor do they allow for subclassing etc

965803
hash	salt
also it s good practice to salt the hash with a value which is particular to the operation you are doing and won t change internal userid

965811
subtraction	addition
quotes are natural the same way + and - are natural for addition and subtraction

965844
width	height
it s essentially copying the x and y position height and width of your input and applying them to the autocomplete layer so that they match up visually

965851
int	chars
operands that are int constants ï oating constants enumeration constants chars

965867
perforce	svn
are the files in perforce also in svn

965867
perforce	svn
i suspect that may be some use for synchronising changes from svn to perforce

965869
gridview	repeater
please note that these linkbutton elements are not added to a datagrid gridview or repeater

965930
migrate	upgrade
if you can upgrade your crm 3.0 machine to 4.0 and make sure that it and your new system are at the same rollup level then you can migrate everything across

965938
serializable	deserialization
it stores native objects so there is no serializable deserialization steps involved

965972
submit	submission
the proper way of checking a form submission is to check the form s submit event not the button s click event

966025
post	get
we have a rest web service that uses post - to insert data into database unmarshall data from xml and get to retrieve data marshalled into xml

966025
post	get
or should i have 2 xsds - one more verbose tailored to get requests and one slimmed down purely for post request

966077
put	get
i have servlet mapped on say servletpath after that i can put whatever i want and get my servlet responding depending on the rest of a path except when there is 2f in the path

966096
dreamweaver	aptana
i think i want to switch from dreamweaver to the eclipse based ide aptana

966096
dreamweaver	aptana
so is there a way to set aptana to collaborate with team members who are using dreamweaver

966107
int	chars
far better to use a surrogate key and yes a join on an int is often faster and you can join in delete staments in many databases not use the slower subquery especially since names tend to be longer than a few chars

966131
gif	bmp
this works for all files except for image files jpg gif bmp ect.

966208
subtract	add
but i can t write -1 or +1 to subtract add day like in sql

966229
dreamweaver	aptana
as aptana is based off eclipse you could basically choose whatever source control repository technology dreamweaver could support and install an eclipse plugin for that i would think

966272
pop-up	dialog
things i can immediately think of include pop-up calendars and modal pop-up dialog but there must be more.

966275
richfaces	icefaces
jsf with icefaces or richfaces come to mind

966291
post	get
mostly for ajax get and post here

966301
setinterval	settimeout
you should better use setinterval instead of settimeout

966312
hide	show
i use it for pre-loading more content than is actually show - if i have a tabbed page i load the contents of all tabs at once and then show hide the different sections and style the tab menus with css classes using jquery

966324
lapack	gsl
it draws from lapack blas and gsl gnu scientific library

966328
bitblt	gdi
it s been awhile since i ve used the gdi but i m assuming you re talking about the bitblt function right

966386
folder	dir	folder	directory
dir s b a-d lists all files at or below this folder s in bare format b excluding directory a-d

966407
hide	show
inside those functions you can show hide your indicator

966426
width	height
effectively giving it a height and width of 0 and behaving as if it doesn t exist

966459
spaces	delimiter
add a spaces or other delimiter only if a variable is set in order to avoid ugly unnecessary spaces

966470
for-loop	loops
this however has nothing to do with my answer a foreach loops creates an iterator so it shouldn t access the database 99 more times on the post they used a for-loop to access the first 100 items

966479
equals	gethashcode
and override the equals and gethashcode members

966597
coff	omf
warning lnk4033 converting object format from omf to coff

966632
free	malloc
if you do not free memory that you malloc d in a c program under linux when is it released

966639
cpu	hyperthreading
make sure you test on a machine with multiple cpu cores or at least a cpu with hyperthreading

966662
free	malloc
memory allocated by malloc is free when the process ends

966674
free	malloc
malloc ed memory is definitely free when the process ends but not by calling free

966686
hash	md5
i think the best bet would chose a standard hash either md5 or sha1 to obtain a hash of your string and then to get an integer hash to a and that should convert your hash into a integer hash

966689
coff	omf
answer nicked out of metawindow faq - omf vs coff object file formats.htm

966689
coff	omf
coff object modules later became the defacto standard for all microsoft win32 development tools and gained an advantage in being much closer in format to portable executable files - the native executable format for win32 a coff-format linker has much less work to create a 32-bit exe or dll from a coff file than from an omf format file

966689
coff	omf
just as there are omf- and coff-format object files .obj s there are also omf and coff format library files .lib s

966689
coff	omf
to make things difficult however both omf and coff use the same file name extensions .obj and .lib to reference the two different types of object and library file formats because of this you can t just look at the file name extension to tell if the object module or library file is omf or coff

966689
coff	omf
the problem with mixing object files and library files from different compiler vendors is that some vendors support coff other vendors use omf and a few can handle both

966689
coff	omf
borland for example still uses omf object files and libraries while microsoft s 32-bit compilers produce coff format files

966689
coff	omf
watcom c c++ v11.0 seems to prefer coff when compiling and linking windows applications but generates omf object files for use with their dos4gw 32-bit protected-mode dos-extender

966689
coff	omf
along with this microsoft masm 6.13 produces omf files by default but with the coff switch can emit coff object files instead

966689
coff	omf
for example the microsoft visual c c++ linker is designed for coff format object files and libraries but will try to convert omf object files into coff files if necessary

966689
coff	omf
some dos extender and embedded system vendors such as phar lap provide their own linkers which support both omf and coff giving you a choice

966689
coff	omf
the bottom line is that mixing omf and coff object and library file types can be a mess plus the cryptic error messages from the linkers don t help

966689
coff	omf
unless your linker specifically supports it you should stick with recommended object and library format for your compiler linker platform and avoid mixing omf and coff files

966726
client-side	server-side
for a web developer it would be very common to work with a client-side and a server-side language every day such as javascript and java

966776
post	get
sure its lacking features but if you want messaging web get post data this is the platform for you

966789
telerik	radcombobox
i have a webpage that has a telerik radcombobox on the page

email	dkim
i have two dedicated servers one of which is configured for sending email out spf dkim other domain whitelisting methods etc

966947
put	get
debugging user mode code from kernel mode is most definitely possible but is a bit more complicated - for instance to get a break in the process before it starts you need to put a breakpoint on the kernel s process creation code or on a ntdll s user mode code that first executes

966954
fseek	fread
by fread unless you call fseek or

966954
fseek	fread
in fact if you don t need to read anything from the file i would just use fseek in place of your call to fread

966991
width	height
first of all take a look at measuredwidth and measuredheight properties of uicomponent so all the controls and containers have these properties flex already measures required width height of the containers

967044
ienumerable	ilist
wcf service tries to return an ilist or ienumerable here here

967063
rss	feed
if you are crawling just the rss feed xml i suspect you could do that every hour without annoying anyone

967084
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicswidget
it makes it very easy to make these types of interfaces since widgets can now be placed on the scene qgraphicsscene using qgraphicswidget and qgraphicslayout

967105
post	put
you put your url after post

967114
cos	sin
if you pick a certain magnitude for the initial velocity u speed then you can write the x and y components of u as u cos a and u sin a respectively where u is the initial speed and a the initial angle

967129
mouseover	mouseout
have you thought about using mouseover and mouseout to simulate this

967129
mouseleave	mouseenter
also look into mouseenter and mouseleave

967147
onfocus	onblur
so onfocus sets focused true onblur sets focused false

967167
spaces	linefeed
the blank spaces will be removed and a linefeed will be added at the end of each line

967177
multiplying	add
to calculate how gravity will affect the velocity of your object just take the time since you last updated the velocity of the object multiplying it by your gravitational factor and add it to your current velocity vector

967181
post	get
user is now prompted for credentials for remote soap server which by the way are the same as the ones used to get into local site 9 times out of 10 via post form

967181
put	get
i m not used to handling security credentials beyond a simple this is where you put in your password...good now that everybody knows each other for the rest of the session i can get back to outputting useful stuff.

967212
client-side	server-side
do you mean you want a client-side jquery autocomplete control that queries a server-side database for the data

967257
sorting	filtering
and everything works together so changing a page and then the sorting and adding a filtering works without losing any of the other settings

967258
serializable	deserialization
here is the serializable and deserialization code

967272
vb.net	vb6
vb.net has the vb6 syntax for linking to methods in dlls

967288

i ve been looking at serializer but the necessary methods writestarttag element writeendtag element write doctype are protected not public

967288
dom4j	xom
this is related to my question about the best dom4j replacement where xom is a strong contender.

967300
hide	show
add an inputpanel to your form hook up the gotfocus and lostfocus events of the textbox and show hide the input panel in the event handlers

967307
rss	feed
java will have more libraries for random things like fetching rss feed

967356
activemq	rabbitmq
as an alternative to activemq mentioned above there is open-source rabbitmq

967377
getter	setter
what you are saying by defining your getter and setter in the abstract class is you must implement this if you want to inherit from me. then you are asking how can i made a derived class ignore this rule.

967377
getter	setter
the answer is that if you have a situation that every derived class needs a getter put that in the abstract class and let the derived class decide if they will implement a setter or not by leaving it out of the abstract class

967442
spaces	delimiter
assuming you know which primitive types you will be using you can loop through to form a single string using a spaces or whatever you choose as a delimiter then use the string.split method to split the string back out into a string array and finally loop through that array and cast its members to reproduce the original array

967463
postgresql	mysql
any input from people having dealt with similar problems is welcome -- i am not a mysql guy trying to batter postgresql into making all the same mistakes i am used to -- just dealing with data i don t have full control over

967467
put	get
so i guess my next question is how do i get 128 to work and hopefully this will put an end to this question

967473
perl	tcl
since then i ve used a lot of different programming and scripting languages c c++ php python perl tcl and recently i started thinking of my old turbo pascal days

967483
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i m on a mac and i m experiencing the same result on safari firefox and opera

967502
post	get
because from i can tell it does support crud operations just from the underlying http protocols of get post delete etc

967524
hex	binary
i m trying to write a small program that will generate a parity bit for hex and binary values pulled from an ascii character array

967524
hex	binary
so i type a and it finds the corresponding values in the binary and hex arrays and then displays them

967586
width	height
the uncompressed image will definitely be larger than the 44 kib the compressed image in jpeg form occupies roughly 3 or 4 bytes multiplied by width and height

967595
vim	emacs
vim because once you suggest emacs someone will suggest vi

967632
hash	salt
instead take the salt hash of the answer and store that in the database

967637
folder	directory
i have a directory called xmonroe in the vendor plugins folder of my rails app

967638
getter	setter
synth the getter and setter in the .m file

967679
kde	gnome
b to be hosted in .net applications for automation similar to dcop in kde and how gnome is using corba

967705
put	get
in my opinion powershell as a shell is clearly intended as a replacement for cmd easy to see and windows script host windows script host didn t get much attention in recent years even though it had similar concepts as .net back in its day one platform multiple languages with activescripting but with .net microsoft basically put that to rest and resurrection probably wasn t an option for them

967751
memcached	ncache
not free version of ncache not memcached

967774
firefox	safari
the method works flawlessly when called through firefox but when i attempt to call it either via ajax or directly from the browser in ie8 or safari it simply will not log in

967776
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
this is working in ie6+ ff2+ and opera but for some reason there are huge gaps in safari and google-chrome like those two browsers are ignoring it and just applying regular breaks

967776
google-chrome	safari
i tried testing with larger line-heights like 20px or 30px and safari and google-chrome recognize those

967782
aim	instant
i personally have setup filters for aim aol instant messenger http msn messenger windows live messenger pop and smtp

967805
emacs	textmate
i feel like emacs is so much better than textmate

967821
textarea	textbox
i have other fields that are getting validated correctly and the css is changing when there is an issue on the textbox and textarea accordingly

967832
hash	md5
use hash and not md5 instead

967837
fadein	fadeout
so would i now be using the css method to change the color of the background fadein then fadeout to white again

967842
implements	sealed
i then create my sealed class myentityrepository which inherits imyentityrepository and implements all members

967851
post	get
however i am looking for some sample code on how i get my filter conditions there are quite a few i would have those selected clientside via dropdowns back to the controller s post request

967859
quicksort	shellsort
so here is my questions in term of performance and their concept what is the differences among bubble sort selection sort insertion sort shellsort and quicksort

967899
hash	md5
put this way given a hash function which md5 is of size 1 bits there are only 2 possible combination s

967899
hash	md5
even at 128 bits md5 2 files sharing the same hash does not mean they are in fact the same file

967908
mergesort	timsort
wikipedia doesn t mention the incredible timsort which is what python uses a clever variant of natural mergesort

967913
telerik	radcombobox
it works fine when i use the radcombobox from telerik

967921
primes	modulus
primes 65521 for the modulus

967921
primes	modulus
someone else in this thread makes a somewhat convincing argument that modulus a primes is better for detecting bit-swapping

967921
primes	modulus
effectiveness of using a primes modulus

967925
maven	pom.xml
maven s working directory is the directory of a module the one which contains pom.xml

967976
post	get	getter	setter
setter getter on stripes action beans are used to allow the actionbean to receive the request parameters url parameters in the case of get requests form parameters in the case of post requests from the browser

968001
for-loop	arrays
reason i ask is because i need to run a for-loop inside the other function where the arrays is passed

968027
primes	modulus
in fact the only time a primes modulus fails to detect a single swap is when two equal indexes mod m are swapped and if m is big they must be far apart

968064
put	get
want to get out put as what is it

968082
hash	salt
you use them for something like a password such that every time someone tries to log in you compute the hash of the password they tried to log in with plus a salt and compare that with your stored value

968087
touchescancelled	touchesended
this example doesn t take into account a number of things including the touchescancelled method and the relevant threading if you re always running some code i m not sure but you may never get the touchesended method to run - play with performselector afterdelay or performselectorinbackground

968089
des	aes
some common algorithms used in practice today are aes des and blowfish

968132
accessor	properties
from my understanding private would mean that the variable cannot not be used outside the class unless there is a accessor method or get properties

968164
hash	md5
use the md5 hash of a database table and modification date utc to determine if a table has changed

968167
spyware	antivirus
it seems that that there is no such api provided to accomplish this is it possible to use some hooking technique but this has to be reliable and not to be treated as spyware by antivirus tools

968244
virtualenv	setuptools
this is the structure pinax used for external django apps at one time but i think it s using virtualenv + pip instead of setuptools distutils now

968379
min	rank
and that will do group by of id and min rank and join back

968385
capitalize	capitalization
it looks like you have a capitalization issue - since your columns are capitalize activerecord will create capitalize attributes for you

968465
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
as written i m not sure that i understand the sequence of how the code would emulate a complete drag event - composed of mousedown mousemove and mouseup events

968591
inherited	properties
in linq to sql this can be done in the or designer by selecting the properties then in the properties window set inherited modifier to virtual

968612
client-side	server-side
so unless your company policy forces you to don t sign jars on the server side and keep common jars in signed and non-signed versions signed go to the client-side deployment non-signed go to server-side codebase

968640
bazaar	git
as for the first tool to choose problem with git bazaar and mercurial is they are distributed vcs s

968733
multicastdelegate	delegation
however only the system and compilers can derive explicitly from the delegation class or from the multicastdelegate class

968765
mantis	bugzilla
i ve personally switched from bugzilla into mantis and installed some plugins and found this more comfortable

968768
free	malloc
you need to either do malloc and free or pass buffer and its length to this function

968853
inherited	properties
you should define those properties as private only if you do not want them to be inherited

968873
implements	extends
i would also consider taking this a step further to implements a testable session solution that extends the system.web.httpsessionstatebase abstract class

968881
openssl	botan
for c++ your free and open source options seems to be to look into openssl or botan

968887
min	max
how to get a min and max column value for the modified date

968887
min	max
how can i get min value and max value for the particular modified date

968951
equals	gethashcode
overriding equals without overriding gethashcode is a bad idea and introduces a lot of complexity

969038
folder	directory
it will show you a list of every file and folder in your output bin-debug by default directory

969057
nfa	dfa
regular expressions at a theoretical level form the foundations of what a state machine is -- in computer science you have deterministic finite automata dfa and non-deterministic finite automata nfa

969158
min	max
you can further use min rownum or max rownum to get the first or last row for matt respectively

969189
xlsx	xlsm
the code previously implemented takes in the xls file saves it on to a column in a table using the stream i use the same method but the only change is the the file saved is a xlsm or an xlsx type file it saves to the column in the database

969189
xlsx	xlsm
when i try and get the contents from the database and throw the saved xlsm file or xlsx file i get an error excel file found unreadable content do you want to recover the contents of this work book

969189

969242
cvs	svn
is it possible to transfer a repository from cvs to svn one branch tag at a time

969254
folder	directory
you are assuming that the program folder is the current directory

969263
principalcontext	userprincipal
from principalcontext you can instantiate userprincipal which includes permissions requests and i assume hopefully meet many of your requirements for building out a custom portal

969325
cvs	svn
the approach to migrate from cvs to svn is to use the cvs2svn tool

969325
cvs	svn
this migration tool assumes a one time action to convert the cvs repository to svn

969325
cvs	svn
during the conversion the cvs repository should be frozen and after which everybody should use the svn repository

969325
cvs	svn
the tool isn t suited for gradually moving parts of the cvs to the svn

969325
cvs	svn
it doesn t create a persistent record of which cvs version relates to which svn revision number

969342
hide	show
another way to put it would be write a javascript functions show commonimageid nexttoimageid and hide commonimageid nexttoimageid that would be used like show correct draggable1

969384
jqgrid	tablesorter
you can also look into jquery addons like jqgrid or tablesorter

969397
post	get
assuming you know how to load the pdf in to a byte array you ve got to get it base64 encoded and then post that to server using mime multipart encoding

969406
mathml	tex
but then i have to convert mathml to tex somehow wich is not so easy

969439
hide	show
instead of having multiple divs that you show and hide you can try this solution as well

969492
freebsd	linux
but a simple hello world application that just uses the console as output can be compiled on windows linux vms as 400 smartphones freebsd ms-dos cp80 and almost any other system for which you can find a c++ compiler

969524
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
keyedcollection does not implement neither inotifycollectionchanged nor inotifypropertychanged

969539
rsa	aes
rsa vs aes

969560
firefox	safari
browsers like firefox and safari are better at line numbers but they are generally pointless due to minification of the files

969571
des	rsa
then you need to decide whether you want symmetric think des shared key or asymmetric think rsa public and private keys and also think hard about key management because that is often the point of weakness

submit	submission
this way the value of the submit button will be ignored upon submission the form

969624

969838
min	max
exactly i need min value and max value for the modified date

969881
many-to-many	one-to-many
the problem is not made any better by the fact that linq to sql does not support many-to-many relationships directly and in reality assuming that your lookup table only defines a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship you d have to do something like

969884
icmp	tcp
a typical implementation will use icmp echo requests if the privilege can be obtained otherwise it will try to establish a tcp connection on port 7 echo of the destination host

969902
ant	maven
integration it s done for both maven and ant

969922
hide	show
if you are ok with validating multiple steps at once tomas lycken s suggestion hide show with jquery would give a fast step by step experience

969939
glog	gflags
glog gflags and boost asio

969945
onmouseover	onclick
you may also want remove event handlers like onmouseover and onclick etc

970282
bitarray	bitvector
there are a few modules that can help such as bitvector bitarray and bitstring

970292
vim	emacs
c-x 3 emacs and vsplit vim are great for multiple separate views into the code but i d like it to flow from one column to the other like text in a newspaper

970382

with the above code i get the following compiler error from vs2008 this is only the first few lines of 160 in total which i think is a bit too much to post here

970389
post	get
you can add more get variables or you can post data with this

970437

use collections.list results to put the results in a list and then use list.size to get the count and iterate over the list

970478
width	height
get width 2 and height 2 of the rectangle then using system.graphics.measurestring to get the dimensions of your string again half them and subtract from your earlier width height values and you end up with the x y coordinate to draw your string at in order for it to be centered

970557
pull	push
you have to push to php instead of pull from swf meaning your flash movie has to report its lso s state if it changes

970574
post	get
on the api call you should pass the server the last updated time as a get or post parameter

970621
lxml	elementtree
i would normally recommend lxml but since that uses a c-library libxml the alternative would have to be as aaron has already suggested elementtree as far as i know there is both a pure python and a c implementation of it available

970640
spweb	spsite
maybe you need to allowunsafeupdates on the spweb or spsite

970640
post	get

i m just thinking here is there a need for having get and post at the same time

970643
post	get
to obtain get post data according to which http request was made

970655
implements	extends
would it be possible to create your own class that extends the generated class and then have your class implements the interface

970673
super	extends
one of the issues with building a map is that it will not support subclasses unless you register them specifically or extends your get function to look up super classes specifically

970687
post	get
yes but you might want to make sure that when using this code you check that the request method is post if you are going to change anything as a consequence of the request rather than treating get and post as the same thing

970697
public	protected
you could use an internal or protected modifier for the constructor instead of public

970817
rss	feed
we are pulling in an rss feed that could potentially have anything in it

970819
rar	zip
i am writing a set of classes rar zip and trip

rar	zip
2 write zip rar and trip classes

970848

the transmission protocol used is https ssl

970849
gridview	repeater
another option would be to put a templatefield that contains the bindable control repeater another gridview etc. you choose to use and binding the datasource property to the attendees property of your business object

970849
listview	gridview
also i don t if you re married to the idea of using a gridview but in cases like these where you need more control of the layout i would suggest the new listview .net 3.5 control or lately i ve just been using nested repeaters so i can have more refined control of the layout i am trying to generate

970855
inherited	subclassing
inherited itself will do you well and it will help to have a base archive class if there are a number of methods common to your subclassing

970965
codeigniter	kohana
given that kohana is a fork of codeigniter you ll maybe fix with this

970976
serializable	deserialization
for total control over serializable and deserialization implement java.io.externalizable instead of serializable

971001
post	get
get is generally used for display purposes while post is used for admin purposes adding editing items confirming choices etc

971001
post	get
there may also be a slight security problem someone could like to a page using get parameters and force execution of something like deleting data - actually this can be done with post from an external html form but is much less common

971027
children	parent
each node of the tree needs to know both who it s parent is and who it s children are

971027

971239
width	margin
otherwise it defaults to the full width of the page and the auto margin for the left and right get set to 0

971239
width	text-align
if you want the footer bar to take up the width like the stackoverflow notice bar and center the text then you need to add text-align center to your definition

971240
post	get
i would recommend keeping both post and get vars since you can t predict how they are going to be used

971311
accessor	properties
properties are new in objective-c 2.0 and provide auto accessor generation

971314
getter	setter
since you appear to be using nsviewcontroller i assume you re on leopard os x 10.5 in which case you should probably be using property and the synthesize d getter setter if possible

971322
serializable	deserialization
2 use some serializable deserialization into one hidden field

971343
post	get
that way your view markup stays simple but you still get the pre post state tracking in your post info

post	get
i can read get using oauth just fine however when i try to send a status update via http twitter.com statuses update.xml using a post it returns a 401 with the following xml

971788
cvs	svn
i think it s possible that you re using the term check out here in its cvs sense that is an svn update

971812
jtree	jtable
is there a way for a jtable and a jtree to share the same model so that any change in that underlying model is reflected immediately in both components

971825
jtree	jtable
i am not sure if this is what you are looking for but there is a two part tutorial from sun on creating tree tables which is essentially a jtable with a jtree renderer in the first column

971847
post	get
in a similar vein to what ammoq suggested i don t have enough karma to comment on their post - instead of laws have documented code standards. it s a lot of work but a non-confrontational way to get everyone on board with better code quality

971848
pull	push
i bleieve you may need to push the schema changes from the publisher as opposed to attempt to pull them from the client

971856
mouse	keyboard
it s nice because once you have the user set up the client software you can arrange with them a time to leave their pc unattended so that you can remote in and take a look with the option to disable local keyboard mouse and monitor access

971923
versioning	upgrade
however if you are going to be updating content frequently then you can either upgrade to the latest versioning of any popular cms preferably joomla or drupal

972006
ant	maven
i looked at ant and maven though haven t employed either yet i ll also need to spend time solving #3 and #4

972006
maven	buildr
update 2 - from benchmarks i ve seen daniel spiewak is right that buildr s faster than maven and if one is doing incremental changes maven s 10 second latency gets annoying so if one can craft a compatible build file then it s probably worth it.

972033
spaces	delimiter
if you define words as sequences of characters delimiter by spaces .

972056
hide	show
when i tried in google chrome the show hide text would toggle but the embedding widget doesn t show up

it s supported as a vendor extension to sql by mysql postgresql and sqlite

972111
filesystems	ntfs
is the filesystems ntfs

972111
short	base
the increase occurs because ntfs base the short file name on the first six characters of the long file name

972169

it can be tricky moving items absolutely if one does not know the height and width

972203
spaces	delimiter
this method can handle more delimiter than spaces by the regex being used

972342
puts	fflush
this will work better if you use puts which will append a newline terminator if there is not already one at the end of the line forcing a buffer fflush

972361
multiplying	multiplication
any chance you re doing some sort of operation multiplication by a constant integer somewhere multiplying by 5 instead of 5.0

972366

972607
folder	directory
instead i made a folder in my user directory instead

972652
postgresql	mysql
the application is developped with php and zend framework database should be mysql or postgresql

972730
inherited	subclassing
i think for such classes designed for inherited and used as build blocks of application based on some framework definition of behavior should be more abstract - leaving some details to subclassing even if class itself is not abstract

972730
superclass	subclassing
subclassing should be different is some way from superclass otherwise it does not make sense to create subclassing

972730
superclass	subclassing
and you always can abuse this difference and write a program that works for superclass and fails for subclassing

972737
post	get
when i click the get date button i saw the date flash on the screen for a second but since the whole page is loading it disappears and when i view it in firebug i see it is doing the post but quickly disappearing

972751
vmware	virtualbox
i m currently using virtualbox and vmware and this does not look good enough for me correct me if i m wrong the hard drives could lock for instance either because two virtualized machines run on them or because all hard drive access is channeled through the same hdd controller

google-chrome	firefox
you could also just recommend google-chrome or firefox

973093
folder	directory
directory path to 123 folder doesn t exist

973113
folder	directory
the problem is that bash performs tilde expansion before shell parameter substitution so after it substitutes path to folder for it doesn t try to expand the so it looks for a directory literally named with a tilde in it which of course doesn t exist

973229
folder	directory
my current implementation has a function to find the latest file in a folder that conforms to a file mask cjl .log and uses 2 anonymous classes one to filter a directory listing and another to sort a list of files based on modifieddt

973247
rss	feed
xml is application xml and text xml but there are also specific variants like application xhtml+xml application svg+xml and application rss+xml that ll you ll need to decide whether to override the default behaviour catching these would break xhtml rendering svg images and rss feed respectively

asihttprequest	cfnetwork
if you re unwilling or unable to use private apis there s an open source bsd license library called asihttprequest that provides a wrapper around the lower-level cfnetwork apis

973320
filesystems	ntfs
the historical reason for this is that the underlying ntfs filesystems supports alternate resource streams that can be accessed with names like yourfile.txt hiddendata.txt

973320
filesystems	ntfs
there is also a limitation in current versions of asp.net that incoming urls need to map to the ntfs filesystems for purposes of determining managed configuration data

973341

973361

973365
lisp	scheme
it uses scheme lisp dialect a highly iterative language suitable for prototyping apps one line at a time

973403
fast-forward	merge

yslow	pagespeed
see the yahoo yslow tool and the pagespeed tool for this

973475
min	max	minimum	max
of course management only ever looks at the minimum figure but by the time they start complaining about cost over-runs and missed deliverables you ve already got them locked in and you have been hopefully keeping the fully appraised of any problems you ve encountered and the effect those problems are having pushing the actuals away from min and closer to max

973476
redmine	trac
i would recommend redmine similar with trac in many aspects

973563
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater

973600
width	height
one is impossible the other would be to set the width and height properties using jquery

973610
width	height
if you re wanting to do it in a statement then the height and width properties would most likely be best

973610
width	height
if you re wanting something animated you can use the .animate ... command and set the height and width as parameters

973616
django	web.py
django for me has a terrible api and although we can find some other really cool projects like web.py when i compare that to what i get with php and cakephp i don t get that excited

properties offer both getter and setter and can have different scope at least in .net 2.0

974108
width	height
you can adjust the width and height and you can also remove the border if you want the page to be more seamless

matplotlib	scipy
i have chosen to use python combined with numpy scipy and matplotlib

974183
vtk	itk
when you import itk and vtk in matlab you have to use mex functions to program your c code in

974183
vtk	itk
so it is impossible to run some itk vtk code notice it doesn t work and alter some of the variables used in the mex file created there but they will also die there because of the black box only returning your result for speed testing what does work

974190
disk	ram
buffer is temporary placeholder variables in many programming languages in memory ram disk on which data can be dumped and then processing can be done

974228
min	max
you can then do min and max against it

974265
versioning	upgrade
if you have a hacked versioning and an upgrade doesn t work try it then you will have to write your own migration scripts

974292
ant	maven
other than the desire to learn something new i have used ant before i think the dependency management of maven might work well for the drupal modules

974292
ant	maven
btw i think i will switch to ant if i can t get maven to work soon

974303
gif	png
the following ignores existing files folder and files with the extension matching jpg jpeg png gif

most aggregates like min and max will return null when presented with an empty set of rows to operate on

977577
width	height
1 after changing the size of the frame by using the mouse and executing the drawframe method a rectangle is drawn as intended but the frame expands a little after drawframe method is executed more than the size it was changed using the mouse.this is because i suppose the width and the height obtained through frame.size includes even the border size.so when mycanvas.setsize width height is executed mycanvas expands to size of the frame which includes the border size also

977823
ironruby	ironpython
but what about ironpython and ironruby

977823
ironruby	ironpython
chris mentioned that f# learned a lot from ruby and python so i would think that f# has a similar relationship to ironruby ironpython and c# has to vb.net

977823
ironruby	ironpython
however a little googling around tells me that ironruby and ironpython are both built on the dlr but f# is not

977823
ironruby	ironpython
how are the relationships between f# ironruby and ironpython to be best understood

977839
ironruby	ironpython

977881
put	get
i can put in code in my build process to get other files but by then it is too late

977914
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream

978181
post	get
i could post the error i get back from the product.dll but i don t think it is relevant

978197
getter	setter
once all of that is saved you should be able to automatically generate setter as you have defined above using the generate getter and setter command

978201
int	double
the int division probably needs to be coerced into a floating point one cast one of the numbers to a double - or use the notation 23.0 to indicate that you want a floating point division

978207
int	double
in addition you can use a float double or real instead of a int

978210

978547
floating-point	fixed-point
2 my code works both in floating-point and fixed-point

978547
floating-point	fixed-point
right now these constants are initialized by a function float2fixed whereby in floating-point it does nothing while in fixed-point it finds their fixed-point representation

978547
floating-point	fixed-point
for instance 0.5f stays 0.5f if working in floating-point whereas it uses the pow routine and becomes 32768 if working in fixed-point and the fixed-point representation is qx.16

978613
min	max
here we ve passed two additional bits of state into min and max - but we can t define to know about that as that is a caller detail

978619

978708
fadein	hide
it looks like hide and fadein are being applied to not the

978729
free	malloc
this is also an improvement over traditional memory management malloc free or new delete which left it up to the operating system to manage any memory fragmentation

978885
width	height
adjust width height of iframe to fit with content in it

978945
passenger	thin
also with workling you don t have to use starling as the queue it also uses amqp stuff but this is more easily integrated into an environment that uses eventmachine like thin or evented mongrel so if you are using passenger it s a bit more difficult

979255
width	height
x 161 y 26 width 75 height 23 - button4 was scrolled to be entirely visible

979255
width	height
note how in addition to the width and height changes that the x y also changed with scrolling

979275
integer	fractions
the problem is the integer division in the innermost part of the expression which truncates the value omitting the fractions part

979275
multiplying	multiplication
since m_pi is a floating point number and multiplication in c is left-associative meaning it proceeds from left to right the first multiplication 2 m_pi will be promoted to a float as will each successive multiplying

979275
multiplying	add
to get the correct range you d want to add 1 then multiplying by 50

979281
width	height
it will accurately reflect the field s new height and if you change the field s width the height will immediately be updated etc

979342
firefox	safari
if your users are using bleeding-edge browsers and if firefox 3.5 and safari 4 support it i don t know that either do will you could adjust the css color-profile attribute of the image setting it to a grayscale icc profile url

979414
versioning	upgrade
when i upgrade to the latest versioning 143 the exact same code worked

979440
jobs	cron
that being said it may be more practical to use something like daemons to manage a background process that goes to sleep now and then than to rely on something like cron to kick off jobs

979445
firefox	safari
this works in firefox safari but not on ie

979460

979585
xmltype	clob
but if it is xml why store it in a blob rather than an xmltype or clob

so the data that will be processed is what is being acted upon in either case and the direction push pull it is moving is relative to the person triggering the processing

979617
getter	setter
i m following all of the necessary conventions for getter and setter as far as i know.

979852
bmp	png
if your original image is a bmp then converting it to png and then uuencoding the png file will result in a considerable shrinking in filesize

979881
ubuntu	linux
for this reason as well as that some gnu linux distributions ubuntu in my case still comes with python 2.6 i can t completely throw 2.x out the window yet

979893
mouseup	mousedown
have to use mousedown and mouseup to check if these two events happen on the same element

if it is not for high performance you can use an updatepanel otherwise you should just use the scriptmanager by yourself

979956
implements	extends
i ve noticed that on all the examples that illustrate the decorator pattern there is a base class interface and there is a decorator class that inherits implements it after which all the decorated classes extends the decorator class

renders perfectly in opera ie google-chrome but fails completely in firefox 3.1 and 3.5 beta 4

980058
webkit	gecko
i think the best way to do this for my requirement is to use a rendering engine - like webkit or gecko

980066
nunit	mstest
use nunit or mstest to achieve this functionality in a more graceful way

980100
inherited	properties
a process group is a properties just a number which you can set before forking and child processes then inherited it automatically

980151
put	get
if you re still worried about security you can get your own boxes and put them in a co-location facility but then you have to worry about administration security yourself

980235
spweb	spsite
the spfeaturereceiverproperties in the featureactivated override has the current spweb or spsite as spfeaturereceiverproperties.parent

980254
gtk	motif
jcolorchooser has a recent-color panel in some look feels motif but not in others gtk

980259
pascal	delphi
turbo pascal was one of the if not the main compilers of the dos era and delphi is still the second most sold ide in the world after visual studio so i think the dead language and teaching language bits are a bit exaggerated

980260
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
updated isn t declared in the headers for nsmanagedobject or nsobject so i guess it must be a private method

980319
equals	gethashcode
as several other answers have stated sorteddictionary doesn t override the default implementations of equals or gethashcode

980321
int	double
fenton a jet date field is an int value for the day plus a decimal value for the time -- no an ace jet datetime column is a float synonyms double float8 ieeedouble number with limits the maximum datetime value is #9999-12-31 23 59 59# though the maximum float value that can be cast to datetime will be a little larger

980328
equals	gethashcode
no this is not how the equals and gethashcode methods are implemented

980340
bash	tcsh
are your users have a correct shell bash tcsh etc.

980350
post	get
something the blog post doesn t mention once you ve set your project to use iis rather than webdevwebserver and set the override url s you sometimes have to do something extra to get debugging working

980371
findwindow	showwindow
in general terms you could call findwindow to get the hwnd of the window in question then showwindow with sw_hide to hide the window

980376
sorting	filtering
but my advanced search may include joining mytable with category table geographic_location table for searching within 10 20 miles etc filtering by someother criteria and of course sorting of search results

980398
xslt	xquery
if you do the above the parser will return you the ordered list without any further work and or you can process it more easily using standard xml tooling like xslt xquery etc

980513
children	parent
the parent partial view simply contains renderpartials for the children

980521
cpu	processors
with a single-core processors where all your threads are run from the one single cpu the idea of implementing a critical section using an atomic test-and-set operation on some mutex or semaphore or etc in memory seems straightforward enough

980566
pop-up	dialog
if it is a complex application with sub-panels lot of pop-up dialog menus mdi behavior with docking etc. it might be hard to impossible to port.

980679
punctuation	words

980693
int	boolean	tinyint	varchar	tinyint	boolean
id is int name varchar all other tinyint 1 boolean that is

980702
division	modulo
i think using a native modulo in c internally uses a division operation which is costly on the processor i am using. no div instruction

980718
for-loop	loops
this is just an example of where i am finding the problem txtfile.txt has 5 lines so the for-loop goes 5 times each time test gets +1 to it and the a displays the correct value of x but the last echo on the for-loop displays 0 which is what test is set to before loops

980718
folder	directory
here is what i want to accomplish as there may be an easier way i want to run a for-loop that findstr s all rtf s in a series of sub folder and copies them all to a all directory with a new name 1.rtf 2.rtf 3.rtf etc

980723
post	put
this doesn t work for me i would not expect a different behavior regarding use of culture if i post a value or put it in the querystring

980725
free	malloc
there are tools like electricfences that replace malloc and free and take advantage of the mmu but those are intended only for spot-checks .

980811
implements	extends
use it with implements and extends build a jar from your classes and import them into your spring project

980831
versioning	upgrade
there could be good reasons why these sites haven t upgrade -- such as compatibility with other plugins that don t work with newer versioning

980831
versioning	upgrade
either they can upgrade their page most likely since the older versioning is probably being used due to inertia or drop your plugin

980852
multiplication	modulo
since you want the modulo by a constant you can probably beat it by using reciprocal multiplication

980884
hide	show
then create an onchange event on the insuredsalicense2 listbox which hide the not important field and show the important one

980898
hide	show
on the following site i have used jquery on the menu to show and hide options projects and contact

visual c++ 2010 beta has some useful c++0x support - you can play with lambdas rvalue references auto decltype

980929
udp	tcp
as for a protocol you should use either tcp ip or udp depending on what you need to do

980929
udp	tcp
udp is great if you plan to have your client for the game account for missing information by using approximation most fps games do this as well as just about any game that requires very quick reflexes where tcp ip is simpler will greatly reduce errors in transmission and be more prone to lag

980932
post	get
from the quickbase guide there are two methods of hitting the api post and get

980932
post	get
i can handle the get calls but some api methods require xml to be sent over post

the test runs as expected in firefox and safari

980951
google-chrome	firefox

on many processors integer multiplication is faster than integer division

980962
division	multiplication
this blog post shows how to replace a constant integer division with a constant integer multiplication

clipspy unfortunately the only workable multi-format viewer clipspy shows me the string data wrapped every 10 characters and expands the hex and binary views which i m not concerned about

981198
google-chrome	safari
i have a weird issue that only occurs in safari and i can only assume google-chrome as well since they both use webkit

981198
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this works great in firefox ie 6 7 8 and opera but for some reason on safari windows and mac versions the add_endrequest ... does not always fire

981198
hide	show
this is a show stopper for me because not only does the processing request... message appear but i also put a transparent div on top of the entire page to prevent multiple clicks after submitting so the page becomes unusable unless you know how to hack the css to hide the transparent div

981235
children	parent
if you iterate through the parent itemcontrol s visual children recursively you shouldn t have any difficulty locating the text boxes you are seeing on screen

981273
children	parent
model nodes build a 1 n tree each component except the root has 1 parent and 1..n children

981273
children	parent
data flows almost exclusively from parent to children

981273
children	parent
parent nodes don t need much any information about their children

981281
organization	naming
it sounds like you re also facing apathy within your own organization if they are uncooperative about even naming the tool

981289
ilist	icollection
i believe that if you call linq.count on either an icollection or ilist like an arraylist or list then it will just return the count property s value

981300
groupbox	panel
using visual studio 2008 winform designer i have a container form panel groupbox whatever and some controls in it

981337
ienumerable	ilist
i would recomend returning objects or ienumerable ilist etc of objects

981366

981469
ssl	https
in practice you could use https ssl tls to protect your saml message

981535
put	get
this library differs from that built in to groovy however it looked very well written with some thought put into the kinds of things you want to mock and more importantly the error messages you would get when tests should fail

981548
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png	tiff	bmp	tiff	png
you can use every image format for icons that qt supports bmp gif jpg png tiff xpm ...

981562
put	get
what i mean is you can use an xml document for integration whether it is stored in a database or sent over a rest interface or stored in a filesystem or put get on a queue

981572
firefox	safari
i am looking for something that will work in the 3 main browsers ie firefox safari

981617

981704
ssl	https
i have a client program that talks to a web server through a ssl connection https

981741
post	get
in all honesty your example doesn t given enough data to determine which method post get would be appropriate for you

981741
post	get
suggested reading get versus post in terms of security

981750
trojan	virus
if the man-in-the-middle actually sits on the client computer think of a virus trojan or other malware they can read modify anything going on over that connection

981790
public	protected
you probably don t want to do that so instead you will need either to add public accessors or use the ones which are there already if any or else make them protected members of the base class of types specified by typedefs in the derived class or else have the derived class declare the base class a friend

981793
post	get
and yes both get and post data can be easily tampered so you obviously have to check for validity

981829
serializable	deserialization
i did find you cannot have objects with securestring properties unless you want to implement custom serializable deserialization for them

981857
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox google-chrome and ie

981888
hash	salt
if you wanted to store the passwords hash and salt for instance you d need to think through how to implement that in your scheme and you could make a mistake that would lead to a security problem

981964
user-controls	elementhost
this is where i m trying to hook in - the winforms user-controls that s currently getting loaded will have the elementhost

981964
user-controls	elementhost
winforms user-controls - contains the elementhost

981964
user-controls	elementhost
the elementhost has dock set to fill and its child property set to ucreport which is a wpf user-controls which has the following markup only top level design included

981964
user-controls	elementhost
when i view the winforms user-controls the one that has the elementhost in the designer the problem is apparent

981986
min	max
it also helps alleviate many of the issues caused by the sort operations required for aggregation operations such as min and max either with datatable.compute or linq

982000
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ported a widget i ve been using with actionscript 3 to javascript and it seems to be working fine with google-chrome safari but on firefox is throwing an exception

982035
hide	show
i can add some data that would make ie render the such as make it show a 1 pixel image which would enable the element in the dom but this would hide the fallback markup

982055
inherited	properties
inherited may be an option to make it more elegant - factoring out the shared properties into a base class

982064
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
paletted pngs with transparency are fine in ie6. most other browsers work correctly though including ie 7.0+ firefox safari google-chrome netscape opera epiphany konqueror.

982068
mxml	haxe	avm2	neko
you might want to take a look at haxe a high level language that targets many platforms as avm1 avm2 php c++ ectc. and neko a server vm available as compiler target for haxe as well as haxe remoting you can simply compile your haxe net-code to an swc and stick to as3 mxml for the rest .

982079
firefox	safari
firefox and safari rendered them differently

982145
width	height
you could write a javascript wto find the window height and width and make it to half to find the centre point

i have taken the approach of copying the ootb documentlibrary folder and files structure from the 12hive template feature directory changing some of the default files to make this a new customdocumentlibrary and wrapping the new files and folder up as a feature to be deployed with stsadm

982172
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
by using a compiler you can define variables loops add subtract multiplying etc

982185
sudo	passwd
sudo requires the passwd of the user running it

982185
sudo	passwd
if you use sudo it will cache credentials or can be configured to do so so you only get asked once for a passwd - but it will prompt the first time just like su does

982185
sudo	passwd
sudo is better in most respects but still requires a passwd which asroot does not

982194
hide	show
you can have controls appear or hide depending on the editmode of a page so what is show to the user is totally different but all the code for a page is still in one place

982224
haskell	scheme
does anyone know if f# is going to be something which ms is going to support going forward or would i be better of trying to convince the powers that be to go with scheme haskell et al

982236
width	height
i think you need to specify two more arguments to putimagedata width and height

982246
post	get
i just found this post which may help you get the proper configuration setup to handle what you need based on your iis environment

982263
getter	setter
the only solution i ve found is to have aimpl hold a bimpl instead of a b and have the getter return bimpl and the setter recieve bimpl

982267
post	get
limit to get head post debug uncheck check that file exists

982288
hash	md5
now you can encrypt the password easily with the hash module md5 and similar modules in python 2.5 and below

982326
integer	unsigned
rather than that approach and assuming that each of your version string elements is less than 255 you could just take each element as a byte in a 32 bit unsigned integer

go check out the component showcases of icefaces and richfaces two jsf ajax cable libraries

982437
richfaces	icefaces
my personal experience with both richfaces mixed better with other jsf libs icefaces has more advanced ajax capabilities like server sided push kinda like comet the basic ajax functionality is easier to set up and use but plays difficult sometimes when you mix it with other jsf libs

982446
mouse	keyboard
for example moving an analog stick on the gamepad to move the mouse and clicking certain buttons on the gamepad pressing keyboard keys or mouse clicks

982470
for-loop	loops
to be precise any for-loop without anything between the semicolons will loops forever until terminated by some other means because it has no defined invariant

982486
mouse	joystick
for example in java you can use jinput to read the joystick and then use jawa.awt.robot to move the mouse

982486
mouse	joystick
you may want to use some movement controls such as a quadratic gradient to speedup slowdown the mouse movements the longer the joystick is pushed in one direction for instance

982497
post	get
one of the possible solutions would be use the http request common module which exposes some useful functions like get post and header

982531
int	double
std numeric_limits float std numeric_limits double std numberic_limits int etc..

982537
photoshop	fireworks
to get the exact look you want your best bet is to jump in flash fireworks photoshop etc and tweak a button skin to your liking

982560
super	extends
if your dog extends animal you can create a constructor that takes an animal and initializes the super parent constructor

982569
versioning	upgrade
if you find a method that works the developers will likely classify it as a bug in the future and break your code when you upgrade to the next versioning

982605
for-loop	loops
i d recommend using a regular for-loop with a termination flag in loops invariant

982611

try-catch	exception-handling
i do have a try-catch block around the save operation and even though the exception-handling is caught jboss still continues with the rollback

982884
int	chars
you can use sprintf instead of printf to print into an array of chars and strftime to give a format string how similar to ddd dd mmm yyyy hh nn ss probably a d b y h m s and use the long int timezone global variable instead of localtimezone.bias

982886
jar	war
the application is put into a war file with the grails prod war command scp d to the server to be deployed on and extracted with jar -xvf path to war

982905
getter	setter
later i realized that there is no need to access private data of the other class hence no need for nested classe if the property getter and setter are designed carefully to avoid infinite indirect recursions

982905
children	parent
an item may have one parent and many children

982930

984212
base	fractions	havok	physx
so far from seeing physx as the obvious choice for high-end game development i d say it should be avoided unless either you don t think people with amd cards make up a significant fractions of your player base highly unlikely or you have enough coding and qa manpower to test two physics engines more plausible though if your company is that wealthy i ve heard good things about havok

986034
implements	extends
then when you define a visitor extends this abstract class instead of implements the interface directly

986034

first off i m not familiar with sync but a quick read of the overview suggests that your client will need to provide either a web service or rss feed in order for the sync runtime to obtain the data to be sync d from the java process

986314
rss	feed
if you are set on the client being the sync participant then take a look at jakarta commons which i think has the code you re need to turn you client into a simple web-server that ll be needed for it to act as a web-service or rss feed

986322

rss	feed
if you re not windows and can t use svn notifier as mark suggests i recommend updating an rss feed each time a commit occurs

987701
rss	feed
basically you can ask for an rss feed for any repository path file or directory and it is dynamically generated updated for you

987709
post	put
if you need additional columns for answers and questions respectively put them in additional tables with a one-to-one relationship with post

qcodo	qcubed
i have used qcodo qcubed for 1.5 years now

987741
qcodo	qcubed
i have used qcodo qcubed for 3-4 successful projects now

987753
cpu	processors
it could be the case that the timing mechanism you use references wall clock time in debug mode and cpu time which sums across all processors cores in use in release mode

987771
matplotlib	scipy
things like matplotlib scipy and numpy make python almost equivalent to matlab for these areas

987785
ienumerable	ilist
depending on what you want to do you might be able to cast the list to an ilist or ienumerable without generics and then iterate over the objects

987813
temp	tmp
if the program binary is writeable you could download the patch or the new bits to temp or tmp then apply them to the binary

987818
put	get
why not just manually increment a breaks count tracking variable when you actually perform the addition of a new break instead of having the system go and count it or get rid of the counting in the loop since you re not updating the display anyways during this process and put the counting of page breaks in to its own code segment that runs through the content at the end of the whole formatting process when a final number of page breaks can easily be determined with a single call

987831
accessor	properties
properties accessor accessibility

987833
wordpress	joomla	magento	joomla
we use magento or cubecart for ecommerce and wordpress or joomla for cms sites

i m personally pretty happy with menhir though it s a raging bitch and a half to get working with godi + ocamlbuild

987868
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
if you are using .net then i would start by trying to use svcutil.exe or wsdl.exe to generate a proxy class against their service interface

987888
uiview	calayer
the easiest way would be would be to have a uiimageview for the speedometer and use a calayer for the needle or the calayer of a uiview

987922
rdf	owl
owl in general is about entailments given a set of rdf not about validation especially with regards to structure

as an update a couple of the jmonkeyengine guys have forked that project to create ardor3d a new version of which was recently released so its still under active development

987935
disk	ram
they are more limited in size than filestreams because you generally have vastly more disk space than ram

987941
merb	ruby-on-rails
i advice you to check the book i linked if you re interested in more or check the alternatives of ruby-on-rails like merb which has some nice features and is usually faster but lacks the maturity of ruby-on-rails

988011
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
basically i want to do two way databinding of multiple controls textbox dropdownlistfor checkbox etc to a single instance of custom class entity ie person

988015
hide	show
if the list of options is not too big you could just render all the user controls statically and use javascript jquery to show hide the appropriate controls based on the value of the dropdown onchange js event

988031
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
if using strings just create string versions of add subtract and multiplying not too hard

988074
division	multiplication
power is just repeated multiplication and mod is related to division

988074
division	multiplication
we know that multiplication and division are inverses so through that connection i would assume there s a correlation between power and mod

988132
uitextview	uiresponder
since uitextview inherits from uiresponder indirectly it actually inherits from uiscrollview which inherits from uiview which then inherits from uiresponder you can call the -becomefirstresponder method on your text field which will cause it to become the first responder and begin editing

988146
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i can think of several techniques to make the uitextview become the first responder but the easiest is probably in your view controller s viewwillappear or viewdidappear methods

988202
implements	extends
there is an application django-simple-history which implements and extends this approach docs here

988221
feedback	review
when this pops out only on the system implementation you whether go back to review the domain or you discovered some fragility whose feedback could - and should - aggregate changes on related details of the business to make the domain richer and better modeled

988292
hide	show
you can use user.identity.isauthenticated to check if the user is logged in and show hide the login button based on that

988302
hide	show
and i wonder about the wisdom of hide show i expect this to just make the ui flicker

988337
x86	mips
i need to run an nfsclient on a mips target machine and nfsserver on an x86 machine

988354
outputstream	inputstream	getter	setter
if however you want to add content to the fileobject and not mere attributes you will have to do it the normal java-way of using the inputstream and outputstream of the fileobject both have a getter and setter and remember to close the streams accordingly

988357
put	get
one way would be to put a dummy file in that folder dummy.txt and do an http get of the file

988362
translation	localization
the only catch here is that if you want to assign the localization to a global variable you have to run it async false otherwise you won t have the translation available when you need them

988362
post	get
t return dictionary of string string via get ajax web request works with post

988366

fgets	fgetc	fgets	fseek	fseek	fgetc
at the end of a line i then run a procedure that consists of opening file b using fgets fseek and fgetc to grab characters from that file

988444
free	malloc
is there a significant performance hit from using malloc and free such that i should use something static like instead of a dynamic

988505
free	malloc
worrying about malloc free performance before profiling indicates that it is a bottleneck is premature optimization

988505
fseek	ftell
and yes you can use ftell to get the current position in a file then fseek with seek_set to get to that

988576
performselector	delegation
then you can use delegation performselector okbuttonaction

988577
post	get

ncover	ndepend
run my unit tests reset a database deploy some code send out some emails do some code analysis ndepend and ncover are great

988588
integer	unsigned
i was reading the c standard the other day and noticed that unlike signed integer overflow which is undefined unsigned integer overflow is well defined

988605
integer	unsigned
one way where i could think of unsigned integer overflow causing a problem is when subtracting from a small unsigned value resulting in it wrapping to a large positive value

988611
base	fractions
you should be aware that all information in computers is in binary and the expansions of fractions in different base vary

988611
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	subtract	multiplication	exponent
floating point multiplication consists of re-adding the hidden 1 to both mantissas multiplying the two mantissa subtract the offset from the two exponent and then adding th two exponent together

988613
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer overflow in the shape of wrap-around is routinely taken advantage of in hashing functions and has been since the year dot

988625
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
the key point of that article is to bind the collectionviewsource to an ilist implementation rather than a weaker icollection or ienumerable interface

988654
integer	fractions	fixed-point	fractions
this data type uses a 16-bit signed integer and a 16-bit fractions to represent fixed-point decimal numbers.

988694
profiling	debugging
as client-side libraries become more and more robust and more responsibility is placed client-side in general this type of debugging and profiling will only become more useful

988714
integer	unsigned
it is perfectly legal ok safe to use unsigned integer overflow as you see fit as long as you pay attention and adhere to the definition for whatever purpose - optimization super clever algorithms etc.

988758
postgresql	mysql
afaik ms access is a database and you can connect to it through odbc etc but it is not a database server in the way sqlserver mysql postgresql or oracle are database servers

988761

maven	pom.xml
when maven gets the libraries you need as you express them in the pom.xml file of your project the jar names include the version number

988831
put	get
then your lques action can just get what lques records you need and do a options_for_select and it should just put what comes back from the server as

988851
opera	safari
ps opera safari

note there is a previous post on this 672083 but its more on when to use it which kind of helps me get it a bit more but i want valid my thoughts on the patterns themselves

988991
inherited	subclassing
if your subclassing does not follow the liskov substituion principle it shouldn t be a subclassing an inherited relationship is not appropriate and you should choose some other design

988991
superclass	subclassing
you can always invoke the superclass method implementations with from within your subclassing

988993
put	get
now i m reading about how important it is to put some good thought into 2.0 deployment and the the more i read the more i get confused

fadein	fadeout	mouseleave	mouseenter
i m using the mouseenter mouseleave event to fadein fadeout respectively

989036
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	show	hide	fadeout

mouse	keyboard
if i open the dropdown and select an option with my mouse or keyboard and hit enter the dropdown box closes and the itemindex property is changed before the keypress event handler is fired

989411
expander	togglebutton
looking at the expander through mole or looking at it s controltemplate generated by blend we can see that the header part that is responding to space enter click etc is really a togglebutton

989411
expander	togglebutton
now the bad news because the header s togglebutton has a diffrent layout for the expander s expanded properties up down left right it s already has styles assigned to it through the expander s controltemplate

989411
expander	togglebutton
that precludes us from doing something simple like creating a default togglebutton style in the expander s resources

989411
expander	togglebutton
if you have access to the code behind or don t mind adding a codebehind to the resource dictionary that the expander is in then you can access the togglebutton and set the tabindex in the expander.loaded event like this

989433
iboutlet	ibaction
the two most important things you need to know when dealing with ib are the iboutlet and ibaction keywords

989439

is there a way to know when the dismissmodalviewcontrolleranimated is initiated and when it is completed such as the idiom for viewwillappear and viewdidappear

989706
spaces	delimiter
split the game name using a spaces delimiter

989732
int	double
the only other differences are that where there s a numeric in the function definition the error line shows various types like int double precision and bigint

989734
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
when dismissmodalviewcontrolleranimated is called the underlying view the one about to appear will receive a viewwillappear message and a viewdidappear message

989738
put	get
i can t find anything that tells me what settings to use to get the build process to copy the headers into headers directory in the framework or alternately where i have to put those files

989767
jax-ws	saaj
actually cxf does not use javax.xml.soap saaj underneath unless its required to do so jax-ws handlers are present provider type things etc....

post	get
imagine you have a site api that accepts data in the form of get requests with parameters or as post requests say with standard url-encoded -separated post data

989967
post	get
is there a simple way to get the post data in the apache log as well

990021
post	put
one concern is that post data can be pretty large and if you don t put some kind of limit on how much is being logged you might run out of disk space after a while

990038
int	double
otherwise you d have to pass string after int after double after string between your presentation and business layers

ncover	ndepend
nunit ncover ndepend and ndoc allow me to do deep analysis and reporting on my code base with each build done with each check in

990096
cruisecontrol	jenkins
i have not tried integrating with cruisecontrol or hudson jenkins but in implementing continuous integration via other means i ve encountered these issues

990102
cpu	affinity
so since the gil limits us to basically executing a python program on one cpu my thought is why not accept this and simply use taskset on linux to set the affinity of the program to a certain core cpu on the system especially in a situation with multiple python apps running on a multi-core system

990179
firefox	safari
sometimes it works in firefox but not in safari

990215

990270
superclass	subclassing
if you have access to a compiled class animal.class in your example then you can recompile a subclassing dog.java you don t however need to have access to the source code of the superclass

990270
superclass	subclassing
if you don t even have access to the compiled superclass then if you know the relevant methods those which are implemented or called from the subclassing then you can create a stub of the superclass just to get the subclassing to compile

990285
wan	lan
that volume is not a problem for access so long as it s on a stable lan or very high speed wan

990347

- there are rumors already that opera might do that and i think i ve seen a google-chrome plugin that enables webslices

990435
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
it might not sound like much of a problem for a single developer but if you try to upgrade nunit one project at a time you ll see how much nicer it is to be able to checkout the trunk of your project and know that you ve got the right versioning of nunit along with it rather than then having to uninstall nunit and reinstall the right versioning

990519
width	height
height + math.ceil linelength width

990522
versioning	upgrade
i am planning start my iphone development and i have a imac with tiger 10.4 os versioning planning to upgrade to leopard 10.5.6 os x but i heard apple going to release the snow leopard in september will development environment shift to snow leopard instead of leopard and leopard 10.5.7 no longer be used to development

990624
datamapper	activerecord
apart from the key there are numerous storage facilities you might use like yaml or you can actually build a complete activerecord datamapper etc

990655
free	malloc
then you can malloc and free the data items while passing references pointers to them between your threads via the array

990762
client-side	server-side
you have to consider both server-side rails or whatever and client-side javascript

990780
innodb	myisam
i heard myisam is faster but others say innodb can be fast also but it takes abit more to optimize it

990789
union	distinct
by using union which does an implicit distinct to become

990790
getattr	setattr
you can do this with the reflection-like hasattr getattr and setattr

also importantly i do not know all the hash keys in advance that is i do not know width height or depth -- they could be cats dogs and hamsters

990826
realloc	malloc
with one exception it is not true for local variables or for data allocated with malloc or realloc

990830
innodb	myisam
innodb is slower for read only databases because it has features acid compliant row level locking that myisam leaves out

do you mean your sub-classed implementation is not called when touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended are called

990925
vim	emacs
i hate to say it being an avid vim user but emacs supports wiki markup

990960
implements	extends
instead of extends something like a mouseinputadapter which can be annoying since java is also single-inheritance or implements a lot of pointless empty methods you can adopt a protocol and implements only the optional methods you care about

990964
prototypejs	mootools
i choose to use jquery as our default ui library precisely because it does not extend or otherwise monkeypatch native objects unlike prototypejs or mootools

991002
int	chars
accessing variables such int or pointers as chars or unsigned chars in not a problem from a portability view

991020
git-cherry-pick	dcommit
if this is the problem you have at the moment you can probably create create a new branch from the point you last updated from svn and then use git-cherry-pick to transfer your simple bug fixes to this new branch from which you can then dcommit to svn

991053
division	modulo
the modulo gives the remainder after integer division

991162
g++	gcc
note comeau and gcc g++ 4.0 give an error with the code above

it comes down to the image you want to repeat it s height width in relation to the sprite it exists on the direction you want to repeat it and the size of the container you want it to repeat in

991364
cifs	smb
if you need to have it accross machines then i assume samba would use inotify to get notified and convert that to smb cifs events but i m not familiar with that

991366
exponent	modulo
i don t know what it is but i expect them to be modulo d exponent

991366
exponent	modulo
when i create an rsaparameters and assign the 3 byte arrays to modulo d exponent and try to use that rsaparameters in rsacryptoserviceprovider.importparameters decryption fails stating corrupt keys

991366
exponent	modulo
i don t have that values is there an easy way to decrypt a byte array using only modulo d exponent in c# as in other languages

991371
opera	firefox
according to w3schools the .form property of input fields is supported by ie 4.0+ firefox 1.0+ opera 9.0+ which is even more browsers that jquery guarantees so you should stick to this

991385
getter	setter
as i am sure you already know the c# compiler in vs 2008 will automatically generate getter and setter for properties when compiling

991390
width	height
you can also use the lazy method provided by bufferedimage s superclass image getscaledinstance - using -1 for either width or height will maintain aspect ratio

991426
rss	feed
also if the links you are trying to remove are navigation rss feed etc you can use phpquery to return only a particular portion of the externalpage meaning you would no longer have to remove the links that are not within the portion you want

991482
svg	vml
i found that any other solution svg vml flash image tags was simply too slow and hard to operate

991534
updatepanel	scriptmanager
if ajax is available and partial post backs are enabled the post back call should be intercepted by the scriptmanager and the updatepanel should be updated properly

991573
bufferedreader	fileoutputstream
i don t know bufferedreader and fileoutputstream to be incompatible

991591
post	get
append the array index value within square brackets to the post get variable name for array

this is the test js i used again this uses post method not get

991611
metaclass	subclassing
it isn t possible to create a subclassing because appengine and django have different database models with their own metaclass magic

991615
width	height
well you must have a maximum height and width lets assume the image size you have available is square say 100x100

991615
width	height
when a user uploads an image get the dimensions of it then work out which is greater the height or the width

991615
width	height
then take the greatest measurement and get the ratio of that measurement to your target measurement then use that ratio to scale both the height and width

991615
width	height
so if the user uploads a picture of 500 height and 450 width as the height is greatest you d divide 100 by 500 your thumbnail size

991764
hide	show
is there a way to hide the window title so that it won t get show in fullscreen mode

991777
getter	setter
i know that when netbeans automatically creates getter and setter it uses number 2 method

991825
uiview	subviews
solution created a container uiview object which now contains the uiimageview and the button so that the button appears as overlayed on the image but it is actually a sibling of the image and a subviews of the dummy container uiview

vim	emacs	vim	kate	vim	notepad++	emacs	kate
i m looking for something intuitive and easy to use like kate notepad++ and not emacs or vim

991991
datamapper	activerecord
i think you can use mysql and use the berkeleydb storage engine and use activerecord or datamapper as usual

992006
resx	baml
specifically this is for wpf and combining resx and baml resources

992030
width	height

setcontentview	findviewbyid
i can then turn the full screen capability off and on using the following code in my activity class usually called from a menu option the m_contentview variable is the view from findviewbyid using the id that you used when calling setcontentview in your on create

992060
hide	show
well if you are trying to dynamically show and hide it during the lifetime of the activity i am not sure if you can do that with the official window title due to the note that has been mentioned about window features needing to be set before setcontentview is called link

992060
hide	show
one thing that you could do is implement your own title bar and dynamically show and hide that.

992060
hide	show
my other thought is if you just want to hide everything to show a progress bar why not use the progressdialog

992079
post	get
btw could you post the table schemas for all tables involved and exactly what output or reasonable representation you d expect to get

992132

so why don t any of these change the width height of my imageview

992132
post	get
i found another post on here that basically states i have to right a small book of code to get it resize my image.

992146
uiview	uiwindow
the uiview has to be contained within a uiwindow to be visible during simulate interface mode

992161
division	addition
in my example above if you only did 2 + 5 + 3 3 the program would do division operations before addition - so it would evaulate to 2 + 5 + 3 3 or 2 + 5 + 1 7

getter	setter
ides such as eclipse and netbeans will automatically write the getter and setter in the above format

992232
boost	stl
boost enjoys a near stl status due to the number of people on the c++ standards committee who are also boost developers

992252
wordpress	joomla
normally this translation is done by joomla wordpress itself and it only works as long the how_to_get_the_ladies text is known and unique throughout the system database

992261
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i believe you need access to the httpd.conf or vhost configuration file though rewritemaps or some related directive cannot be put in .htaccess files

when subversion changes the working copy versioning in a release such as 1.5.x - 1.6.x any 1.5.x working copy is silently upgrade to the 1.6.x format as soon as it is touched by a 1.6.x client

992335
boost	stl
as rdbound said boost has a near stl status

992367
nsurl	nsstring
look at the stringwithcontentsofurl encoding error method of nsstring - it lets you pass in a url as an instance of nsurl which can easily be instantiated from nsstring and returns a string with the complete contents of the page at that url

992410
resx	baml
you have to manually do this generating .resources from locbaml and then merging the resx and baml resources using the assembly linker

992412
serializable	deserialization
theoretically and yes this is a terrible idea you could catch serializable exceptions and parse the error for the older version details of course current deserialization will work without throwing .

992412
serializable	deserialization
basically bindtotype is being given the opportunity by the deserialization process to substitute a known type for the one originally used to serializable that object

992455
nsview	nsoutlineview
remember that nsoutlineview has a fairly long object tree - it inherits from nstableview which inherits from nscontrol which inherits from nsview which inherits from nsresponder which inherits from nsobject and there are various helper methods that exist in each of these classes which can often help you achieve what you want

992455
inherited	subclassing
the easiest way to create the shell of your subclassing would be to select then choosing objective-c class as you would with any other class which will create a new class with header and implementation files that inherited from nsobject

992455
nsview	nsoutlineview
since you are creating a subclass you can change the default implementation of any method up the object tree - that is you can override methods declared in nsoutlineview nstableview nscontrol nsview nsresponder and nsobject although you should rarely override methods declared in nsobject

992502
hide	show
similarly if i scroll past the top to fully hide the bottom most cell and it rubber bands back to show that cell it will crash before showing it

min	max
keeping track of min max of your data should allow you to know a

992557
oncreate	ondestroy
it is a local variable in oncreate but it is not declared in ondestroy at all

992577
sorting	filtering
if you implement some kind of filtering sorting paging or worst searching then you might at some point miss the quereing capabilities of sql

992599
debian	linux
on a debian system and probably other linux distros you could do this

992653
getter	setter
in eclipse you can create the getter and setter for a field with ctrl-1 when the cursor is located on the field in question

992663
button	checkbox
client side has few trackbars checkbox button and picturebox

992787

993059
aggregate-functions	sum
one of the nice things relational databases support are the aggregate-functions like count sum avg etc

993062
int	double
you ll note two extra complexities here first it s actually a function type not just a simple alias and second that it s parameterized plotdatagen is a type constructor that i apply to another type to create a new type such as plotdatagen int double

993069
queue	fifo
as the queue is a fifo fifo data structure this ordering is typical

993121
getter	setter
is the only way to add properties to a control via a getter setter type approach

993140
children	parent
i would like each parent page to show its immediate children fruits page shows apples oranges and all other fruit

if you re worried about cluttering the gui you can have an advanced search view or a toggle to show hide the filters

993160
rank	max
child records will always have monotonically increasing rank from 0 to max rank for a given parent

993180
getter	setter
after a deep analysis and compare i have see that the il contents is exacly the same but all the classes and methods property getter and setter etc

993180
hex	binary
so if i compare the two assemblies with and hex editor comparer i see a completely different binary body

993209
put	get
your best bet is to use something like firefox firebug to get access to the css source copy and modify the css to do what you need it to do then put it in your local site and maintain it there from then on

993220
int	boolean
my version set all strings as the name of the field setname would be called with name then set all int as 1 boolean to true etc

993229
fgets	fread
your php code should use fgets and not fread

993238
mouse	keyboard
would you also pop that same menu on focus when the focus changes as a result of the keyboard the tab key instead of a result of the mouse a click

993238
mouse	keyboard
incidentally the css-based popup menus that i ve seen respond to the mouse but not to the keyboard to the up and down arrow keys

993242
nant	cruisecontrol
most of the team is already convinced by the idea of svn cruisecontrol nant and atlassian yes atlassian is indispensable excluding me

bazaar	git
now that repositories for git and mercurial have been mentioned launchpad s the equivalent for bazaar

993319
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba

993354
fadein	fadeout
i searched here and found a similar problem with fadein and fadeout .

993354
fadein	fadeout
and is it the same fix for pulsate as with fadein and fadeout etc..

993354
fadein	fadeout
i must admit i don t seem to get the issue with fadein and fadeout

993375
inherited	subclassing
i also wanted to pass along a tidbit i learned that can bite you down the road +initialize is inherited by subclassing and is also called for each subclassing that doesn t implement an +initialize of their own

993439
profiling	benchmarking
have you profiled with a good systems profiling like the free windows performance toolkit to see what is going on in your benchmarking

993439
profiling	benchmarking
these kind of benchmarking can be a lot of fun to write and profiling don t let a few false starts get in the way of digging in and looking for speedups

993471
accessor	properties
you d have to specify the properties names as strings so that the framework could look up properties accessor using reflection or java bean introspection

993512
hex	binary
things i want to do include presenting arbitrary chunks of the data in various forms binary decimal hex convert data from one endianess to another etc

993590
free	malloc
i know i should release memory - the golden each malloc free or each new delete rules exist now in my world but i m using them to rather simple objects

993597
width	height
if you want to stick with div s you can do that easily by setting specific width height values for each parent cube and the child cubs and simply floating them left right

993597
width	height
just be sure to use the clear fix to keep the content from flowing past their sibling tags if you decide not to use explicit width height values

993649
mouseover	mouseout
jquery doesn t add a hover tag it merely provides handlers for javascript s hover event iirc it s actually an abstraction of mouseover mouseout

993700
strtol	strtod
it seems that strtol and strtod effectively allow and force you to cast away constness in a string

993749
nunit	moq
here is the excerpt from the test nunit moq that is giving me problems

993768
daemons	systemd
if you want to do something like this i would advise you write a systemd daemons that applications can use as a copy store and access through systemd ipc such as dbus

993771
folder	directory
these structured namespaces correspond to the folder directory structures in which the source code and the projects are contained

993816
filesystems	ntfs
the open-source project ntfs-3g for ntfs driver on unix platforms has developed a posix filesystems test suite to check the posix compliance of different filesystems on these platforms with more than 3000 regression tests for different commands

993817
superclass	subclassing
i m not sure about it here but if initwithstyle allready calls init in the superclass when you override init in the subclassing and call the super you might have a loop on your hands

993823
for-loop	arrays
for example if you had a vector of pointers to stl strings or c-style character arrays put that into a stringcontainer use a better name and have the stringcontainer hold a vector and in the stringcontainer destructor run a for-loop to delete each string in the vector

993823
public	protected
you can make the vector inside the stringcontainer a public member and mess around with it directly but it s even better design to make it private or protected and add some member functions to manage the string vector

993833
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	solaris	solaris	netbsd

- represents a single row with getter and setter

993862
width	height
fade works by changing the opacity of an element and blind i think by changing the width height

993887
triples	tdb
i assume you re asking about persistence of triples and possibly graphs via quads where the storage is either a native triple store for example tdb or a relational database with a triple store overlay like sdb

993893
udp	tcp
one problem with it is that all the traffic is udp which makes the connections unreliable so you need to implement your own version of tcp over it if you need reliability

993955
maven	pom.xml
should i just require each user to put the information in settings.xml file that disables using the snapshots or releases from the maven repository or should this be in a pom.xml file

993955
maven	pom.xml
if it s in the pom.xml how will maven know to go to the repository since it needs to already know where the repository is to get the pom.xml

994000
vsto	add-in
this functionality was removed in later versions 2003 and 2007 with the advent of the vsto software although obviously you could still create com add-in in a similar fashion without the use of vsto or vs.net by using vb6 ide

994038
width	height
you can assume that width is constant 150px and height can vary between 150px and 300px

994057
opera	firefox
update this code works and is tested in opera 9.51 firefox 3.0 and ie7

994065
children	parent
here main waits on parent but since parent s children were indeed created as detached that does not make main implicitly wait on the children as well so main and therefore the whole process can and often will terminate before some child task has had a chance to run

994071
disk	ram
long answer you can use a ram disk as a hack

994073
clang	llvm
the llvm developers are trying to compile it with clang

strtol	strtod
c++ doesn t mention similar overloads for strtol and strtod and indeed my compiler gcc doesn t have them

994245
public	protected
where you might forget to public after the protected methods

994254
onfocus	onblur
using onfocus onblur works in firefox but not in ie6 or ie7

994272
postorder	inorder
you would do a parallel tree traversal - choose your order pre-order postorder inorder

994297
integer	unsigned
i assume you mean size_t -- this is a way of indicating an unsigned integer an integer that can only be positive never negative -- it makes sense for containers sizes since you can t have an array with a size of -7

994301
integer	unsigned
the type size_t can be defined as the largest unsigned integer on that platform

994301
integer	unsigned
for example it might be defined as a 32 bit integer or a 64 bit integer or something else altogether that s capable of storing unsigned values of a great length

994328
public	protected
in this class all methods are public except bar_protected and bar_private which are declared protected and private at the end

javascript 1.5 does have getter setter syntactic sugar

994351
perforce	svn
when something gets committed we use perforce but this would work for svn a cronjob on one of our build boxes notices that there s a more recent change than is build fires of an http request to download the source tree and starts building with gmake mostly

994357
integer	unsigned
the return type of sizeof is size_t and it is an unsigned integer

994357
int	chars
size_t is not included in the list of fundamental int types so i have always assumed that size_t is a type alias for one of the fundamental types chars short int int and long int

994429
doc	odf
now i thought i would try one of my scripts run a graphical diff for odf doc on windows

994429

994647
floating-point	integer
if you just want a fast integer log 2 operation the following function mylog2 will do it without having to worry about floating-point accuracy

994647
integer	unsigned
it will return uint_max for an input value of 0 as an indication of an undefined result so that s something you should check for no valid unsigned integer will have a logarithm that high

994690
width	height
flex builder defaults some components to fit to content if you don t specify a set width or height

994709
integer	unsigned
if you are on a recent-ish x86 or x86-64 platform and you probably are use the bsr instruction which will return the position of the highest set bit in an unsigned integer

994717
inherited	properties
you get an ambiguousmatchexception if a two or more properties with the differing return types and the same name live in your inherited chain

995259
getter	setter
what s the point of having getter and setter

995293

995587
folder	directory
if we look at the .folderdata folder inside the code directory

995636
bazaar	git
the recent historical popularity of subversion is clearly reflected by the number of questions indicating at least a small tipping of the scales towards git over the mercurial or bazaar

995636
bazaar	git
obviously only two-data points aren t enough to show a trend but it looks like git and subversion are largely entrenched mercurial has seen a lot of growth and bazaar has remained relatively quiet

profiling	debugging
i personally do development testing on jailbroken devices i find that it is nice for profiling debugging with all the unix tools available as well as testing out code for checking for tampered plist files

996052
haskell	ocaml
i would just use ocaml but haskell s syntax is so much better than ocaml s and haskell is pure and has cool features such as type classes

996093
getter	setter
i want eclipse to automatically generate javadoc comments for my getter and setter methods based on the previously defined comments for the fields

996093
getter	setter
so i have to do redundant work by describing the fields and describing the getter setter again

996152
selecteditem	selectedindex
one option would be to change the binding from selectedindex to selecteditem

996158
kde	gnome
is there any way to change the font size of terminal window gnome or kde from inside a shell script

996179
getter	setter
why getter and setter methods are evil

996179
getter	setter
java are getter and setter evil

996179
getter	setter
is it really that wrong not using setter and getter

996179
accessor	properties
should you use accessor properties from within the class or just from outside of the class

996213
getter	setter
getter and setter methods are put in place to control access to a class members

996213
getter	setter
getter and setter methods that just look a little prettier

996213
getter	setter
getter and setter can be useful for variables that you specifically want to encapsulate but you don t have to use them for all variables

996218
getter	setter
getter and setter can be useful for variables that you specifically want to encapsulate but you don t have to use them for all variables

996218
getter	setter
the trouble programmers have and allen holub was right in pointing it out is that they sometimes use getter setter for all variables

996224
getter	setter
getter and setter are used as little more than a mask to make a private variable public

996264
awt	swing
i ve written the ui layer in terms of awt abstract window toolkit or swing which are both abstraction layers

996310
floating-point	integer
convert the integer index into a floating-point number of sufficient precision

996320
csc	vbc
you could use vbc or csc from the .net framework they re shipped as part of the framework not sure about the new 3.5 client stuff

996351
post	get
to get the exact formatting you specified at the top of this post you could call it something like this

996364
passenger	webrick
it works fine when started with ruby script server webrick -e production however i m having trouble getting it working in apache with passenger

996375
getter	setter
holub is pushing the point that getter and setter are an evil default antipattern a bad habit that we slip into when designing a system

996375
getter	setter
getter and setter are usually a cop-out when the programmer is just to lazy to do the analysis required to determine exactly what each class is and is-not and so we go down the path of it can do anything

996375
getter	setter
getter and setter are evil

996375
getter	setter
that s cool just cop-out and use getter setter antipattern for now but when you do know through experience what the class is being used for you ll probably want to comeback and cleanup the dirty low level interface

996375
getter	setter
getter and setter are an easy trap to fall into

996375
getter	setter
yes beans basically require getter and setter but to me a bean is a special case

996375
getter	setter
getter and setter have their

996376
spaces	delimiter
these delimiter will only need to match if there is no character between the delimiter not even spaces

996415
ant	maven
the java secure channel jsch is a very popular library used by maven ant and eclipse

996449
memcached	apc
query caching almost always translates to memcached sometimes to apc shared memory

996495
hash	md5
assume i have two strings or byte arrays a and b which both have the same hash with hash i mean things like md5 or sha1

996495
hash	md5
i tested it with md5 and in all my tests appending something to the end made the hash the same but appending at the beginning did not

996505
put	get
efficient amortized o 1 get put delete

996515
width	height
meaning each cell is the same height and width as the table

996548
postgresql	mysql
perhaps even a free one like postgresql or mysql

996554
actionscript	mxml
the reasonong behind this is that mxml is actually translated into actionscript and then compiled

996575
free	malloc
one lab that i did enjoy and found useful however was writing our own malloc free routines

996576
queue	fifo
if efficiency is being asked for in the question then a non-recursive solution is best and done using a fifo list a queue in c# parlance - i m not a c programmer

996656
getter	setter
as corletk points out there is wisdom in thinking long and hard about the highest level of abstraction and not just programming thoughtlessly with getter setter that just let you do an end-run around encapsulation

996690
width	height
template files where each property has a variable to swap with string interpolation ex mx hrule height hruleheight width hrulewidth

996789
getter	setter
getter and setter make sense when they reflect some sort of coherent idea

996789
getter	setter
it probably makes sense to have getter and it likely makes sense to have setter

996789
getter	setter
there are some advantages of getter and setter over public variables

996789
getter	setter
so i d say to use private variables almost exclusively getter and setter where they have a real meaning in object behavior and not otherwise

996789
getter	setter
just because getter and setter are frequently overused doesn t mean they re useless

996791
versioning	upgrade
one was recently upgrade to use the 1.0 versioning and one is stuck on an earlier preview versioning

996797
persistent	transient
if i just pass the exception back up the stack or don t do this rollback then i will hit an error when i do try to save the other data null or transient object passed to persistent as the bookinglines are already persistent

996803
public	protected
use public private or protected instead

996807
google-chrome	firefox
of course firefox has huge market share and the up and coming google-chrome etc crowd

996848
for-loop	arrays
the next problem i am running into is that i cannot perform the for-loop easily after converting the byte arrays into uint32 or long

996873
hash	md5
using a hash function like md5 is probably overkill for random error detection

996909
integer	unsigned
the syntax to change the value of group_concat_max_len at runtime is as follows where val is an unsigned integer

997007
folder	directory
is it possible to have both of these blog share a common theme directory so that i only need to modify one template folder

997030
octal	decimal
0 means use the usual rules no prefix is decimal 0 prefix is octal and 0x is hexa -- just like eval

997070
opensuse	linux
i tested this manually rm and mkdir on my opensuse linux installation and the soft link was still fine after recreating the directory structure

997105
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to make this work in firefox ie and google-chrome

997108
hash	md5
the hash functions being discussed here are typically cryptographic sha1 md5

997108
hash	md5
are you saying that you located two inputs which had the same md5 hash and then appended something to the end or beginning of the input and found that adding at the end resulted in the same md5 as that for the original input

997135
sorting	filtering
this all works fine with sorting and filtering on the gridview but when iâ m paging it the grid pages like it should but the paging template always stays on the first page show 1 as active

997141
post	get
unfortunately i don t have the exact error text with me something about not being able to figure out which overloaded function to use at the moment or the specific version of g++ the latest being distributed with ubuntu but i ll update this post when i get that

997147
klocwork	coverity
assuming you can t use dynamic memory checkers like the open-source valgrind tool on linux static analysis tools like the commercial products coverity prevent and klocwork insight may be of use

997238
pdfbox	itextsharp
since i m a .net guy i ve taken a look at both pdfbox and itextsharp

997279
folder	directory
to make this more general and allow copying folder not in the root directory i would do something like this

997309
hash	md5
the algorithm message digest 5 or md5 it is a one-way cryptographic hash function

997309
hash	md5
md5 performs many binary operations on the message binary data for example of an iso image to compute a 128-bit hash

997309
hash	md5
it is useful to check the integrity of a downloaded package such as ubuntu because generating the md5 hash will be identical if the package is exactly the same as the authenticated source

997327
moose	mason
i would suggest looking at perltidy mason catalyst template-toolkit2 moose dbi and poe as relevant keywords to start searching once you learn the basics of the language

997333
post	get
in particular if you get an exception then post the complete exception including stack traces and innerexception instances

997361

in my experience in school is that quicksort and mergesort are the other two basic sorting algorithms introduced with or shortly after bubble sort

997362
z3c.form	dexterity	z3c.form	archetypes	archetypes	dexterity
nobody can say what you must use archetypes formlib z3c.form or dexterity

997383
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
however if you want to modify the method dispatch for a single instance i think your only option is a conditional statement within your viewdidappear method or to consider a redesign that does not require separate methods on first and subsequent appearances from your description separating your code into viewdidload and viewwillappear functions seems to make sense

997384
cpu	processors
instead it reads that location and a bunch of nearby locations into a processors cache that lives on the cpu and can be accessed much more quickly than main memory

997423
vsto	add-in
vsto may also be a way to go if you design an add-in that added a toolbar to the inspector mail window that inserted your url to your secure service say via small winform that looked up that patient by name id etc

997442
viewdidload	viewwillappear
it s almost certainly over-clever and should probably be separated into viewdidload and viewwillappear rather than two versions of viewwillappear

997473
mbunit	nunit
but i think nunit mbunit and xunit.net all support transactional tests out of the box or with a contrib project

997480
centos	linux
centos linux and mac os x report the limit as being 128

997549

with mvp every view has a presenter that does the view s job

997650
mvvm	delegatecommand
i will replace the events with commands using the delegatecommand eliminate the views references on the view-model and i think that s all because the examples that i saw of mvvm is much like mvp

997659
ethernet	wireless
for network failures nothing beats first unplugging your computers ethernet cable or d c it s wireless and then unplugging whatever cable gives you access to the cloud

997725
rss	feed
one screen could be an aggregated rss feed of development topics pulled from sites such as stack overflow or even coding horror

997736
internationalization	translation
another thing is even if the standard right now is that the app will only be released in english you are also blocking the possibility of internationalization with ascii adding to the work that needs to be done when the company policy decides that translation are a good thing

997811
apache	nginx
i am working on adding some nagios alerts to our system -- some of which will monitoring the rate of certain events hitting the nginx apache logs or parsing values from those logs. the way i ve approached the problem so far is with a simple shell script tail -f ing the log for 25 seconds or so to a temporary file killing the process and then running awk etc over the temp file

997888
post	put
you will need either a server script that accepts the xml document sent using a post request or for the server to support put request to replace the original xml url

997906
inherited	properties
note i do not want to inherited and extend each control i want to have this properties available on

997931

capitalize	capitalization
as for capitalization capitalize the first letter

998016
pascal	delphi
cardinal and longword didn t exist in delphi s and turbo pascal s 16-bit days

998016
16-bit	64bit
the longint and longword types will become 64bit types because they have always been the same size as the pointer type which was 32 bits even in 16-bit times

998025
ramaze	camping
the three i like are sinatra ramaze or _why s 4k camping get the one with the bugs fixed

this may appear a bit convoluted but it can be adapted in a number of directions and should work in at least ie firefox google-chrome and probably safari and opera.

998113
int	double
the value property is an object so i can be set to string int double etc

998132
mp3	wav
in my c# application i need to play multiple audio files wav and mp3 one after the other

998143
r-tree	quadtree
the simplest sturcture is the grid index then the different search trees kd-tree quadtree with r-tree as the most frequently used a generalized b-tree for more dimensions

998144
getter	setter
if you had a macro language you could write a function like open a popup that allows me to type in some text then generates the getter and setter including its javadoc based on templates

998248
g++	gcc
i m developing an embedded application using gcc g++ compiled for arm-eabi

998286

i made it hide and show again the #results and it makes ie rerender it and realise its height again

998386
public	protected
however if the variable have to be protected or public use an explicit access method or rely on the local scope rule i just demonstrated

998396
firefox	safari
the attribute works perfectly on firefox safari etc

998413
postgresql	mysql
while he doesn t have examples for derby directly i suspect you could probably adapt them to your problem particularly the postgresql or mysql one it seems somewhat platform agnostic

998420
cvs	rcs
cvs uses the old rcs file format and uses rcs tags both for branches and cvs tags

998451
translation	localization
staticity is a life-time and technically memory localization property it tells if the variable will be global in the scope of a class when in a class or a translation unit when used with a global variable defined in a cpp

998475
sharepoint	spsite
we faced the same problem some days ago and the solution was to set the application that is trying to create de spsite object to use the same apppool that the sharepoint s web application

998478
integer	unsigned
assuming img_ is of type iplimage and assuming 16 bit unsigned integer data i would say

998529
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the problem never happens for other browsers such as firefox google-chrome opera

998542
parentviewcontroller	navigationcontroller
do we have same value at navigationcontroller and parentviewcontroller

998571
integer	unsigned
i am trying to write a c++ template function that will throw a runtime exception on integer overflow in casts between different integral types with different widths and possible signed unsigned mismatch

i was thinking i could have one web page for each one or i could have a single web page and show hide the fields for the subclass

998655
google-chrome	firefox
if i copy a 32bit image from photoshop or ie firefox google-chrome and run the above code the output loses its alpha channel instead it is saved against a black background

a magic 8ball is something most people can relate to and it s an introduction to basic strings floats int io cli boolean and rng s using only the simplest tools

998695
int	chars
here is a slightly edited version that i ve tested for converting from int to chars

998701
imperative	declarative
you have less control over the algorithms used since it s more declarative than imperative

998702
debian	linux
the server i ve been trying is just django s built in server using manage.py python manage.py 0.0.0.0 8000 since i need to access it externally on linux debian

vbscript	jscript
custom actions even without tools like installshield can be .exe vbscript jscript or dll based

998783
disk	ram
note that this is distinct from error -34 disk full and appears to be referring to your system memory ram + virtual ram

998809
postorder	inorder
if you want to get to the bottom of the tree first then you do an inorder or perhaps postorder search

998813
wadl	wsdl
i don t think i will be asked for wadl because no vips around here know what it is but wsdl soa so i must comply

998853
versioning	upgrade
one thing that may be different is that this app was created back when mvc beta was the latest versioning and was upgrade to the rc and then rtm as they were released

998865
folder	dir
it has scripts presentations etc in it.s i should probably create a bin subdir in the mesh folder and put that bin dir in my path

998902
post	put	post	get	put	get
of the http methods like post get put delete etc

998958
int	chars
while chars can be used to represent chars it s inherently an int data type

999010
put	get
when i put inner on a different domain i get the problematic behavior

999018
put	get
the primary problem with sending byte s over web services is that they get put in the soap body which is gets encoded as a base 64 string

999032
int	chars
the cast from int to chars works fine

999093
implements	extends
when extends the class you may create a static method of the same name but you are not in fact implements a static abstract method

it works for click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout keydown keypress and keyup

999113
bazaar	git
you should be aware however that open source projects borrow ideas from one another or have similar features developed independently one example would be finding bugs by bisecting searching history for commit that introduced the bug which was as far as i know developed first in git and then implemented as plugin in bazaar and first extension and currently core functionality in mercurial

999113
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
we have kde and we have gnome and xfce and other window managers and desktop envirionments

999113
bazaar	git
and we have git mercurial and bazaar

999136
post	get
firefox permits changing the page showing within the modal panel via a normal post but ie opens it in a new window which seems to imply that a straight get or post won t work

999154
redland	jena
i m the creator of redland which includes native triple stores in c plus i ve used some of the java systems like jena and sesame

999174

the program simply pull some information from the database and do some calculation then push some data back to the database

999197
free	malloc
have you considered writing your own functions to malloc and free texture memory

999203
width	height
part of this may be keeping track of the display height and width of the rows and columns so that the display system can iterate over the range until the desired width and height of cells has been collected

999268
width	height
if the orginal file s width is greater than 480 or lessthan 450 then i want to set the width of output image as 450px.and the height has to be proportional of the width

999268
width	height
if the width of the orginal file is its height then add white space to the top and to bottom to the height so that the new height will be 650

999268
width	height
ex my orginal image had width 450 and height 1094

999268
width	height
desired height desired width ratio ie

999272
textwrangler	bbedit
open the eula file up with bbedit or the free textwrangler and see what encoding it uses

999280
rational-numbers	fractions
this introduces if you can associate every member of set a with exactly one member of set b mathematicians say the sets have the same size. next comes showing that every fractions every rational-numbers can be associated with exactly one counting number using the diagonal method

999297
struts	wicket
eg a different framework wicket vs struts vs spring vs pure ejb j2ee architecture number of distributed tiers one box setup or 3 tier setup

999320
width	height
what you need is a simple ratio between the width and height of the image

999320
width	height
now if we wanted to resize the same image to an width of 50 dividing it by the ratio would give us an height of 100

999347
maven	m2e
first even when i enabled all m2e features checkbox i still couldn t check out a project as a maven project from subversion

999366
parentviewcontroller	navigationcontroller
parentviewcontroller is not always a navigationcontroller

999376
getter	setter
in your class1.m file the getter and setter methods for today are never created

999392
wordpress	joomla
software like joomla and wordpress are open source but it also creates jobs with support customisation extension templates developent

999405
google-chrome	firefox
the way i see it open source will absolutely flourish for applications that us normal users use every day be it operating system linux browser firefox google-chrome etc etc

999414
width	height
choose a constant height and width for your element and create one png out of it

999414
opera	firefox
here is a working solution for ie7+ firefox opera that achieves exactly what you are looking for

999450
queue	fifo
for example if i was implementing a queue admittedly you d use a framework for a queue i d say something like fifo data structure with o 1 insert remove and size

999468
igraph	networkx
we tried networkx and igraph

999482
jruby	mri
i m trying to understand the practical impact of different threading models between mri ruby 1.8 and jruby

999482
jruby	mri
and also are there any practical examples of code in mri ruby 1.8 that will have worse performance characteristics on jruby due to different threading models

999491
jruby	mri
i do not know of any place where mri ruby 1.8 code runs slower on jruby

999497
jruby	mri
so the only real performance difference is the fact that your mri yarv ruby applications won t be able to utilize all of your processor cores but your jruby applications will happily do so

999549
min	max
i am using coregraphics to draw a quadratic bezier but want to computer the min max value of the curve

999578
put	get
so the best advice i can give is put in the plan the need for working prototypes at the earliest possible stage so that you can get those numbers and plan for those numbers to change over time so get prototypes or working versions at every checkpoint to retest all along the project timeline

999583
hash	salt
set a session cookie of a hash and salt secret value

999620
min	max
calculus gives the standard box of tricks for finding the min max of continuous differentiable curves

999670
rspec	machinist
all i do in my rspec tests for my controller is create a user with machinist and then assign that user to be the current_user

999670
rspec	machinist
you obviously would probably need to adapt this to work in test unit and without machinist if you don t use it as i use rspec but i m sure the principle is the same

999744
pull	push
but after some initial research in the web i found out some disappointing facts which are applicable to our application - using git for large systems like ours is painful checkout clone merge push pull and commands are complicated geeky would be more appropriate for a developer base which is dvcs ignorant and mostly windows users

999744
cvs	svn
there is no fixed mindset for git but if i have to go for a centralized approach in really worst case then what should be the way cvs svn apart

999823
cpu	processors
you submit commands to the opengl subsystem and then they are executed on the gpu so not by definition a parallel thread b c the graphics processors doesn t necessarily have the concept of threads in the same way as the cpu

999825
move	drag
i need to draw line circle and rectangle by mouse drag on canvas and then i need to to move and resize the drawn shapes
