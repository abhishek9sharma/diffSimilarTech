the user clicks the menu button and that then toggles the menu to be show or hidden i am however having problems working out where the logic to show and hide the menu component should live the showing an hiding is relatively simple i basically want to add and remove a class to the menu component to show or hide it

45702861
sorting	grouping
the reason i want to maintain the sorting order of each individual query is because the sorting values are not uniform and i don t want results from different grouping to be buried down the result set

45702861
sorting	grouping
the only solution i could think of would be to somehow re-process all records and compute a relative sorting value based on the sorting values of all the records in a given grouping but these values change very regularly and the index has a lot of records so that would probably be overkill

45702871

the solution is to exclude numpy in the py2exe setup script and copy the entire package folder into the distribution directory and add that directory to the system path at the top of the main python script

45703856
width	height
you need to specify a width and a height on the image tag itself

45703856
width	height
if the original images are not square shaped then forcing the width and height to 300px will cause the images to be stretched which might not look so good

your variable could have an int or double value and math.floor a always has an int value so if your variable is equal to math.floor a then it must have an int value

45704025
width	height
first define a div.inner container to hold the image and specify both a width and height value 100px for example

45704025
width	height
to get the images to scale either to the height or width depending on the native aspect ratio of the image apply max-height and max-width of 100 to the image

45704025
width	height	portrait	landscape
note that unless your images are exactly square intrinsic height and width are the same then you will have some extra white space either on the left and right edges of the image in the case of portrait types images or on the bottom edge for landscape images

the difficulties for me here are knowing how to make the browser open up as a fullscreen program so that the rest of the pi s operating system now showing behind it since the pygame gui has been minimized won t be seen by the user and how to have python detect when this browser window gets minimized or closed at which point i would have to run displaysurf pygame.display.set_mode width height pygame.fullscreen to make the pygame gui return to being fullscreen

45738788
width	height
i have already tried to just use the webbrowser.open webaddressstring command followed on the next line of my python code by displaysurf pygame.display.set_mode width height pygame.fullscreen but doing this just results in the browser being opened then immediately covered over by the pygame gui and hence the user cannot see or use the browser as it gets covered up as soon as it is opened

when you have a property named isprocessed firebase requires you to have getter setter named getisprocessed setisprocessed

45742187
getter	setter
it genarates getter setter named isprocessed setprocessed according to kotlin doc

45742187
getter	setter
if the name of the property starts with is a different name mapping rule is used the name of the getter will be the same as the property name and the name of the setter will be obtained by replacing is with set

45742187

for example for a property isopen the getter will be called isopen and the setter will be called setopen

45760854
swift	objective-c
for swift objective-c that would usually be an editor and compiler linker

45760854
swift	objective-c
the main uses of objective-c and swift are client side so you have uikit and their standard libraries there to do most of the work

45760854
swift	objective-c
server-side swift is fairly new and server-side objective-c is not very common so you might have a harder time finding helpful libraries for those at least compared to languages developed for backend use like python or ruby

i am quite sure that the nist test vectors are valid since i used them before when using aes with crypto++ and i am also pretty sure that the implementation of pycrypto is correct since its output agrees with online tools such as this page

45761019
min	max
band scales are ordinal instead of linear which means you need to provide every possible value to the domain instead of just the min max

all you need to do is to give them the exact height and width and position top left

45761286
lisp	prolog
while an array but only a non-empty one can be considered as something plus another sub- array such an approach is used commonly for lists in languages like lisp and prolog it is usually stored element-wise

45761287
neo4j	titan	neo4j	janusgraph	janusgraph	titan
that being said there are two with real market share neo4j and titan janusgraph

45761287
janusgraph	titan
titan janusgraph is the next most popular as it s free open source and has very strong support ibm google hortonworks aws ...

45761287
janusgraph	titan
so while janusgraph is a new project it s literally the same titan code with even broader industry support than titan had

45761287
cypher	gremlin
neo4j uses its proprietary language cypher while nearly everyone else uses gremlin and the tinkerpop open source tool set which is a part of the apache set of open source projects

45761287
cypher	gremlin
so for example you can use either cypher or gremlin to query neo4j though neo and some other proprietary graph database vendors support gremlin as a second-class citizen so to speak

45761287
janusgraph	titan
note that there are many graph databases that support gremlin other than titan janusgraph

45761287
neo4j	janusgraph	cypher	gremlin
neo4j s query language cypher and janusgraph s query language gremlin are semantically identical just spelled differently so you ll learn the concepts either way

45761291
scatter	graphing
i m trying to use shiny to create an interactive scatter plot where i can click on any point on the graphing and get the corresponding x and y co-ordinates

innodb	myisam
first image run the query i will use on statement create with select using both engines myisam and innodb

45761397
glfw	glew
i could write the code in my entry point to use glfw and glew to create a window but as soon as i would abstract this in a separate document ie app.hpp and include it to my entry point it would not compile despite the code being correct

45761397
glfw	glew
make sure that the includes for glfw and glew were made in

45761397
glfw	glew
then you need to link the libraries glfw and glew in

45761397
glfw	glew
and of course make sure you tell input what dlls you want to use both glfw and glew in this case

45761397
glfw	glew
then you take both the glfw and glew dlls you just told added to the additional dependencies and stick them in the folder where you contain your entry point main.cpp

45761487
inline	constexpr
if the global constant is of literal type prefer using inline constexpr the inline is optional if itâ s a static class member instead of inline const

45761487
inline	constexpr
in c++17 static constexpr class members are automatically inline so if your global constant should be part of a classâ s scope you can do something like

45761487
inline	constexpr
otherwise you will need to say constexpr inline which should still work

45761487
inline	constexpr
is possible with constexpr but not with just inline because with constexpr it knows that greeting.size is a compile-time constant and can be used as the size of an array.â³ with optimizations this could compile to a just a single mov instruction and ret without including any copies of the string or array because itâ s unnecessary

45761487
inline	constexpr
â³ this simplified example works even without inline or with the array being only const instead of constexpr but those are useful for more complicated real-world situations

45761490
youtube	vimeo
nicely fits youtube vimeo soundcloud or other url via iframe

45761529
width	margin
make hp width 100 or margin 0 auto

45761686
for-loop	arrays
in your case you can avoid a for-loop because of the way your data is structured we can directly call to the specific arrays of data in your arrays

45761692
for-loop	arrays
in case the whole first half matches the second half of the arrays the for-loop will be completed and after that true will be returned

45761707
min	max
this is due to constraints of the lut implementation where the nodes are specified as a min and max and assumed to be evenly spaced between those values

45761710

cpu responds to the irq and invokes irq handler which is set by the keyboard driver

45761719
versioning	upgrade
i ve removed that code but during upgrade major product and package guids set to upgradecode has the same value as previous versioning i can see in verbose log from msi that this auto_found_dir exists the registrysearch reads the key value with specific directory and as a result the util removefolderex removes that directory and all components that are there located

45761719
versioning	upgrade
the msi with upgrade versioning has this property removed

versioning	upgrade
the real question is can i upgrade the libraries without update the java versioning

45762284
screens	tablet
this ended up being a 2 part solution that revolved around the different screens sizes of the tablet

45762284
width	height
part 1 was to define the row layout width and height parameters in terms of density independent pixels rather than hard-coded values

45762284
screens	tablet
the question now is whether to design the layout for a smaller tablet and waste screens space on the larger tablet or create multiple layout dimension files that support different tablet sizes

45762325
filesystems	btrfs
formatting will remove the btrfs filesystems identifiers so the system won t be able to detect the other drives in the array

45762382
width	height
you must have bounded width and height

45762382
width	height
for example if you set width to be match_parent but wrap_content for height i think android doesn t know that how high you want to stretch your text

45762382
width	height
you should have both bounded width and height which means either one of below for each dimension

45762382
width	height
you have specified an absolute value for that dimension width or height

45762396
post	get
i am using requests-futures package and call asynchronous get post in asynchronous get post result callback add_done_callback on futur result

so i am mainly struggling with ifelse-statements and the min max numbers

45762440
min	max
notice it is important that the ratio between min max is always 1

45762440
min	max
a female with scr 0.9 gives scr k 0.9 0.7 1.28 and results in min 1 and max 1.28

45762440

45762516
width	height
following the pattern of halving the width and height to center the scene

45762516

portrait	landscape
ios encourages developers to support both portrait and landscape so it can be difficult to restrict one part of the app to be landscape while the other is portrait

45763665
portrait	landscape
one option that works pretty well is to restrict the entire app to portrait mode in the project settings and apply a rotation transform to any view controllers that need to be landscape

that method is simply allowing c# to interpret the bits for a 64-bit double or convert an 80-bit double to a 64-bit double if that s what it has to work with as if it were a 64-bit signed int

out of the box in vsts you re probably using a hosted agent which is just a server with tfs installed on it that builds the solution

for-loop	loops
so make hash.set operation only for the first char occurrence - check for key existence before the second for-loop and execute that loops only when needed

your height and width are set to height 10vh

45775350
width	height
something that is 10px in height or width will always be 10px in height or width no matter how you resize the window because we re talking the static physical pixels on your screen

45776027
int	chars
now the three chars types have the same rank and a signed type has a rank always less than int

45776027
int	chars
basically every chars has always a smaller rank than int and they can all be represented in an int and so the overload with unsigned chars is not a better match because it would involve a conversion from chars to unsigned chars instead of a promotion

swift	objective-c
i want to import files from this library i copied and pasted the following .h and .m files from the objective-c library into my swift project

45776162
int	chars
here you re passing a chars with a x int hex format specifier

45776162
int	chars
so the value is promoted to a signed int because 127 negative chars and chars is signed on most systems on yours that s for sure

45776172
tesseract	leptonica
i need the codebase leptonica tesseract and opencv to be always up to date that s why i want to compile them myself

45776172
tesseract	leptonica
i could compile leptonica and tesseract without any problem and opencv without the text module

45776190
int	chars
if you inspect char_min and char_max from you re also likely to find that your chars type is signed and so 0xf1 does not fit as an int value inside of a chars

45776190
int	chars
when these values are promoted to int in order to pass to printf sign extension occurs to preserve the value that is a chars that has a value of -1 should be converted to an int that has a value of -1 as an int so the underlying representation for your example is likely to be transformed from 0xf1 to 0xfffffff1

45776190
int	chars
declare a with a type that can fit the value 0xf1 for example int or unsigned chars

45776211

width	height
however for inline-level elements such as span that can wrap from one line to the next offsettop and offsetleft describe the positions of the first border box use element.getclientrects to get its width and height while offsetwidth and offsetheight describe the dimensions of the bounding border box use element.getboundingclientrect to get its position

45780378
width	height
therefore a box with the left top width and height of offsetleft offsettop offsetwidth and offsetheight will not be a bounding box for a span with wrapped text

so supposing you find out a special rule you want in a whole set of classes in your system and can express that using a metaclass that does not preclude you from creating a single base-class from that metaclass and create all other classes with normal inherited if what will change from one such class to another are just the usual method overriding and specialization inherited still will be simpler both to code as to whoever reads your code as for the toolchain echo system that evolved around c++ in decades of language existance

if this is your first time and you want to test createsamples and don t know any other ways choose a round or square object with equal width and height

int	chars
it would seem to be feasible as per your code with an int and similarly-sized chars buffer

45839230
int	chars
however in that same section it lumps the chars and signed or unsigned int into a integral type category and states that the

45839230
memcpy	memcmp
so i suspect that memcmp will not be able to fail immediately following a memcpy using the same memory blocks and size

as an alternative to using comparator you can also have the class you re using in your priorityqueue implement comparable and correspondingly override the comparator method

the .data-set-label elements have width 50 but with their parents widths undefined their widths get calculated in a strange way which causes inner text to wrap and height to get thrown off

setting the width of .data-set-label explicitly to 50px makes the text wrap and increases the height of .cards-card-detail seemingly to the same wrong height as in your example coincidence

if these were hardcoded form elements i could easily code this show hide logic

but it didnt work right clicking and using the open with command on the log file and specifying that it should be run in terminal with x commands so on and so forth it seems that most answers are touching on basic things having tensorflow set up correctly or using commands correctly but i think this is a deeper issue due to the overwhelming lack of suggestions and the fact that of all the videos i have watched on using tensorboard tensorflow tensorboard while trying to fix this no video even hints that this step is one that can lead to error implying that it is not a simple common error

x86	64bit
no intel or amd x86 manuals ever guarantee atomicity of anything wider than 64bit except for lock cmpxchg16b so this talk of sse vector loads stores being atomic on some cpus isn t something that you can reliably take advantage of or detect when it s supported

udp	tcp
i know that tcp would work better for this but i have to use udp

45905690
queue	fifo

shadowing	named
there is no way of strictly not allowing this to happen -- instead you should use a linter that can look for named shadowing so you ll at least notice this happening

45907309

45907711
inherited	properties
i could think of two approaches first is to define a special signature properties in every one of those classes like string for example and check for it in the arbitrary object second approach is to inherited all classes from an empty class and check if this arbitrary object is instanceof the base class constructor so is it ok to inherited from an empty class

45907721
post	get
if you want to send messages from client - server basically the whole rest of the internet is built to do that send a simple get or post

45907721
post	get
if you need to trigger a socket event on the back end you should send a simple get or post then use code in the receiving controller to trigger the event using emit and the emitted event will be received by all clients that have subscribed to the appropriate channel

45907789
folder	directory
then you can use servletcontext.getrealpath to get the path of a directory under webapps appending to it the name of the new created file so suppose you have folder under webapps named images

45907794
fflush	gets
also dont forget to allocated memory and read comments under your post to dont use gets fflush

i have a similar folder structure the build directory is a subfolder of the source directory on my linux virtual machine but none of them give any warning

45907954
mouse	keyboard
the ui system in my program currently works by assigning function pointers of the type to trigger elements quads on the screen keys on the keyboard with a specifiable call condition which will be compared to the actual condition of the key using glfw mouse button or cursor every frame to determine whether the callback function should be called

45908000
ssl	https
solution is to redirect to https while maintaining ssl security throughout the backend

45908011
inherited	properties
anyways i don t think your problem lies with the cast since it shouldn t be needed at all as class a inherited all of class b s properties

45908021
post	get
never you can get post data from client side using javascript or any other client side language

45908021
post	get
you must use a server side language to get post data like php nodejs

45908040
super	self
return super object self .__new__ ... is calling type.__new__ which doesn t take what you re passing it

45908062

and my experiments seem to prove that you add this not subtract it

45908139
filtering	grouping
we ll grouping it later while we also filtering it

45908190
implements	extends
public abstract class enum extends object implements comparable serializable

45908196
x86	64bit
i suspect here it is because a 64bit compiler is matched with 32 bit cdb in the x86 rather than x64 directory

45908197
post	get
i found out that i needed to get and pass the id of the post in the action of the form

45908240
cpu	processors
first it depends on how many cpu cores do you have - if you have more cpu cores than running threads then there aren t enough threads to keep all the cores in the processors busy at 100

45908290
prepare	execute
the pdo execute function execute a prepare statement

45908290
prepare	execute
so you need to prepare then execute

45908341
swift	objective-c
i have found some objective-c answers which i don t quite understand and don t know how to implement it in swift

45908359
prepare	execute
in order to understand better the prepare do s and don t s i was wondering if the following example isn t wrong or even worst - dangerous to execute

45908445
innodb	myisam
change from myisam to innodb

45908445
innodb	myisam
these matter when it comes to fragmentation which myisam w varchar is severely subject to and innodb is only slightly subject to

45908478
fflush	gets
because as you can see i start by writing import imp it then gets buffered and a little later the buffer gets fflush and the virtualenv executes the command this is why you see it twice

45908519
getter	setter
and this is correct behavior - if you take a look inside org.gradle.api.task interface source code you will find that description is not a field but a pair of getter and setter methods

45908552
min	max
let min 0 and max n-1

45908552
min	max
if max min then stop target is not present in array

45908552
min	max
compute guess as the average of max and min rounded down so that it is an integer

45908557
hide	show
your code calls hide on the #book-shared-message element but it never calls .show to show it again

45908557
hide	show
similarly you call which appears to be something to hide the modal overlay but shouldn t there be some kind of corresponding .modal show call

45908571
centos	linux
if i install the bundled postgres that comes with centos the postgres linux account is always created

45908600
post	put
you can put the two files php html submit the form to the same index.php then put condition statement to check if post request was made if it has then enter the checking block of your php code

45908664
dbcontext	objectcontext
in entity framework 4.1+ dbcontext is preferable to use to objectcontext so you d better use

45908763
width	height
now traversing each files from an array of file names imagedatasource is created with a given height width and framerate

45908772
google-chrome	firefox
i m using fabricjs 1.7.17 and have seen this issue below on ie edge google-chrome and firefox

pdo_dblib is typically installed in most linux distros when you install php-mssql on centos and ubuntu for example

45908797
put	get
so what iâ d like to achieve is when i get the webshop items from the rest api i want to put their names descriptions etc

45908800
width	height
this isn t a desirable solution as i m sure titles can vary a lot in length so its impossible to pick a default height to suit every possibility and even that s complicated by the responsive width of the columns potentially changing the height dynamically

45908816
width	height
you have to define height width x and y positioning for both the name uilabel and the info uilabel

45908816
uilabel	uibutton	width	height
font size places a dominant role for height with uilabel and width can be based on the number of characters in the uilabel x font size so you do not have to explicity express height and width constraints for a uilabel but for a uibutton you would have to explicitly define constraints for x y width height

45908869
uilabel	uitextview
unless you have a specific need to be using a uitextview i recommend using a uilabel

45908889
onkeydown	onblur
to work around this the onblur event of the window is used to mark the alt key as released as the user cannot alt+tab back without releasing the alt key and if the alt key is held down while bringing the window to focus by some other means the onkeydown event is firing multiple times

45908902
rational-numbers	fractions
exif stores latitude and longitude as three rational-numbers fractions where the numerator and denominator are four bytes long

i have a listagg function applied to table 1 that i want to compare with a substr returned in another query

45908949
listagg	substr
i want to fetch such records which are present in the first query listagg but not in second substr

45908958
put	get
you could try something like this put the objects into a dictionary the strings as keys and the objects as values and insert the keys into the listbox then retrieve the selected keys with listbox.selection_get .split and use them to get the desired objects out of the dict

45909011
folder	directory

i ve been searching for a solution all weekend but most answers i find apply to ios apps older versions of swift objective-c etc

45909022
google-chrome	safari
there a few small libraries you can use that provide custom uiactivity controls to get the open in safari and open in google-chrome activity items

45909031
getter	setter
in you reportseventservice you only have a setter method you don t have a getter method to return the value

45909099
google-chrome	firefox
notice that for the purpose of testing you can make cross domain dragging between ie and firefox google-chrome back and forth with datatransfert behaving roughly as between two ies on the same domain

45909102
switching	screens
when i switching pages in ios the screens is initially laid out as if the navigation bar was present then shifts up to take up the space where the navigation bar was leaving a gap on the bottom of the screens

45909278
addition	multiplication
some laws that relate xor and and can be found by reasoning about the field â 2â in which addition corresponds to xor and multiplication to and

45909278
min	max
turn min into max and vice versa

45909278
multiplication	modulo
has an inverse because it is effectively a multiplication by an odd number and odd numbers have an modular multiplicative inverse modulo a power of two

45909300
getter	setter
i also hope we could have public getter and private setter

45909300
getter	setter
until we do another way to handle this is to add additional private getter and setter

45909303
debian	linux
on some systems an unsupported format can crash the program debian linux

45909313
client-side	server-side
i m thinking about trying firebase and have spent the day looking at example projects and the docs and i seem to be misunderstanding something probably because i m used to server client-side architectures where the interesting parts of the code would be server-side

45909335
width	height
since the program is very small i would normnally guess that the problem is created by switching the height and width variable but that is not the case here since both are equal

45909354
versioning	upgrade
there is documentation from heroku on how to upgrade the postgres versioning but it s not totally clear from their example what i would need to do

45909360

however when i try to click on another option and attempt to hide the previous controls show it does not hide itself but merely stays on the screen and the datagridview is show on top of it

45909388
prepare	execute
your syntax is wrong there is nothing like prepare statement and you d want to execute the ps to execute the query

45909422
width	height
calling stage.sizetoscene and then setting the minimum width and height to the current width and height after showing the stage works for me

45909449

post	get
the access-control-allow headers alone only work for get and some post requests

45909490

button	checkbox
starting with 8.1 you can render any vaadin ui component such as button checkbox textfields or custom components inside grid s cells

45909715
post	put
that said if you insist on breaking things your solution is to put the java installation call in post which will execute after the files have been installed

when i try the code alone it works but when i added it as a part of code in the author file the first time it does not display anything but once i modify a height and width

gson	jackson
instead since you re already using gson or jackson or others store the question_ids as json

dictionary	map
a much better solution would be to use a dictionary to map the binary values instead of using variables

45928668
filtering	grouping
note that dimension.filter just returns the dimension and changes the filtering for the entire crossfilter so all of your grouping above would be the same grouping and only the last filtering would take

draggable	droppable
using react-draggable npm package i was able to make contents draggable and droppable

45928734
width	height
core ml neural network models are channels x height x width

45928749
portrait	landscape
overall your code looks fine i think it could be the way your library saves the orientation of the pictures could conflicting with the mobile vision api try using native android captures on a side project or another library if your app still not working try saving the still in landscape even if they are taken on portrait that could help as well

45928775
post	put
i don t have enough reputation to put a comment so i ll post an answer

45928789

45928794
google-chrome	safari
the following simple pen results in different behaviours in google-chrome and safari

45928794
google-chrome	safari
specifically in safari there is no extra space neither above nor below the img whereas in google-chrome there is a huge space

45928794
width	height
it seems as if chrome first checks the img height to reserve the space and then shrinks the img for width 100

45928794
width	height
whereas safari first sets width 100 and then set the height of the enclosing div

45928794
google-chrome	safari
how to make google-chrome behave like safari

45928824

int type converted to double ok

45929204

45929983
ng-show	ng-hide
the reason that ng-hide ng-show aren t the best ideas for animation is that they apply display block property to your element thus any transition applied to them will not work

45948223
width	height
once the width goes below 1100px the height changes in proportion as before

45948223

hide	show
the reason why is because you made a event listener of 2 events which both executes when doing the click which will make your menu show then hide to prevent this just use 1 event which is click click also works on mobile or use tap event when user is using a mobile device and click on non mobile device detecting a mobile browser

45948579

after you put something together on your own you can edit your post to include what you ve tried and then you will be more likely to get an accurate response for your particular situation

45948595
put	get
this means that if you try joining that process you may get a deadlock unless you are sure that all items which have been put on the queue have been consumed

similarly if the child process is non-daemonic then the parent process may hang on exit when it tries to join all its non-daemonic children

45949248
children	parent
you can pass a function down from the parent to both of the children to allow setting of the value

45949248
children	parent
the function in the parent should make a call to setstate with this new value which will cause re-rendering of itself and any children

typedef	struct
the .h file contains a typedef struct

on the other hand you should not multiplying those values but add it instead

45962670
filtering	grouping
finally i am using the hamming distance to determine the intra-cluster and the inter-cluster distances given that it seems to be the most appropiated metric for binary data but results show me that clusters are not closely grouping and separated among them so i wonder if i am applying the most suitable grouping approximation method or even if i should filtering the input data previously grouping

45962670

any clue or idea regarding grouping clustering method or filtering data is welcomed

45962691
post	get
i don t get it why it changes every time even i haven t use post method

everything works fine but when i see network activity in debugger console google-chrome or firefox there is a 302 responde from formaction page is that right

45963169
width	height
i had a quick play with your jsfiddle and since you re specifying width and height on the images anyway you can make the images absolute positioned so they sit on top of each other

45963225

i copied my project folder to a newly created directory

45963438

i ve commented the code below for clarity but basically we loops through values in column a using a for-loop because they re less prone to disguised infinite looping than while and look for them in column b

45963452
superclass	subclassing
in this code i have created an object of subclassing and stored in reference with superclass

45963473
put	get
i try to request data from web then get an array for four times they are different and i tried to put these four arrays in a big array

45963549
for-loop	loops
the program is still only going to check the while condition after the for-loop has run it s course but it ll only increment once per loops which is likely what the issue was in the first place

45963596
loops	if-statement
further more you would want to use a do-while loops for validation instead of using an if-statement

45963640
swift	objective-c
and both swift and objective-c solutions are applicable

45963654
spaces	delimiter
my guess is that a scanner uses the whitespace as the default delimiter therefore it doesn t return a spaces as a character because it uses the whitespace to break the input into tokens

45963654
spaces	delimiter
by return a spaces i mean consider a spaces as a input and not as a delimiter

45963693
width	height
and the svg has width and height specified at 18 pixels

45963704
width	height
i have also set the height and width of the node same as a4 size

45963724
put	get
the therein put mysqldb.properties will get founded this way

45963967
spaces	delimiter
this will accept the spaces as a character not as a delimiter

45963989
installation	upgrade
if you are not able to upgrade your mysql installation you will have to take the workaround you mentioned

45963989
installation	upgrade
upgrade your installation award to wchiquito

45964066
seaborn	matplotlib
at the end you won t even need any seaborn plot at all but just a matplotlib scatter and a matplotlib plot

45964076
width	height
this method should only be called if a measurement may be invalid due to a change like a browser width resize that might affect the height of wrapping text content etc

45964082
typedef	struct
the struct is actually still usable without the warning if you remove the typedef keyword like this

45964082
typedef	struct
as other have pointed out if you include the name at the end of the struct definition then you can use it as the typedef and you get rid of the warning even without the struct keyword but this makes the first instance of item superfluous

45964083
maven	pom.xml
on the maven configuration pom.xml i have guava at version 21 and selenium at version 3.5.2

45964115
prng	random
i want to evaluate the pseudorandom naive random number generator prng in node.js math.random and also other third party prng

it is better to pass a uri and then picasso to place it in an imageview as explained on

45964160
folder	dir
folder is after that mount with docker volume to nginx dir

45964166
maven	pom.xml
you can upload your maven project directly to bintray just by adding some code to your pom.xml and then running the appropriate mvn command

45964259
quicksort	mergesort
but under the assumption that k is some approximation value between 0 and 1 when 0 is completely unsorted and 1 is perfectly sorted surely the answer to this is quicksort or mergesort

45964264
post	get
i get no tokens matching this arguments found in the cache. wouldn t let me post a 3rd link

45964296
sudo	passwd
edit i have found a solution by using a script that creates a window that asks for the passwd and then i sue the passwd for the sudo command

45964296
sudo	passwd
i have inserted a system to check if the passwd is correct by trying to do the sudo command

45964296
sudo	passwd
if the output is passwd checked the passwd is correct if it is only checked the passwd in not correct but this is not the best solution the best could be try to get the authentication via api and send something like an authentication token to the sudo command instead of the passwd itself

45964314
hide	show
however if you would like to implement the second one you should know that the new iap management feature in your product store page allow you to show and hide the subscriptions you want

45964359
post	get
the service is running fine when i navigate to the service page i get a list of available get post methods

45964406
integer	unsigned
note that unlike signed integer overflow unsigned integer is not undefined behavior

45964406
integer	unsigned
in the case of murmurhash unsigned integer overflow in multiplications is fully intentional so you should disable the option

45964443
tensorflow	cudnn
i had the exact same error while trying to build tensorflow on windows using cudnn 5.1

45964483

valueasdate is most likely just a getter setter and not an actual property meaning things like setdate won t mutate the underlying value as it s operating on a completely new independent

45964518
strcpy	strncpy
or you can use a combination of strcpy and strcat or strncpy and strncat for the paranoid in the room

45964518
strcpy	strncpy
using strcpy and strcat is risky but using strncpy and strncat in their place isn t a guarantee of success either

45964553
for-loop	loops
to optimize what you have a for-loop would be much faster than a for in loops

45964563

when the following is executed the console.log it returns nothing in google-chrome version 60.0.3112.101 but a string in firefox 54.0

45964639
jar	war
but unfortunately since the web service client is inside the jar that is a dependency of the war it doesn t seem to use my axis2.xml configuration but uses it s own axis configuration which doesn t know about the proxy

45964639
jar	war
is there a way to let the ws client in the child jar make use of the same axis2 configuration of the parent module that is a deployable war and has the axis2 dependencies

45964639
jar	war
my war file has an axis2 configuration from the source code of this war a service generated with wsimport is called which is in a jar that is a dependency of the parent war

openacc	pgi
pgi compiled objects are interoperable with gnu and it s fine to mix in pgi openacc compiled code with gnu compiled objects

45964770
openacc	pgi
note that gnu support for openacc has gotten a lot better in their 7.0 release so while i work for pgi i d encourage you to try both compilers

45964770
openacc	pgi
as for the cuda libraries pgi ships all the libraries that we need to compile your openacc code

45964832

i do not want to use a solution that sets flags on the mousedown mouseup or any other mouse events please

45964962
mouseup	mousedown
the mouseup mousedown listeners are not available - i want to do something like

45965011
inherited	properties
but most likely in real-life application you ll need to bind drive picker s properties to some datasource item fields so be sure that your drive picker widget inherited right datasource

45965027
inherited	properties
in the future once realm outgrows this limitation you should be able to define a superclass called animal which have an owner properties make both dog and cat inherited from the animal class then delete all objects from realm that inherited from animal

45965093
google-chrome	firefox
i am having this issue in google-chrome and firefox

45965120
children	parent
from my understanding the flexbox system should calculate the height of the children elements automatically by simply adding display flex to the parent element as below

45965133
google-chrome	firefox
using the timeupdate event there s no lag because timeupdate fires once per frame with firefox and every 250ms for google-chrome

in our team ci servers still use git in 1.9.5 for lack of time to upgrade while developers use a range from 2 to the last versioning

45965356
width	height
my issue is that when i rotate the innercanvas i adjust the innercanvas width to be the size of the outercanvas and calculate its height based of the width however it seems like the innercanvas s width is adjusted instead of its height

45965356
width	height
simply flip floping width and height does not fix the issue

so i need to get only the strata value and put it in the lightblue box how to do that

45965452
noexcept	decltype
so the question is can i apply some template code to remove the noexcept from the type returned by decltype and make it work as expected

45965470
disk	ram
any database engine is at the mercy of the speed of the disk and how much or little ram you have for caching

45965489

the first thing i noticed is that the admission requirements banner has a height and width set when i removed it the banner acted more responsive but the text inside is very hard to work with because of padding

45965501
ubuntu	linux
i suggest you use linux ubuntu ndk 14rb

45965545
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade from versioning 3.6.1 to 3.6.2 to try to resolve the issue and restarted my computer but it is still occurring

45965635
for-loop	loops
if you run this with the fourth loops nits as a for-loop it will run

45965650

printf	strncpy
i tried adding the strncpy because i thought maybe the null terminator from printf was not working properly with the bitset

45965713
inherited	properties
on top of that i can t make t extends somebaseclass because the models come from swagger-codegen and it looks like there is no way to inherited the models from a custom made class and that makes things even harder because my sync method will need to check some properties of the model to actually work

45965728
post	get
i would like to get instantsearch widget to filter custom post types

45965728
post	get
it renders the title correctly and all is working but the custom post types won t get listed at all in any shape or form

45966067
put	get
if i put the same viewmodel to the two views i get the following exception

45966081
vispy	qglwidget
as long as vispy is using qt as backend you must use .native this parameter will make the canvas use qglwidget for example

45966190
serializable	deserialization
it works but it seems overkill and very unclean to serializable the object 2 times and make the javascript handle the deserialization

45966191
put	get
on the login_setting parameter i put either all or none and i still always get the response

45966199
super	self
initialize the super1 part of itself by calling super sub1 self .1.__init__ self ... in its own constructor

45966199
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
so if you your superclass has a member a whose value is passed to its constructor your subclassing also has inherited a member a and must somehow pass its value to the superclass constructor

45966199
superclass	subclassing
or whether there s some relationship between the super and subclassing arguments or the subclassing hard-codes some of the superclass arguments or ... depends on your code

45966351
int	double
i am wondering if someone could please explain to my why how this code works to convert a double between -1.0 and +1.0 to an 14-bit int

45966366
post	get
if i change sethttpmethod from post to get arguments.arg x as i would expect

45966394

45966402
woocommerce	shortcode
i need to exclude out of stock items from displaying when the woocommerce recent products shortcode is used on my front page

45966402
hide	show
using a code that hide rather than doesn t pull out of stock products just show empty spaces where the products would have been show

45966410
put	get
it s a little slow if you plot each individual pixel but you can get dramatic speedups if you only call the put method once for each row of the image

45966436
range	max
thus i believe something may be buggy in the pnet.c file causing the values to truncate to the 7-bit max value rather than displaying the full uint8 range

45966493
min	max
however this doesn t work for built-in functions like min and max

45966494
int	chars
the maximum hash grows only slowly you d need strings of 34 million chars before the entire range of a 32bit int is used

45966494
addition	multiplication	multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	addition
the other way multiplying by powers of a this can be evaluated with horner s scheme so no powers needs to be calculated explicitly it still only costs an addition and a multiplication per character though the naive way is not the fastest way to compute that hash does not have this problem

45966494
int	chars
the powers of a quickly get big and start wrapping which is fine as long as a is odd so strings with 30 chars stand a good chance to cover the entire range of whatever int type you re using

45966520
for-loop	loops
i know in general list comprehensions are faster than for loops so i m trying to convert my double for-loop into a list expression

45966538
min	max
then combine it with min max

45966538
min	max
but it looks like you want to clip the values instead of min max

45966544
implements	extends
i ve read somewhere that in spring 5 you have to replace the extends webmvcconfigureradapter by extends webmvcconfigurersupport class because the first one was deprecated however this didn t work for me and i had to implements webmvcconfigurer instead

however these functions return the minimum maximum values of the bounding box so when the bounding box is rotated relative to the world the min max values these functions return will not be with respect to world coordsys

45968807
min	max
i solved this by using resetxform on the object before using the built in min max functions resetxform aligns the bounding box with the world coordsys

45968807

i think there must be a better way to calculate an object s min max values without using resetxform but i have not found it yet

you can get the actual image resource and query its width height to use for the fit values

45969724
width	height
this rule here makes no sense transition prepares an element to animate it s properties smoothly if you wanted to animate width or height you should be doing transitioning width height from 0 to some value but that s not specified in your code

say you have an employee base class and two subclassing that inherited from it namely emptypeone and emptypetwo

45970807
put	get	base-class	subclassing
what you should do is as netmage advised in a comment is put your methods in your base-class then override them in your subclassing to use their variables and get work done

width	height
javafx layouts will call computeprefwidth and computeprefheight with a height or width parameter based on the content bias of the control

45970847
width	height
leaving content bias at null doesn t work as width height are always -1 in the compute methods and there is no way to find out how big the parent area is to return sensible values then

children	parent
assuming is a dom element you could loop the children of the parent of that element and set the style of the actual element after the loop

45971700
for-loop	loops
otherwise this is the correct way to write a for-loop as a while loops essentially move the initialization variable to outside of loops and place the modification statement at the end

45971715
opencv	emgucv
so i doubt that emgucv opencv can read an adobe proprietary format

45971770
width	height
i haven t worked with the tiff format lately but i strongly suspect that a tiff representation of an image of width x height size would contain a lot less bytes than that so even if the buffer was successfully passed to findedges trying to treat it as much larger than it is would lead to an access violation

45971772
children	parent
considering the problem as a tree i m using an iterative depth-first search starting at leaf nodes a process that has no children and iterating through my file to create these closures where process 1 is the parent to process 2 which is the parent of process 3 so on and so forth

terraform	packer
my understanding for your problem to block you is the bitbucket pipelines normally call them agents have no enough permission to do the job terraform apply packer build to your aws account

45971872
terraform	packer
with that you can run packer or terraform commands without issues

45971872
terraform	packer
second for your existing requirement you only need to run packer and terraform commands you needn t run docker command in bitbucket pipeline

45971897
hash	salt
you could use a username or an incremental id counter or salt hash of the username or a uuid

45971900
google-chrome	safari
the most common methods make use of wkhtmltopdf which creates an instance of the webkit rendering engine used in both google-chrome and apple safari to generate the rendering of the page which is then converted to pdf somehow i think they use magic here

free	malloc
i imagine there are many ways for this to break other than tail call optimizations but it s really elegant when it doesn t because the links are guaranteed to be fairly cache local since they are fairly close to each other and there is no malloc free needed for arbitrary sized consecutive allocations since everything is cleaned as soon as returns happen

45972472
apk	dex
when i run the app by clicking on the run button the apk size is 90kb when i build the apk with proguard enabled the apk size is 600kb when i build apk with proguard disabled the size is 1mb using apk analyzer i could see that the dex file grows from 45 kb to 1 mb why does that happen

rss	feed
the one answer provided does not answer the question about why the link for the rss feed doesn t work when it is put in a list item

rss	feed
it also is a useless answer because if you remove feed from the link you won t go to the rss feed page--it just reloads the current page.

45972974
rss	feed
a link to the rss feed for the website is included in the list

versioning	upgrade
the safest way overall is to upgrade to a more recent versioning of spring boot

45979867
versioning	upgrade
you ll automatically upgrade all boot managed dependencies to their latest compatible versioning

45979867
versioning	upgrade
a minor versioning upgrade might require you to slightly change things about your configuration or in the apis in case you depend on third-party api from your application code

45979867
versioning	upgrade
minor versioning upgrade in boot are usually very careful when it comes to not pulling in breaking changes in third-party libs but unfortunately not all of them follow semantic versioning

45979867
versioning	upgrade
that s one of the main reasons this upgrade by property is recommended over re-declaring a dependency in a newer versioning explicitly which still can be a last resort in some cases

45979867
versioning	upgrade
use option 2 to upgrade to a newer versioning of boot and evaluate the impact this has on your application code

45979867
versioning	upgrade
generally speaking it s a good idea to keep an eye on boot releases and regularly try to dry-upgrade the project to that newer versioning but not necessarily ship that upgrade to production

45979867
versioning	upgrade
avoiding upgrade basically just makes them more painful but yeah sometimes they can t be made right away because of political reasons or because the upgrade is running into problems in newer versioning

45979902
int	boolean
to solve this problem use temporary int to store scanning of an boolean value as int and after that store it to boolean variable

i ve also tried an approach where the tsc options are the same as above but where i manually import each core-js shim individually but in that scenario despite importing core-js es6 map and other similar variations typescript does not seem to be able to resolve map to a type presumably because it s expecting to have es6 es2015 available in the lib option

if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually

you are trying to read the height and width of the image before it has loaded

45991211

onload will be called when temp_image has finished loading so the image will have a width and height

45991217
width	height
make .loading full width full height and position fixed add z-index if necessary

45991219

you can directly get the height and width like this

45991236
getter	setter
here are my structures i truncated getter and setter to keep the code minimal

45991238
post	get
the problem here is that you are missing the actual post request to get the data

45991240
stdout	stderr
especially when it comes to passing and viewing data on stdin stdout and stderr

45991317
post	get
for example see this post for how to get all lexicals for each frame in the call stack

45991694
median	max	min	median	min	max
select min of next 50 rows by ordering the rows in desc in case if column count is even this will be median or else max of firsthalf+min of secondhalf 2 will be the median

45991708
width	height
your while loop will keep jumping in and getting in the way of everything javascript related that the browser tries to do so even after the image is ready it may take many cycles of the event loop to actually populate the properties of width and height on your image and they likely won t update in the same loop

45991708
width	height
you set the width to 0 over and over on every iteration of the loop but if the height property is already available when you finally receive a real width value then you break at the top of the loop before stashing it in a variable

45991708
width	height
there is no guarantee of which property is set first width or height as so clearly demonstrated by your 50 50 results

45991832
folder	dir
i notice when installing on osx and the intellij.app file gets coppied from the mount in volumes intellij into a dir in my applications folder from the command line with cp i have the error

45992098
entity-relationship	entities
or we can use the entity-relationship concept of reifying relation ship s associations specialofferproducts productoffers to associative entities that are the two participants

45992098
entity-relationship	entities
if options weren t considered entities then entity-relationship would call this a weak relation ship association entity with special orders products as identifying entities. regardless special orders products must agree on options and if that isn t enforced via fks then it still needs constraining

45992098
entity-relationship	entities
from an entity-relationship perspective considering that you seem to be confused about participant entities special offer vs specialofferproduct maybe this is moot but maybe if you tried to express yourself only using technical terms without the confusion then you would be trying to say that this design needs a constraint that product-option pairs appear in productoptions and that it s messy that the constraint involves a relation ship association whose associative entity productoption isn t one of the participating entities

45992098
entity-relationship	entities
ps 2 entity-relationship reasoning about designs involves what possibly associative entities are participating in relationships whereas in the relational model view tables just capture n-ary relation ship s associations for any n

45992118
post	get
i also have a form that used to return post data to the return url - however it recently stopped working and i was able to get it working again using get method instead by following this helpful article

45992129
post	get
you are looking to make the logout command accessible via a get request as opposed to a post request which is how laravel sets it up by default

45992129
post	get
simply change it from route post to route get and leave everything else the same

45992129
post	get
this would ultimately make the logout route accessible via both a get and a post request

45992129
post	get
they both link to the same method so they do the same thing and work in the same way and now you can logout as either a post or get request

45992129
post	get
so you can still use in your blade files and the route name will work regardless of whether you are using it as a get or post request

the c++ originally seemed to consider that private members could be placed somewhere other than next to public members perhaps so they could be a protected region in hardware so it is conceivable that the public and private sections could be moved relative to each other

getter	setter
synthesized getter and setter

45994608
getter	setter
in other words applying __attribute__ nsobject and strong on a property with core foundation type makes the getter and setter work correctly but it will not make arc manage the underlying instance variable because the instance variable s type will still be the core foundation type and thus arc will not release the instance variable upon dealloc if it is non-nil

some html elements have predefined margin s and padding s which one need to take into account when giving them a width

45995229
box-sizing	margin	box-sizing	border-box	margin	border-box
in your case not using margin s there is a simple solution where you set box-sizing border-box to both the and to ensure a consistent layout cross browsers

45995229
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
the box-sizing border-box will make border s and padding s set size be included in the elements set width

45995229
width	margin
the solution for margin s is to use css calc like this width calc 100 - 30px where the 30px is the sum of an element s left and right margin

margin	height	width	height	width	margin
it seems like the mapcontrol doesn t have default width and height the recommend way is not to set any properties for example height margin and so on to let it fit the parent container

45995641
width	height
the reason for not recommend is because without setting the height and width the map can adaptive different uwp devices kindly

45995641
width	height
if you do want to set the height property to make the map shown you may need to set the width property or to indicate the width as well

post	get
i am using a version of phpstorm which has a bug related to the use of post this is why get did work

45995819
post	get
if a get is happening rather than a post you can force your form to be a post by specifying formmethod.post in your form constructor function html.beginumbracoform you shouldn t really have to do this have a look at the html that gets generated is the form tag being generated correctly because its umbraco the url it is posting to wont be as straight forward as standard mvc as it is being generated by the html.beginumbracoform method but it should still make sense

45995915
folder	directory
a folder is nothing else but a folder a directory

45995927
width	height
i am in a situation where i need my bg image to be of the fixed height and the width of the image should vary on device width change

45995927
width	height
now if the device width increases the height should always be fixed for example the height of the image is 200px and width is 2000px and it is being viewed on the device having 1000px of with then the image should be of the fixed height and the width should vary as stated above

45995956
apache	nginx
or any corresponding configs of your server like nginx or apache

45996076
width	height
this differs in behavior from width as width is often pre-defined to 100 width whereas the height are automatic

45996090
hash	salt
it therefore does make sense to add iterations work factor and possibly additional salt bytes to the already stored hash values

45996293
folder	directory
i have a directory with the following folder structure

45996349
width	margin
margin using percent doesn t work cross browsers on flex items so if your margin s is more related to the viewport use viewport units vh or vw else you can combine px with css calc width calc 33.333 - 20px to match an equal gutter between the items

45996352
required	placeholder
the error says that you are not feeding a placeholder that is required for running the optimizer tensor

swift	objective-c
for example one can use both objective-c and swift in single ios app both languages talk with each other by using a bridge

45996463

if the size of the text is somewhat known another possible option would be to give the second last column item a bottom margin matching the last items height though this fixed height needs to be well tested on different screen sizes so it doesn t overlap

prop	each
by using the optioncomponent prop i was able to render each option with a checkbox see image

45996913
min	max
with being the 3d input array of the stacked list of 2d arrays we could simply use min max ufunc reductions on the array data and then stack those in columns

45996913
min	max
in the loopy code we were finding the min max among all elements for each index along the last axis so the equivalent reductions would be for the first two axes in the 3d stacked array

45996913
min	max
so we could avoid that with a loop comprehension to perform one level of min max reduction and then one more to cover for all input arrays - 1 2..n

45996956
folder	directory
the major problem though is that the files view solution explorer shows the directory structure of the folder you opened while the optimal view would be to able to see the headers and sources of external libs just like you can in a normal vs project

45996990
public	protected
i ve declared them public protected or private -- nothing seems to work

45997047
width	height
but you have to set the width height of the elements to the right ratio in order to not clip parts of the images

45997047
width	height
you can set this ratio dynamically by sizing the .skill element by width xx and for the height apply a padding-bottom yy

put	get
first idea was just put both into an array use that array with ksecuseitemlist so keychain calls will operate only on the items in this array not on real keychains and then get the identity like this

45997867
portrait	landscape
windows startup screen is not fixed and it depends on the window size which might be sometimes landscape sometimes portrait

45997873
hide	show
you can check for a specific class and show or hide depending on the class

45997873
hide	show
when show change that class so u can hide next time

45997908
ip-address	lan
i only need to informations of the currently used network adapters which are normally just the lan port and wifi which at least recieve an ip-address and or have a mac address which i need to write down

it works fine for google-chrome and older version of firefox 46 but it fails in ie and latest version of firefox with the below error message

45997984
mkmapview	mkannotationview
i implement public func mapview _ mapview mkmapview didselect view mkannotationview in my delegate to detect annotation touch

45997984
super	self
a breapoint located in the if clause fires but returning whatever super self imageview does nothing

45997984
mkmapview	mkannotationview
and if i clic on my annotationview exact center the public func mapview _ mapview mkmapview didselect view mkannotationview delegate method if fired

filtering	grouping
the windows agent sends metrics using some labels and the google cloud autoscale for managed grouping can t filtering that labels at the moment

45998088
filtering	grouping
they are working to implement the labels filtering into the option of the managed grouping google team wrote

45998166
post	get
i m trying to get a list of post from a facebook page but when i send my request via graphrequestmanager it throws an error undefined is not an object evaluating nativegraphrequestmanager.start

45998176
inject	interceptor
that way we can inject the into the factory and pass it to the interceptor when we construct it

45998193
free	strdup
so another solution is to return strdup buf which will return a copy that the caller needs to free after use otherwise you will have a memory leak

45998205
children	parent
this is a little dirty because if one of the parent change its name you have to update all the children accordingly

45998244
width	height
if you have a homography that relates img1 and img2 then the homography that relates half_size_img1 and half_size_img2 that is the height and width are halved is exactly the same except the translations are halved as well 10 px translation in the full size images is 5 px in the half-sized images

45998251
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you should rather make use of objectoutputstream objectinputstream classes to send receive your hashmap

45998251
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectoutputstream objectinputstream are specifically concerned with sending object across network

45998264
setinterval	settimeout
but you d use settimeout not setinterval to establish your 1000ms timeout

45998299
bower	npm
on previous machine check what versions are there for node npm ember-cli bower and phantomjs-prebuilt

45998299
versioning	upgrade
i will suggest you to upgrade your ember-cli versioning as mentioned in there release documentation

45998315
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
i want to play this video using qgraphicsvideoitem inserted in qgraphicsscene of qgraphicsview

45998341
atom-editor	sublimetext
i just moved from sublimetext to atom-editor

45998347
free	malloc
note that the malloc ed memory will need to be free d by the caller later

45998347
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
that is there may be problems if the version of malloc or calloc that getstring is linked against differs from the version of free that the calling code is linked against

45998347
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
here the function dll_free is part of the dll and malloc calloc and free would all be linked against the same library when the dll is created

45998352
tinyint	boolean
why do you not simply merge the two tables and add a boolean tinyint field answered

45998410
google-chrome	firefox
it is working on firefox and google-chrome both browser

45998423
ffmpeg	libav
however if you ve ffmpeg or libav on your machine - as you should ve while building installing opencv - then you can use ffmpeg libav to list all the available codecs

45998471
google-chrome	firefox
in case of there still will be -webkit-transform in style string somehow after the first command for me it never happen in modern google-chrome firefox and edge i have else statement a little bit ugly but it works

45998475
width	height
have to get the same text position what is in the span element like top left width height for the below code

45998631
for-loop	loops
you can found the link here haskell recursion in recursion for-loop in loops part 1

45998631
min	max
previously the 2 red dots were generated by finding min x min y and max x max y

45998631
min	max
to generate 4 red dots min x min y max x min y min x max y max x max y partition4 should take into consideration

45998677
equals	gethashcode
if you execute the above code the equals method will be invoked 4 times since the gethashcode will return the same value for both objects

45998722
post	put
the advantage is it secures a call of all the update modify methods post put patch

45998781
maven	pom.xml
you reference different maven projects in your pom.xml

45998781
nexus	artifactory
if you use a repository like nexus or artifactory you deploy project2 there and reference it from project1

45998846
free	malloc
the address you pass to free must come from malloc and it seems you re violating that in addition to losing the original returned address for your 10 bytes

45998846
free	malloc
assuming get_string returns static storage you don t need to free it you can do this without involving malloc

45998863
vsts	tfs
why isn t any extension available in the vsts tfs vnext market

45998872
serializable	deserialization
ignite is indeed a possible solution for you since you may optimize serializable deserialization overhead by using internal binary representation for accessing objects fields

45998880
quicksort	heapsort
probably all implementations of std sort use introsort aka introspection sort a hybrid algorithm that combines quicksort and heapsort

45998880
quicksort	heapsort
technically introsort better meets the complexity requirement than quicksort this is because heapsort has guaranteed o n log n complexity in the worst case whereas quicksort has quadratic worst-case time

45998880
quicksort	heapsort
however heapsort is slower than quicksort in the average case in the sense that heapsort performs c n log n whereas quicksort has d n log n performance with d being significantly smaller than c the numbers c and d are constants

45998880
quicksort	heapsort
in other words the per-comparison-overhead of heapsort is higher than the one of quicksort

45998880
quicksort	heapsort
to get the best of both worlds introsort starts with quicksort â a recursive algorithmâ but when recursion depth gets too high which means it gets into a degenerated worst-case behaviour it switches to heapsort

45998882
os.walk	pathlib
instead of using the old os.walk function it uses modern pathlib functions

45998882
folder	directory
it scans all the files and directory in folder saving the matching file names to the files list and recursively searching any directory it finds

45998887
int	chars
this does allow for portable direct comparison of decimal digit chars and also for reliably finding the int value associated with a decimal digit chars through subtraction

45998906
ubuntu	linux
my os is linux ubuntu

45998923
gsap	scrollmagic
replaced scrollmagic with the non-minified version so it show error messages in console like the missing animation gsap plugin

45998935
google-chrome	firefox
the following code is working in google-chrome but not in firefox and i do not know why

45998935
google-chrome	firefox
so it got it work in google-chrome but not in firefox so far

45998935
google-chrome	firefox
i m just wondering why it works for google-chrome and it doesn t in firefox

45998954
free	malloc
so the answer for the question posed is remove the malloc and the free because the library handles both

45998955

however no matter i use a plugin or placing the code directly in the html viewer of the post i get not result

45999136
versioning	upgrade
to resolve this issue try upgrading your node to the latest versioning 8.4 and also upgrade your angular cli to the latest versioning as shown bellow

45999139
hide	show
based on the response of the authentication api you can use show hide the log-in button

45999183
visualvm	yourkit
you can use visualvm which is free and comes with the jdk or alternativly you can use yourkit which is paid

45999231

45999368
post	get
anything you receive through get or post or whatever sanitize it

45999375
put	get
iâ ve tried with authstate.providerdata.uid but it didnt work so i put the 0 to get into the array and get the uid

45999421
hide	show
in this context it does nothing if it s ok but that might change in the future on errors it should show a popup informing the users that the data could not be loaded and in either case it should hide the loading bar which is also handled through vuex

45999429
put	get	post	get	post	put
the controller actions requiring the get verb works fine but actions with post put that does not return any content will throw a nullreference exception

45999486
filtering	grouping
i ve tried this inside and outside of target s and i ve tried getting the full list in one grouping and then filtering in a separate grouping

45999579
pow	floor
note that your using the double versions pow fmod and floor instead of the long double versions powl fmodl and floorl

45999579
int	chars	int	double
here is a working solution see at ideone for your case converting the double to a std string and iterating through every chars of the string adding that chars converted to an int

45999585
shibboleth	simplesamlphp
so with onelogin you get a solution that will work as soon as you get an account and with simplesamlphp shibboleth you will need to host configure and maintain it

45999611

tunnel	vpn
the airwatch server is configured to tunnel the app s traffic per-app vpn and while the cordova app is open the vpn usage is indicated in the status bar

46000009
git-svn	svn2git
but besides that for a one-time migration git-svn the svn2git tool you use is based on git-svn is not the right tool for conversions of repositories or parts of repositories

46000009
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn or tools based on it but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

46000009
git-svn	svn2git
the svn2git that is based on git-svn suffers from most of the same drawbacks than pur git-svn just working around of some of the issues

46000009
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility

46000009
git-svn	svn2git
if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually

46000009
git-svn	svn2git
the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn

46000009
git-svn	svn2git
you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

46000011
put	get
for example from all the movies i want to get title release_date and the poster_path to put in 2-d table

qtableview	qstyleditemdelegate
if you have thousands of rows then you re gonna have to draw the widgets yourself using qstyleditemdelegate which will paint the widgets inside your qtableview

46000272
getter	setter
3. crete getter and setter for the properties then you will be able to get the properties

46000328
versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade keras as versioning 2.0.7 is the one that contains the legacy_get_updates_support function

46000337
width	height
you need to define in the svg #svg-region inside the modal via css height width that you want that they appear at their maximum

46000369

all negative values will be interpreted as positives 10000000 as signed integer is -128 but as unsigned it is 128

46000480
min	max
another idea that crossed my mind is to find a way to feed an sqlite database from my loaded data and then query it from r i ll only do subset min and max operations on the data

46000480
int	double
my data is only made of int and double if it makes a difference

46000485

46000830
width	height
i want to display viewpager above of buttons but that it have wrap_content height and width

46000847
post	get
for every post you get you need a subroutine for example with a recursive function to use the next parameter in a separate api call to get all comments

46000920
post	get
i think it s better to use post method to make changes in the model data instead of using get so you can write a form like this in your template

46000926
post	put
but i have will put this as a second question as i can post no more links to images

46000927
width	height
its size x y width height

how to get the dynamic values of the input box which was entered in dynamic boxes and send it to post request as i know how to send a static input box value request for multiple how can we send it

46001029
post	get
i thins above i can generate dynamic input box and can remove it but unable to get values so how can generate by using id and post all dynamically generated values to the database

46001034
subtract	add
this code is only correct if methods add and subtract are called from the same thread only

46001065
nsstring	nsobject
all nsstring nsobject nslog are unqualified-id class

46001066

46001248
google-chrome	firefox
i am using google-chrome 60 and firefox 54

46001269
jar	manifest.mf
i hacked together an example using string.class as example and access manifest.mf in meta-inf since the rt.jar has no properties in it at least a quick jar tf rt.jar | grep properties resulted in zero results

46001298
google-chrome	firefox
although it says google-chrome the issue actually comes from firefox

46001369
intersect	contains
there are various methods that are callable on a cgrect such as intersect and contains which will tell you if two cgrects overlap or if one contains the other

i have automated tests setup which runs product tests in 3 browsers on windows ie 11 google-chrome and firefox 55.0.3 and 56.0.b7 were tried

46001429
google-chrome	firefox
but if to run test using jenkins slave running as windows service from the same user it works just with ie 11 and google-chrome but fails with firefox in the beginning

46001493
freemarker	velocity
please see chunk template engine as example which fits well into android app but there are lots of another such as velocity or freemarker

the overflow hidden works perfectly on google-chrome and safari but is not working on firefox

46001606
filtering	grouping
the question is how to summarize movieticket topmost object grouping by show one related object filtering by user other related object with reporting detals from related objects depending on show and sort these results by some aggregated field in the grouping by booked time of recent movieticket in the grouping

46001606
filtering	grouping
it is important to grouping by pk of the nearest related models at least those which are not made constant by the filtering - it is only show because user object is still filtering to one user

46001606
min	max
it is very important to not output or sort any field of the topmost model without encapsulating it by aggregation function min and max functions are good for sampling something from a group because every field not encapsulated by aggregation would be added to group by list that will break the intended groups

46001622
initializer	class-method
instance method can be called only with an instance while class-method can be called on the class initializer or not

46001639
google-chrome	safari
i have tested this scenario in ios and android with safari and google-chrome browsers respectively

46001642
folder	directory
following the instructions in i disabled the play layout and then manually added the source and resource directory which i copied from only modifying the test source and adding my own resource folder

46001699
google-chrome	firefox
but if i open it up in a browser doesnt matter if firefox edge or google-chrome i get the following error

46001706
migrate	makemigrations
thing is to understand what does makemigrations and migrate does

46001706
migrate	makemigrations
so if you would run makemigrations or migrate it would do nothing

46001706
migrate	makemigrations
now when i do makemigrations it works but when i migrate it throws error that already existing

46001706
migrate	makemigrations
so makemigrations and migrate --fake works now without error

46001716
dataframe	multi-index
for example if i define a dataframe with a two-level rows multi-index like that

46001749
pop-up	dialog
after double-tapping the view have that view or copy float and pop-up into the center of the screen like a dialog

46001770
getter	setter
and also define setter and getter methods for each property previously it was not strictly required

46001784
folder	directory
let us say i have some folder in the directory i am in

46001784
folder	directory
now if i want to cd into folder 1 and make a directory there what i would do is

46001858
versioning	upgrade
it seems that you installed a previous ctp versioning of sql server service pack 2 and then upgrade only the dm add-ins

46001869
int	chars
for example if i declare and only use it in a way that it could have and should have been declared since chars uses less memory than int will gcc optimize that or does it not even matter since it will be converted to assembly

46001870
min	max
min max mean etc

46001900
width	height
let size cgsize width 424 2 height 664 2

46001900
width	height
now what i want to make another image which keep leading 20 pixel top 20 pixel and width and height 20 pixel smaller than original background

46001900
width	height
here background image is created with aspect fill but issue is of starting position and complete height and width

46002017
width	height
bring your attention to the fact that zoom level depends on your screen density but width and height of bitmap it is in pixels depend only on your zoom level

46002083
visualvm	jprofiler
you can also go for commercial profilers like jprofiler but visualvm can also do the job perfectly

46002083
profiler	visualvm
visualvm is probably the best profiler to detect delays caused by thread locking

46002143
observer-pattern	mvp
in mvp we directly call an interface function but observer-pattern in mvvm is quite different from these simple interfaces

google-chrome	firefox
this is because in google google-chrome you are not allowed to use webcam js in http for this you have to use proper ssl or you can use other browser like firefox or you can call it in i frame

46002541
getter	setter
i can access it directly without using implicitly synthesized getter and setter in the .m

46002557

46002813
filesystems	ntfs
probably you re just experiencing the not-so-fast performance when creating a lot of small files in an ntfs filesystems

46002813
disk	ram
perhaps to confirm it s a file system performance issue you could create a ram disk to which clone the repo

46002838
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
i have been able to set the div content constant on all zoom levels on google-chrome safari and opera mini but i cant get mozilla to apply the same javascript code to set div constant on the browser on itself

46002838
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
when i set the zoom level more than 100 it sets all the div content as normal on google-chrome safari and opera mini but on mozilla it does the opposite so i am asking how can i set this to be like the other web browser s and does mozilla browser support the syntax in the javascript command below cause this is driving me nuts

46002839
pull	push
it is a surprise to me because in team explorer you can push pull and see all changes

46002932
children	parent
i can generate the parent first level of tree but when i click on the + next to a parent node ex 13000000 i can generate the children nodes to its parent node and console log them but the tree does not update with its children

46003256
post	get
i thought about using a post request instead of a get so i can pass a body with the request

46003256
post	get
switching to a post request simply because there s too much data to fit in a get request makes little sense

46003256
put	get	post	get	post	put
but contrary to this elasticsearch uses post methods to get around the issue of queries being too long to put in a url

46003256
post	get
both http get and http post can be used to execute search with body

46003256
post	get
since not all clients support get with body post is allowed as well

46003256
post	get
or does the difference between post and get not matter as much in modern browsers

46003271
namedtuple	dictionary
numba supports namedtuple in nopython mode which should be a good alternative to a dictionary for passing a large group of parameters into a numba jitted function

46003327

debian gnu linux 9

46003663
sorting	filtering
i know that i can change interface of updatesearchresults to receive query and page as arguments and then i can avoid first setstate to pass values there but it doesn t look like a good solution because when list of search parameters will grow sorting order page size filtering for example then it ll get a bit clumsy

46003698
int	chars
now the c standard says that behaviour on signed int overflow is undefined so with of the result of c + 1 could very conceivably behave as it indeed was 128 even though a variable of type signed chars could not hold that value

46003699
pop-up	dialog
ideally i d want to pop-up a save dialog

46003717
hex	binary
i write function that convert base64 string to base64 hex string and now it is correct converted to display as blob png image...but problem is when i open field in db browser for sqlite it writes this converted value as text and must be written as binary so that the image will be recognized and displayed when i choose image in db browser for sqlite...so the question is how can i insert base64 hex string to sqlite3 database as binary

46003717
hex	binary
so i see that sqlite3 displays inserted base64 hex as text not binary...what i need to write in insert statement to insert it as binary

46003764

46003981
range	min	range	max	min	max
both inputs are mandatory to be filled by the numbers below between or out of the range given in min and max attribute provided which may or may not have decimal numbers

46003981
range	min	range	max	min	max
if number will be below the min range then the text color will turn orange if it is above the max range it will turn red and if the number in input value matches the range it will turn green all these validations will be done by jquery

46003981
range	min	range	max	min	max
issue here is i need to submit myform but because of min max attribute i get this tip value must be less than or equal to 20 or value must be greater than or equal to 10 for the inputs submitted lesser or greater than the range provided in min and max attributes respectively because of this my form does not get submitted

46004011
minimum	max	min	max
the maximum and minimum of the color scales are defined as max variable1 3 na.rm true and min variable1 3 na.rm true and max variable2 3 na.rm true and min variable2 3 na.rm true for variable1 and variable2 respectively

46004011
min	max
to get one color scale for each variable after getting the max and min of two variables based on the original data that was explained i rescaled variable1 3 and variable3 3 altogether

46004038
pull	push
after seeing the error once i will see it the other machine too if i push pull though apparently nothing changed outside the content related logic that i added

46004049
min	max
the min and max attributes are used by the browsers to perform form validation

i m trying to get the user s facebook picture to show up right next to his her comments for a specific post

46004205
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
putting the 16px margin on the right eliminates the need for removing it from the first element with a separate rule and margins that overflow the containing element don t matter as they aren t included when calculating width and height

46004205
margin	height
the important thing in this method is that the height of the dummy div be the same as the height + top margin of the floated elements

46004235
ffmpeg	handbrake
just wonder this could be done in handbrake or ffmpeg

46004235

finally my pojo with the standard getter and setter omitted here to reduce clutter

46004334
children	parent
it only shows the children one so the parent is somehow forgotten

46004334
children	parent
is there any way i can inherit the parent and modify extend in the children

46004334
inherited	properties
edit 2 properties are inherited somehow

46004334

i have checked my .htaccess in the public directory etc httpd conf httpd.conf and etc httpd conf.d phpmyadmin.conf to make sure no redirects are configured but have not found anything

46004373
int	chars
you can test each chars as a digit and simultaneously convert to a list of int

46004398

46004456
swift	objective-c
your question is tagged as objective-c but it should be easy enough to convert the swift code above to objective-c since you would use the same uicolor api

46004467
folder	directory
why not have your file folder inside the tomcat bin and refer the directory from your code

46004499
put	get
put that command in a for-loop and add the size to an accumulator and you ll get the total size of all the files in a directory

46004519
sse	avx
they are not however generally useful directly to implement std memory_order_acquire or std memory_order_release operations on std atomic objects larger than 8 bytes because there is no guarantee of atomicity for sse or avx loads and stores of larger than 8 bytes

46004527
fflush	gets
if some other core processor manages to allocate that memory range again quickly enough and starts filling it with new data can it happen that the new data gets concurrently overwritten by the old cache being fflush by the current core

46004568

46004647
multiplying	add
as you need a loop anyway to multiplying each element you can add a line to check and set the maximum value

46004656
subtract	add
but that requires the setmonth implementation to care about the number of days in the months in question not just add subtract a fixed duration

46004656
subtract	add
according to this thread the moment.js approach is to add subtract the number of milliseconds in 30 days which suggests that library would be prone to the same inconsistencies

46004665
dictionary	map
json is basically a dictionary and in your models you can modify the save function and map the dictionary keys to the corresponding model field

46004748
folder	directory
how do i set the current working folder to the directory the batch file is in rather than the windows system32 directory

46004842
post	get
a way to get constant data server side when the client post the same json

46004850
express	node.js
the closest you could come would be to run an http server and write a server side program via perl + psgi + fastcgi node.js + express or even bash + cgi which acted as a wrapper around those commands

46004867
folder	directory
both my excel and python ipynb file are in the same folder the python directory appears to be the same

46004930
move	drag
the ideal ui would that you have to drag from the drag-icon but that when you do you see the whole row of elements move at least in chrome as i know draggable can look different between browsers

46005112
xctest	kif
though some have pointed out that the issue may not be because of kif and rather because of xctest itself

46005174
swift	objective-c
but even more than objective-c i would write the code in swift

46005258
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can wire the mouseenter and mouseleave commands on your controls to set a helptext property in your viewmodel and then bind the status bar label to helptext so that when it is set to something new the new value appears in the status bar

46005297

46005389
subtract	add
and some know that processors dont subtract they add instead so

46005389
x86	mips
so from one architecture to the next arm mips avr x86 etc if you want to use that flag well not mips you read the documentation or do an experiment as the docs are not that good on this topic

46005389
subtract	add
sometimes the add with carry or subtract with borrow instructions will hint at which way that architecture works inverts the carry flag on the way out of a subtract

46005568
union	distinct
instead use just union and remove distinct from the individual queries

put	get
but if you give us more information there s probably a better way to get the result probably a user-function instead of the built-in sumif directly put in the cell

46005620
versioning	upgrade
either you upgrade your system to get an newer versioning or get some pre-packaged newer python versioning like anaconda

my current guess is a 3 dimensional array of width height and rgb values or 2 dimensional array for a monochrome image

46005651
scenekit	metalkit
mtkmeshbufferallocator is part of metalkit and scenekit won t know what to do with the allocation

depending on your os your package directory might be one of these and for most of the packages just extract the content to this folder with it s root folder as the name

46005705
equals	gethashcode
surely they are equals and comparing both returns of gethashcode returns true as well

46005705
equals	gethashcode
i have checked this and this too however i cannot figure out how to create a default for every reference type for this struct that complies with the gethashcode concept two objects that are equals return hash codes that are equals

46005719
restrict	shared
modern browsers do have webworkers which allow additional threads of javascript but those threads are very restrict in what they can do for example they cannot access the dom and in how they can communicate with the main javascript thread all communication is via messaging - direct function calls or shared variables are not allowed

qgraphicsview	qgraphicsitem
qgraphicsview qgraphicsitem don t implement it

46005913

there s no way to bolt this on externally - you need to add such support directly to qgraphicsview and qgraphicsitem infrastructure and then have the qchartview leverage it

46005970

int	chars
for d4 because there is no int at start and so chars is type-casted to string before append

46034505
int	chars
you have an int value 2 and a chars value d

46034505
int	chars
2d would be a string so neither an int nor a chars

46034505
int	chars
so it was decided that int plus chars results in int taking the numeric value of the chars

46034505
int	chars
this works for almost every combination of int and chars so that was the chosen behaviour

46034505
int	chars
getting the numeric value of the chars like in int + chars would result in 100test which would be very unexpected

i would like to receive information only for one class about its parent and children but for the next nested class i do not need this information how can this be better achieved

int	double
also now i finally found that double olaf mentioned that alone conversion to int for the remaining math of course incurs huge performance penalty probably even in hundreds of cycles

46037757
int	double
and you must switch from double to int as the microblaze cpu doesn t have fpu unit so the floating values are emulated by int math just the initial conversion to int must cost quite some cycles you should see that in debugger if you have disassembly view and step into it by single instruction

46037805
migrate	makemigrations
when you finish editing the fake migration file just execute python manage.py migrate no python manage.py makemigrations

46037841
for-loop	arrays
i am currently not able to test it but i since foreach is a member function of arrays and not of nsfastenumeration from which results inherits i think you cannot use foreach on a results instance so you need to use a regular for-loop to do this

46037881
dplyr	tidyr
so we build a lookup table and then use tidyr and dplyr

46037914
uicollectionview	uitableview
since uitableview or uicollectionview inherit from uiscrollview they basically do not have an intrinsiccontentsize

for-loop	arrays
if you run a for-loop and add these results in an arrays you will effectively get a full distribution of negative and positive numbers

46038380
int	double
sum type should be float or double not int

46038380
int	double
factorial int n must be able to return very big numbers so its return type should be double too

for-loop	loops
is it best to try this with a while do + while loops or is a for-loop better

46038582
put	get
the last two are still a work in progress but basically i can save my queries by copying and pasting them into the lower text area and clicking save text and they get appended to the notes tab and with a little care of escaping the single quotes i can copy them into the first two fields of the qry tab or sheet and when you click get queries they all get copied up to the dialog and you can click on them to put them in the top text area which is where the program expects to find sql queries

46038590
folder	directory
the two things i essentially changed was to make sure that the nspersistantstoredescription was pointing directly at the sql file rather than it s directory as above and that i copied all three files .sqlite .sqlite-shm and .sqlite-wal to the documents folder

46038622
tax	shipping
i got 1 for the tax as the 3 shipping cost

46038629

46041569
swift	objective-c
when you explicitly try to add name and details properties to your extension swift 3 notices that the extension is on an nsobject subclass and automatically exposes the properties to objective-c

46041569
swift	objective-c
swift 4 doesn t automatically expose everything to objective-c anymore so you won t get this error there and in swift 3 you can work around this by adding the nonobjc keyword

46041569
swift	objective-c
the only reason the retroactive protocol didn t work was because you didn t have nullability specifiers in your objective-c class so swift didn t know whether they could be nil or not and thus interpreted types as string

now i have sequence and sequence items separately for both encoder and decoder input agents

also since both agents are generating items decoder should not send an item before it receives data from encoder agent via passive encoder agent monitor

int	chars
the int types in c are chars short int long long long and enum

46073296
int	chars
â the rank of long long int shall be greater than the rank of long int which shall be greater than the rank of int which shall be greater than the rank of short int which shall be greater than the rank of signed chars

46073296
integer	unsigned
â the rank of any unsigned integer type shall equal the rank of the corresponding signed integer type if any

46073296
integer	unsigned
â an object or expression with an integer type other than int or unsigned int whose integer conversion rank is less than or equal to the rank of int and unsigned int

46073296
int	chars
what this somewhat cryptic text means in practice is that _bool chars and short and also int8_t uint8_t etc are the small int types

46073296
integer	unsigned
this text is often misunderstood as all small signed integer types are converted to signed int and all small unsigned integer types are converted to unsigned int

46073296
unsigned	short
the unsigned part here only means that if we have for example an unsigned short operand and int happens to have the same size as short on the given system then the unsigned short operand is converted to unsigned int

46073296
unsigned	short
but in case short is a smaller type than int it is always converted to signed int regardless of it the short was signed or unsigned

46073296
int	chars
the harsh reality caused by the int promotions means that almost no operation in c can be carried out on small types like chars or short

46073296
int	chars
for example an expression containing two unsigned chars operands would get the operands promoted to int and the operation carried out as int

46073296
int	chars
both unsigned chars operands are promoted to type int the operation is carried out on type int and the result of x - y is of type int

46073296
integer	unsigned
otherwise if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned

46073296
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

46073296
integer	unsigned
signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned

46073296
integer	unsigned
all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type then

46073296
integer	unsigned
the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the

46073296
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type

46073327

min	max
edited i add it may be useful for someone an image of the problem in the first workflow the two points of the extent - ll and ur - far from raster even if on a different raster respect to the one above in the question and the solution suggested by mkennedy that works fine using four points unprojecting all four corners of the raster ll ul ur lr and then taking the min max of the 8 values

46079229
min	max
taking the true min max the results are more closely as in the 2nd workflow

i have read about metaclass which seem overkill and got my hopes high on this which has a separate instance for parent and subclassing

46079554
for-loop	loops
edit 1 i will add a pseudocode to explain how this could be solved with a double for-loop but since i have around 6000 samples and 10000 lines loops solution is not an option for me

you d need js i d suggest to set the height and width of the rotated element to fit the parent div

46079839
int	chars
when you type a it should increment the int with index 65 so that when you print the chars with the value 65 it gives you a

46079839
int	chars
here when you type a it s incrementing int number 17 65 - 48 which is some special chars

46079876
int	chars
getchar returns an unsigned chars casted to an int to accomodate for eof so an array of length 256 is enough to capture all chars

46079971

46080546
sorting	filtering
this far it would be noticable that the conditional filtering sided with a sorting order is able to make you feel the keyboard melting between your hands from the heat emitted by your chipset it s really wise to use a graph generator or an intelligent information digger for larger records

keras	tensorflow
interestingly the output shows that keras is using tensorflow version 1.3.0 which is the cpu version and not 0.12.1 the gpu version

46080634
keras	tensorflow
i guess now i need to figure out how to have keras use the gpu version of tensorflow

range	minimum
we re using subtotal which skips filtered rows to get a minimum of the visible range and this will be fed into indirect

46080734

46081327
getter	setter
the beauty of jaxb is it doesnot call the setter and it uses the same list from ther getter

46081334
getter	setter
to avoid this drawback just use the simple jsonignore but keep in mind that therefore getter and setter will be ignored during serialization

46082506
spaces	delimiter
first of all this is not a duplicate of any of the various questions about url matching regexes here on stackoverflow since it deals with a specific case looking in attributes values and it s not so much about what the url text contains but rather about its delimiter in html attributes values could also be about its typical position in attributes values it s always the first spaces separated part of a comma+space delimiter subgroup in a say srcset attribute value

46082506
width	height
for example a.22x would be a match but not typical width height or pixel descriptors that you can find in srcset values 600w or 1.2x

46082506
spaces	delimiter
order-based approach an url in an attribute s value is always the first spaces delimiter part of a comma+space delimiter subgroup or the whole string if it s a single url if there are no spaces or comma+spaces in the string

post	put
for verbs like post put and patch you d normally have the above json body as the content of a flow file and pass that to invokehttp setting the correct verb and url there

46082973
post	get
the good news is that the elasticsearch rest api for the search endpoint supports both get and post

46082973
post	get
from their latest doc both http get and http post can be used to execute search with body

46082973
post	get
since not all clients support get with body post is allowed as well.

get put into their own arrays so i have something like this

46084153
ready	each
finally once you are ready to save the data structure back to the database you can get the hierarchy data structure from the visualization using the d3.select rootnodeclassorid .data function and then write your own custom function to parse through the hierarchy structure and flatten it out where you have the parent uuid attached to each node

46084157
super	self
for python 2 you d need to set the metaclass a different way and call super providing the current class object and self explicitly which makes it less nice but then python 2 is generally less nice at this point so consider writing new code for python 3

i m not sure but i speculate that on stock markets you use both min and max as reference in different time interval

46085746
min	max
you choose min as reference when your price is rising and max when your price is falling

46085779

46085955
multiplying	multiplication
i read some posts and i know that pandas dataframe when using multiplying is able to automatically only do an elementwise multiplication on data-pairs where the date is the same so if one df has timeseries for 1999-2017 and the other only has 2012-2015 then only common dates between 2012-2015 will be multiplied the intersection subset of the data set - so this problem about understanding the error message s and the solution - the whole problem is related to calculating btc_dkk variable and plotting it which is the price for bitcoin in the currency dkk .

46086190
children	parent
to be able to pass props to the children from a parent when the form is submitted in the parent you need to save submit values in the component state or in redux or whatever state you able to use and pass state as a prop to the children

46086289
sse	avx
background on why sse avx is a problem

46086289
sse	avx
when avx was first introduced they could have defined the behaviour of legacy sse instructions to zero the upper lane which would have avoided the need for vzeroupper and having a saved-upper state or false dependencies

46086289
sse	avx
instead of making avx unsafe to enable on windows systems using such drivers intel designed avx so the legacy sse versions left the upper lane unmodified

46086289
sse	avx
we have binary-only software distribution for microsoft windows to thank for intel s decision to inflict the pain of sse avx transition penalties

46086289
sse	avx
so any kernel built with avx support will support it in every driver module raid5 raid6 that wants to use sse or avx even a non-avx-aware binary-only kernel module assuming it was correctly written rather than saving restoring a couple xmm or ymm regs itself

46086289
sse	avx
windows has a similar future-proof save restore mechanism kesaveextendedprocessorstate that lets you use sse avx code in kernel code but not interrupt handlers

46086299
accessor	properties
the intermediateserializer by default only serializes public fields or properties with both public get and set accessor

46086338
width	height
since the content view is managed by ios the webview will always be the width of the tableview and the height will be whatever you provide in the delegate method heightforrow

i have seen numerous tutorials of rest-assured that tell me how to script for a get request that has headers and how to script for a post method

46086474
for-loop	arrays
the way i understand it this bug probably affects quite a bit of code in the wild-- anywhere a member small arrays is the subject of a c++11 range-based for-loop

46086503
stdout	stderr
simply check the stdout stderr of the command for any warnings indicating such checksum failure was fatal

so i am using brackets to code and i am very new to programming i put a div element around my image so i could edit it in css but for some reason the width and height are not changing

46086621
width	height
you need to give the width and the height to the image not the div

46087053
width	height
a child canvas element is present but with width height and style attributes not reflecting the changes made to the parent a-scene

46087160
int	chars
i can see potential problems with undecidable sets arising for infinite types like int but could it even be implemented for finite types like chars where even the power set has finite cardinality

46087164
for-loop	arrays	int	chars
in your code on line in the for-loop does no more point to an arrays --the compiler has no information about the length of the variable that it s pointing at whether it is an arrays a single chars or an int or something else-- but it is just a plain pointer presumably a pointer pointing to a default int

46087244
post	get
for details see the when browsers must internally set origin to a value thatâ ll get serialized as null part of the answer at when does firefox set the origin header to null in post requests

46087320
width	height
after playing with this a bit the solution is to set the a-scene s style attribute and not the a-scene s width height attributes

46087331

i need a call to subclass.foo to get all class annotations from subclassing and superclass

46087372
superclass	subclassing
after adding the annotation docannotation super annotation to subclassing that s the same one as in superclass it actually shows up twice once for its use in subclassing and once for its use in superclass

46087373
put	get
the simplest way to get where you want to be is to put all the socket interaction in one thread

46087462
hide	show
it s just related with input keyup event so if you want to check the input s value to hide show the button

46087462
hide	show
make it independent with submit it should be hide show before the submit

46087476
google-chrome	firefox

46087599
width	height
with the current version ngraphics svgreader class it looks like it s rendering the svg at the dimensions specified by the width and height attributes and optionally constrained to viewbox or viewport attributes in the svg file

46087599
width	height
to get a sharp image you will need to have the width and height of the svg to be as large or larger than the expected canvas of the target

46087693
hide	show
i then added an active prop to mapbody to add show hide css classes
