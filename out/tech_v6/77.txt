11700376
getter	setter
why would you use global variable and getter setter

11700411
client-side	server-side
instead of that client-side script you should probably use server-side code which by the way already knows day and month names in all cultures of the world

if your clients must use http and post get requests then use a http flavoured binding

11700740

11700748
subtract	add
curiously if you try 1e9999999999999999999999999999998 or 1e10000000000000000000000000000000 add or subtract one from the power you get inf and 0 respectively

11701046
width	height
now the resizing of the images works great but only when the jquery slider source file is not included so somewhere in the jquery file there are width and height calculaters that messes the resizing up and i believe it is this part

11701086
portrait	landscape
if in landscape mode activity x will display both fragments a and b if in portrait mode if nothing is selected and the selection stored via whatever means feel free to mention potential decent ways fragment a will be shown by x when something is selected or if something was selected fragment b will be shown by activity y

11701086
implements	extends
should i instead do what i d probably do in wxwidgets where i extends a class for basically everything and have my own class for the button which implements onclicklistener and hence can have it s own onclick method

11701086

11701121
width	height
this can be done only with css as follows change the width and height according to your image size

11701171
isotope	masonry
you should probably look at masonry s big brother isotope here

11701208
portrait	landscape
so does this mean i have to implement listeners for fragment b in both activity a and b am guessing that when in landscape orientation activity a would load up fragment c and in portrait b takes over

11701301

but here comment in for-loop becomes 0 and 1 only i mean not an object but just a string how can i iterate over this arrays

11701640

if your links are static use any advanced text editor notepad++ gedit textmate etc. and pick search and replace

i think you d be better off using a search and replace in a program like notepad++ or sublimetext

11701688
mdpi	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi
densities however my issues is that although i have done image sizes of 36x36 for the lpdi screens and tested this small screens via the emulator i found that 48x48 to be too small for the mdpi normal size screens and from here the 72x72 too small for the hdpi large and the 96x96 for the xhdpi xlarge

11701688
mdpi	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi
what i did do was make the mdpi 72x72 but still found that the 96x96 was still too small for the hdpi large screens

11701699
for-loop	loops
after connection.query my for-loop is always given a value that escapes loops

11701721
client-side	server-side
the best is without a doubt zebra_form a jquery augmented php library for creating and validating html forms provides both server-side and client-side validation client-side validation is done using jquery 1.5.2+ and has a lot of predefined rules that can be used out of the box

11701738
mdpi	hdpi
if you want to make a button image design it to fit the button at your resolution say 100px square mdpi and then scale it for the other resolutions 75px - ldpi 150px - hdpi 200px xhdpi

11701768
versioning	upgrade
the only thing to keep in mind is that anything that s not included in whichever specialized versioning you re using may need to be upgrade but that s simply a matter of clicking check for upgrade under help after running the new versioning for the first time

11701776
width	height
then you set the options width height time_base and pix_fmt like you did

11701809
for-loop	loops
see also javascript for-loop unexpected behaviour or javascript closure inside loops √¢ simple practical example

11701853
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

11701920
put	get	post	put	post	get
i need to call get post put etc

11701965
parentviewcontroller	navigationcontroller
in your case the parentviewcontroller is the navigationcontroller if that is how you presented

11701983
for-loop	arrays
note that you need to know the size beforehand when you declare an arrays so you will have to move the creation of the arrays to just before the for-loop

11701993
folder	directory
now i created a new folder project with files in the var www directory server root directory

11702007

jar	war
it won t work if you drop this jar into a ear war with it s own constraints and a validationmessages.properties in the root of the classpath

11702166
inherited	properties
if you take the example function from the linked question and loop over an instance you will get all enumberable properties both inherited and direct

11702166
inherited	properties
it did not log the nonenumerable properties that were inherited from object.prototype like tostring or isprototypeof

11702166
inherited	properties
that is explained well in the answers the function only takes own properties into account not the ones inherited from the prototype

11702166
inherited	properties
this applies both on normal properties and those inherited from their prototypes

11702193
copying	overwrite
first you probably meant rather than in the malloc second you re copying end-start+1 symbols from the original buffer and then overwrite the last one with 0 which probably isn t the intended behavior

11702214
post	get
but i want just before i make that ajax post to get 3 4 and change text style like

11702220
hide	show
then for each li you check whether its text contains any of the words and show or hide appropriately

11702243
binutils	automake
do you have make autconf automake binutils bison installed m4 or install the package to build a kernel or reinstall ruby pg gem #39

11702252
int	chars
the simple perl pattern for matching an int followed by that number of any chars is just

11702306
hide	show
if you roll over the homeslider the slideinfo hide itself -slideinfoheight and show itself when you roll out

11702336
children	parent
but when i click one of the options the whole popping up activity fires again because it are the children of the parent and so he recognizes the class where the children are catched in

11702372
put	get
there s no constructor call made in your case what you get is an array of 100 pointers that either happen to be filled with zeroes or the compiler has put a code to do so

11702393
udp	tcp
in this instance the protocol json-rpc the transport tcp udp stream etc and the types are all known at compile time so there is no reason to do a vtable dispatch.

11702393
boost	stl
almost every stl or boost header you include adds thousands or 10 s of thousands of lines of code that must be processed per-object-file most of it redundant

11702408

11702435
opera	firefox
i tested it and it works on firefox and opera

11702443

11702537
versioning	upgrade
create a locally patched versioning and store it separately from the main code so it doesn t disappear in an upgrade

11702640
width	font-size
if you raise the font-size the width will also rise

11702681
width	font-size
if you are increasing the font-size you should change padding and width also

chameleon	jinja2
pyramid and chameleon and jinja2 all support python 3 see the python 3 porting page on the pyramid project wiki

11702742
min	max
you actually don t need setting min max width anyway

11702761
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r www-data www-data myrepo

11702791
chown	chmod
the first issue can be solved by running chown or chmod on new view file right after executing mkview command

11702807
mouseover	mousedown
3 events inside a view is something that listens to dom events click mouseover mousedown etc and of course you will know which dom element was triggered the .bind or let s say .on does something when an .trigger is called the entire backbone code is full of custom triggers so that you can if you wish to be notified of model.add model.remove collection.reset etc

11702811
rtp	sdp
if your browser does support rtp for html5 videos try setting the src attribute url to point to the sdp file describing the streams put the sdp file on an http server and set the src attribute to point to it

11702824
int	boolean
in c++ int can basically be used for boolean checks right

11702837
portrait	landscape
sheet i tried horizontal i tried 2x3 in portrait and landscape i tried all possible arrangements for the images and what i found was that the order of the stars made absolutely no difference i didn t really expect it to given the image is indexed and so all that changed was the palette being rearranged but the vertical layout produced a smaller file than any other

11702847
width	height
when i initialize object a it creates a grid cell with a specified width and height

11702852
ssl	https
as peehaa pointed out you can use https to encrypt your http stream with ssl tls

11702865
int	boolean
there is a primitive library in it such as boolean dobules int etc

11702869

padding will add to the overall height and or width of the element

11702869
box-sizing	border-box
you can alter this behaviour with box-sizing border-box

11702936
post	get
at the moment i can test if a key is correct by comparing the output but i cannot bruteforce 16 character keys for obvious reasons reading other post it was my understanding that having the data i have it might be possible to get the key

11702938
width	height
the image resource has a width number of pixel columns and a height number of pixel rows

11702938
width	height
the physical width and height of the image as it appears on the pdf page is determined by the value of the ctm current transformation matrix at the time of the do operator

11702938
width	height
if the ctm would equal the identity matrix the physical width and height would be 1 pt high and 1 pt wide

11702938
width	height
the image height would be 300 pts and the image width would be 400 pts

11702959
strdup	malloc	strcpy	strdup	strcpy	malloc
i ve also switched between using strdup and malloc strcpy for allocating the strings but that didn t seem to have any effect

11703001
post	get
although performance is one of the key elements this is not a feature in nosql it is more a consequence of design what i think is the feature is the flexibility of its data structure and the possibility to store information in a single row avoiding multiple round trips when you work with records that are close related take a look of this post to get a better understanding of what i m talking about

11703016
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this will return something like firefox opera safari etc

11703018
google-chrome	firefox
here is the code tested on google-chrome and firefox

11703068
google-chrome	firefox
this setup works fine in firefox and google-chrome but ie doesn t like it

11703080
folder	directory
already created some files or directory in the cache folder so they are owned be the web servers user probably www-data

11703080

11703203
google-chrome	firefox
can you see what line returns the error in the console you using google-chrome firefox with firebug

11703233
folder	directory
from the error you could see the electromart folder is missing in the path and when you move to another machine the directory structure might change too depending on how the server is setup

11703238
listview	gridview
it s similar to a listview so if you ve worked with a listview then a gridview should be okay

11703263
integer	fractions
with integer division you get truncation which means the fractions part of the result is thrown away

11703265
java.util.calendar	simpledateformat
you cannot extract them from simpledateformat afaik but you could use java.util.calendar to extract the date components using its method

11703275
int	double
this statement is undefined behavior because the argument has to be of type double and 9 5 is of type int

11703277
gson	jackson
and then binding or using gson or other data-binding library like jackson

11703282
hide	show
the idea is to show the popover when you click the button and to hide the popover when you click outside the button

11703314
writetofile	nsdata
i m not sure about the nsfilehandle result when writing data but i would suggest using nsdata s writetofile atomically method as the atomically flag achieves just what you re asking about - it guarantees that either all data is written or none is

11703334
mouseover	mouseout
while it represents an element which has a pointing device over it there is neither a mouseover pseudo-class for an element that has just been pointed to nor a mouseout pseudo-class for an element that has just been pointed away from

google-chrome	firefox
this works for google-chrome firefox and ie9

11703357

11703411
rss	feed
apple appstore provides you with an rss feed to get the latest apps submitted into the app store into your favorite feed reader

11703411
rss	feed
i was wondering if google play store has an rss feed as well that lets you do the same

11703447
wadl	wsdl
you just have to look out for other places the service endpoint might show up such as in wsdl wadl xsd references etc.

11703465
rss	feed
edit some 3rd parties do seem to have a feed available though follow the android market with an rss reader for beginners

11703490

what about addition subtraction division

11703619

in the flex layout model the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction in any order independent of source order and can flex their sizes either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent

11703651
min	max
you could then store the max and min lat and long along with that point in the database

11703684

implements	extends
if you are worrying about code duplication then you could implements a base activity for which you implements the callback to show fragment c and make your two activities extends from that base class

11703735
portrait	landscape
as you didn t post any real code on how you manage those fragments keep in mind that if you are in the portrait orientation in the b activity showing fragment b and by clicking or whatever you do you replace the fragment with c this will not be carried to activity a if you switch orientation to landscape

config	ini
the other traditional mechanism config files--whether xml ini .properties or whatever--help store config data between runs but do nothing to organize config options for the program code or during its execution

11703813
instances	transient
√¢ √¢ transient config √¢ √¢ if you need configs options changeable on the fly --say for the scope of a given method invocation--the method can extend the instances option chained mapping

11703828
folder	directory
initially i was getting reference errors because d3.js was not in the right folder however once i put it in the war directory they went away so the problem can t be a reference error

11703925
profiling	instrumentation
i ve spend the past week till now firing up instrumentation using the time profiling allocations and core animation tool to optimize as much as i can

11704049
accessor	properties
now with arc and synthesized accessor properties you do not have to care about all this

11704049
accessor	properties
it is definitely recommended to use the accessor and to not set ivars directly if there is a setter method in other words if you have a properties use its setter by calling self.property newvalue

11704083
inherited	properties
prototype properties points to the object that you have inherited

11704114

11704161
sudo	passwd
sudo apt-get purge php5 which will then prompt you for a passwd then proceed with removing php assuming you have the php package standalone and not bundled in with some preconfigured lamp stack but then again it should still work generally speaking so long as the version is right

11704255
getter	setter
let s say i have a java pojo class that looks like this assume getter and setter for me

11704258
implements	extends
generally speaking you would switch your addchild calls to addelement and you would have to change your other classes that currently extends sprite movieclip displayobject to extends something like group so that they implements the necessary interfaces for flex application to work with them generally it expects more things than lower level flash objects provide since it has the layoutmanager popupmanager component life cycle etc.

11704258
implements	extends
in some cases you may want to stick with your current lower level extension say extends sprite and just implements ivisualelement yourself

11704286
int	chars
what i am trying to say that 0 s and 1 s are neither int nor chars nor decimal values

11704286
int	chars
if you decide to see them as int then the 01101010 will be seen as the number 106 6a in hexadecimal which is written 0x6a while if you decide to see these bits as chars then the bits will be seen as the letter j

11704286
int	chars
so when you are creating a pointer you are saying that you want to treat the bits as a memory address not an int not a chars not a decimal value etc.

11704286
int	chars
theoretically speaking if all types of pointers will reserve the same number of bits in the memory why don t we use a chars pointer to point to an int variable like

11704286
int	chars
as i said before an int will take 4 bytes in the memory while a chars will only take 1 byte

11704288
serializable	deserialization
you can then write the serializable deserialization yourself

11704621
sorting	filtering
it s likely that mongo isn t using an index for both filtering and sorting

11704639

11704699
mamp	wamp
the major difference between this question and other questions here is that this is not to connect to a wamp or mamp stack but a remote database

11704741
onresume	onpause
to set and reset variables i think you can use the onpause onresume oncreate activity overrides to decide when to update your variables

if you want the bar to be resizable set its height and width to percentage amounts of the container height and width

11704748

11704760
bellman-ford	floyd-warshall
you are correct about the first two questions and about the goal of floyd-warshall finding the shortest paths between all pairs but not about the relationship between bellman-ford and floyd-warshall both algorithms use dynamic programming to find the shortest path but fw isn t the same as running bf from each starting node to every other node

11704765

in my app i would like to have something quite similar to android s built in popup menu see link below but it also needs to include checkbox and images and i should be able to choose several checkbox before closing with the same button that opened it

11704767
visualvm	jhat
using visualvm or tools like jmap and jhat would be the best way to figure out what is actually still on the heap

11704775
mvp	presenter
you might also think about using model-view-presenter mvp presenter first

11704785
oncreate	setcontentview
i can make this happen with the minimal project where oncreate does nothing more than call super and setcontentview

11704807

width	height	cos	sin
since you know the starting point the width height of the image and the angle or cos sin of those you will have the exact coordinate of the end point

11704865
cos	sin
be advised...the exactness here is not really what you might have understood because we may the thing is we will have calculation errors in cos sin values

11704904

11705421
scrypt	pbkdf2
in my opinion the best approach to take is to pick a password hashing algorithm bcrypt pbkdf2 scrypt and then tune the work factor to give you the best tradeoff between speed and security given the computing resources available to you and the characteristics of your system

11705441
for-loop	arrays
notice the for-loop in this function which is simply adding each of the permissionid values from the userpermissions arrays to the userpermissions observablearray of the useraccount

this suggests to me you are using debian or ubuntu i don t think a vanilla gcc build from the fsf sources would have that in the specs

11705877
ubuntu	debian
the multi arch support in recent debian ubuntu releases moves library directories and so breaks vanilla gcc i think debian and ubuntu patch the gcc code for their .deb packages.

pow	sqrt
currently the tool i wrote only supports mul div add sub sqrt pow frac and sum as those are the only set of operations i need to handle and the imposed limitations can be a bit loose by providing a preprocessor see preproc.l for an maybe not-so-good example that would clean away the raw latex input

qimage	qpainterpath	qpainter	qimage
but if you can live with limited precision and if your path is guaranteed to have one y value to any possible x then you can approximate it by rendering the qpainterpath onto a black and white qimage as a qpainter and scan through each line in the image to find which line has pixel x marked

11710898
uilabel	uibutton
you should use addsubview only to add a true subview a uilabel a uiimageview a uibutton etc. or the child view if doing proper view controller containment etc. to a view

11710943
ienumerable	ilist
the difference between ienumerable and ilist is the enumerable doesn t contain any data it contains an iterator that goes through the data as you request the new one for example with a foreach loop

11710952
awt	swing
can this generated code use only the basic java packages swing awt and not any other package provided by the ide

11710983
children	parent
i tried using this find parent next and children to no avail

11711007
min	max
the objects at the leaf level belong to all three heaps this is where elements transition from the min part to the max part of the heap

11711007
min	max
now one can compute the sizes of the min heap and max heap use a partial sorting such as quickselect to partition the data and bulk load the three parts individually

11711007
min	max
or we can look at heaps of size 7 3 levels and discern min and max types

11711007
min	max
ensuring that for min levels we have the first type and for max levels we have the second type

11711007
min	max
this also is essentially an interleaved min and max heap

11711012
hash	md5
nobody seems to have mentioned hashing yet - with a strong hash algorithm ie sha-2 and not md5 it should be much safer

mousemove	mouseup
the function repositions the element based on the change in location of the mouse which is queried by handlers added to the root document element for captured mousemove and mouseup events

11711071
mousemove	mouseup
it is important to note that the mousemove and mouseup handlers are registered as capturing event handlers because the user may move the mouse faster than the document element can follow it and some of these events occur outside the original target element

11711084
mouse	keyboard
wm_lbuttonup etc to manage your mouse and keyboard states - as many still detest dinput8

11711094
children	parent
so your code might look like this assuming children rely on existence of parent and not the other way around

11711095
google-chrome	safari
it works in safari on the mac but not in google-chrome or in ios

11711120
children	parent
you are breaking this by declaring that both the parent owns all children but also that each child own it s parent

11711120
children	parent
smart pointer can have their own meaning for swapping children between parent but for general usage you should accept raw pointers

11711137

up to this point you are correct though short is not guaranteed to be 2 bytes long like int is not guaranteed to be 4 √¢ the only guaranteed size by standard if i remember correctly is chars which should always be 1 byte wide

11711593
put	get
one issue is that you will need to put a lot of fingerprints and they will need to be subtle if a attacker can get two copies of the program and can compare the files between the two he will be able to tell what is the identifying information and just put whatever they want in so they can t tell who they got it from

11711608

with crossrider you can develop extensions to all major browsers - google-chrome internet explorer firefox and safari with only javascript

11712050
processors	hyperthreading
i m going to go out on a limb and guess that you have 4 processors or 2 with hyperthreading

11712058
openfeint	scoreloop
the openfeint sdk is no longer supported so the best choice will be to use scoreloop or something else

11712067

this is the code which i have written in my button1clickevent initially when i click on the button i do get a width and height but when i change the size of my jframe and then again i click on button1 i get the same width and height as i got earlier.the values are not changing anytime

11712175
width	height
the reason imshow is not working is that the value returned by read ... is height x width x colors x numframes where height is the height of the video width is the width of the video colors is the number of colors usually 3 and numframes is the number of frames you read

11712222
fadein	fadeout
secondly when writing javascript case does matter and its fadein and fadeout notice capital letters

11712252
fixed-point	fractions
the most obvious solution is to use a small unsigned type since you don t need negative values using a fixed-point representation so that a value of 1 represents some fractions of a radian

11712252
unsigned	short
if you use a 16-bit unsigned type typically unsigned short that gives you 13 bits after the binary point so a value of 1 represents 2 -13 radian

11712252
floating-point	integer
integer values are easier to deal with than floating-point

11712256
clearance	devise
i ve modified my devise table user to have a clearance column

11712256
clearance	devise
unlike all the examples i m reading my clearance role in the examples is not a separate table with a relationship but is its own column in the devise table user

11712256
clearance	cancan
apperantly however cancan thinks that my user confirmed clearance level of 2 falls under the else provision and therefore i can only read posts

i get this one using the post method as it is uncommented below

11712386
put	get	post	put	post	get
i get this one if i use the commented-out put method with post commented out

11712386
post	put
and this one mixing and matching put and post

11712412
postgresql	mysql
support of database mysql postgresql migrations schema changes loading data etc.

11712413
quicksort	heapsort
heapsort although somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort it has the advantage of a more favorable worst-case o n log n runtime

11712414
quicksort	heapsort
in their respective worst cases heapsort is faster than quicksort

11712414
quicksort	heapsort
that is actually the reason such hybrid algorithms as introsort exist introsort begins with quicksort and switches to heapsort if it sees that quicksort is struggling with this specific input

11712487
put	get
however when i put this in some method say showmypdffile and try to call that on commandlink pdf doesn t get open

11712530
google-chrome	firefox
everything works great with google-chrome but not with firefox

11712532
disk	ram
like they say above image file size on disk is only important for deploying your application on google play users will download less but on ram the image is completely raw which means every single pixel counts example a completely red 128x128 bitmap takes up the same space as a completely colorful one having both exact same color depth

11712546
move	drag
everything works ok that is the time counts down but the problem is that i have a uitableview in the application and if i touch the table and drag it to move along the cells the timer stops until i release my finger from the screen.

11712578
integer	unsigned
row is of type nsinteger so i m assuming that the problem is that the book wants me to send objectatindex a signed integer when it is expecting an unsigned integer

11712578
int	chars
member reference base type chars const chars int is not a structure or union

11712586
apache	nginx	gunicorn	uwsgi
a common setup would be to run nginx for static resources in front of apache mod_wsgi gunicorn or uwsgi as the wsgi server which for a small site could be done on a single server

subtract	add
how do i subtract and or add elapsed time to a date in the format yyyy-mm-dd hh mm ss

11712639
nginx	lighttpd	apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
however if you mean to serve static content through the same web server lighttpd apache nginx that is serving the django application then you can do that easily by running python manage.py collectstatic in the project directory to copy all static files into one directory and configuring the web server to serve from that directory as you would any other static site

11712689
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this fix in ie9 standards mode firefox and google-chrome

11712689
google-chrome	firefox
in browsers that support document.addeventlistener such as ie9 standards mode firefox and google-chrome the sys.application constructor adds a domcontentloaded event listener that calls sys.application.initialize

you are trying to get value from shared preferences but you haven t put any value in shared preference.that s the reason of nullpointerexception

11712700
getter	setter
i understand that synthesize autocreates the getter and setter for an instance variable

11712700
getter	setter
when i specify the _something part i understand that this informs the compiler runtime that i want it to use a particular backing variable for the getter setter

11712700
getter	setter
does objective-c autocreate the _something variable along with my getter setter or should i be defining that instance variable in my interface implementation file

11712725
gentoo	linux
you said that you want to write c code on gentoo linux as i understand you re not familiar with linux

11712725
gentoo	linux
install gentoo linux on virtualbox there are a lot of tutorials on the net for example this video

so when the conditionally show section contains one or more forms then this way you ll risk potential attack holes as the restriction to show or hide the form isn t enforced by the server side anymore

11712750
hash	salt
the necessity of hiding the salt for a hash

11712790
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome it used to work in firefox and still does on a friends mac

11712797
hash	salt
the salt is then used to require the attacker to attack each password hash individually if the attacker wants just one password the salt doesn t help in any way

11712798
hash	salt
the purpose of the salt is to prevent the use of rainbow tables .these would allow a hacker to have generated a large number of pre generated hash for certain passwords

11712798
hash	salt
by appending the salt to the password before it is hash the hash is completely different than the original password

11712798
hash	salt
thus they would need to recreate the hash for each salt value which is unpractical

11712812
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
all the salt does is make them throw out any precomputation and solve the whole problem which is time consuming but certainly possible especially for hash like md5 -- you should move to sha256

11712852
lxml	beautifulsoup	pyquery	beautifulsoup	pyquery	lxml

i have overridden onbackpressed and onkeydown int keycode keyevent event in all of my child activities in each tab

11713034
put	get
this is what confuses me - if i use the same form of uri which failed with the python wrapper in the api console on the soundcloud api website and i am authenticated through oauth then the get put and delete all behave as expected on the same group_id s and track_id s which fail through the soundcloud-python wrapper

11715221
kerberos	ldap
if the application does use the stock membership or web.config-defined authentication and membership system then it s hypothetically possible for you to change the web.config file to use an activedirectory ldap kerberos provider instead of its own however in my experience very few asp.net applications outside trivial hello world-examples use the membership system by-the-book

11715228

if you were using tcp rather than udp as part of the constructor of the tcpclient you can specify which endpoint you want the outgoing connection to use

and having declared the properties you can now let the compiler synthesize the setter and getter

11715509
getter	setter
if you do that declare a property and then synthesize it the compiler will behind the scenes create the instance variable for you and then automatically generate a setter a method that is set followed by your variable name setforgotpassword and a getter method a method with the same name as your variable which will retrieve the variable contents for you for each of your properties

the modal view controller should present itself modally when the device is on landscape mode and should dismiss itself when going back to portrait

11729961
int	boolean
though it doesn t really apply in c++ in old c that doesn t have an actual boolean type any int type can be used -- but in this case a comparison to true can give incorrect results

11730001
pop-up	dialog
i want the c++ side to be able to pop-up a dialog

11730008
xna	slimdx
considering the lack of windows 8 love that xna is getting support being dropped apps won t be sellable on the app store -- i d go with slimdx -- it s better than xna anyway -- the only down side is that you can t make xbox apps with it

11730017
put	get
the problem is that when i put the same for-loop within the for-loop with both the same objects i don t get the behavior i was expecting.

11730034
post	get
since you re doing a custom ajax post to get the data you must specify a function that calls the response callback with the desired autocomplete candidates

11730057
folder	directory
remove the jar files from the build path and drop them in the folder web-inf lib of your webcontent directory

whenever i run the program i get the following httpresponse from my post method

11730211
mongodb	bson
mongodb is bson not json as such i do not believe there is a direct conversion as you see in the console which is actually converting to json the same way you do in python

11730224
disk	ram
if you are saving to a database and if your working set is too large to fit in ram available to the database engine using the smaller size can have a huge difference on performance because more records fit onto fewer sectors of your disk reducing disk seek time assuming no ssd and increasing the amount of data points that can be transferred through the io channel per unit time

11730248
prng	random
also md5 s prng output isn t as random as it should be

so i ve been trying to put it on my website but whenever i run the game in browser i simply get a white screen though checking the java console shows no errors

11730371
post	get
i m starting to get into python lately and was wondering if you could post some code about how to to encode a json string send it as an http request to a url and parse the response

11730442
pull	push
but that ll only come up sometimes when adding and removing files -- when two or more people are modifying the same .m file all you have to do is git pull and then git push and it will calculate insertions and deletions for you

11730483
folder	directory
it seems to me that you want the webserver s folder to be conveniently accessible from your home directory

11730487
jobs	cron
i have set up a series of cron jobs on an internal company server to run various php scripts designed to check data integrity

i m relatively new to expressionengine and as i m learning it i am seeing some stuff missing that wordpress has had for a while

11730516
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
pretty good support in firefox safari opera and google-chrome

11730550
width	margin	box-sizing	margin
note i removed the margin since that was causing an overflow and set the box-sizing to determine the width of the element including the width of the borders and padding

11730562
google-chrome	firefox
as long as it works in both google-chrome and in firefox the same way as in accessing the elements works fine even if the output has the undefinedx1 i consider it some kind of bug in google-chrome not refreshing something internally

11730562
for-loop	arrays
then i did a for-loop on the arrays logging or using each element all showed up fine

11730597
strstr	atof
the standard string functions strstr atof etc are another

11730634
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
try making your uitextfield the first responder inside viewdidappear instead of viewwillappear

uiview	subviews
in the first block of code you held the uiview around by adding it to a subviews but let the uiviewcontroller go away

11730675
width	height
i set both scroll panel and horizontal panel to 100 width and height

11730675
width	height
so i cannot center the formpanel inside of horizontalpanel since their height and width are the same

11730709
width	height
by resolution i mean the dimension in the form of width x height

11730729
squash	branch	squash	merge
finally we squash commits from our dev branch if necessary and merge them with our local master

11730757
dataoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
go immediately for datainputstream and dataoutputstream maybe also bufferedinputstream it s been a while for me so i m rusty

11730798
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
he probably wants you to interpose a bufferedoutputstream between the objectoutputstream and the socket and similarly for bufferedinputstream

11730803
memcpy	malloc
another option is to allocate a big enough buffer through malloc and keep adding the data to it -- if that s better then 1 is pin-ptr followed by a memcpy the pinning would go out of scope once put method returns the best way to convert copy a single string data

11730836
google-chrome	firefox
btw this is demo ware and only needs to work on firefox and if possible google-chrome

11730862
int	double
mid returns a string format the string to a int long double float ect..

11730885
width	height
i also find setting position absolute and all four directions to 0 is more reliable than 100 width and height

11730889
width	height
i m looking to take a folder worth of images and have php determine their size and then write their code depending on whether the width or height is higher

11730936
for-loop	loops
statements after each if unless you want it to exit the for-loop after only one time around loops which i don t think you do

11730950
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
the sorteddictionary is a balanced tree while sortedlist is just a continuous slab of memory that happens to contain ordered elements

11730987
google-chrome	firefox
this login form works brilliantly in google-chrome but in firefox it for some reason freezes the username input after i ve started writing the password and when you remove focus from the password box that s frozen too

11730995
subtract	add
however now the multiples of 400 that are leap years have been subtract too so add their count back + m_year - 1600 400 base year here is 1600 the largest multiple of 400 not after 1900

debian	linux
my code works just fine in linux debian squeeze but when i tried it on windows xp and 7 i got a constant stream of error messages

11731212
for-loop	loops
i would use a conditional statement and use a for each loops instead of a for-loop

11731231
put	get
the following is probably a better design move all your audio files to your assets directory and put the file name in the button s tag use the same click event handler to get the state of the one mediaplayer object stop it if its currently playing set the new file to play from the button s tag and play the file

11731270
mouseleave	mouseenter
i want to create a mouseenter mouseleave state for hovering over group headers

11731273
mouseleave	mouseenter
i couldn t figure out a solution to delegate to the mouseenter mouseleave events properly using extjs terrible event binding

11731273
mouseover	mouseout
however i did figure out how to add delegation listeners to the mouseover mouseout events

11731427
width	height
i can get both of the images height and width but when i go to resize it it returns a null bitmap

11731428
for-loop	loops
i could exploit this with a for-loop and a starting index value for each row equal to the position of the first 1 from the previous row but am i correct in thinking that the numpy argmax function will still outperform a loops written in python

11731512
wildfly	glassfish
below is a servlet 3.1 compatible one which matches tomcat 8+ wildfly 8+ glassfish 4+ etc

11731540
opera	google-chrome
the getusermedia function that alex w mentions is only currently available in opera and google-chrome you can read some blog posts about it and see some demos here

11731580

everything seems to be working fine the repository is created through redmine i see the repository under gitolite repositories

11731667
union	distinct
as omg ponies has already pointed out that there is no use of using distinct with union you can use union all in your case...

11731669
union	distinct
you should use union all if there are equals rows in both tables because union makes a distinct

11731696
django	web2py
for example i see backbone web2py django enyo kendo meteor node.js etc etc

11731701
nsis	uninstaller
i have an nsis installer that calls an uninstaller to automatically uninstaller the older version of the program

11731702
implements	modifiers
edit you also should switch from an auto-implemented property to a manually implements property with a backing variable declared with volatile modifiers

11731747
google-chrome	firefox
this only happens in google-chrome in ie 9 and firefox 14 it works aok - so clearly i have chanced on a quirk and a very specific one at that as it s not reproducible in jsfiddle

11731751
disk	ram
if you take care to make sure the two threads don t get confused when the first thread wants to re-read back a record still being written to disk by the second thread there should be no other issues there either -- but asynchronous writing is likely to increase your throughput with most access patterns unless you are i o bound anyway or really short on ram relatively speaking

11731764
client-side	server-side
in web development client-side javascript frameworks are mostly separate from server-side python frameworks so a python framework .

11731788
post	get
i ran into a similar problem and ended up implementing a simple addparameters method extension for the ajax.request class to get this done for both get and post requests

11731792
implements	extends
for example you can have a singleton that implements an interface or extends another class

11731795
background-color	transparency
i was wondering for a div with a background image whose parent div has a white background - should the child have background-color white or transparency

11731798
union	distinct
the use of union guarantees distinct values - union removes duplicates union all preserves them

11731798
union	distinct
this query will out-perform all other answers because the database can efficiently count distinct values within a table much faster than from the union list

11731831
onfocus	onblur
i don t know if my issue is with asp.net the multiline control or something else but the onblur and onfocus are not working

11731852
put	get
assuming that images ima1 is in b2 this would be something you could put into c2 to get you what you re after and then paste the formula down

11731858
hide	show
i don t see how there can be any ui displayed by .oninit that the user can click on since the main window has not been created yet but if you moved the code somewhere else you could hide show the installer with hidewindow + bringtofront basically showwindow or disable the buttons you don t want the user to click on with getdlgitem + enablewindow

11731898
ssl	https
if you want to configure tomcat to accept https communication then your etc apache2 crt ssl file needs to be a java keystore and not a bare certificate file like apache httpd uses

11731903
width	height
if the image data inside the pdf say height 216 and width 288 then this is the size in pixels not inches or any other length unit

11731945
client-side	server-side
php is a server-side language while javascript is client-side

11731957
width	height
i have an image in a div and i am setting all css properties in the style property of the div including bottom left height and width

11731973
google-chrome	firefox
it works just fine in google-chrome but doesn t execute the jquery stuff before returning true either in firefox or ie

11731981
width	height
now if you don t give it a width and height you can use bottom and right to make it so it takes up all the space except for whatever you specify in those style attributes

11731989
uiview	subviews	uilabel	uitextview
i have a uiview called containerview in which i have a few uilabel s and uitextview in it and i am adjusting the final height of the containerview by later on iterating the height of it s subviews and summing them up

launching from another directory fails unless the config path is set to an absolute path in the ini file

11732025
librsvg	batik
for example there s embedded svg animation using batik or librsvg

11732042
inherited	properties
to clarify you re adding a properties to the type frmnewform which inherited from form

11732056

i m trying to see on success of a json request that for the particular hyper link it should call addclass and removeclass to add remove particular css properties

11732171
post	put
i am going to put them in the if statement so if a negative number is entered the program stops and post their average

what is the difference if we implements an interface and not extends our class

11732246
portrait	landscape
i did some cursory exploration into this using the accelerationincludivingravity property of an ipad and discovered that the portrait - landscape values of x y and z are different than the landscape - portrait values of x y and z

11732246
portrait	landscape
in my initial testing i found out that a portrait to landscape rotation event occurs at x y z 8.5 6.8 0 and that a landscape to portrait rotation event occurs at x y z 4.5 6.8 0

11732272
getter	setter
note please make sure you don t inherit the simpleboardgame as the main class in land class if you want to access the variable inside the main class just make setter and getter for that

11732402
int	chars
i m trying to read the first chars as a string and the third chars as an int and then print those out on the screen

11732404
cos	sin
this should not be computationally intensive at all especially since you only have to do a single sin and cos calculation for each image your angle doesn t change for every pixel

11732404
cos	sin
no worker threads no mutexes no redundant calls to sin cos

11732473
mocha	zombie.js
in mocha you use a separate tool for http response testing such as request supertest zombie.js etc

11732481
disk	ram
the disadvantage is that it s rather complex to implement and the entire clipmap has to be stored somewhere probably in a big file on disk so that you can load parts of it into ram as needed

11732492
putty	winscp
if you are on windows you can use a combination of putty and winscp to manage your server and its files respectively

11732581
floating-point	integer
integer and floating-point arithmetic are totally different

11732581
int	double
in this example the types int and double are automatically coerced converted to type double without an explicit cast

11732581
floating-point	integer
there are languages in which you could not even sum an integer and a floating-point number without an explicit cast afaik sml in which by the way parametric polymorphism is key to overcome this kind of problems

11732581
min	max
this of course also applies to forms of method overloading in classes i.e java.lang.math methods min and max are overloaded to support different primitive types

11732581
haskell	ocaml	haskell	sml	ocaml	sml
take for example the cases of duck typing in dynamic languages like python or even in statically-typed languages like go or algebraic data types in languages like sml ocaml and scala or type classes in languages like haskell multi methods in clojure prototypal inheritance in javascript etc

11732582

since you are using mvp the only things you ll ever need to directly resolve are presenter

11738256

i m currently on schedule with kinect openni and nite

11738641
width	height
no there is no way you can do that inside of one img tag as the background and the image itself are assigned the same height and width so they will always overlap each other and be stretchd or shrunk into the dimensions you specify

11738716
width	height
definitely when you apply height and width style to img tag it will apply to the main image ie image in src

11738723
oncreate	setcontentview
in the oncreate method i m calling setcontentview

11738826
width	height
i think there are better ways to do this but if you absolutely have to do it your way use padding - setting the width and height of your image with css will definitely deform it .

11738835

11739321
xstream	jackson
if you need to support both xml and json you need to include jackson first and then org.restlet.ext.xstream as xstream is also capable of json representations but the implementation is rather poor as described in restlet docs this is recommended order by restlet authors

11739364

11739653
sudo	passwd
if you really want this configure sudo to accept you without asking for a passwd

11739679
for-loop	loops
and the whole block of your for-loop is a single statement as far as cmd is concerned thus when loops runs any environment variables are already expanded to their values

11740145
getter	setter
should i declare and access my private fields through setter and getter or through the constructor

11740145
getter	setter
i understand the purpose of a constructor maybe not but what is the point of having a constructor if i can declare and access my private fields through setter and getter

11740146
stdout	fflush
that system.out.println in the sample code probably does a fflush for every line which automatically will shift the bottleneck into the console stdout

11740158
android-listview	baseadapter
android android-listview expandablelistview baseadapter

11740224
getter	setter
usually one say if it s a required dependency use the constructor if it s optional use getter setter

11740272
apache	nginx
in my opinion you will never get the same level of security with a pure-python server that you could have with majors web servers as apache and nginx are

11740288
getter	setter
fields through setter and getter

11740297
width	height
this should work if you have the buffer as byte a width and the height + the pixelformat stride

11740308
getter	setter
in my opinion it is more correct to write setter s getter s since then the number of properties will only grow

11740313
g++	gcc
if you are using gcc g++ you can use a command like this to generate makefile acceptable dependencies

11740316

11740430
folder	directory
need an inotify compatible script writing that will monitor a certain directory and if any new files folder are created in in copy those files to another folder

11740446
children	parent
in your example you will need to explicitly call databind on the control you want bound or on a parent which will invoke databinding on all children

11740512
floating-point	integer
instead you should pass the measurement in its native form an integer or a floating-point number and add the quotation mark at the last moment when you are about to display the string to users

11740556
post	get
you ll get the best answers if you ask specific questions rather than please review my code ...and if you limit each post to a single question

figured out that using setelementsize and setelementposition instead of using width height and x y makes quite a difference

11740702

but behave more like block items margin padding width height work as you d expect

11740937
behat	mink
i use the behat and mink to write the tests and i have some problems with tests for registration system

for now i was able to solve this by changing the method from get to post

11741056
textview	imageview
i have created a custom listview with one imageview and nine textview s

11741100

the idea is to provide a public method that executes the steps of your algorithm at high-level and use overrides of protected abstract methods in subclasses to deal with lower-level steps of the algorithm

11741117
post	get
if you can get at the svn logs post them

11741128

11741338
post	put
edit the latest pre-release adds support for put post delete operations

11741344
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
you can easily upgrade an existing netbeans installation to the latest versioning 7.2 was just released all your settings will be saved - and the old versioning remains entirely functional should you need features that are abandoned in later versioning

you can combine that with jon skeet s unstrained melody or any other post il processor to get a proper type constraint on an enum but that is optional

11742343
hide	show
second despite that correct observation i can still attest that i am seeing the behavior that you are complaining about and here s why the show event is triggered before the actual modal has been show and hence your call to hide is made before the rest of the show code

actually the point that i am getting that runtime-dimension-counts from the underlying c interface doesn t matter as the c lib creates those structs from serializable data that comes in over the network and as its impossible to know at compiletime of the lib how many array-dimensions an array that comes in over the network from another app in potentially another programming langauge will have a c++ implementation of the deserialization would still have to determine valuetypes for dictionaries from runtime information about the array dimensions

11765194
post	get
the problem you are facing above specifically can and should be solved with post redirect get

11765199
put	get
just off the top of my head one way to do it would be to put all of your imageviews which you should get from your grid s adapter into an array and iterate over that array every 5 seconds using your timer and determine which imageviews should be be set to invisible setvisibility view.invisible

11765838
subtraction	addition
an obvious solution would be to perform addition or subtraction to each number in the given range one by one

11765838
range	minimum
then finally perform update operation to get the minimum and maximum number in the range

11765838
subtraction	addition
this is just a simple example.the actual problem might contain thousands of such addition subtraction operations.i hope it s clear now

inherited	subclassing
the difference is that subclassing that won t also be abstract must implement all inherited abstract methods

11765903
superclass	subclassing
as to the why or perhaps more explicitly why choose the abstract superclass rather than an interface often it s useful to provide implementations of only some methods of an interface - for instance for code-sharing - and require concrete subclassing to provide specific implementations for other parts of the interface

11765940
mouseup	mousedown
i just have a hunch that you were perhaps trying to use mousedown and mouseup events ..

mvp	presenter
mvp has been designed to separate the user-interface specific interactions and specific control capabilities which in most cases are framework vendor dependent and to hide them from the business logic the presenter

11766075
mvp	presenter
i suspect you would not have to support different user interface technologies at the same time like asp.net web forms wpf silverligth or asp.net mvc but if you hypothetically have to port an asp.net mvc website to a destktop wpf app and stick to the mvp design pattern then you would in the best case have to only implement the view interface in each ui technology keeping the same codebase for the presenter services and all the business logic stuff well in reality going from asp.net mvc to desktop would be quite an adventure but the example should emphasize that the presenter and business logic would not have to be modified

11766659
google-chrome	firefox
since this works in firefox i m not quite sure that its a google-chrome bug or expected behavior

11766659
mouseup	mousedown
what i ve done is not apply any perspective to the transform until the mousedown event is fired this somehow allows the mouseup event to fire and links to work

11766715

you can handle the submit event which will occur only for your form submission

11766737

integer	radix
parseint parses a string into an integer with the radix base specified -- 10 corresponds to decimals

11774342
int	chars
and for the reason your code was not working my only guess is that you weren t stripping out all non-number chars from the string hence when the ++ increment operator tries to force a typecast it just returns a nan as the given string fails to be parsed as int

11774342
int	chars
i found the main problem of your code retrieves the full url of the image that is why as my paragraph above implies you weren t removing all non-number chars and it failed to evaluate as int

width	height
if you do not define that height the div should automatically resize with the browser width

11774758
width	height
you did specify a height which makes sure that at least the whole background image is shown but this also means that the div will never resize with the browser width

11774758
width	height
making sure that both the div and the image have a width of 100 the full width of the browser the image will resize with the browser and the height of the div will adept to that of the image and thus push the other content below the div down

the twig for-loop iterates over an arrays of objects running the inside of loops for each of the objects in the arrays

the salt is stored with the hash because a different salt is used for every hash unlike your previous approach with sha512 where you were using the same salt for every hash

11781348
hash	salt
with this method a single rainbow table will only be good for a single password whereas if the same salt was used for every hash a single rainbow table would be good for all hash

11781983
post	get
one other thing i tried is using the optional stream parameter to get at the raw contents of the post data

ordinals	difference
build up on wergeld s solution here as you see in his solution the end of x-axis was position correctly at 5 30 but there was a suddent leap in time this is because the ordinals property of the axis is set to true by default which means all points are equally spaced in terms of pixels immaterial of difference in terms of time so the axis leaves enough room at right for just 1 point and hence number of pixels required to add one point

11784430

11785743
integer	unsigned
which is a 32 bit unsigned integer with all bits set

11785765
int	boolean
you can replace || with | the bitwise-or which works on int but then the entire expression will need to be converted to boolean by comparing it to zero because in c# the if -statements require a boolean

11785819
factors	matrix
matrix elements are required to have no attributes so factors dates and posixt items become their numeric representations if coerced to matrix

put	get
because if i make a web.xml and put only this i ll get some other errors in runtime like missing contextloaderlistener etc etc..

11786708
inline	inlining
as the secrets paper discusses inlining promiscuously is not the greatest idea -- making the pragma even more of a blunt hammer so that functions got inline whether or not it made sense to do so would probably hurt more than help overall not to mention increase code bloat since modules would have to keep the different levels of eta-shifted functions around all at once

inherited often times requires that we both be able to reference subclassing from superclass anonymously by for example calling an abstract method - think of java where this is problematic and back not necessarily anonymously

11786923
superclass	subclassing
if a superclass calls a function on its fields we may need to pre-initialize those fields to certain other values in the subclassing and certainly we might need to use the product of superclass initialization in the subclassing

int	double
since there are two ways of implementing an ap fractions number one is to emulate the storage and behavior of the double data type only with more bytes and the other is to use an existing int apa implementation for representing a fractions number as a rational as a pair of int numerator and denominator which of the two ways are more likely to deliver efficient arithmetic in terms of performance

11798640
fixed-point	fractions
i m aware of the existing c c++ libraries some of which offer fractions apa with floats and other with rationals none of them features fixed-point apa however and of course i could benchmark a library that relies on float implementation against one that makes use of rational implementation but the results would largely depend on implementation details of those particular libraries i would have to choose randomly from the nearly ten available ones

11799258
firefox	safari
on safari firefox on mac the text is squeezed right up toward the top of their lines

11799271

11799298
versioning	upgrade
i noticed a huge difference in size between 2.0.2 and 2.0.3 95mb for the first one 128 mb for the second one which is surprising given the versioning would make think it is a minor upgrade

11799328
public	protected
being the property protected internal instead of public i was afraid it might not work but yes it did all of it and smoothly really

11799328
public	protected
if a navigation property does not really needs to be public for proxies to be created protected is enough i m leaving internal out because i assume that only influences the ability to use that property for the relation mapping why on earth the restriction on the expression to extract the property for the hasmany method or better yet since i understand the property must be a property of the type being mapped and not some random collection why is not there an overload for hasmany which takes a string propertyname and searches the property for itself even if it is not a public property

11799340

once i commit then sync push through github for windows this script is supposed to call the linux command git pull -f

11799426
post	get
it worked in an older 3.2 copy but upon upgrading past 3.2.4 it starts throwing an error because it is looking for a get route when only a post route exists it is meant to go to a standard create method

11799476
ostringstream	std
if you use std ostringstream you can get std string from it using std ostringstream str function

you need to instead using a timertask or alarmmanager for this to generate an event at the time you want

11799573
superclass	subclassing
changing a superclass method behaviour based on whether it is overridden isn t a good idea in most cases because it means the superclass is second-guessing the behaviour and intent of the subclassing

superclass	subclassing
for example what if one day someone wrote a subclassing that wanted to get the default setup afforded by the superclass for a reason you hadn t thought of

it has been my experience that there is no way to do what you want in ie and you should simply put a switch in so that non-ie users get the wiz-bang you re looking for but ie users have to do it the old-fashioned way

serializable	deserialization
am i required to read and write the entire xml file - starting from the root xml element everytime i want to make use of serializable deserialization or is there a way to allow me to ignore extranous outer elements and directly deserialise pertinent child xml elements to their code equivilents without the parser chucking errors

11799941
multiplying	division	multiplying	multiplication	division	multiplication
this means that if you really need a lot of digits after the dot you can take any big-integer library multiplying all your data say by 2 64 and you basically immediately get fixed-point arithmetic with 64 binary digits after the dot at least as long as arithmetic operations are concerned with some extra adjustments for multiplication and division

11799941
division	multiplication
note also that in many practical applications multiplication operations are often accompanied by division operations as in that compensate for each other meaning that often it is unnecessary to perform any adjustments for such multiplication and divisions

11799953

11800029
switching	screens
in order to get it to switching back to the default launcher when they are not in car mode would be a bit tricky but you could prolly achieve it with some sort of fork activity that checks if car mode is enabled if so go to your car mode launcher if not go to the default launcher it gets trickier if the user already has a different 3rd party launcher so essentially your app will always be the home screens app no matter if car mode is enabled or not but if it is not then you manually start the normal home screens

with a cgimageref you can query it for the width height depth wpl which will you will get as bytesperrow from the image then modify by dividing by the pixel size

11800880

11801063
google-chrome	firefox
the image shows up in google-chrome in firefox but does not show in ie8

11801074
width	height
alternatively you could bind the scale transform to the height and width of the control using multibinding

11801588
put	get

also mixing cin and cout and the c style io functions like gets is asking for trouble so don t

11801657
int	chars

11801714
width	height
i had a problem resizing a google calendar fed iframe so i ve just made a default size to it in the iframe s style width 600 and height settings of basically the maximum i would want 980 i believe then wrapped that in a container div with height and width at 100 and min-height and min-width at 400px and 300px respectively and then added some jquery to run at onload and onresize.

11801714
width	height
so to clarify the resize function runs onload because i am targetting mobile phones and tablets in my responsive design which takes the height and width of the calendarcase div and sets the height and width of the iframe #googlecalendar accordingly minus 10 pixes for some padding

11801717
capistrano	rvm
the problem is i m on a windows machine not using rvm and that causes the whole deploy capistrano task to crash because i don t have rvm

a for-loop will loops through all of the contents of an iterable usually a list and perform an action against each member object and then break out of loops when there are no more objects to loops through

11801828
int	chars
xij just expands to the chars chr int ij 16

11801857
for-loop	loops
as you can see above the for-loop lets you iterate directly over the contents of an iterable as opposed to the while loops method where you keep track of an index and access items with the index

11801886
folder	directory
you can do that either from the same app that inserts the data from a test app that also uses the datadirectory property if it is in the same output folder or you can open the file in the output directory bin release in your case

11801894
mouseleave	mouseenter

11801995
portrait	landscape
the simulator defaults to landscape but the ui is sideways as if it was portrait with most of it hidden because it s designed to be landscape

11802075

11802449
width	height
which has a fixed width and height and is position on a fixed different location using the top and left margins

11802466
post	get
so far my idea would be when a user login s in with facebook using sso on the app they get a token from facebook when they then post things to the website from their mobile they pass this token and their fb userid to the mvc webapi service and the server makes a request to fb and checks that the token is valid before actioning any post or puts etc

11802475

what i noticed is that .on click ... works but other events like mouseover mousemove and mouseout don t

11802820
switching	screens
the options and help screens do not implement the viewwilldisappear method and switching back and forth perfectly on the device

11802867
background-color	font-size
this does of course over-simplify things and it might be worth setting font-size and default color and background-color properties too among many many others

11802921
folder	dir

11802931
google-chrome	firefox
why scripts work not simultaneously in firefox and google-chrome

11802998
pascal	delphi
it s not really what you re looking for because delphi is a statically typed compiled language but if you really insist on being able to type some pascal in and see if it does anything you can try the tjvinterpreter component that comes in the jedi vcl

11802998
mouse	keyboard
we don t even do that bit by writing code much we do it all visually with our mouse and keyboard

11803033
getter	setter
you can then turn the member variables on the base page into properties and embed your user specific caching and fetching in the getter and setter

11803057
queue	fifo
the thread running the actual work is managed by a fifo queue so if you give it a large task to execute it will not be able to do other tasks until the long-running one completes

inherited	subclassing
looks to me as if you want to delegate some behaviour to other classes which are usually not subclassing in terms of inherited

11803795
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
right now the borders work for ie8 firefox google-chrome safari but not ie9

11804090
google-chrome	firefox
it should work both in firefox and google-chrome ie has some other issues with select

11804096
post	get
if i understood your question right...you have a dependency on your get requests...that is to say the second get depends on the first...if that is the case obviously you need to take consecutive get operations...however if that is not the case that is if you know the order of get request and the response won t be affected by local conditions...then i suggest you do post get operations on server side...trigger the first one an let the server handle the rest and get the result.

11804105
put	get
easiest way to get that id is to put it in a hidden input element in your html then grab the value in your javascript

11804109
addition	multiplication
i think the add refers to the multiplication by 2 the adc is actually a trick to add to pos and the or joins the mbsrlentable entry and the rest of the code but that seems to be in the wrong order and then the or would correspond with an addition in the source

11804126

additionally most modern processors execute several instructions at a time so other work proceeds while a multiplication is occurring and they are pipelined so commonly one multiplication can be started and one finish in each cpu cycle

11807934
multiplying	division
to remove a previous scaling of 0x1p57 multiplying by 0x1p-57. this is because division instructions are slow on most modern processors

11807996
punctuation	words
word-splitting correctly is a bit tricky but here s a simple start that breaks words at punctuation or spaces

11808014
many-to-many	one-to-many
because relationships could be set up any way one-to-many many-to-many one-to-one and could be empty your statement about subsets is not correct

11808044
for-loop	arrays
as this is information from user input i am using a variable created by the num_rows in my database to determine the number of times a for-loop runs through displaying my arrays values

11808044
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop contains a form that displays one value of the arrays and a like button type submit and repeats this form until all values have been displayed from newest to oldest with a like button following each

11808044
for-loop	loops
i ve even tried using a while loops instead of a for-loop

11808075
maven	pom.xml
my app is maven project and i run it from eclipse and settings are in both web.xml and pom.xml

11808086
inherited	subclassing
normally we just inherited the field and set its value in constructor of subclassing

11808120
for-loop	loops
rather than the for-loop switch that to a while loops over your posts table

11808145
width	height
you have to set some width and height of the table to get that work

11808159
button	checkbox
i know how to validate the normal input fields but the radio button and checkbox are causing trouble

11808171
portrait	landscape
here are screen captures of me opening the application rotating to landscape touching the screen to display the video controls then rotating back to portrait to see the corruption

11808176
google-chrome	firefox
same as in google-chrome and firefox

11808177
multiplying	multiplication
say upperbound for short in java is 32767 and i am multiplying 328 100 i can t actually do comparison with short.max_value because after multiplication answer would already be overflown and answer would be -32736 which is certainly smaller than short.max_value

11808191
typedef	struct
coordinate is typedef on anonymous struct not object

11808211
draggable	droppable
it is not about files as you don t have problem with them but it is about draggable and droppable including greedy droppable

11808215
button	checkbox
in stead of checking the value you want to check if the checkbox radio button has been selected

11808223
superclass	subclassing
in a uml diagram when you create an instance of a subclassing do you usually include the implicit construction of the superclass prior to the sub class constructor

11808251
width	height
can t this be solved in css by defining the width and height like so

11808255
email	dkim
yesterday i made tests where the email had dkim pass

11808264
superclass	subclassing
it shouldn t be read isolated from other parts of a design so if a reader is unsure about what any of the components is an instance of the subclassing and the superclass he or she should look into the - hopefully - accompanying class diagram

11808296
google-chrome	firefox
i am doing the following on google-chrome but it does not work on firefox

11808299
width	height
the window shrinks to the original width but not the original height

11808333
versioning	upgrade
i actually upgrade my crystal report versioning to get the pdf versioning higher than 1.2

11808339
debian	linux
it appears that libsndfile s native platform is debian gnu linux so the source may be a little trickier to work with under windows

11808423
google-chrome	firefox
what you want is hard to achieve even more if you don t target a specific browser vendor like firefox or google-chrome etc

11808454
google-chrome	firefox
i tried it in all browsers ie google-chrome firefox

11808537
hide	show
so the bottom only show 5 product images hide the div of the currently viewable product

11808552
translation	localization
the approach i tought of was to have a big xml file with all the general translation in various languages and smaller xml files with localization for the single pages and single plugins

11808584
inherited	subclassing
any actual types passed to the respective type arguments are meant to be a part of the given inherited hierarchy starting with the base class you specified so users of your class can specify any type that matches the base class or any of its subclassing

11808601
getter	setter
add getter and setter for your container class

11808604
integer	unsigned
looking in the documentation for that function and selecting the overload for an unsigned integer

11808606
hide	show
this is so you can hide and show the panel at any time

11808629
width	text-align
when i try the same using display inline-block and text-align centre i can have the content centred in the screen even though the wrapper stretches to 100 of the width

11808666
getter	setter
i would recommend that you get rid of the custom implementations of the setter getter for musicplayercompletionblock and just declare a property

11808666
getter	setter
the generated setter getter will take care of copying the block

11808731
actualheight	actualwidth
the actualwidth and actualheight properties do not reflect the rendered size

11808778
pop-up	dialog
check this previous so question how to create pop-up window modal dialog box in html

11808789
actualheight	actualwidth
actualwidth and actualheight will get you the correct result when the layout of the grid is updated

11808793
ready	each
separate branches for each environment live stage dev n and a verified code flow from dev where you develop and can have broken codebase state to stage where release candidate resides and is ready for testing and does not change from stage to live where your live code is in stable state

11808801
actualheight	actualwidth
after call grid.updatelayout method actualwidth and actualheight will reflect the new values

11808816
disk	ram
i am able to get ram hard disk and battery info and would like to inform users when free hdd ram or battery is let s say less than 20 even if my app is not running

11808834
google-chrome	firefox
note google-chrome shows a slight variation compared to firefox and ie on how it calculates the absolute position of the d element

11808834
width	height
this solution removes your 100 inline styling on d s width and height

11808856
equals	charat
i already searched stack forums and docs oracle but i only found that this exception is thrown when is index equals the size of the string for charat method

11808867
google-chrome	firefox
this function is working in firefox but not in google-chrome on mac os i didn t test yet ie

11808871
lwuit	lcdui
if you want an application that looks as good as if it were developed with lwuit but in a smaller jar file and that is easier to debug for you one solution is to develop the gui from basic geometrical shapes and images drawn on a lcdui canvas

11808873
int	chars
in this case you want an int and so s must be a sequence of chars that form a signed int

11808882
width	height
is there a way to change a string s width or height separately

11808893
rubygems	rvm
usr local rvm rubies ruby-1.9.3-p194 lib ruby site_ruby 1.9.1 rubygems deprecate.rb 63 in

11808952
for-loop	arrays
to deal with arrays properly you should almost always use a for-loop instead of for-in

11808960
hide	show
i am trying to show hide the next two rows of a table using jquery

11808983
mouse	keyboard
a nifty cross platform solution for simulating keyboard and mouse input

11809003
width	height	portrait	landscape
i ve got a ul list which contains a 9 pictures which are either 70px in height or 70px in width depending on whether the image was taken portrait or landscape

11809026
width	height
then draw that image on your main canvas and manipulate its width and height

11809052
addition	multiplication
inner nodes represent operations addition multiplication etc. and

11809064
post	get
ideally you use ajax to post the first option and get the options for the second select

11809065
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
note i have only tested the above link in google-chrome so there could be inconsistencies on firefox opera etc

11809093
freebsd	centos
i put the videos on a local server in my office along with the exact same web pages using apache and freebsd hostgator uses centos

11809115
hide	show
as i understand it you want to show hide #copy based on the emptiness of #recentinc and do the opposite for #recently_viewed

11809122
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
you simply can create an arrays loops over the values using a for-loop and push ing the values

11809226
hide	show
i am creating an application in which a camera is showing with an option on screen to hide and show grids on the screen

11809226
hide	show
but when i hide the grid and click show then horizontal lines are not showing.

11809228
implements	sealed
implements the parameterless work method in your authenticatedbase and use the sealed keyword to stop it from showing on inheritors of authenticatedbase

11809254
maven	pom.xml
i agree that there should be a way to specify that maven itself should look at my pom.xml and generate a project dir structure from that

11809254
maven	pom.xml
step 1 move your already created pom.xml somewhere else maven will complain if you already have it in the directory where you will run the next command

11809258
ubuntu	debian
try this tip to force uninstall apps in debian ubuntu

11809258
versioning	upgrade
the syntax changes between drush major versioning and if you let apt manage this you could inadvertantly upgrade your drush install

11809273
put	get
if you want to filter cursor adapter follow sam guide in your posted code you get data from cursor and put to your class so it not cursor adapter

11809304
implements	extends
when designing linq instead of creating a new interface that defined each member that any object that it would be possible to query using linq would need to implements microsoft instead decided to take the existing class ienumerable and extends this class using extension methods

11809304
implements	extends
so microsoft created lots of extension methods extends ienumerable inside the system.linq namespace and any class which uses the system.linq namespace and contains an object implements ienumerable can use these extension methods to query that object

11809304
implements	extends
in regards to where where is an extension method extends ienumerable and returning a new object which implements ienumerable

11809399
hide	show
you can give each input an id attribute and use jquery to hide show based on the id

11809448
post	get
i am using get method for form post but i am not interested if person could see if i am using yii framework

11809509
min	max
for this i have to calculate a max a min and a margin of error these will indicate the interval of my dataset

11809521
next	except
this sort-of works except that it skips the last-child proceeding immediately to the next album and the first-child else if statement doesn t work at all with slideshow.cycle prev

11809525
addition	multiplication
floating point addition and multiplication typically take few cycles in modern processors

11809587
put	get
but to do so it has to keep track of the object separately such an object is put on the finalizer queue waiting for the finalizer thread to get around to executing the finalizer

11809587
cpu	processors
their values take a lot less memory than an reference type object and can be stored in cpu registers and the cpu stack memory locations that are highly optimized in processors designs

11809642
plot	heatmap
4 plot your heatmap

11809642
plot	heatmap
in that case you ll have to play around with some x-scale factor and y-scale factor to transform your heatmap s coordinates into pixel coordinates first and then plot the heatmap and then the overlay should work

11809653
int	double
if you re using sse adding constants directly to the exponent field is a legitimate trick in fpu code it s quite terrible - it typically has double the throughput and a 4 times better latency except on processors that have a float- int and or int- float penalty

11809728
post	get
if i run this code as is then i get a page where i am able to edit all the post i imagine because post draws from an association

11809728
post	get
then if i change the post to discussion.posts.at 0 to get the first post then i can proceed to the edit page.

11809741
implements	extends
i suggest that you don t have your gui or applet classes also implements listener interfaces since this can make your code difficult to debug and extends

11809779
sudoers	visudo
to do this i need to run the command visudo in order to add edit the sudoers file i then added the following into the sudoers file

11809805
gentoo	opensuse
on opensuse redhat gentoo you have to use perl version of rename

11809815
division	multiplication
but the possibility of overflow is still there another useful trick may be dividing n - r + i and i by their gcd before doing the multiplication and division and still overflow may occur

11809821
ubuntu	linux
i ve been using linux ubuntu aptana and it has the nice word navigation you described then started using max os x for work and it does seem like the mac version of aptana and it seems to lack the same functionality it only jumps over words separated by whitespace and not underscore or camelcase

11809828
udp	mtu
udp is not connection oriented you can never say that two packets belong to each other you can use getsockopt to determine mtu and stay under it preparing packets by hand with proper offsets

11809828
udp	mtu
basically while sending udp packets larger than mtu ip fragmentation can occur if it s supported on your platform but not all platforms support it

11809836
put	get
i am requesting to twitter to get all the locations of my users but then when i try to put them into my array all my objects get the same location the last location of .each

11809903
google-chrome	firefox
this anchor works fine in google-chrome and even in ie but when i use it in firefox the browsers redirects to #dash-main .load billing.php

11809948
post	get
to post in the background then you should get a long-lived access token as described here but that would be more applicable for a server-side app and since you said you would be using flash i think it might not be relevant for you

11809966
innodb	myisam
innodb or myisam

11809966
innodb	myisam
if it is myisam then yes they can be recovered if you still have all the files but if type is innodb then there might be some trouble

11809981
width	height
you don t need to set the width and height because during image loading this information is loaded and set

11809981
width	height
it is not possible to change the width and height of an image object

11809981
width	height
you can just query its width and height

11809985
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and opera are refreshing images after src change but firefox don t

11810019
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectmodel
if you change the user also changes nspersistentstorecoordinator and nsmanagedobjectcontext but nsmanagedobjectmodel - not there nsfetchrequest

11810030
children	parent
for example if the action was to create a parent some children and attached them i dispose immediately once that is finished

11810054
put	get
but i can t get put works with an entry

11810075
width	height
further to this is it possible to just extract jpg images and then further only images above a certain height width size

11810110
x86	64bit
this occurs when running a 64bit version of ubuntu without the necessary x86 libraries installed and trying to execute a 32-bit binary

11810165
junit	testng
it will get run automatically each time at least with testng but i suppose junit support inheritance as well

11810178
hash	md5
you cannot decrypt an md5 hash

11810205
hash	salt
when the user enters their password concatenate it with a random salt and hash it for the password recognition routine

11810205
hash	salt
use a different salt and hash it again for the aes encryption key

11810213
tunnel	vpn
so the best approach here is some type of ssl tunnel or a vpn to your office network and the bonus part is you likely not have to re-link the front end to a different ip address since once that tunnel is setup to your office then the result of the network setup including the use of printers etc

11810250
content-disposition	content-type
you can rename a .html file to .doc and word will eat it but you will still need some php or whatever serverside language is your drug of choice to send a content-disposition download tag and a content-type application vnd-ms-word header

11810273
children	parent
for example having audio visual as parent and mp3 wma as audio s children and mpeg avi as visual s children

11810283
post	get
okay firstly you need to change your request to get from post

11810300
width	height
you can also filter by image width and height but it appears to be weird with how it finds the width and height

11810300
width	height
...it would spit out the width xxx and height yyy ...but it doesn t

11810300
width	height
that being said you can use a similar solution like above for width and height too

11810316
redmine	gitolite
since you ve bundled redmine with gitolite that probably means that redmine is managing these public keys and you would need to upload them to redmine so that redmine can update the admin-repository

11810323
apache	nginx
the only way to serve the blog is via apache or nginx

11810326
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
unfortunately i have found a sample that works in ie9 google-chrome opera and safari but not in firefox 14

11810352
folder	directory
containers are similar to folder or directory and blobs are similar to files in our system.if you specify it is similar to specifying drive folder file .hence when you access a blob through a url you actually fetch the blob file through http

11810384
post	get
either get or post

11810404
hide	show
i recommend having the image already in place in the html and just have the jquery show hide it as required

11810456
qobject	qwidget
it s also possible to re-emit signals with an int qwidget or qobject parameter

11810492
width	height
we will start returning a dictionary containing the fields url height width and is_silhouette when accessing the picture connection for an object and specifying a callback property

11810515
x86	mips
now compilers will take c++ code and generate its corresponding assembly code for the architecture x86 mips etc.

11810546
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this seems to be supported in all browsers that i ve tested ie 8 google-chrome 21 firefox 12.0 opera 11.61 safari 5.1.2 under windows and android 2.3.3

11810589
put	get
if the item already is in the map get the value increment increment it and put it back into the map

11810645
google-chrome	firefox
however when i go to edit the product status of a product that i have entered and change the availability date in google-chrome it wont work but in firefox it does.when i say it doesnt work i mean that when i click on the date field the datepicker opens but when i click the date it wont return it in the field

11810668
post	put
the way to send json like any payload is to put it in the post data not the url

11810686
pow	sqrt
i m wondering if fast implementation of pow for example this one is a faster way to get square root of an integer than fast sqrt x

11810686
pow	sqrt
my question is is fast implementation of pow x 0.5f faster than fast sqrt x

11810699
google-chrome	firefox
this is working great in firefox but not in google-chrome

11810699
google-chrome	firefox
in this block every console.log fires in firefox when i mouse over and click the copy span but in google-chrome all except the complete listener fire

11810699
google-chrome	firefox
i m thinking there is possibly some issue with dynamically adding the embedded flash objects in google-chrome on mouseover or perhaps some difference between user scripts in google-chrome vs firefox with greasemonkey

11810704
fadein	fadeout
you can you use the jquery fadein fadeout methods which will look like a slide effect

11810710
mouseout	mouseenter	hide	show
i have a tooltip that show on the mouseenter event and hide on the mouseout event

11810728
mouseout	mouseleave
try mouseleave instead of mouseout like this

11810733
interbase	firebird
see the interbase 6.0 data definition guide page 107-111 available for download from or the firebird book by helen borrie page 281-287

11810739
mouseout	mouseleave
use mouseleave instead of mouseout

11810749
pow	sqrt
therefore you could take that algorithm and replace b with the constant 0.5 and now you have a sqrt that is at least as fast as that pow

11810749
pow	sqrt
please note that that pow function is an approximation and has relatively large error and therefore is not nearly as accurate as say most library sqrt functions

11810758
pow	sqrt
with regard to c standard library sqrt and pow the answer is no

11810758
pow	sqrt
first if pow x .5f were faster than an implementation of sqrt x the engineer assigned to maintain sqrt would replace the implementation with pow x .5f

11810758
pow	sqrt
the code you linked question you asked is about attempting a crude approximation of sqrt using a crudely approximated pow

11810758
pow	sqrt
i also measured the run-time of the system mac os x 10.8 pow and sqrt and of the sqrt approximation here with one iteration and multiplying by the argument at the end to get the square root rather than its inverse

11810758
pow	sqrt
the correct value returned by the system pow and sqrt is 1.73205

11810758
pow	sqrt
running in 64-bit mode on a macpro4 1 the pow approximation takes about 6 cycles the system pow takes 29 cycles the square root approximation takes 10 cycles and the system sqrt takes 29 cycles

11810772
mouseleave	mouseenter
you need to write your mouseenter and mouseleave functions in a proper way something like below

11810822
min	max
you can specify the min and max date

11810835
post	put
the search will query the facebook graph api as you can do using hate my boss type post limit 100 locale en_gb my issue is that i want to put quotes around the query so when the user types into the text field and hits the search button the php code does the rest and queries the api but at the same time will query it like i hate my boss

11810898
postgresql	mysql
i m migrating my mysql databases to postgresql

11810898
postgresql	mysql
so could you please convert this mysql query into postgresql

11810913
hive	hdfs
there should be a directory in hdfs named user hive warehouse lip_data_quality dt 20120712 after your load

11810914
folder	directory
i ended up making a directory structure for my compass project in the main app resources folder

11810942
int	chars
reorder is int array only carries the new index order of the chars in the given str

11810964
width	height
the whole height and width seemed promising but making and adjustment broke it entirely

11810987
spaces	delimiter
i do not simply include spaces as a delimiter in the for f statement because that can throw off the token counting when a value is sometimes blank and sometimes not

11811023
letter-spacing	text-align
this might be less important if it did not cause the text with letter-spacing of -1px to be slight off-center when you are trying to align it with text-align center

11811030
sorting	filtering
this way the question of unusual sorting becomes not relevant - the log data gets eventually converted into information by applying proper set of filtering with few clicks of a mouse

11811055
post	get
i am able to log in and get the user s first name but when i go to post nothing shows up on user s wall

11811055
post	get
i get a callback notification saying response was received successfully but id of post is 0

11811055
post	get
i have even tried replacing the call to get user s info with the post and still get same result

11811087
filtering	grouping
i want to filtering search by age grouping

11811088
mouse	keyboard
i m not sure you ll have any luck getting doh robot to work with a headless browser it s very much attuned to generating low-level mouse and keyboard events

11811098
draggable	droppable
i ve got three draggable images and three droppable divs for them to go into

11811153
stdout	stderr
close file descriptors for stdin stdout stderr and tty close lkml

11811153
stdout	stderr
duplicate tty file descriptor to stdin stdout stderr dup

11811156
width	height
when ever you float something you always want to give it a specific width and if the container of the floated elements doesn t have a specific height you would add

11811159
jobs	cron
sqs expects your application to be idempotent and i ve got multiple consumers producers where even if sqs had a deliver-once mechanism i will have race conditions creating duplicates and race conditions consuming because my consumers run via cron jobs

11811201
width	margin
basically when you add a margin to the right div you are increasing it s width by more than 75 in total width 73 and margin-left 25 - this makes the div s width greater than the allowable

11811238
udp	mtu
by default linux udp does path mtu maximum transmission unit discovery

11811253
invariantculture	cultureinfo
the invariantculture property returns a neutral cultureinfo that is based on english settings so it uses period as decimal separator.

11811260
udp	mtu
-- by default linux udp does path mtu discovery

11811260
udp	mtu
this means the kernel will keep track of the mtu to a specific target ip address and return emsgsize when a udp packet write exceeds it

11811283
put	get
this query will get a list of columns along with their schema and table names matching whatever you put into the parameter somecolumnname

11811285
mouse	keyboard
see xilinx spartan-3e fpga starter kit board user guide ps 2 mouse keyboard port section and or generic ps 2 electric protocol description the latter essentially repeats the former in more detail

11811286
put	get
let s get through a simple put to a map but first we have to determine how the map is built

11811286
put	get
doing a put operation on this map it will first get the hashcode of the key

11811300
mouse	keyboard
rdp usage will use both in and out bandwidth since you send input keyboard mouse etc. and it sends mainly screen changes

11811332
post	get
i would suggest you do some research attempt some code and if you get stuck then post what you have so far -

11811334
int	boolean
also preg_match returns an int and you re doing on a boolean which will never hold true since they will never be of the same type

11811369

hide	show
all you do is assign an id to each header that you click on and then on click you hide all content and show the one clicked

11811529
screens	tablet
android introduced fragments in android 3.0 api level 11 primarily to support more dynamic and flexible ui designs on large screens such as tablet

11811529
screens	tablet
because a tablet s screens is much larger than that of a handset there s more room to combine and interchange ui components

11811564
awt	swing
the jframe naming came about because it s a swing frame and swing came after awt the original java windowing toolkit which already had a frame class

11811564
awt	swing
since both awt and swing where available at the same time they used the j prefix to demarcate the toolkits note that jframe extends frame btw

11811587
google-chrome	firefox
however this fiddle on win 7 is showing me that on google-chrome ie9 and firefox all are applying one less pixel after the last letter firefox is showing me to start out with one less pixel to begin with in the gap to the border which seems to be in violation of it not being applied to the end of the line

11811587
width	text-align
either solution above may or may not help with differences in text-align center calculations as that appears to partially depend on the 1px rounding for center based on the display width as seen when one stretches the width of this fiddle

11811594
x86	64bit
now given in most cases 64bit is not needed at all i think targeting x86 in the executable would just be the best general solution all the other assemblies are targeting anycpu but from what i can see the executable determines where it goes

11811602
vim	emacs
i recently switched from emacs to vim so i m kind of a newbie

11811612

11811648
windows	wow64
windows server core 2008 r2 and presumably core 2012 support wow64 as a separate installable and removable component - including the .net bits

11811669
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
the recommended way to handle that situation is to use a qgraphicsscene and qgraphicsview and then populate the scene with qgraphicsitems

11811675
vim	textmate
it s similar to textmate and has support many vim key-bindings

11811676
int	boolean
i need to somehow specify return values but in fact this function returns pretty much everything depending on int code value -- boolean int pointers etc

11811712
children	parent	inherited	properties
note that if you add more styling to the parent you would have to set an alternative for the child divs parent div to prevent that properties from beeing inherited by the children

11811735
postgresql	mysql
i am in the process of switching from mysql to postgresql because of all of the troubles i have been having with south and mysql but i can t even get this process done

now how can i use above value to change id on the fly while admin publish the post the post author id should change with above id value get from selection box

11811848
post	get
now how can i use above value to change id on the fly while admin publish the post the post author id should change with above id value get from selection box

11811862
pop-up	dialog
there s no way to trap it so i can pop-up a dialog to ask the user if they really wish to exit

11811866
apache	nginx
whether that s apache or nginx php-fpm or just php-fpm you need something to actually run the wordpress code then use the same proxying system you are using now

11811935
super	self
it is stated that if we use super myclass self .__init__ text inside __init__ of myclass we get into recursion

11811935
super	self
but as i understand myclass inherits object so super myclass self should just merely be object but it turns out that super myclass self is __main__.myclass

11811954
hash	salt
salt hash should be used only for authentication

11811980
width	height
there is an example returning image s real width and height which i found these method from this answer

11811992
ffmpeg	handbrake
you might also try handbrake but that also just uses ffmpeg x264 afaik

11811996
put	get
the main reason i have this as a transient property is so my uitableview entries get put into sections based on nsdate but can move between the sections when the date changes

11812005
width	height
i would recommend setting the height and width of the html and body tags as well

11812022
super	self
the problem is that by writing super myclass self .__init__ text you are saying to use the super relative to whatever class myclass refers to at the time super is called

11812022
super	self
you define an __init__ method on origmyclass but that __init__ method calls super myclass self not super origmyclass self

11812022
super	self
decmyclass defines an __init__ that calls super decmyclass self

11812022
super	self
note that this means that when the super myclass self call later executes it will be doing super decmyclass self

11812022
super	self
decmyclass.__init__ calls super decmyclass self .__init__

11812022
super	self
origmyclass.__init__ calls super myclass self .__init__

11812022
super	self
because myclass refers to decmyclass this is the same as super decmyclass self .__init__

11812022
super	self
thus super decmyclass self .__init__ again calls origmyclass.__init__ which again calls itself and so on to infinity

11812022
super	self
note that super calls super sub self

11812038
versioning	upgrade
so if you re not using 2.10.x upgrade and if the problem still persists upgrade to unstable versioning 2.11.3 or higher before to test before filing a bug in

11812039
put	get
if you want to get around that you can put the code in the if blocks as dynamically executed code i always feel this is a bit of a hack workaround

11812060
uninstall	upgrade
as to whether it is technically an uninstall of the old product or an in-place upgrade seems of little importance

11812060
versioning	upgrade
upgrade code the upgrade code stored in the upgradecode property should remain the same for all versioning of a product

11812072
min	max
then you can determine min and max row col in the grid so that the cells include every drawn region

11812111
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works in google-chrome opera and safari but not in firefox neither ie9

11812132
width	height
executes before callback function gets called before you set the width and height

11812134
width	height
the width and height dimensions are calculated according to dstx2-dstx1 dsty2-dsty1

11812138
sqoop	hadoop
i have set up a single node hadoop cluster and configured it to work with apache hive now when i imported a mysql table using the following command using sqoop

11812178
removeclass	fadeout
change the order of calling fadeout and removeclass methods try this

11812196
post	get
with these in theory you can get rid of the problem by authenticating the users when creating these and let facebook post them instead of scheduled jobs on your side

11812197
google-chrome	safari
definitely check google-chrome safari as suggested

11812205
min	max
you could narrow the box down to find the actual max and min pixels in it if you have many outliers

11812224
switching	screens
do this for each possible id number and change the screenstate to whatever screens state you want it to switching to

11812227
put	get
usually i put external jar files into script library but periodically get outofmemory

google-chrome	firefox
it perfectly works in firefox and ie in google-chrome there is a problem during animation some thumbnails are moved 1px left or right

11812274
addition	multiplication
multiplication is a relatively complex operation and is likely to be slower than say addition or comparison

11812277
rtp	rtmp
i d like to get audio video from user s webcam display webcam output in user s browser and stream media through rtp rtmp web sockets

11812300
distance	polygons
if we consider the origin of our coordinate system the center of the polygons it boils down to finding an equation such that for any input point in cartesian coordinates the output is the distance from the closest side of the polygons

11812300
distance	polygons
gives us the radial distance from the center of the circle which could be considered as a polygons with infinite sides

11812300
distance	polygons
gives us the chebyshev distance from the closest side of the square which could be considered as a polygons with 4 sides

11812363
leaflet	proj	d3.js	leaflet	d3.js	crossfilter
my current proj includes a combination of bootstrap jquery jquery-ui d3.js leaflet crossfilter and some obscure stuff and it is fair to say that although the application is awesome the code has become an unholy mess

11812363
d3.js	crossfilter
especially code for d3.js and crossfilter is quite verbose see source of the official crossfilter demo for a typical example

11812438
folder	directory
you can instead use the same code in a .htaccess file in each of the folder you want to prevent directory browsing

11812460
restsharp	twitterizer
i m currently looking at mvvm light restsharp silverlight toolkit facebook c# sdk and twitterizer as the primary libraries to use

11812536
chunked	transfer-encoding
it depends on the response if the transfer-encoding of the response is chunked then you read until you encounter the last chunk r n0 r n

11812536
chunked	transfer-encoding
if the transfer-encoding is also set to chunked then you must dechunk the decoded response

11812536
chunked	transfer-encoding
if the transfer-encoding is chunked read and dechunk the data piece by piece

11812564
post	get
theoretically you could use curl for manipulating the gravatar site with get and post requests and parsing the result

11812569
pop-up	dialog
the stock trader ri sample app only uses a modaless dialog pop-up

11812601
awt	swing
of course you might put the applet in a swing gui account for the weird mix of swing and awt and use the layered pane to draw over the top of the entire applet

11812682
explode	implode
when dealing with an array just implode it with some wacky delimiter like or something and str_replace the lot explode the lot again and bob s your uncle

11812704
bottle	flask
i would go with a micro framework like bottle or flask

11812704
django	web.py	web.py	cherrypy
django is a full stack framework and if you don t need database interaction i would seriously look into one of the above cherrypy or web.py

11812704
flask	cherrypy	flask	web.py	web.py	cherrypy
like i said before web.py cherrypy flask are also good alternatives

11812731
arp	udp
that means there is no send buffer when sending udp messages and there are arp requests pending

11812732
google-chrome	firefox
all of that code works fine in firefox and the other browsers but not in google-chrome

11812755
coffeescript	haml
i m working in rails and my goal was to use the same format haml for partials on the server haml ruby and templates on the client haml coffeescript but that proved to be impossible and anyway not very advisable

11812759
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works fine with firefox 14.0.1 google-chrome 21.0.1180.6 and safari 5.1.7 this with file estilo.css #contenido line height is used to make it fit in safari and google-chrome

11812759
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
if i change its position to absolute i got the same look on google-chrome 21.0.1180.6 and safari 5.1.7 opera 12

11812791
post	get
what you can do is make an http post request instead of http get

11812798
fastcgi	scgi
the uwsgi protocol is more akin to fastcgi or scgi

11812801
width	height
the problem is that the textview text doesn t show up in the dialog if i set its width and height as in the code above

11812818
isotope	masonry
same problem as here how to avoid gaps using isotope with masonry layout

11812835

replace width and height with some defaults for the viewbox

11812835
width	height
i use the values from the width and height attributes of the svg tag

11812860

the parent property in the businessbase is generally used by the businesslistbase to keep a relationship with its children

11812876
windows	wow64
windows it uses wow64

11812885
persistent	transient	instances	transient
c the instances of the other persistent class is transient does not yet have an id

11812892
post	get
if you have some particular characteristics that you need for your threading that asynctask will not readily handle or if you need the thread for an indeterminate period of time until the user presses a stop button use your own thread and something else to get work to the main application thread a handler or post or runonuithread

11812914
width	height
when you set up the cell in cell for rowatindexpath you re setting the frame to cgrectzero a rect at position 0 0 with width height 0

11812914
width	height
you then reset the position but you never reset the the width height

11812914
width	height
or just use cgrectmake x y width height to make the frame

11812934
onmouseover	onclick
however two very important things i would want it to detect are onmouseover over a node and onclick over a node again

11812963
google-chrome	firefox
you can inspect elements in both google-chrome and firefox if you have firebug and both will display the layout information of the element

11812969
for-loop	arrays
a common way to solve this is to traverse the arrays elements in reverse order because the elements that are repositioned by removing the current element are ones that you have already traversed not the ones the for-loop is still going to process next

11812974
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you should also construct the objectoutputstream before the objectinputstream

11812981
mouse	keyboard
i guess that you mean the lack of mouse and keyboard activity in this window

11812981
keydown	mouseup	keydown	mousedown	keydown	keyup	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	keydown	keyup	mouseup	keyup	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
so you would have to add a listener for keydown keyup mousemove mousedown mouseup dommousescroll touchstart touchend touchmove events

11812981
mouse	keyboard
this way the timeout will fire one minute after the last event received one minute after the user stopped generated keyboard or mouse events in the window

11813064
folder	directory
ok so the background on this is that i have some files in the subdirectory linking to other files using links like files test.php because those files expect the other directory to be in the root folder but on my site they aren t

11813087
for-loop	loops
when searching nameslist i have for-loop to takes the names one by one is there a way to search the list one time without loops

11813114
for-loop	arrays
when iterating an arrays with a for-loop the incrementing index is just the index into the arrays

11813115
for-loop	arrays
you should traverse the arrays with a for-loop and a counting variable as you do below

11813163
margin	height
also make the element have height 0px and throw in the same for padding and margin for good measure so that it wont occupy any space when its hidden

11813164
for-loop	loops
when searching nameslist i have for-loop to takes the names one by one is there a way to search the list one time without loops

11813166

screens	hdpi
hdpi stands for high density pixels that means devices that have a screens with a high resolution would use this drawables

11813281
screens	mdpi
normal screens would use drawables from the mdpi folder

11813281
mdpi	hdpi
you can put all high density icon in a hdpi folder and all lower resolution drawables in a mdpi or ldpi folder

11813284
hide	show
i ve been using the standard method to hide show a class namely

11813285
fadein	hide
if you want it to permanently display without fadein after the first load just set the css display property to block assuming you used css to hide it in the first place

11813289
stdout	stderr
there are ways to redirect stderr stdout to logcat but there are drawbacks either need to adb shell setprop which is only for rooted devices or a dup like technique but creating a thread just for that purpose is not a good idea on embedded devices imho though you can look further below for this technique

11813363
for-loop	loops
you have a semicolon right after your for-loop so there is no actual code in loops also you calculation is wrong you add an extra value because you start b at one

11813383
typedef	struct
i need to use typedef struct data datas

11813459
typedef	struct
defining a typedef for a struct type is also unnecessary

11813474
getter	setter
that interface also required me to define the defaultbutton getter and setter but it was not necessary to solve this error

11813492
ubuntu	linux

fastboot	adb
the usb id is different in fastboot mode so you can easily have permission to it in adb but not in fastboot

11813512
sorting	grouping
if i just use the default sorting comparator and grouping comparator i guess the ordering of the value lists in reduce wouldn t be determinstic

11813555
reportlab	pdfrw	pypdf	pdfrw	pypdf	reportlab
i ve been googling for about an hour and the packages i ve found are either massive overkill and still don t provide useful examples such as reportlab or seem to assume that the only thing anyone would ever do with pdfs is concatenate several of them together pypdf pdfrw

post	get
how can i get that xxxx updated in the post

11813756

i want the fancybox to be generated with the exact width and height of the contents that the link references in this case it s the cruise-compare.html page

11813756

11813807
client-side	server-side
the fine folks at repl.it provide a version of python that is compiled in javascript using llvm and emscripten - it s heftier than some of your other options and possibly buggier but it s completely client-side and therefore not vulnerable to some of the attacks that a server-side setup might be vulnerable to

11813823
xlib	xcb
i ve found plenty of examples documentation explaining how to do this using xlib xcb for linux win32 api for windows and carbon for osx but i m having a hard time finding a way to do this that would be applicable within the scope of a qt application

11813869
hide	show
hide what is show for the selected chapter for all sibling chapters

11813869
hide	show
hide what is show for the selected chapter for all top-most chapters that aren t in the ancestry of the selected chapter

11813870
sorting	grouping
the common pattern for rendering the value order deterministic requires sneaking part of the value into the key and ignoring that extra part for the grouping partitioner and comparator while considering it for the sorting comparator

hash	salt
i was doing some research to find what types and size i should use to store the hash and salt in my database

11814102
interpreted-language	compiled-language
php being an interpreted-language and not a compiled-language makes true polymorphism impossible

dreamweaver has a code which swaps images using mouseover for a swap and mouseout for a recovery of the original image i am certain most people know this

11814139
folder	directory
cd foldername go to foldername which is a direct folder in current directory

11814163
put	get
the password is saved with one way encryption. so there is no way to get the password out to put in anywhere in a form s hidden field which would be a bad idea anyway

i want to deny access to files inside folder 2 and 3 using htaccess file that exists in web root directory

11814350
hash	salt
at the suggestion of the top answer on this post keep me logged in - the best approach i decided to hash a combination of the user s salt and password in one cookie and store the user s id a number in another cookie

11814350
hash	salt
the salt value i used is the same one that i used to hash the password of the user when they first register so it is static - it doesn t change between sessions

11814350
hash	salt
3 in a scenario where some user with malicious intents were to gain access to the database a secure website would have salt and hash passwords making it rather difficult for the hacker to gain access into multiple accounts if at all

11814350
hash	salt
but by simply playing around with the hash and salt values and creating a cookie that matches the values they ve changed on the database they can effectively get access to any account they want rendering the whole password-hashing process as useless

11814350
gmail	hotmail
surely websites like gmail and hotmail who offer this keep me logged in feature follow a more secure approach than what i m doing now so how would they do it

rtf	odf	doc	odf	doc	rtf
pod generates another odf text document odt that contains the desired result.pod can call openoffice in server mode to generate the result in pdf doc rtf or txt format

11814521
folder	directory
depending on you development environment your future intentions you should place the libraries in a location best suited to it for example in a lib directory within you project folder but outside of the source

11814569
int	chars
i have done type casting with int and chars but not with pointers so i posted this question

11814576
submit	submission
i believe that most well made authentication will have some sort of nonce in its form which is essentially to ensure that unless you use their form to submit the submission will be rejected

11814583
folder	directory
create an xml file in the values folder in your resource directory

11814584
hide	show
why is there a filter function in jquery when you can get and show hide the elements by class

11814598
int	chars
as for the second printf printing zero remember that int are four bytes while chars are only one

11814601
express	node.js
how to use node.js 0.8.x domains with express

11814620
int	chars
what it does is that assuming address stored at a is say 100 and assuming that int takes 2 bytes and chars takes 1 bytes in memory

11814620
int	chars
one byte stored at p is the chars representation of the first byte of int 1 which is 0

11814643
int	chars
in more probably the type int on your computer has size 4 bytes while chars is 1 byte long you can verify this using the c operator sizeof so the first element of your int array is

11814643
int	chars
for this reason when you use a chars pointer to see the values of your int array you proceed forward one bytes at time not 4 with the obvious result you ve obtained

11814653
int	chars
when you cast it you basically just said okay i know this is a pointer to an array of int but now we re going to reinterpret the data as an array of chars

11814653
int	chars
because it is a chars array it advanced one byte down the array which is in the middle of the int which contains 0

11814664
min	max
_segment_tree 1 holds max min of the whole data array - it s the root of the tree because array-based binary tree has to be indexed from 1

11814664
min	max
hereby if _segment_tree k holds min max of data b e then segment_tree 2 k holds min max of data b b + e 2 and segment_tree 2 k + 1 - of data b + e 2 + 1 e - you can see these indicies in the code

11814678
width	height
when the browser width height is small than the tabpanel i need to display it

11814682
int	chars
p is declared as a pointer to chars not int and is initialized to points to the first element of the array a

11814682
int	chars
the int value above interpreted as a chars would look like so

11814682
int	chars
points to the next int 2 points to the next chars which is 0

11814745
hash	salt
you will notice here than if you add to the salt beyond 22 characters the hash will remain unchanged

11814745
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
that is crypt will truncate the salt down to 22 characters before performing the hash

11814745
hash	salt
also the format of the salt hash is base 64

11814789
superclass	subclassing
if a subclassing defines a static method with the same signature as one in the superclass it is said to be shadowing or hiding the superclass s version not over-riding it since they are not polymorphic as instance methods

11814789
superclass	subclassing
secondly the return types must also be compatible in both the superclass s and subclassing s method

11814870
superclass	subclassing
the return type of the hiding method in the subclassing must be assignment-compatible with the return type of the hidden method in the superclass

11814970
affinity	processors
however you could always try setting the affinity for the matlab process to all your processors manually by the details available at the following link for linux

11815006
chunked	transfer-encoding
edited because i mistakenly took characters produced by transfer-encoding chunked to be caused by misconfifguration

11815009
int	double
would do - since you re using int will return you an int and probably round up down the result casting to double will change this result to a valid one

11815026
x86	64bit
i ve set my path from my computer properties to c program files x86 java jdk1.7.0_05 bin the 64bit version of that and without the bin at the end and jdk1.7.0_05 jre bin

11815076
octal	decimal
i can understand that it is converting the first two characters after 0 077 from octal to decimal but can any one explain me why 2 characters why not 1 or 3 or any other

11815084
children	parent
the where clause basically includes only the parent who have less than 4 children or who do not have any children at all b.employee_id is null

11815092
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

11815121
crypt	md5
i am having trouble because the .htpasswd file would work with passwords encrypted with the crypt function but i am not sure how to get it to work with their md5 encrypted passwords

11815133
put	get	post	put	post	get
the poster used some middleware to approve put get post delete requests like so -

11815149
filtering	grouping
you can just join the tables grouping by employee and filtering the grouping for those with less than 4 records

11815163
int	double
although its often considered best practice to use int long or bigdecimal most investment banks and funds use double because once you understand how to use them safely they are simpler than long and faster than bigdecimal to use

11815174
getter	setter
here√¢ s an example for the getter and setter

11815202
width	height
if your decision is based on height and width a very simple script around ffmpeg can do this for you

11815202
width	height
in the output you will have height and width parameters available for the stream

11815202
width	height
based on height and width take decision in your script to rotate or not

11815229
versioning	upgrade
without strict versioning you cannot track versioning of your database and you cannot do explicit upgrade you cannot do downgrades at all

11815233
cout	cin
the iostream library is a fairly large and also has static initialisers - for instance to initialise cout cerr and cin objects

11815246
post	get
the post get their own unique _id but upon creation also get an owner_id which is the id of the user that wrote the post

11815250
min	max
you need to store separately the max min for each interval and what values have been added to it just their sum

11815250
range	min
this range does not cover the whole interval of the first node so we update the children and then set the min for the whole interval that is the value of the first node to be the min of nodes 2 and 3

11815279
octal	decimal
in 07777 the backslash is followed by 3 octal digits 0 7 7 which represents a character with the value 077 in octal or 63 in decimal

11815300
crypt	md5
i m upgrading my auth class replacing md5 with crypt for storing passwords

11815310
post	get
i m writing a node.js bot for irc and i want it to post links in irc that people can click on to prompt it to post more data this is because i want to allow irc users to stay on the channel yet prevent my bot from having to flood the channel and get banned for spamming

11815311
width	height
this state is set using glviewport pos_left pos_bottom width height

11815324
width	height
that would make the element have 0 height and width which would cause a sort of jumping effect

11815397
hide	show
don t create a new j x frame on runtime contents of this container will be the same no reason for that create that once time reuse this container and for visibility on the screen to hide show use setvisible false true

11815397
jlist	jtable
read oracle tutorial about jlist jtable and listselectionlistener logics will be the same and for swingx components too

11815397
mouse	keyboard
i d be use jpopup as control for displaying the jdialog just to avoids annoying events came from mouse or keyboard

11815397
jcomponent	jdialog
create a new separate void that fills value from jtable s row to the jcomponent s placed into jdialog

11815418

try to remove the 2 rows the change the width and height of the picturebox or set them to be constant like 1 or 2 or.

11815424
children	parent
the new circles and its parent don t keep the structural harmony anymore some children circles are not contained anymore by its parent

11815433
width	height
following is my code snip the frame width and height is 176 144

11815449
getter	setter
i cowrote this code with someone who believes that in the name address and student classes it is necessary to include all of the getter and setter that are currently there

11815494
public	protected
you can always set the properties as public or protected or with default scope and access them provided the class is in the appropiate package

11815494
getter	setter
that said it is always good practice to use setter and getter

11815494
getter	setter
setter and getter also help to add logs breakpoints to check the behavior of the program

11815494
getter	setter
and most decent ides allow you to automatically code setter and getter just from the properties so it is not a big deal

11815504
put	get
it should not be a splash screen because i d put a textedit and a button to get the user s username

11815554
google-chrome	firefox
however this doesn t seem to work in firefox ie only in google-chrome

11815577
getter	setter
by establishing and using getter setter from the very beginning you ve enabled your code to have all the bounds-checking logging etc

11815577
getter	setter
in the future if you don t do them now without requiring client-code to adapt to a conversion to getter setter

11815594
daemons	launchd
thanks to the lua script it is possible to launchd several polling daemons in parallel the script guarantees that a given session will only be processed once since the keys are removed from to_be_expired by the lua script itself

oncreate	recreate
when i rotate the entire activity is recreate and i lose all variables declared in my oncreate within the fragment

11815669

edit i should mention that my current workaround is to have static lists in the tab activity and have the fragment push stuff to those lists on onpause and get stuff back from them on onresume

11815675

postgresql	mysql
i case of postgresql or mysql you should define

11816369
width	height
it seems like that css width and height of canvas is completely different than the actual width and height of the canvas element

11816369
width	height
so if you wish to make the coordinates of the html elements match the coordinates of the lines on the canvas element you need to set fixed width on the div that contains it and the same and fixed width and height directly on the element

11816394
put	get
how you get it back and put it into the original file however is more complicated

11816397

is there anyway to compress a folder to a .rar and move it to another directory

11817618
min	max	range	max	range	min
while not a direct answer to your question a better solution is to first figure out the range of values you want as if the input min was 0 and max was max - min

11817618

if gvismerge could change parameter values for the googlevis objects passed to it then it would need an accessor method and a mutators method a getter and a setter neither of which it has

11823828
min	max
my guess is that shouldn t be difficult because all you need to set common min max values for the axes is the data set displayed by each chart

11823828
min	max	range	max	range	min
append the returned values from a call to range for each annotatedtimeline chart then pass in this aggregated range for every call to annotatedtimeline which will obviously give each chart drawn from the constructor the same min max values on the given axis

11829731
uiview	subviews
i used those methods in the past with uiview uiscrollview inherit from uiview so it should work also but i didn t have the chance to confirm that it can be that the uiscrollview mechanism handle his subviews differently so u need to check it yourself

hash	salt
they enter a password the client side code then generates and appends a long random string salt to the end and generates a hash - bcrypt password+salt for example

11829913
hash	salt
the client code then sends the full hash plus the unhashed salt to the server

11829913
hash	salt
2 the server stores the full hash and the unhashed salt in the users entry in a db

11829913
hash	salt
3 during the user login they type their password which is then hash with a salt again

11829913
hash	salt
question 2 at this point does the client side code just send the full hash without the salt

11830468
ienumerable	iqueryable
an objectcontext.translate that returns an iqueryable rather than an ienumerable would be ideal but not necessary the vast majority of queries are compile-time constants so some form of pre-processing is possible

11830468
sorting	filtering
edit i m looking for something returning an iqueryable so i can add filtering sorting client side but have them executed on the db as usual

11830618
tiff	png
imageresizer.net has a pdf plugin and can convert to tiff jpg png etc

11830645
children	parent
it s self-referential and would look a lot like a hierarchical tree however instead of having just one parent each node could have multiple parent and multiple children

11830648
hash	salt
the server generates a random salt appends it to the password hash the result and stores the hash and the unhashed salt value

11830648
hash	salt
the server retrieves the salt from storage appends it to the password hash it and compares the result to the hash password in storage

11830648
hash	salt
if the passwords are not salt then there is a very high probability that many of the hash will be the same because many people use the same weak passwords

11830648
hash	salt
now even if two people use the same password a different salt will have been generated for each of them and the resulting hash will be different

11830675

google-chrome	firefox
due to restrictive same-origin policy for file urls this won t work on google-chrome without the --allow-file-access-from-files command line flag and it will only work in firefox if the images are being fetched from the same directory or a subdirectory of the current page

getter	setter
since jsf 2.x it s recommended to explicitly specify a getter and setter for component attributes which in turn delegates to uicomponent#getstatehelper

11831742

that s all you basically need note that the getter and setter must exactly match the attribute name as per javabeans specification

11831753
ostringstream	std
imbue is inherited by std ostringstream from std ios_base and it sets the locale of the stream to the specified locale

a bit messy but it does seem to work in ie google-chrome firefox and safari

11831877
ilist	icollection
ilist is everything that icollection is but it also supports adding and removing items retrieving items by index etc

in terms of performance i would be tempted to cache my items and show or hide based on that

margin	height
you have set the content height to 100 but not removed the default margin or padding in some browsers

11832546
min	max
generally there is no best way to find the min max in the performance point of view because it depends on how this application will be used

11832546
min	max
-finding the max and min in a list needs o n time so if you want to run many many in the context of the input operations your approach to find the min max after all the operations took place is fine

11832546
min	max
-but if the list will hold many elements and you don√¢ t want to run that many operations you better check each result of the op if its a new max min and update if necessary

11832620
equals	gethashcode
you should always override gethashcode when you override equals

hash	hmac	pbkdf2	hash	hmac	pbkdf2
however i wouldn t worry too much in the case of pbkdf2 since the timing attack that comparison function was designed to defeat applies more to hmac signing rather than password hash verification.

11832689
salt	md5
to answer question 2 for insecure constructions such as md5 salt+password encoding the salt first would allow an attacker to use existing ascii md5 tables to attack the entire digest where a raw binary salt would make such tables useless

min	max	subtraction	addition
i will assume that all update addition subtraction operations happen before finding max min

11832869
min	max
i don t have a good solution for update and min max operations mixing together

11832869
subtraction	addition
subtraction is addition with the negated number so they can be treated similarly

11832869
subtract	add
when we need to add k to the original array from index i to index j we will add k to index i of our array and subtract k to index j + 1 of our array

11832869

nhibernate	queryover
what is the best way to solve this issue using nhibernate queryover

11833940
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
wsdl.exe has been around since .net framework 1.1 while svcutil.exe came out in .net 3.5

11833940

next i tried specifying a fixed width and height but still the same result

11834000

superclass	subclassing
but that s not the end of the constructing we re still being initialized by the subclassing constructor which overrides some of the superclass s members so when the thread jumps right in dispatching events to the database it occasionally gets in before the subclassing constructor updates the database reference to the correct database

i have a custom component which extends linearlayout and implements ontouchlistener

11834323
width	height
given those definitions the width and height used for viewport is often not the same as the width and height used for aspect ratio

width	height
in this fiddle i ve made it easy on myself to do such a calculation manually by setting a width on the wrapping div and knowing the height based on the inner sizes

11834346
children	parent
the issue i ran into was like you images are not linked to the children products of a configurable parent tho you can upload images for these products...

11834384
d3.js	protovis
while it would be possible to include a prefuse visualization as a java applet in a jsp page i would rather recommend to use d3.js or protovis for web-based visualizations

11834394
width	height
the only issue is that the way it prints out the data is determinate of the terminal width height making it potentially unparsable if run at weird size

11834395
google-chrome	firefox
same behavior in firefox 14 and google-chrome 20

11834496

rss	feed
additionally i m trying to figure out how to count the number of entries in an rss feed through ajax but i ve never programmed around rss before

the xsd doesn t can t define all logic vars other than basic properties and setter and getter so we ve tried to inject code by xsd definition which are actually discussed by other folks couple of times

it looks to me there is no way we could take or import any packages other than setter or getter

11834606

believe it or not this actually fixed the problem in webrick but i m hesitant to use this approach in a multithreaded passenger environment because i think it s tantamount to modifying a global variable which could potentially affect other threads

11834611

you need image assets for both retina and non-retina landscape and portrait

11834812

you might want to listen for keyup or keydown instead

11834832
put	get
i know if i use either the framework or framework64 versions of regasm i can control where in the registry entries get put - and i have seen some references to running cscript as either 32 or 64 bit which possible affects what part of the registry is searched depending on the cmd shell invoked and i have tried both ways as well as trying an administrator shell

11834832
win64	windows
when running under the vs2010 x64 win64 command prompt again as admin the registry entries appeared under hkey_classes_root clsid but this time the test scripts worked from the same prompt and also from a standard windows cmd prompt however they fail from a 32 bit prompt

11834946
packets	pcap
i capture packets in client side with wireshark and here you can find pcap file

11834946

my approach didn t work but i decided to go one step behind so now i am using an even simpler client with a simpler provider in order to just test my post and get methods

11835005
int	boolean
i have a running spring-ws project that can unmarshal requests using jax2b but when unmarshalling of int boolean fail i get an error message with little detail and often without the name of the invalid element

11835013

you can try fadein and fadeout methods

11835151
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox don t care ie does

11835160
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that the css doesn t get interpreted by google-chrome or firefox but it works in internet explorer

versioning	upgrade
the major number tends to change only when there is something really earth shattering that means that going from the older major versioning to the newer major versioning is a significant upgrade effort

11835246
for-loop	loops
you can loops over that custom function and break when it returns empty you ll have to play and learn some syntax or at least i would but the syntax for a for-loop in mysql is here

11835258
pull	push
they each have a repository and there s a central repository they both push to and pull from

11835258
fast-forward	merge
so bob gets the error because he s trying to push something that requires a real merge not a fast-forward

11835273
int	double
for example if the client wants to send a string perhaps it would put str as the first three bytes of the message and if it s an int it s int or dbl for double and so on

11835303
ostringstream	std
a type-safe alternative with no concerns over buffer size would be to use io manipulators either on the output stream directly or on std ostringstream

11835321
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you can use objectinputstream and objectoutputstream for read and write those objects

11835341

int	chars
it s not up to the socket to define the format of the message chars data -- strings int or other type of objects binary data etc

11835405
pop-up	dialog
based on my research and what public opinion is it seems like where the focus goes for a modal dialog pop-up would depend on the usecase

11835407
stdout	fflush
note that the c library may cache outputs so to make sure the data is output you need to call fflush stdout

11835409
google-chrome	firefox
finally remember that while the likes of browsershots can help you with css it can t check javascript with browsers such as ie7 having a big performance hit versus google-chrome or firefox especially with intensive graphics such as svg or manipulation using xpath selectors lacks native support

11835474
cpu	processors
multicore refers to a computer or processors that has more than one logical cpu core and that can physically execute multiple instructions at the same time

11835474
cpu	processors
the only reason your cpu isnt running at 100 all the time is that the operating system knows how to suspend the processors which basically makes it stop everything and wait until something happens such as an io event or a clock tick

11835515
post	put
you have to put post method in partial view

11835531

11835839
stringbuilder	stringwriter
i also tried doing the stringbuilder stringwriter but no luck

11835897

your logic is sound the issue is that when you declare a char array of size 10 you don t actually get 10 spots to put characters in you only get nine

11835905
post	get
when i get back a dto class as part of a post request i can use automapper to map it onto my poco class and this works fine too

11835916
serializable	deserialization
actually you can configure mixins for serializable or deserialization or both of course

11835932
memcached	apc
instead look into apc memcached or redis as they allow you to store data directly in memory which is much faster to read and write

11836049
mouse	keyboard
i am using cgeventpost to programmatically post keyboard and mouse events

you need either to dynamicly resize de font-size or the div width height

11836362
width	height
still fittext makes its calculations based on the width of the container not the height

11836364
post	get
you would get the output of the almonds post that belongs to the other nuts parent category that s categorized in almonds

11836394
folder	directory
the thing is that when you load images from the assets directory the system doesn t apply any scaling or processiong whatsoever to your bitmaps instead when using the drawable folder android tries to scale your image according to your device s resolution

11836399

11836413
subtract	add
regarding monotonic declarations can add constraints which subtract possibilities

11836419

you can then remove the height config on you image as the layout make the inner item fit the whole height and width automatically

11836889
outputstream	inputstream
i saw this most efficient way to create inputstream from outputstream but i am not sure if this is the best route to go.

11836904
google-chrome	firefox
there are also a number of developer tools available to help with this type of thing such as the rest console app for google-chrome or the restclient add-in for firefox

11836929
jpql	hql
you can most definitely use any type of database-specific function you wish with hibernate hql and jpql as long as hibernate is the provider

11836936
int	chars
i have tried making the list column chars varchar and int all have not helped

11836949
children	parent
by using position absolute throughout your fiddle you are removing the child elements from the flow of the dom and interfering with the ability of the parent element to incrementally hide its children

11836964
for-loop	loops
now i d like to have some kind of loops i m guessing it s a for-loop but i m not entirely sure so that after a function has been completed it ll return to the top so the user can enter a new function number and do a different equation

11836977
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome but not ie and firefox

11836982
for-loop	loops
the text box does not update because the program is tied up inside the for-loop and thus never gets back to qt s event loops to redraw the widget

11836984
width	height
when you change the width and you haven t defined the height yet the browser automatically keeps the proportion between them so the height will also be 110 and 90

11836986
puts	fflush
2 user changes product and puts product to invalid state remember that invalid state is still acceptable for object unless we decide to fflush it to database

11837030
qevent	qmainwindow
for example the missing reference to qmainwindow event qevent mentioned above becomes

11837113
post	get
answering an old post since someone might get this page from a search engine

11837150
fileoutputstream	bytearrayinputstream
just replace fileoutputstream to bytearrayinputstream vice versa

11837229
dictionary	map
i did consider the following but not sure if there is a way to disk map the dictionary and without using a lot of memory except during dictionary creation

11837239
sorting	filtering
but if you need to update new products every so often or if you want to add features like filtering search sorting etc. than having a database is the way to go

11837241
google-chrome	firefox
i m currently working on a flash game and at least on my machine the audio seems to lag by a fraction of a second in google-chrome but not in ie or firefox

11837241
google-chrome	firefox
the audio is delayed in google-chrome but not firefox or ie

11837267
floating-point	integer
that code was written to accept either integer or floating-point weights.

11837294
mathml	mathjax
the upshot seems to be that in order to guarantee decent rendering of mathml you need your users to install either mathjax stix or asana math fonts

11837366
submit	submission
finally i realized that there are two submit buttons so i tried passing the name parameter when submission the form

11837368
width	height
the rotation is straight-forward but on resizing the height and width dimensions are reversed

11837397
min	max
obviously this doesn t work as this does not allow you to pass in variable which in the case below is min and max

11837436
min	max
mixing of group columns min max count ... with no group columns is illegal if there is no group by clause

11837441
folder	directory
on this new server i only have ssh access so i was wondering if there is way to copy across the folder so they will populate the directory in app

11837442
google-chrome	firefox
i m using firefox and google-chrome

11837447
put	get
when i put the same function in a class however i get an error

11837460
min	max
when you are using a column in count min max avg aggregation functions you have to mention that column in group by clause like this

11837489
width	height
by definition gridlayout forces all elements to be the same height and width -- ie

11837505
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
and yes it s really recommended to use buffered clases like bufferedinputstream and bufferedoutputstream

11837515
ubuntu	linux
this script worls fine on ubuntu linux

11837526
google-chrome	firefox
i am using firefox 14.0.1 stable on ubuntu 12.04 and google-chrome works fine

you call findviewbyid before even you have any views a call to setcontentview

11837600
int	chars
int main int argc chars const argv

11837605
pull	push
in order to interact with remote repositories via git the git directories need to be added to the remote machine s windows path environmental variable this should be done for any windows machine running git and needing to clone push or pull

11837607
min	max
note that and are corresponding to max min

11837636
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade fos userbundle with composer from 1.2 to the latest versioning 2.0 and followed the instruction to delete the propel_user_class definition in the app config config.yml file as indicated in the upgrade.md file

11837677
rss	feed
i m working on an android rss feed reader

11837709
int	chars
however unlike all the other conversion specifications the n conversion specification is an output operation that takes a pointer to an int and it is used to find out how many chars have been written up to that point in the format string

11837757
ubuntu	debian
as the wiki page says on some versions of debian or ubuntu you can do this with

11837774
for-loop	arrays
as for output use a for-loop or foreach look to go over the elements of your arrays and print them

11837853
memcached	apc
everything from apc to memcached to polling a file will all likely put less load on the server than having the client set up and tear down a connection every second

11837867
put	get	post	put	post	get
if you are using this to get html code using a ajax get or post method then i would go with the first one because anything that is echoed from the php file is put into a variable that you can use

11837872
inherited	subclassing
another solution with mono inherited could be to subclassing the kinetic.rect class using the extend method and overload the shapetype attribute which will become the key for your filtering

11837874
width	height
also set the height and width of the sidebar div

11837908
bindparam	bindvalue
you need to use bindvalue instead of bindparam

11837921

11837934
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
at the application delegate level create another uiview or uiviewcontroller that manages both the uinavigationcontroller s view and some other view that displays what ever it is you want displayed above the uinavigationbar

11837973
put	get
to get the full picture of the test you now have to mentally put all these pieces back together

11838006
subtract	add
your event handlers for the add and subtract buttons are inline and very simply only increment or decrement the number in the hourvalue box there is no code to change the class of the same relevant number .spanval element

11838037
children	parent
as another possibility if the bst is stored as a 1-dimensional array instead of with pointers between nodes you can simply walk over the array and do the math to determine each node s parent and children

11838042
getter	setter
in case anyone is wondering this is done so that freemarker can access public properties on objects without needed getter and setter

11838063
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i originally had everything in plain html and all the pages showed just fine in google-chrome firefox ie and safari

11838063
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
thinking that the pages will grow and it d be good to put the header navigation and footer in include files i did that without much trouble and everything was going well while testing in google-chrome firefox and safari

11838183
integer	unsigned
date is the json representation of a 64 bit signed integer for milliseconds since epoch unsigned before version 1.9.1

11838184
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the text is displayed next to the image icon

11838184
google-chrome	firefox
however that will break the styles for firefox and google-chrome

11838184
google-chrome	firefox
so you will have to add some smarts to make the design work for ie 7 and google-chrome firefox

11838205
subtract	add
you never bound anything to the add and subtract links

11838213
uptime	reboot
from my reading of the documentation the uptime clock only gets reset when the device is reboot

in mac osx and in linux centos i insert a new system environment variable myapp using .bashrc .bash_profile

11838254
width	height
i m not sure how to go about detecting the width and height of the image either

11838323
folder	dir
hmmm three folder named peas and carrots but sorted alphabetically as is my preference for the dir command

11838323
folder	dir
if you are simply checking if a file folder exists then using the dir command is a pretty bad choice

11838323
folder	directory
if mydir tmp is a folder then the script would be wasting time retrieving the directory information for every file in that folder

11838339
screens	tablet
this is a problem on small screens such as tablet because the bottom parts of the overlay cut-off by the small screens remain out of reach

11838361
portrait	landscape
i set mpmovieplayercontroller.controlstyle mpmoviecontrolstylenone when i entry fullscreen landscape and set mpmovieplayercontroller.controlstyle mpmoviecontrolstyledefault when i entry portrait

11838403
width	height
it gives the frame rectangle s width and height

11838403
width	height
use this width and height as the size for an image if you don t want it scaled or rather if you want a 1 1 scale

11838405
getter	setter
based on the getter i think you should make the setter be like this

11838424
inherited	properties
but please be sure that inherited properties is false as in example

11838443
jtextfield	jtable
this example overrides editcellat in a jtable having a defaultcelleditor using jtextfield

text color is different whether portrait dark or landscape light

11838548

11838550
for-loop	loops
any for-loop can be written with a while loops and vice versa

11838562
for-loop	loops
however a for-loop can do anything a while loops can and vice versa

11838572
easymock	powermockito
according to the wiki on powermockito it states that easymock is a dependency

11838612
int	double
because the current bdd xunit frameworks only allow you to verify primitives strings int double booleans.... this usually results in a large number of individual tests one for each assert

11838679
public	protected
if i don t provide this empty protected constructor there ll be an implicit default constructor which is public correct

11838688
public	protected
if you do have something to do marking it protected will be the same as marking it public because the base constructor can only be called by a child and the child would have protected access anyway

11838692
slideup	slidedown
first retract all the li s then slidedown the clicked one in the slideup s callback

11838699
onresume	onpause
so you should better look at onresume of the activity to update the button text.if you still want to change the button text while activity is onpause you can use a broadcast receiver on the activity that will change the text.you can also use a handler along with runnable to update button text

11838745
switching	screens
switching back to index.php and then back to map.php again the map s center loads in the top left and the full map is not displayed until the screens is touched none of this occurs on a computer s browser however

11838795

good read jquery selector question how to select all input fields on a form except button and checkbox

11838859
post	get
as for the post get parameters before you call the paginator loop over the parameters and save them into a string

11838871
put	get
you could put all your input buttons in a form tag which is using get as its method

11838882
nsstring	nsdata
the value parameter can be only property list objects nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary

11838882

11839085
gitolite	gitosis
if you will have a number of other people contributing to the codebase you might consider setting up gitosis or gitolite which make it easy to do this

11839085
gitolite	gitosis
if you re choosing between gitosis and gitolite i d go with gitolite since gitosis appears to have been abandoned and is no longer being actively maintained

11839144
fadein	fadeout
i ve got the fadein and fadeout working correctly but i m getting bugs if i try to trigger the same even on a different list item while the pop-up is still active

11839704
for-loop	loops
you could either do this by putting your while loops inside of a for-loop that goes over q but a more r-tastic way would be to simply define and leave the rest of your code as-is

11839771
implements	extends
abstract classes with abstract methods and interfaces serve the same purpose however you can extends only one class but implements as many as you want thus making your code less prone to significant changes should you decide the inherit some functionality from some other class

it is a combination of two things one that switches with the current application a list of menus implemented by nsmenu nsmenuitem etc. and one that doesn t change the system s status bar nsstatusbar

11839791
nsmenu	nsstatusitem
you can use nsstatusitem to define something for this bar to display a menu when clicked and in your nsmenu definition you can add a view using setview this is the part that requires mac os x 10.5

11839798
implements	extends
the major advantage an interface gives in java that you can implements more than one interfaces but you can extends only one class

11839814

maya	blender	maya	3dsmax	3dsmax	blender
if you wanted to simulate curved collision surfaces consider using a meshcollider and import a basic 3d mesh from blender 3dsmax maya etc. with a low poly count that fits the shape of your level

11840109
move	drag
a very quick way to demonstrate this is to drag a couple of cubes gameobject- create other- cube select it and right click- remove component on both the meshfilter and meshrenderer leaving you with the boxcollider which you can move rotate scale

11840151

the problem with fadein not working when the fadeout is interrupted is because fadein only works if the element is hidden

11840268
width	height
swf s usually do scale or you can set their scale behaviour in your embed swfobject options so if you just restrict the width the height of the swf itself scales accordingly

11840268
width	height
what you notice though is how the swf uses the container s width to determine its size fitting the width and scaling the height accordingly

for-loop	loops
you could solve this by using a for-loop be careful the length of loops might change due to the removal of elements

11841863
free	malloc
ditto for malloc free as opposed to new delete and many other aspects

11841865
qobject	qwidget
my main problem is that any implementation that i could think of i mainly thought about implementing it with signals and slots will require the refreshable interface to inherit from qobject so some meta-data will be stored and i ll be able to use signal and slots and this means that widgets will not be able to derive from refreshable because they already inherit qobject via qwidget

11841912
getter	setter
the approach that most of other programmers would expect you to follow is to create special getter and setter methods

post	get
my answer is if you call any specific post in html which is obviously admin manageable there are lots of chances that same post can get deleted by mistake then the above code will not work as the post id could not be retrieved so we basically make a category and add the post in it

11842567
qobject	qwidget
and yes you are right on the observation that you can t inherit from qwidget and yet another interface which must inherit from qobject too in order to be able to declare a slot

11842764
ubuntu	debian
i would venture a guess that this is a bug in the distro s packaging rather than in yaws since the man page clearly states that running it as a non-privileged user it falls back to reading etc yaws yaws.conf except that under debian ubuntu i m on debian 6 the permissions on etc yaws do not live up to the claim in the map page

11842788

i know you ve said you d like to avoid setting the width and height but that s the only way i ve managed to get it to work personally

11842793
width	height
setting the width and height of the containing div will make the image larger but only with fixed pixels

11842793

11843134
liferay	alfresco
so my recommendation would be that unless you really need a portal and a lot of the stuff liferay offers that isn t available in alfresco or would be hard to develop for alfresco i d stick with alfresco as my collaboration platform and develop the necessary functionality in alfresco share for example as it does a lot of the stuff liferay also does

so if an image has size of 300 450 and we have set this image to an imageview of scale type centerinside with dimensions 200 400 then it will make size of image to 200 300 according to the target dimensions so scaling it down make 200 is minimum in width and height

11845124
width	height
there is no problem with that simply change the contentsize of your uiscrollview and you are done.increase its width size and its height should be as it is at present.moreover you can also hide the vertical scrollers also

int	boolean
my first idea was to create an array of int and store one boolean per bit in each int

11845287
int	boolean
however the overhead with this solution is still way too big storing 10 8 boolean bits in a 32-bit environment php_int_size 4 bytes needs an array of 3125000 int consuming 254 mb of memory whereas the rare data of 10 8 boolean would only need 12 mb

11856804
packets	multicast
acquring a multicastlock will cause the stack to receive packets addressed to multicast addresses

11856804

getter	setter
actually it is impossible to have out parameters in java but you can make a work around making the method take on a de-reference for the immutable string and primitives by either writing a generic class where the immutable is the generic with the value and setter and getter or by using an array where element 0 1 in length is the value provided it is instantiate first because there are situations where you need to return more than one value where having to write a class just to return them where the class is only used there is just a waste of text and not really re-usable

the easiest way to post data from javascript and move the page to the results rather than using ajax to do so without changing the page is to put that information into a form and then submit it

11866358
google-chrome	firefox
if you open it up in google-chrome and firefox or ie you ll notice i m having some trouble getting the lis to correctly line up with the nav bar

11866375
google-chrome	firefox
my application has an apache server on the port 80 and my websocket is on the port 843 everything is working fine on firefox and google-chrome

11866385
joptionpane	jdialog
consider using a joptionpane or a modal jdialog for displaying a blocking window that stops the main program until the dialog has been dealt with

11866413
hide	show
the link s click event should call a jquery that calls a method to toggle hide and show for elements in matching the class

11866413
put	get
this will obviously need tweaking to get right against your specific requirements and there will need to be some null checks put into place where failures could occur

11866414
int	double
numeric sorting double int on every column with numbers

11866447
hash	salt
i have a load of zf1 salt hash elements in various forms on my site and 99 of the time they work fine but occasionally they fail

11866474
qscrollarea	qspinbox
on qspinbox inside a qscrollarea how to prevent spin box from stealing focus when scrolling

11866496
public	protected
s the difference between public default protected and private

11866496
superclass	subclassing
why can t a subclassing in one package access the protected member of it s superclass in another package by the reference of the superclass

11866498
hide	show
i have a little web app in which i show and hide divs a lot

11866498
hide	show
sometimes however i need to add a css class to that div that hide the div using display none rather than jquery s hide function because i still need to know if the given div was initial show on the screen

11866498
addclass	removeclass
i typically use jquery s addclass and removeclass accordingly

11866498
hide	show
jsfiddle example 2 - after using the show and hide functions it will not properly hide the div using the css class

11866505
width	height
so to do this you just copy the width height pins etc.. and then step through all the glues in the original shape and move the glues to the new shape

11866555
client-side	server-side
in short there is no footprint available server-side that tells you anything about what client-side method was used to change an attribute

11866586
hide	show
i have done this also a lot - my solution was to not use the hide show at all and simply create a hidden css class and toggle that or add remove as you have done

11866629
hide	show
its because jquery hide show puts an inline display property to hide or show the div

11866629
hide	show
you can use .css display to clean the div after using hide show

11866646
hide	show
additionally i would recommend sticking with one way to show hide stuff your own or jquery

11866646
hide	show
use jquery show hide for all showing hiding but you can still add a class for tracking just don t have that class hide your elements

11866656
ubuntu	debian
then exit the console and reconfigure the system time zone debian ubuntu sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

11866670
width	height
main problem reason is width and relative when you add absolute position relative is must of the parent element and width and height are must it absolute element

11866715
jar	.war
you don t have to use that runtime jar though or you can use it in just your documentum .war if one is non-documentum

11866732
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but very badly in ie

11866758
hide	show
i use jquery to hide all nested items and an only show the major categories when the page loads

11866806
int	chars
key_t ftok const chars pathname int proj_id

11866815
tunnel	vpn
i have established a site to site vpn tunnel and have created the appropriate subnets and placed a virtual machine in one of the subnets that isn t the gateway subnet

11866835
post	get
with the help of live http headers or some browser plugins similar you can grab the get or post request and parse the response web page and try to emulate human behavior and try to get some similar result

11866835
post	get
emulating post and get request is the most clean way i think

11866891
richfaces	omnifaces
i m not sure richfaces will be able to help you with that but omnifaces surely will

11866915
titanium	mosync
if you are looking for real native widgets combined with html you can look into mosync s native ui which support windows phone metro ui too or titanium

11866925
public	protected
the usual access specifiers are private protected and public

11866929
firefox	safari
under safari it works beautifully but under firefox it just lands with a thud skipping the animation entirely and just doing a regular old .show

11866939
google-chrome	firefox
another issue that this code is running only on firefox and ie but it doesn t run on google-chrome

11866956
filtering	grouping	sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering
attributes - can be used filtering sorting grouping and included in results

11866966
width	height
the rectangle class provides methods such as x y width and height components that would give me positions of the rectangles

11866968
versioning	upgrade
most of these attacks occur on drupal sites some of them are upgrade to the latest versioning of everything modules + core and still show signs of attacks

11866981
getter	setter
i have to mention that if i call getattributes .get name from the encodebegin method i get the correct name value but i m intrigued why it doesn t work with getter and setter

11866985
client-side	server-side
first off javascript is evaluated on the client-side long after the php code has been scanned and dealt with on the server-side

11867011
folder	directory
i was thinking of splitting the cache folder up into sub directory that contain the first letter of the file name and then possibly breaking it down further from there

11867016
qtabwidget	qpushbutton
so can anyone tell me how can i link qpushbutton to tab3 of qtabwidget so that when i click the button it should take me to tab 3

11867063
stretchblt	bitblt
when using this method in my regular programming work life is easy i just bitblt the four corner and then stretchblt the remaining parts into place

11867071
for-loop	loops
my json data specifies albums so i loops through them with a simple for-loop

11867082
datamapper	activerecord
i recently became aware of datamapper and see it s support for legacy database schemas is far superior to activerecord

11867130
range	minimum
for each incoming range adjust minval and maxval variables - to hold minimum value in all range and maximum value in all range respectively

11867197
nlb	iis
i ve recently setup windows nlb custering on a couple of servers hosting iis

11867250
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
is there any way in google-chrome safari or firefox to get a stack trace logged or set a breakpoint for whenever that widget s options data gets changed

11867253
firefox	safari
firefox doesn t seem to support running javascripts but in safari you might use a script like this to get the urls of all links

11867302
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome firefox because they auto-correct your html code

11867302
width	height
your css code is missing something is an inline element so height en width will not work unless you make it a block element

11867324
int	chars
so i learned that int can keep informations that are under 11 chars long

11867355
post	get
a get request that routes to post index.json

11867401
hash	salt
hash the password and the salt using sha-1 or similar hashing algorithm

11867401
hash	salt
or have the user sign up and get a passkey which is a random sequence of characters have him her hash it once no salt and send it to your api then rehash it with the salt and compare that

11867406
width	height
in my application i need to store the exact area height width within the textview that contains text

11867411
sorting	filtering
the strange part comes when i try to add filtering or sorting

11867480
spaces	delimiter
in your example it looks like each subfield is delimiter by a pair of spaces and a pipe character between them and if that s the case make sure that you either create rules to let you escape that delimiter as needed or make sure that the frontend never passes the delimiter to the database

11867509
updatepanel	scriptmanager
at best the scriptmanager will perform a response.clear to wipe out your response.writes at worst you ll break the updatepanel protocol body and you ll get a javascript error

11867552
hide	show
a more advanced option is to hide the file upload box when the page is loaded then create a clone of it that gets show to the user

11867557
uilabel	uitextview
from pulling an uiimage from a uitextview or uilabel gives white image

11867606
post	get
xhr-polling means that your server will be waiting for 10 seconds on any get of post received that it does not have an answer before answering instead of sending back an empty response

11867606
nodejitsu	heroku
i personally use xhr-polling as a fallback option from websockets in an application on nodejitsu another node hosting like heroku and it is working fine

11867606
post	get
there is no new connection that is created on every new polling it is just a way that only one get or post is sent to the server every 10 seconds instead of having to poll the server every .5 seconds to have a real-time application

11867668
micro-optimization	benchmarking
however if you re not using an in-memory database such as h2 we re talking about micro-optimization here as shown in the benchmarking

11867703
overwrite	preserve
such that the id from a is preserve and not overwrite by b

11867764
many-to-many	one-to-many
the choice between the two is one of practicality how likely is the model to change from a one-to-one to a one-to-many or many-to-many

11867794
for-loop	loops
suppose i have a for-loop that iterates over a generator and in this loops i m building a list for later use

11867835
postgresql	mysql
only the sqlite3 backend should be dropping tables postgresql and mysql both provide powerful enough alter table commands to avoid that

11867836
put	get
you will need to get a copy from another system put it into the local system32 folder and apply regsvr to it

11867838
opensso	openam
i d like to add the openam opensso sso feature to jboss eap 6 or jboss as 7

11867846
addition	multiplication
with a little multiplication and addition you find that which accords with the default integer size in this program being 4-bytes ie half the size of the s used in the other variables

11867887
int	chars
the following code example demonstrates that the implicit cast from short to chars fires at level 3 while the implicit cast from int to chars fires only at warning level 4

11867888
for-loop	arrays
i am splitting the arrays in chunks of 500 and using settimeout instead of for-loop

11867897
int	chars
since this particular unicode chars is beyond ascii range you would define getescapesequence int ch to return proper escape sequence and could otherwise use default settings

11867954
kerberos	ntlm
ntlm is not like kerberos where there s a signed token that a service can validate on its own

11867975
ssd	sata
a typical sata ssd drive can read at about 400 mb s and perform 80 000 iops and a typical pci ssd can read at 900 mb s and perform 230 000 iops

11867978
carrierwave	fog
since the fog gem has multipart uploads built in thanks to veraticus for pointing it out the appropriate configuration attributes just need to be passed into fog via carrierwave

11868002
width	height
in sheet1 change the cell height and width of say a1 as shown in the snapshot below

11868014
post	get
here my post to get last n record that will help you if you want to get last inserted record

11868043
post	put
i would post or put these objects in the body of an ajax request using my little request service which ended like so

11868051
post	get
i am unable to get collection value during post in mvc 3

11868053
slideup	slidedown
i am using jquery to toggle slidedown and slideup for a section of rows in my table

11868061
onresume	onpause
you will have to implement a broadcastreceiver on your activity and register and unregister it on the onresume and onpause methods

11868069
daemons	launchd
i am new to os x and have to create an application having 2 parts - launchd daemons and launchd agent

11868069
daemons	launchd
the daemons is going to do stuff such as command execution logging etc and has to somehow communicate these results to launchd agent which would transfer them to a login item displaying a gui although that is a future step

11868074
maven	pom.xml
in the script above replace mvn clean install by the command line allowing you to build your project and remove the if statement that tests the existance of a maven pom.xml file

11868122
ready	each
i have 3 pages that uses the same files the images and it is too expensive to load the images at each page s ready section so i was thinking about loading the images to an array or list with the getfilesasync method when the app starts up and then making it public with the winjs.namespace.define

11868135
children	parent
if you have another element inside parent you can use this technique to make one of the children full height

11868143
post	get
the thing is that after the post is successful it m being redirected the get function but with a post call and it raises method not allowed

11868148
put	get
what must i put in that command to get these file names

11868164
rank	max
this is not the right way to do it because it doesn t select the max rank of each book

11868166
inherited	properties
in theory you can inherited from nancysparkview and specify that as your base view in your spark settings and add that properties along with references to system.web.mvc etc in that class and your views should then be able to call into the helpers assuming everything is referenced correctly

11868167
hash	md5
converting a hexadecimal value that represents a hash value md5 or

11868178
post	put
i have also seen the thousands of post online that say that you can put any generic class that extends a particular base class into a collection of the type of the base class

11868249
margin	height
my sticky footer worked fine at first but when the content is at a certain height there is a margin between the footer and bottom of the page

11868268
prepare	execute
for all those who get the following error when trying to execute a prepare pdo query

11868346
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox ie it looks just fine but what google-chrome is doing is that the background image starts off correctly the background-position works but the rest of the image stretches to the start of the next element

11868405
width	height
when original image have less width and height or scaling ratio more ie 0.5 - 0.9 then all fine

11868417
put	get	post	put	post	get
get put post or delete

11868437
removeclass	next
on a side note update your code to call removeclass on the current object first before adding it to the next object

11868443
folder	directory
create a fixtures directory in your app s folder

11868489
post	put
if it is the former the form s method is set to put if the latter the form s action is set to post

11868582
postgresql	mysql
i am looking for a pure-python sql library that would give access to both mysql and postgresql

11868590
maven-release-plugin	pom.xml
when i try to run the maven-release-plugin it changes the version in the pom.xml file

11868611
google-chrome	firefox
the strange thing is google-chrome show page correctly like firefox and ie

11868645
devise	cancan
of note are rails 3.1.5 devise mysql2 activeadmin custom fork not my choice cancan guard cucumber_rails and database_cleaner

11868650
put	get
niceboxes is the gallery name and all images with this tag get put into the same gallery

11868661
post	put
forms editing existing resources use put forms creating a new resource use post

11868665
post	put
another alternative to consider is that if you do a put rather than post that will overwrite the existing data rather than appending to it

11868696
pull	push
you can find all the basic commands like commit update merge push pull etc

11868699
post	put
if user is a new record post is used and the button label becomes create user otherwise put is used and the label becomes update user

11868713
post	put
now consider a similar case to the above but for an action such as create or update - things activated by simulated put or actual post requests

11868717
union	distinct
the union clause can be faster because it will return distinct records at once duplicated records won t be returned otherwise you will need to do it in the application

11868717
union	distinct
you can mix union all and union distinct in the same query

11868717
union	distinct
types are treated such that a distinct union overrides any all union

11868717
union	distinct
a distinct union can be produced explicitly by using

11868717
union	distinct
union distinct or implicitly by using union with no following distinct

11868728
persistent	transient
that s ok with transient objects but how about persistent objects

11868762
getter	setter
better is to delegate the getter setter to uicomponent#getstatehelper instead of to local properties

11868780
ireport	subreports
then in ireport you can add the subreports in to summary band passing any needed information that it needs to run i.e database connection datasource parameters etc.

11868781
post	get
if i knew other fields properties on your model i could craft a form post with that information and get it saved

11868809
jobs	cron
i have an app-engine paid app that s averaging around 200 visits per day 1000 page views sporadically it spikes up to 1000 visits and 10000 page views or more and i am currently waking it up via cron jobs every 5 minutes to ensure reasonable performance

11868881
getter	setter
where the persistedproperty attributes generates a getter and setter just like the default property attribute except i want to add a line of code to the generated setter

11868897
min	max
i ve tried messing with using min max operators but have noticed that they return unpredictable rows from the application_status table when they work

11868908
apache	nginx
i am running a django site on apache which is front ed by nginx instance to serve my static media

11868928
qplaintextedit	qcompleter
i have a qcompleter using a qstringlistmodel for my qplaintextedit check this example

11868957
getter	setter
for intellisense to work however this must be done in a library as the final compiled code will be unrolled into the full property getter setter

11868976
gson	jackson
also in gson v jackson - part 3 on instancecreator for a parameterized type i posted a couple different solutions to a similar problem

11868986
stdout	stderr
sends both stderr and stdout to dev null essentially throwing them away

11868986
stdout	stderr
sends stderr from the time command to the same place that stdout is sent so that it may be captured by the command substitution

11868988
ubuntu	linux
they are also a mixture of windows 2k3 2k8 and linux mostly ubuntu lucid boxes running various different applications with various different requirements so add-on modules like backhand and lvs aren t an option for me

11869020
put	get
that is put the correlated subquery in the select clause to get the most recent status

11869030
int	boolean
or do i always have to only have one single parameter returned eg string int boolean

11869036
ssl	https
we decided to use https instead of http but after googling i understood that ssl only is not enough

11869043
fadein	hide
in ie8 when i fadein a column after hide or .fadeout the column header loses its border

11869043
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox does not have this issue

11869093
google-chrome	firefox
to troubleshoot i created the following html which runs fine in firefox and google-chrome but produces an object expected error at the line

11869135
width	height
i m getting height and width of a view inflated in the getview method

11869135
post	get
usually i use post on the view to get the size after it was attached to the layout

11869164
pull	push
developer b commits tries to push gets a message saying he must pull

11869237
stdout	stderr
everything you write to stdout and stderr is redirected into the files stdout.txt and stderr.txt respectively where the exe resides

11869265
super	self
an init method must always assign because the super init method might return a value different from the original self

11869297
mdx	dax
of late redmond s energy has shifted to bism dax so even analysis services mdx has languished

11869307
textview	imageview
all the buttons textview and imageview are not being recognized

11869311
cout	cin
read the user input inside the main the part where you use cin and cout

11869363
int	boolean
it is not necessary to always return primitive types such as string int boolean

11869370
google-chrome	safari
pretty silly but at least it works and in both google-chrome and safari

11869376
folder	directory
with the file will be searched in the directory where the file which includes something is located if the include isn t found the compiler will look in the standart include directory it s compiler dependent in which folder this is

11869415
oncreate	onstart
you probably is calling this at oncreate or onstart or onresume methods which runs before layout measure

11869431
google-chrome	firefox
now i have created a test case which i want to run it on ie firefox and google-chrome at the same time

11869431
google-chrome	firefox
i already set up the grid with a hub and three remote controls firefox port 5556 ie port 5557 and google-chrome port 5558

11869434
width	height
you set them based on the width height of the mainmenu sprite

11869434
width	height
but that sprite has no children yet the child is added on the next line so the width height are still 0

11869437
floating-point	fractions
ieee 754 floating-point numbers are represented by a sign +1 or -1 encoded as 0 or 1 an exponent for double-precision -1022 to 1023 encoded as the exponent plus 1023 so 1 to 2046 and a significand for double-precision a fractions usually from 1 to just under 2 represented with 53 bits but encoded with 52 bits because the first bit is implicitly 1

11869437
hex	binary
e.g. the number 6.5 is encoded with the bits 0 sign +1 10000000001 exponent 2 and 1010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 binary fraction 1.1010 hex 1.a decimal 1.3125

11869437
floating-point	fractions
we can write this in hexadecimal floating-point as 0x1.ap2 hex fractions 1.a multiplied by 2 to the power of decimal 2

11869437
range	infinity
when numbers are in the normal range not underflowing to denormals and not overflowing to infinity then there are no differences in the significands of numbers with different exponents so

11869477
google-chrome	firefox
when i open the html in firefox and google-chrome the information is displayed correctly the xxx.php file contains a simple mysql query but it does not work with ie

11869495
puts	gets
the method i m having problems with gets two foxpro tables and puts them in datasets

11869500
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome and firefox but as expected not in internet explorer

11869508
for-loop	loops
instead of a while loops i would recommend a for-loop

11869534
int	chars
you re adding chars together - which will give you an int value

11869589
hash	md5
if you just want to md5 hash a simple string i found this works for me

11869609
postgresql	mysql
if you are looking to mix and match some tables in mysql and some tables in postgresql vs

11869609
postgresql	mysql
a single database that could be either mysql or postgresql i ve been working on an orm called orb that focuses more on object-oriented design and allows for multiple databases and relationships between databases

11869609
postgresql	mysql
right now it only supports postgresql and mongo just cause i haven t needed mysql but i d be up for writing that backend

11869634
innodb	myisam
method #2 use innodb instead of myisam

11869639
for-loop	loops
you should use a for-loop rather than a while loops with an incrementing variable

11869659
profiling	debugging
when i debugging and f10 on just the linq query not the return i get this output in sql profiling

11869721
width	height
my actual image size are width 300 and height 300

11869730
subclipse	visualsvn
what i ended up doing was to delete all the svn files on my hard drive deleting subclipse tortise silksvn and then reinstalling visualsvn using the instructions here

11869730
subclipse	visualsvn
i installed subclipse first then installed visualsvn which worked for me and avoided all the configuration steps i had to do with other svn packages that were referenced in the original tutorial

11869749
pow	sqrt
if you assume a wrong gamma value of 2.0 you can calculate it with a sqrt which may be faster then even the built in method that behind the screens does most likely something like pow frag.rgb 1.0 2.2

11869833
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
but my solution works great on ie9 when running it in the standalone browser also in google-chrome opera safari but not when running it in eclipse

11869874
width	height
you probably need to assign a height and width to the image

11869889
onchange	onkeyup
the onchange event only fires after the textbox loses focus so i suggest the onkeyup event

11869897
setinterval	settimeout
for example i redefined setinterval and settimeout functions to track how many timeouts intervals are active and now i relized that i wont be able to use them outside of the file the engine is in

11869902
google-chrome	safari
i ve tested in ff14 google-chrome 21 safari 5 windows and safari mac and webkit browsers on android and iphone

11869902
opera	firefox
i ve attached screenshots of 2 requests in firefox and opera

11869902
opera	firefox
as you can see in the screens firefox sees the cookie headers and sets them appropriately but opera does not

11869992
post	get
i ve scoured what seems like every post on here but i can t seem to get any further in finding a solution

11870002
pbkdf2	salt
winrar uses a good kdf pbkdf2 which includes a salt

11870002
hash	salt
the second property is achieved by doing something like this take the password append the salt hash the lot

i m having an issue when i set my arrays which is defined as a for-loop within my html equal to and it doesn t pick up on it

11870176
postgresql	mysql
it will work with most database types and certainly does work with postgresql and mysql

11870180
hide	show
you could create a div that was the size of the html give it a z-index very high after that you hide or show this div when you want to block or show the page

11870199
postgresql	mysql
if you aren t wedded to mysql i would urge you to consider using postgresql which is basically a much better database all round

11870205
stdout	stderr
one problem i experienced with trying the proc reliable route is that it seems to have after effects on stdout and stderr and i would need to fix those after each call to run

11870205

i am running in parallel and any change to stdout and stderr effect all of the threads using windows at least

11870205

11870657
post	get
running curl with -si options to get headers and then parse for filename is not the the solution here because curl doesn t accept mix of -i and -f options.it has to be one of them but only with -f i can see headers and the server also sends file along with them.is there a way to get only headers remember i have also to send post data in order to get a file so i can parse them and extract a filename

11870743
g++	gcc
the source code provided was compiled with gcc g++ 4.5.3 without any special optimization flags

11870747

simply specifying max min-prefixed attributes is not enough you should add specific height and width settings only then fluttering disappears

what i really was looking for turned out to be packag krb5-server-ldap this is where the ldap schemas for kerberos are stored.but what i especially want to mention is the brilliant stuff about kerberos ldap nfs in this blog kerberos+ldap as backend .i would recommend everyone looking for kerberos 5 plus ldap information to read this material.it has saved me hour of work.very precise and right on target

it will add some overhead to serving the files though as a full symfony2 request will need to take place whereas serving files straight over apache or nginx won t have the overhead of the framework stack

i would like to return the object after the post http post or get request

11871071

i read some article about performing an http get and post request but i still cannot figure it out

11872055
awt	swing
on the other hand in the tutorial the canvas is inside a jframe so isn t that already mixing swing and awt

pop-up	dialog
i also took the .h and .cpp files from the pop-up dialog and tested them with their own main.cpp and the connect worked perfectly

11872511
multiplication	modulo
note the uint32_t s as opposed to int s - they make sure the multiplication overflows modulo 2 32 as it is supposed to do if you choose 32 as the word size

11872511
fixed-point	fractions
calculating ak w gives a fixed-point result with the format q32.32 the mod 1 step takes only the 32 fractions bits

11872511
integer	fractions
of course when multiplied by m all the fractions bits become integer bits because of how m was chosen and so it simplifies to just a plain old modular multiplication

11874320
mouseleave	mouseenter
you weren t accounting for the scrolled status of the page so the mouseenter mouseleave events were regardless of whether the page was scrolled resetting the class-names without regard

11874320
mouseleave	mouseenter
the result of this is that if the page is un-scrolled the mouseenter mouseleave events do nothing because they shouldn t the normal class-name is correct in this case whereas if the page is scrolled they remove the scroll class-name on mouseenter and restore it on mouseleave

11874322

i am guessing that it has something to do with my get and post functions being improperly formatted but am not sure how to proceed

11874430
getter	setter
properties can have side-effects they provide syntactic sugar around getter and setter methods

11874439
getter	setter
he s saying that properties can provide a getter but not a setter therefore making them read-only for example

11874439
getter	setter
this means that property setter getter can apply logic that a mere public field can t

width	height
if you have a gridview that is 400dp in width and 800dp in height

if you only ever want it to fit the height assuming that the height might change programmatically or due to different device s screens i would suggest making the image considerably wider so that even when presented with a gridview with a very wide aspect ratio it will choose to fit the height and crop the width

innodb	myisam
myisam doesn t enforce foreign key constraints but innodb does. the output from

11886770
innodb	myisam

if you want the stdout lines cleanly separated from the stderr lines consider using two log files possibly with date stamp prefixes on each line to allow chronological reassembly later on

11887304

if i can t get this working then i guess i can move over to cocoa event handling but the pc code also has some keyboard and mouse polling that i was hoping to implement as well and i m not sure that cocoa supports polling keyboard state - although i will be happy to be corrected

11887308

reading gunicorn s documentation a bit further and reading a bit more about eventlet and gevent i think that gunicorn answers my question perfectly

11887636
eventlet	gevent
so the solution is to change the default worker type from synchronous to asynchronous choosing eventlet or gevent here s a comparison

11887636
eventlet	gevent
i was wondering how i should change my existing code but apparently the standard python modules are monkey-patched by gunicorn upon startup actually by eventlet or gevent so all existing code can run without change and still behave nicely with other threads

to me it s pretty obvious why someone would want a version of an app for small phone screens and another larger tablet screens

11888327
screens	tablet
at the same time you wouldn t want those fat buttons designed for mobile screens showing on a nice 10 tablet

11888382
int	chars
you are storing numbers as int but querying then as chars the like operator implicitly converts int to chars and it surely is not optimal

11888443
division	multiplication
operations like multiplication or division can have special meaning for matrices

11888454
ffmpeg	libav
yes it is possible to pass many of the x264 options through the command-line and api at least when using libav i can√¢ t confirm with ffmpeg now

11888506
post	get
so now i m thinking that i may need to just translate the post raw body contents into query string variables - the volume of data in the call is probably low enough that we can get away with this - and then maybe update the api call handler to accept get parameters in this scenario

11888510
width	height
this too is solvable by explicitly setting height width and using images of an exact size - or more effectively by using background url ...

11888586

please take a look in google-chrome or opera to see how it should look as well as either firefox or ie

11889866
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
also there is another problem with the position relative function on the login box in firefox - the login box works perfectly fine in the other 3 browsers ie google-chrome and opera

11889867

in this phase each parent calls layout on all of its children to position them

11889869
rss	feed

width	margin
yes just be sure to set the left margin and width for each div to be the same and you can alter the top and bottom margins to make them fit how you d like

11889930
post	get
be careful that window.location.assign makes a new get request after your main post request

11889943
post	get
i suggest you use a rejex to get rid of all the slashes when you retrieve the field from the database but before you post it to the client

11889948
ilist	icollection
another thing is that i tried to change ilist of t to icollection of t and that could be a solution as client code of myclass uses add remove methods so no refactoring is necessary but interesting thing happened

11889949
coalesce	isnull
another complication is that isnull does not do type promotion in the same way that coalesce does though coalesce has its own problems due to not being a function√¢ it is expanded to a case expression sometimes causing unexpected side-effects due to repeat expression evaluation

bluetooth	usb

second table has all children accounts that may or may not have a match to a parent account in the parent table

11890110
equals	gethashcode
the one thing to keep in mind with a hash based data structure is that your objects need to have implementations of gethashcode and equals that are meaningful the default ones usually aren t for your custom types

11890119
hide	show
that would hide the login view and show the page that is below it

11890130
ready	each
for each remaining set which has pairs that are ready to be included you create a new subsequent state taking all the pairs from the set which are ready

11890176
screens	tablet
okay so what i would suggest for this is to use the relatively new qualifiers sw600dp and sw720dp shortest width 600dp or 720dp to define larger sizes for those screens -- those are basically 7 and 10 tablet

11890234

i did figure out that the accordion does indeed set the width and height of any contained divs to 0

11890376
width	height
thus when i tried to access it through the annotatedtimeline it couldn t find a valid width or height and threw and error

11890390
rss	feed
my problem is that our trac is not public not even to all these users who don t have accounts in trac otherwise we could point them at reports in trac and they could log in as themselves to read them and we can t automate this extraction because it requires a forms authentication process - i can t find a readonly rss feed which doesn t require authentication

11890710
uipagecontrol	subviews
you can have a container viewcontroller with uipagecontrol and uiscrollview that holds your widgets just like the weather app in ios.depending on the different widgets you need to implement different viewcontrollers and add their views to scrollview.if you do not implement different view controller you might have difficulties handling your subviews since you need to control your views from a single view controller

due to the fact that this application is already written it would be an insurmountable task to make every mouselistener keyboard listener any kind of input listener to extends implements a specific class interface that would store the last time a user-initiated event happened

background-image	background-position
if you want to have an image inside you can just put the inside the header element or use it as the background-image url in the css and position it with background-position see also although the compatability table at the bottom is important if you want to do anything too specific with this property

11891107
background-image	background-color	background-repeat	background-image

11891125
google-chrome	safari

answers on other questions give values which appear to be about the same width height of the text

11891731

suggested methods include using √¢ sizewithfont constrainedtosize and other nsstring methods sizethatfits method of the uitextview this gives a more correct height but the full width of the view and the contentsize property of the text view also gives the wrong width

put	get
i have tried to put it in the app delegate also and i can t get that to work at all

onresume	onpause
to make things a little better you should implement onpause and onresume as they are going to be called each time you change of activity or rotate your phone

11892201
onresume	onpause
in any case you should add all the event listeners into the oncreate method but anything related to the information being shown could go into onresume and you should save any information or state during onpause

11892265
filtering	grouping
for grouping of similar elements you want to give them all a common class and then use getelementsbyclassname notice the plural elements vs element - this function won t work with ie 8 or earlier however so if you need to support ie you would have to do getelementsbytagname and then filtering in only those that have the class you want

11892537
reportlab	pdfrw
but you can do this a different way with pdfrw -- if you can use another tool to convert the svg file into a pdf image then pdfrw can take that converted pdf and add it as a form xobject into the pdf that you are generating with reportlab

11892537
reportlab	pdfrw
the entire reason i wrote pdfrw in the first place was for this exact use-case -- being able to reuse vector images in new pdfs created by reportlab
