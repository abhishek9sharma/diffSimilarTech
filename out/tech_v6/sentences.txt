cassini	iis
pattern4	
there are lots of good reasons to prefer iis over the cassini server articles by dominick baier

20666
hash	md5
pattern4	
to go along with what everyone here is saying i use hashtab when i need to generate compare md5 and sha1 hash on windows

70375
equals	gethashcode
pattern2	
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

70375
equals	gethashcode
pattern2	
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

70423
quicksort	heapsort
pattern7	significantly slower	pattern0	slower	
but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average

70440
quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	usually faster	pattern0	faster	
quicksort is usually faster than mergesort just because it s easier to code a tight implementation and the operations it does can go faster

70440
quicksort	mergesort
pattern10	generally faster	pattern10	generally faster	
it s because that quicksort is generally faster that people use it instead of mergesort

gif	png
pattern7	much better	pattern0	better	pattern10	pattern10	
png compresses much better than gif and allows more colors at the same time

1500490
maven	m2e
pattern3	
i recommend using maven eclipse and m2e

1500539
post	get
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	pattern0	less secure	
since post is better suited to transfer large amounts of data or difficult formatted data it is the established standard for submitting forms but it is in no way safer unsafer or more less secure than get requests

2100226
equals	gethashcode
pattern3	
we recommend implementing equals and gethashcode using business key equality

2900131
xsl-fo	xslt
pattern7	
i found the xsl-fo designer from ecrion to be good for both programmers familiar with xslt and xsl-fo and old ladies that need to make changes to the templates we are deploying a desktop solution based on xsl-fo that replaces an older proprietary solution and the ladies can make small changes to the document templates

7700192
bash	zsh
pattern4	
note that you ll never get behavior that exactly matches zsh one with bash only

note that you ll never get behavior that exactly matches zsh one with bash only

583
int	double
pattern4	
personally i prefer int string double etc

2360
mouse	keyboard
pattern4	
go to system preferences keyboard and mouse then choose keyboard shortcuts

2562
wmv	flv
pattern0	easier	
i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv

6659
junit	testng	junit	unitils	junit	easymock	testng	unitils	testng	easymock	easymock	unitils
pattern4	
but i would recommend unitils a great wrapper for junit testng dbunit easymock regardless of which route you take

6671
junit	testng
pattern8	more configurable	
testng strives to be much more configurable than junit but in the end they both work equally well

9788
subtraction	addition
pattern2	
additionally while reads and writes are atomic there is a race condition with addition subtraction and incrementing and decrementing primitive types since they must be read operated on and rewritten

10232
ant	maven
pattern3	
they do a great job for us and i would highly recommend using maven over ant

10809
listview	gridview
pattern0	better	
listview much better than the gridview dataview in that they let you write out clean html

12586
rss	feed
pattern4	pattern4	
the rss brand very much defines the entire feed category though so on the rare occasion that someone does know enough to choose they will tend to choose rss because it s got the name. they will also tend to choose rss 2.0 because it s got the bigger number

13455
cvs	svn
pattern4	pattern2	
i would definitely choose svn over cvs if only because people who learned source control using cvs tend to use svn delete then svn add instead of svn move

14261
actionscript	mxml
pattern7	
if you write your own reusable components then writing them in actionscript may sometimes give you a little more control but for non-reusable views mxml is much better

16381
equals	gethashcode
pattern0	quicker	
gethashcode should be a lot quicker than equals but doesn t need to be unique

cassini	iis
pattern4	
there are lots of good reasons to prefer iis over the cassini server articles by dominick baier

20666
hash	md5
pattern4	
to go along with what everyone here is saying i use hashtab when i need to generate compare md5 and sha1 hash on windows

22074
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
pattern10	more	pattern10	more specific	
in my mind illegalargumentexception seems more specific than using a nullpointerexception since it s telling me that the problem was with an argument i passed to the method and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the method

23203
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
pattern7	
i really like thompsonâ s â œhaskell the craft of functional programmingâ because itâ s well written and haskell allows an easier start than other functional languages while being completely pure unlike lisp or scheme

24035
integer	unsigned
pattern0	
in fact your going to get a value bigger than an integer can hold 4 billion unsigned 2 billion signed before the stack is going to over flow fibbonaci 46

24476
goto	break
pattern0	simpler	
if you re in a nested loop and need to break out of all loops a goto can make this much cleaner and simpler than break statements and if-checks

25701
jdom	xom
pattern4	
i ve worked with jdom as well and there s absolutely nothing wrong with it although i do prefer xom

26851
perforce	svn
pattern8	more intuitive	
if anything i find working with svn easier and more intuitive than perforce

26851
perforce	svn
pattern8	more comfortable	
perforce does have support for many other oses but our non-windows devs feel more comfortable with svn too

27439
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	more	pattern10	more correct	pattern10	pattern10	
from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysql is less correct less compliant but faster

27440
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	
better performance can be bought with more ram and cpu and more appropriate database design and clever stored procedure tricks and so on - and all of that is cheaper and easier for random-website-x than agonizing over which to pick mysql or postgresql and specialist tuning from expensive dbas

27443
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	slower	pattern0	slower	
in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end

27529
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	
hard to compare mysql and postgresql

29557
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
pattern8	
i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.

29923
bazaar	git
pattern7	
in git you can do the same with playing around in the index staging area but bazaar has a better ui for it

34295
emacs	aquamacs
pattern4	
if it is emacs you want i would recommend aquamacs more mac-like or carbon emacs more gnu-emacs-like

34338
phpunit	simpletest
pattern0	easier	
i found simpletest was even easier than phpunit to set up

34474
phpunit	simpletest
pattern4	
i prefer phpunit now but when i started out i used simpletest as i didn t always have access to the command line

34566
equals	gethashcode
pattern2	
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

34566
equals	gethashcode
pattern2	
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

35627
filesystems	ntfs
pattern0	less	
when people say that unix filesystems are better they might mean to be saying oh ext3 stores bits in such as way that corruption happens way less than ntfs but they might also be talking about design choices made at the common layer above

37162
portrait	landscape
pattern4	
web browser print dialogs default to portrait so for every print job the user has to manually select landscape

44638
merb	ruby-on-rails
pattern4	
ok ruby-on-rails is actually pretty good but there is just a little bit too much magic going on in there from the ruby world i would much prefer merb to ruby-on-rails

44752
perforce	svn
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
make sure you re using a source control system that supports branching and merging i ve had experience with perforce and svn and while perforce is better svn is free

45963
free	malloc
pattern10	pattern10	
finding a package that can work with both new delete and malloc free obviously gives you more flexibility

46614
post	get
pattern10	also more	pattern10	also more secure	pattern8	more secure	
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking information into a url

47674
maven	m2e
pattern10	more	pattern10	more friendly	
in other words m2e is more friendly to the maven way

47929
udp	tcp
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt

48015
emacs	textmate
pattern7	better	
textmate is a better emacs for macs though that won t help you with solaris

48103
division	modulo
pattern0	faster	
a side effect of many division routines is the modulo - so in few cases should division actually be faster than modulo

50632
integer	unsigned
pattern7	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

50909
youtube	vimeo
pattern0	fewer users	
vimeo will always have fewer users than youtube because the user experience is poor for low bitrate users

52179
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	worse	
i just checked the timings using mysql 5 and they are slightly worse than postgresql

52725
gridview	repeater	gridview	formview
pattern10	pattern10	
the bind method really isn t for the repeater it s more for the formview or gridview where you are editing just one item in the list not every item in the list

52881
codeigniter	cakephp
pattern0	
also i don t think it is so much that asp.net mvc is so much better than cakephp or codeigniter ruby on rails etc. the great thing about asp.net mvc and other asp.net-based technologies such as monorail is that developers who are using asp.net now have the option of following the mvc pattern using tools and languages they are familiar with

54817
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
pattern4	pattern2	
this seems like an object state invalid scenario to me so i d pick invalidoperationexception over argumentexception the parameters are valid but not at this point in the objects life

55578
vmware	virtualbox
pattern7	more	
vmware has more features but costs 80 virtualbox on the other hand is more basic but is free for most users see virtualbox licensing faq for details

58301
directx	gdi
pattern0	pattern0	slower	
speed is usually faster than gdi and slower than directx and depends greatly on how you do things seen something to work 60 times faster after rewriting in a sensible way

58363
memcached	apc
pattern4	
i would recommend memcached or apc

60137
ubuntu	debian
pattern4	
i haven t decided which one yet but my understanding is that they ll give me a base os install i d prefer debian or ubuntu an ip address a root account ssh and that s about it

60910
emacs	aquamacs
pattern7	
however i m not really much of an emacs user and the preferences menu in aquamacs is less than clear on where and how one might make such a change

62220
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	
however the observation of database-locking stands - if you have particularly onerous updates sqlite performance won t match mysql or postgresql

64644
vim	emacs
pattern4	
i don t think you would want to wait 10 seconds for your text editor to become ready ...if you are going to spend some serious time coding then spend some time and learn to use vim emacs too but i recommend vim

65079
wideimage	phpthumb
pattern10	more	pattern10	more modern	pattern10	pattern10	
wideimage is the more modern php5 approach while phpthumb has much more features

67312
addition	multiplication
pattern0	
transcendental functions are always much more slower than addition or multiplication and a well-known bottleneck

68674
ubuntu	linux
pattern10	closer	pattern10	closer	
ubuntu is getting closer but there are still numerous things with linux that will keep the grandmothers of the world from using it

69545
richfaces	icefaces
pattern10	more	pattern10	more semantic	pattern8	more semantic support	
there is icefaces which provides more semantic support than richfaces .also you can try nitobi suite which also provides similar kinda solution.if you are not satisfied with any of these i suggest try to write your own part extending the sun faces

69989
post	get
pattern0	
get is basically just like post it just has a limit on the amount of data you can send which is usually a lot smaller than post and a semantic difference which makes get not a good candidate from that point of view even if technically they both can do it

70375
equals	gethashcode
pattern2	
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

70375
equals	gethashcode
pattern2	
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

70423
quicksort	heapsort
pattern7	significantly slower	pattern0	slower	
but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average

70440
quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	usually faster	pattern0	faster	
quicksort is usually faster than mergesort just because it s easier to code a tight implementation and the operations it does can go faster

70440
quicksort	mergesort
pattern10	generally faster	pattern10	generally faster	
it s because that quicksort is generally faster that people use it instead of mergesort

70627
quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	not better	
quicksort is not better it is well suited for a different kind of application than mergesort

70881
addition	multiplication
pattern7	higher	pattern0	higher precedence	
precedence rules specify priority of operators which operators will be evaluated first multiplication has higher precedence than addition pemdas

71743
tapestry	sitemesh
pattern10	pattern10	
i have used sitemesh and it is good for wrapping a set of pages in standard headers and footers but tapestry is better for creating components which are used on many pages possibly many times per page

73157
free	malloc
pattern7	pattern7	
yes that may since your allocating with new but deallocating with delelte yes malloc free is safer here but in c++ you should not use them since they won t handle de constructors

74931
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	better	
with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use postgresql performed better than mysql

74992
bash	zsh
pattern4	pattern2	
i prefer zsh over bash because of its support for very powerful file globbing variable expansion modifiers and faster tab completion

77328
textwrangler	bbedit
pattern0	pattern0	
i really do not get the appeal it s marginally better than textwrangler bbedit s free little brother but if you re spending money you may as well buy the better tool for a few dollars more

77883
bazaar	git
pattern7	imho easier	
bazaar is imho easier to learn than git

77945
quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	not better	pattern0	better	
quicksort is not better than mergesort

79550
width	height
pattern7	
if you can get that to work you might want to try progressively removing the height width position attributes from div.header to get the minimal required attributes to get the effect you want

79771
multiplying	multiplication
pattern10	slightly more	pattern10	slightly more complex	
multiplication is slightly more complex as it needs an integer multiplying followed by a scale back such as 0.72 2 becomes 72 200 becomes 14400 becomes 144 scaleback becomes 1.44

81982
robocopy	xcopy
pattern10	pattern10	
at least use xcopy robocopy is even faster

81983
datediff	difference
pattern10	more	pattern10	more difficult	
datediff becomes more difficult to use as you have more dateparts in your difference in your case looks like minutes and seconds

84239
distance	polygons
pattern4	
for each vertex in the red polygons compute the distance to each vertex in the blue polygons and find the closest hint compare distance 2 so you don t need the sqrt

84974
union	distinct
pattern4	
in most cases what you really want to say is union all as it does not do duplicate elimination think select distinct between sets which can result in quite a bit of savings in terms of execution time

85010
restrict	shared
pattern0	
the code is riddled with classes which contain nothing more than public shared attributes variables and methods functions the result of which restrict the application from opening more than one project at a time

85414
vmware	virtualbox
pattern2	
i ve been using vmware for a while and am very happy with it but i would like to compare it with virtualbox

85416
integer	fractions
pattern7	larger	
if the number of bits in the mantissa or fractions is larger than the number of bits in your integer type then you ll possibly lose precision when someone types in a number such as

87006
cvs	svn	accurev	cvs	accurev	svn
pattern4	
i ve used svn cvs clearcase base ucm ccc harvest but none of them can beat accurev s strengths

88100
udp	tcp
pattern4	
for instance if a preference picks tcp versus udp have your conditional instantiate a tcpprovider or udpprovider which the rest of your code uses with minimal muss or fuss

90477
quicksort	mergesort
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
as many people have noted the average case performance for quicksort is faster than mergesort

91149
jboss	glassfish
pattern4	
i would choose jboss or glassfish for a start

91317
webclient	webrequest
pattern7	sometimes easier	
webclient is sometimes easier to use than webrequest

94070
datamapper	activerecord
pattern10	potentially more	pattern10	potentially more complex	
datamapper is potentially more complex then activerecord but it s a lot easier to develop your domain model and database asynchronous then with activerecord

95121
x86	64bit
pattern7	considerably slower	pattern7	
x86 is considerably slower a few clocks plus a clock or so per function argument while 64bit is much less because most function arguments are passed in registers instead of on the stack

95821
eruby	erb
pattern4	
i see that it supposedly beats erb and eruby now.

99817
width	height
pattern7	more	
that is the height is more than half the width and depth -- little rule of thumb

101381
hex	binary
pattern7	
that s one reason why going from hex to binary is much easier than from decimal to binary

105287
nunit	mstest
pattern7	
although several ci tools such as teamcity have better support for nunit probably would change as mstest becomes more popular

105339
int	double
pattern10	more	pattern10	more difficult	
for floats and double it s more difficult as with plain int as these may or not may be in the host machines byte-order

107883
quicksort	heapsort
pattern0	faster	
for example quicksort average cost t n.log n and heapsort average cost t n.log n are both sorting algorithms with the same average cost - yet quicksort is typically much faster than heapsort

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
pattern10	more	pattern10	more invasive	pattern8	more invasive	
puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclass implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t

113331
wxpython	pyqt
pattern4	
wxpython has a very good demo and it can do pretty much anything which pyqt can do i would anyday prefer pyqt but it may bot be free for commercial purpose but wxpython is free and is decent cross platform library

115620
google-chrome	firefox
pattern0	pattern7	
until people have more experience with google-chrome i would think firefox is a better choice

115838
gif	png
pattern7	never worse	pattern0	better	
as a general rule png is never worse and often better than gif because of superior compression

115838
gif	png
pattern7	slightly better	
there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry

116210
gif	png
pattern0	smaller	
indexed png less than 256 colors is actually always smaller than gif so i use that most of the time

116461
gif	png
pattern0	larger equivalent	
if your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors

116739
hash	md5
pattern0	more reliable	
sha-256 uses 64 characters in the database but with an index on the column that isn t a problem and it is a proven hash and more reliable than md5 and sha-1

116767
pbkdf2	hash
pattern7	quicker	
a key-stretching algorithm like pbkdf2 applies a quicker hash like sha512 thousands of times typically causing the hash generation to take 1 5 of a second or so

123076
metaphone	soundex
pattern0	better	
edit double metaphone was specifically designed to be better than soundex and work in languages other than english

124248
rsa	aes
pattern0	less user-friendly	
algorithms like rsa are much less user-friendly than aes

124248
rsa	aes
pattern10	more	pattern10	more so	
that is actually not the case with rsa which is --- more so than aes --- just a math equation

124248
rsa	aes
pattern7	less	pattern0	less safe	
block crypto algorithms like aes do suffer from this problem too but without a pki aes is no less safe than rsa

127152
int	chars
pattern0	
schema is simple like hell one table with autoint as primary index and less than 10 int tiny int and chars 10

127922
mbunit	nunit
pattern7	
mbunit has compatible syntax with nunit but has more features especially data driven tests

128055
quicksort	shellsort
pattern0	slower	
if you use shellsort no extra memory is needed at all though shellsort will be much slower than quicksort

128221
g++	gcc
pattern0	looser	
unfortunately g++ packed the structs significantly looser than gcc which caused significant problems sharing objects between c and c++ code

132841
solaris	bsd
pattern4	
personally i prefer solaris or a bsd for stability

133271
inline	inlining
pattern0	bigger	
if a function is static thus not exported anyway and only called once within your code and you never use a pointer to the function chances are good that gcc will decide to inline it automatically as it will have no negative impact the binary won t get bigger by inlining it only once

134346
hash	md5
pattern10	much more	pattern10	much more secure	
using a non-reversible hash such as md5 is much more secure and you can store the hash value as clear text

135543
versioning	upgrade
pattern0	
the subversion versioning on the server is older than the versioning on my notebook so i guess my newer versioning somehow upgrade the working directories so they are incompatible with the old versioning on the development server

139120
codeigniter	cakephp
pattern0	lighter	
i suspect codeigniter doesn t have quite as flexible a structure it s smaller and lighter than cakephp but a quick look at the cakephp manual to see how behaviors components helpers and the vendors folder may be helpful

139478
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern3	
i recommend using sorteddictionary string tvalue or sortedlist string tvalue

140359
mantis	bugzilla
pattern0	
it certainly looks nicer and has better usability than mantis or bugzilla but it s not open and it makes some tradeoffs for a simpler interface

140501
width	height
pattern7	greater	
if the width is greater then height 3 4 screen.width then

140502
pop-up	dialog
pattern7	
i think it s a better idea to show a div as dialog in the middle of your website because the chance that this is pop-up blocked is smaller and it s imo less annoying

141340
floating-point	integer
pattern0	simpler	
but integer arithmetic arguably is inherently simpler than floating-point

142240
cpu	processors
pattern7	better	
some fancy compilers understand the un interrelatedness of instructions to a limited extent and will automatically interleave instruction flows probably over a longer window than the cpu sees to better utilise the processors

142427
versioning	upgrade
pattern7	number easier	
using compatibility as the central point in the versioning number makes it easier for users especially if te product is a library to judge whether or not they can expect a smoothe and safe upgrade or not

144494
profiling	instrumentation
pattern4	
select profiling from the product menu in xcode 6 to launch apple s instrumentation tool

145433
maven	buildr
pattern0	faster	
and even though everybody says ruby is slow buildr was 2-6x faster than maven

146871
lisp	scheme
pattern4	
i have decided that i prefer scheme over common lisp so that narrows it down a bit

147392
vim	emacs
pattern0	
emacs or vim is not significantly better than vim or emacs

148152
nant	cruisecontrol
pattern0	
think about project management bug reports and it all adds up to something more than just cruisecontrol svn and nant

148194
apache	nginx
pattern0	less memory	
servers like lighthttp and nginx can handle large amounts of traffic in much less memory than apache if you can sacrifice apache s power and flexibility or if you just don t need those things which often you don t

149212
cpu	hyperthreading
pattern7	more	
almost any new cpu has more than one core or if it has just one it might support hyperthreading and thus pretending it has more than one

149409
3des	aes
pattern10	more	pattern10	more expensive	pattern8	more expensive	
3des is more expensive than aes for example

150964
range	max	range	min	min	max
pattern4	pattern4	
so you can either pick a date range run a select max and select min against your db or execute your query and then add the missing dates

151399

you could put the text into an invisible span and read that spans width but basicly this looks like someone trying to sabotage your site and therefore i would recommend banning post with words longer than a certain lenth for example 30 characters without spaces allowing links to be longer
