int	double
pattern4	
personally i prefer int string double etc

2360
mouse	keyboard
pattern4	
go to system preferences keyboard and mouse then choose keyboard shortcuts

2562
wmv	flv
pattern0	easier	
i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv

6659
junit	testng	junit	unitils	junit	easymock	testng	unitils	testng	easymock	easymock	unitils
pattern4	
but i would recommend unitils a great wrapper for junit testng dbunit easymock regardless of which route you take

6671
junit	testng
pattern8	more configurable	
testng strives to be much more configurable than junit but in the end they both work equally well

9788
subtraction	addition
pattern2	
additionally while reads and writes are atomic there is a race condition with addition subtraction and incrementing and decrementing primitive types since they must be read operated on and rewritten

10232
ant	maven
pattern3	
they do a great job for us and i would highly recommend using maven over ant

10809
listview	gridview
pattern0	better	
listview much better than the gridview dataview in that they let you write out clean html

12586
rss	feed
pattern4	pattern4	
the rss brand very much defines the entire feed category though so on the rare occasion that someone does know enough to choose they will tend to choose rss because it s got the name. they will also tend to choose rss 2.0 because it s got the bigger number

13455
cvs	svn
pattern4	pattern2	
i would definitely choose svn over cvs if only because people who learned source control using cvs tend to use svn delete then svn add instead of svn move

14261
actionscript	mxml
pattern7	
if you write your own reusable components then writing them in actionscript may sometimes give you a little more control but for non-reusable views mxml is much better

16381
equals	gethashcode
pattern0	quicker	
gethashcode should be a lot quicker than equals but doesn t need to be unique

20192
cassini	iis
pattern4	
there are lots of good reasons to prefer iis over the cassini server articles by dominick baier

20666
hash	md5
pattern4	
to go along with what everyone here is saying i use hashtab when i need to generate compare md5 and sha1 hash on windows

22074
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
pattern10	pattern10	more specific	
in my mind illegalargumentexception seems more specific than using a nullpointerexception since it s telling me that the problem was with an argument i passed to the method and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the method

23203
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
pattern7	
i really like thompsonâ s â œhaskell the craft of functional programmingâ because itâ s well written and haskell allows an easier start than other functional languages while being completely pure unlike lisp or scheme

24035
integer	unsigned
pattern0	
in fact your going to get a value bigger than an integer can hold 4 billion unsigned 2 billion signed before the stack is going to over flow fibbonaci 46

24476
goto	break
pattern0	simpler	
if you re in a nested loop and need to break out of all loops a goto can make this much cleaner and simpler than break statements and if-checks

25701
jdom	xom
pattern4	
i ve worked with jdom as well and there s absolutely nothing wrong with it although i do prefer xom

26851
perforce	svn
pattern8	more intuitive	
if anything i find working with svn easier and more intuitive than perforce

26851
perforce	svn
pattern8	more comfortable	
perforce does have support for many other oses but our non-windows devs feel more comfortable with svn too

27439
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	pattern10	more correct	pattern10	pattern10	
from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysql is less correct less compliant but faster

27440
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	
better performance can be bought with more ram and cpu and more appropriate database design and clever stored procedure tricks and so on - and all of that is cheaper and easier for random-website-x than agonizing over which to pick mysql or postgresql and specialist tuning from expensive dbas

27443
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	slower	pattern0	slower	
in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end

27529
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	
hard to compare mysql and postgresql

29557
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
pattern8	
i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.

29923
bazaar	git
pattern7	
in git you can do the same with playing around in the index staging area but bazaar has a better ui for it

34295
emacs	aquamacs
pattern4	
if it is emacs you want i would recommend aquamacs more mac-like or carbon emacs more gnu-emacs-like

34338
phpunit	simpletest
pattern0	easier	
i found simpletest was even easier than phpunit to set up

34474
phpunit	simpletest
pattern4	
i prefer phpunit now but when i started out i used simpletest as i didn t always have access to the command line

34566
equals	gethashcode
pattern2	
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

34566
equals	gethashcode
pattern2	
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

35627
filesystems	ntfs
pattern0	
when people say that unix filesystems are better they might mean to be saying oh ext3 stores bits in such as way that corruption happens way less than ntfs but they might also be talking about design choices made at the common layer above

37162
portrait	landscape
pattern4	
web browser print dialogs default to portrait so for every print job the user has to manually select landscape

44638
merb	ruby-on-rails
pattern4	
ok ruby-on-rails is actually pretty good but there is just a little bit too much magic going on in there from the ruby world i would much prefer merb to ruby-on-rails

44752
perforce	svn
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
make sure you re using a source control system that supports branching and merging i ve had experience with perforce and svn and while perforce is better svn is free

45963
free	malloc
pattern10	pattern10	
finding a package that can work with both new delete and malloc free obviously gives you more flexibility

46614
post	get
pattern10	also more	pattern10	also more secure	pattern8	more secure	
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking information into a url

47674
maven	m2e
pattern10	pattern10	more friendly	
in other words m2e is more friendly to the maven way

47929
udp	tcp
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt

48015
emacs	textmate
pattern7	better	
textmate is a better emacs for macs though that won t help you with solaris

48103
division	modulo
pattern0	faster	
a side effect of many division routines is the modulo - so in few cases should division actually be faster than modulo

50632
integer	unsigned
pattern7	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

50909
youtube	vimeo
pattern0	fewer users	
vimeo will always have fewer users than youtube because the user experience is poor for low bitrate users

52179
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	worse	
i just checked the timings using mysql 5 and they are slightly worse than postgresql

52725
gridview	repeater	gridview	formview
pattern10	pattern10	
the bind method really isn t for the repeater it s more for the formview or gridview where you are editing just one item in the list not every item in the list

52881
codeigniter	cakephp
pattern0	
also i don t think it is so much that asp.net mvc is so much better than cakephp or codeigniter ruby on rails etc. the great thing about asp.net mvc and other asp.net-based technologies such as monorail is that developers who are using asp.net now have the option of following the mvc pattern using tools and languages they are familiar with

54817
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
pattern4	pattern2	
this seems like an object state invalid scenario to me so i d pick invalidoperationexception over argumentexception the parameters are valid but not at this point in the objects life

55578
vmware	virtualbox
pattern7	
vmware has more features but costs 80 virtualbox on the other hand is more basic but is free for most users see virtualbox licensing faq for details

58301
directx	gdi
pattern0	pattern0	slower	
speed is usually faster than gdi and slower than directx and depends greatly on how you do things seen something to work 60 times faster after rewriting in a sensible way

58363
memcached	apc
pattern4	
i would recommend memcached or apc

60137
ubuntu	debian
pattern4	
i haven t decided which one yet but my understanding is that they ll give me a base os install i d prefer debian or ubuntu an ip address a root account ssh and that s about it

60910
emacs	aquamacs
pattern7	
however i m not really much of an emacs user and the preferences menu in aquamacs is less than clear on where and how one might make such a change

62220
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	
however the observation of database-locking stands - if you have particularly onerous updates sqlite performance won t match mysql or postgresql

64644
vim	emacs
pattern4	
i don t think you would want to wait 10 seconds for your text editor to become ready ...if you are going to spend some serious time coding then spend some time and learn to use vim emacs too but i recommend vim

65079
wideimage	phpthumb
pattern10	pattern10	more modern	pattern10	pattern10	
wideimage is the more modern php5 approach while phpthumb has much more features

67312
addition	multiplication
pattern0	
transcendental functions are always much more slower than addition or multiplication and a well-known bottleneck

68674
ubuntu	linux
pattern10	closer	pattern10	closer	
ubuntu is getting closer but there are still numerous things with linux that will keep the grandmothers of the world from using it

69545
richfaces	icefaces
pattern10	pattern10	more semantic	pattern8	more semantic support	
there is icefaces which provides more semantic support than richfaces .also you can try nitobi suite which also provides similar kinda solution.if you are not satisfied with any of these i suggest try to write your own part extending the sun faces

69989
post	get
pattern0	
get is basically just like post it just has a limit on the amount of data you can send which is usually a lot smaller than post and a semantic difference which makes get not a good candidate from that point of view even if technically they both can do it

70375
equals	gethashcode
pattern2	
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

70375
equals	gethashcode
pattern2	
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

70423
quicksort	heapsort
pattern7	significantly slower	pattern0	slower	
but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average

70440
quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	usually faster	pattern0	faster	
quicksort is usually faster than mergesort just because it s easier to code a tight implementation and the operations it does can go faster

70440
quicksort	mergesort
pattern10	generally faster	pattern10	generally faster	
it s because that quicksort is generally faster that people use it instead of mergesort

70627
quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	not better	
quicksort is not better it is well suited for a different kind of application than mergesort

70881
addition	multiplication
pattern7	higher	pattern0	higher precedence	
precedence rules specify priority of operators which operators will be evaluated first multiplication has higher precedence than addition pemdas

71743
tapestry	sitemesh
pattern10	pattern10	
i have used sitemesh and it is good for wrapping a set of pages in standard headers and footers but tapestry is better for creating components which are used on many pages possibly many times per page

73157
free	malloc
pattern7	pattern7	
yes that may since your allocating with new but deallocating with delelte yes malloc free is safer here but in c++ you should not use them since they won t handle de constructors

74931
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	better	
with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use postgresql performed better than mysql

74992
bash	zsh
pattern4	pattern2	
i prefer zsh over bash because of its support for very powerful file globbing variable expansion modifiers and faster tab completion

77328
textwrangler	bbedit
pattern0	pattern0	
i really do not get the appeal it s marginally better than textwrangler bbedit s free little brother but if you re spending money you may as well buy the better tool for a few dollars more

77883
bazaar	git
pattern7	imho easier	
bazaar is imho easier to learn than git

77945
quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	not better	pattern0	better	
quicksort is not better than mergesort

79550
width	height
pattern7	
if you can get that to work you might want to try progressively removing the height width position attributes from div.header to get the minimal required attributes to get the effect you want

79771
multiplying	multiplication
pattern10	slightly more	pattern10	slightly more complex	
multiplication is slightly more complex as it needs an integer multiplying followed by a scale back such as 0.72 2 becomes 72 200 becomes 14400 becomes 144 scaleback becomes 1.44

81982
robocopy	xcopy
pattern10	pattern10	
at least use xcopy robocopy is even faster

81983
datediff	difference
pattern10	pattern10	more difficult	
datediff becomes more difficult to use as you have more dateparts in your difference in your case looks like minutes and seconds

84239
distance	polygons
pattern4	
for each vertex in the red polygons compute the distance to each vertex in the blue polygons and find the closest hint compare distance 2 so you don t need the sqrt

84974
union	distinct
pattern4	
in most cases what you really want to say is union all as it does not do duplicate elimination think select distinct between sets which can result in quite a bit of savings in terms of execution time

85010
restrict	shared
pattern0	
the code is riddled with classes which contain nothing more than public shared attributes variables and methods functions the result of which restrict the application from opening more than one project at a time

85414
vmware	virtualbox
pattern2	
i ve been using vmware for a while and am very happy with it but i would like to compare it with virtualbox

85416
integer	fractions
pattern7	larger	
if the number of bits in the mantissa or fractions is larger than the number of bits in your integer type then you ll possibly lose precision when someone types in a number such as

87006
cvs	svn	accurev	cvs	accurev	svn
pattern4	
i ve used svn cvs clearcase base ucm ccc harvest but none of them can beat accurev s strengths

88100
udp	tcp
pattern4	
for instance if a preference picks tcp versus udp have your conditional instantiate a tcpprovider or udpprovider which the rest of your code uses with minimal muss or fuss

90477
quicksort	mergesort
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
as many people have noted the average case performance for quicksort is faster than mergesort

91149
jboss	glassfish
pattern4	
i would choose jboss or glassfish for a start

91317
webclient	webrequest
pattern7	sometimes easier	
webclient is sometimes easier to use than webrequest

94070
datamapper	activerecord
pattern10	potentially more	pattern10	potentially more complex	
datamapper is potentially more complex then activerecord but it s a lot easier to develop your domain model and database asynchronous then with activerecord

95121
x86	64bit
pattern7	considerably slower	pattern7	
x86 is considerably slower a few clocks plus a clock or so per function argument while 64bit is much less because most function arguments are passed in registers instead of on the stack

95821
eruby	erb
pattern4	
i see that it supposedly beats erb and eruby now.

99817
width	height
pattern7	
that is the height is more than half the width and depth -- little rule of thumb

101381
hex	binary
pattern7	
that s one reason why going from hex to binary is much easier than from decimal to binary

105287
nunit	mstest
pattern7	
although several ci tools such as teamcity have better support for nunit probably would change as mstest becomes more popular

105339
int	double
pattern10	pattern10	more difficult	
for floats and double it s more difficult as with plain int as these may or not may be in the host machines byte-order

107883
quicksort	heapsort
pattern0	faster	
for example quicksort average cost t n.log n and heapsort average cost t n.log n are both sorting algorithms with the same average cost - yet quicksort is typically much faster than heapsort

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
pattern10	pattern10	more invasive	pattern8	more invasive	
puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclass implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t

113331
wxpython	pyqt
pattern4	
wxpython has a very good demo and it can do pretty much anything which pyqt can do i would anyday prefer pyqt but it may bot be free for commercial purpose but wxpython is free and is decent cross platform library

115620
google-chrome	firefox
pattern0	pattern7	
until people have more experience with google-chrome i would think firefox is a better choice

115838
gif	png
pattern7	never worse	pattern0	better	
as a general rule png is never worse and often better than gif because of superior compression

115838
gif	png
pattern7	slightly better	
there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry

116210
gif	png
pattern0	smaller	
indexed png less than 256 colors is actually always smaller than gif so i use that most of the time

116461
gif	png
pattern0	larger equivalent	
if your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors

116739
hash	md5
pattern0	more reliable	
sha-256 uses 64 characters in the database but with an index on the column that isn t a problem and it is a proven hash and more reliable than md5 and sha-1

116767
pbkdf2	hash
pattern7	quicker	
a key-stretching algorithm like pbkdf2 applies a quicker hash like sha512 thousands of times typically causing the hash generation to take 1 5 of a second or so

123076
metaphone	soundex
pattern0	better	
edit double metaphone was specifically designed to be better than soundex and work in languages other than english

124248
rsa	aes
pattern0	less user-friendly	
algorithms like rsa are much less user-friendly than aes

124248
rsa	aes
pattern10	pattern10	more so	
that is actually not the case with rsa which is --- more so than aes --- just a math equation

124248
rsa	aes
pattern7	pattern0	less safe	
block crypto algorithms like aes do suffer from this problem too but without a pki aes is no less safe than rsa

127152
int	chars
pattern0	
schema is simple like hell one table with autoint as primary index and less than 10 int tiny int and chars 10

127922
mbunit	nunit
pattern7	
mbunit has compatible syntax with nunit but has more features especially data driven tests

128055
quicksort	shellsort
pattern0	slower	
if you use shellsort no extra memory is needed at all though shellsort will be much slower than quicksort

128221
g++	gcc
pattern0	looser	
unfortunately g++ packed the structs significantly looser than gcc which caused significant problems sharing objects between c and c++ code

132841
solaris	bsd
pattern4	
personally i prefer solaris or a bsd for stability

133271
inline	inlining
pattern0	bigger	
if a function is static thus not exported anyway and only called once within your code and you never use a pointer to the function chances are good that gcc will decide to inline it automatically as it will have no negative impact the binary won t get bigger by inlining it only once

134346
hash	md5
pattern10	much more	pattern10	much more secure	
using a non-reversible hash such as md5 is much more secure and you can store the hash value as clear text

135543
versioning	upgrade
pattern0	
the subversion versioning on the server is older than the versioning on my notebook so i guess my newer versioning somehow upgrade the working directories so they are incompatible with the old versioning on the development server

139120
codeigniter	cakephp
pattern0	lighter	
i suspect codeigniter doesn t have quite as flexible a structure it s smaller and lighter than cakephp but a quick look at the cakephp manual to see how behaviors components helpers and the vendors folder may be helpful

139478
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern3	
i recommend using sorteddictionary string tvalue or sortedlist string tvalue

140359
mantis	bugzilla
pattern0	
it certainly looks nicer and has better usability than mantis or bugzilla but it s not open and it makes some tradeoffs for a simpler interface

140501
width	height
pattern7	greater	
if the width is greater then height 3 4 screen.width then

140502
pop-up	dialog
pattern7	
i think it s a better idea to show a div as dialog in the middle of your website because the chance that this is pop-up blocked is smaller and it s imo less annoying

141340
floating-point	integer
pattern0	simpler	
but integer arithmetic arguably is inherently simpler than floating-point

142240
cpu	processors
pattern7	better	
some fancy compilers understand the un interrelatedness of instructions to a limited extent and will automatically interleave instruction flows probably over a longer window than the cpu sees to better utilise the processors

142427
versioning	upgrade
pattern7	number easier	
using compatibility as the central point in the versioning number makes it easier for users especially if te product is a library to judge whether or not they can expect a smoothe and safe upgrade or not

144494
profiling	instrumentation
pattern4	
select profiling from the product menu in xcode 6 to launch apple s instrumentation tool

145433
maven	buildr
pattern0	faster	
and even though everybody says ruby is slow buildr was 2-6x faster than maven

146871
lisp	scheme
pattern4	
i have decided that i prefer scheme over common lisp so that narrows it down a bit

147392
vim	emacs
pattern0	
emacs or vim is not significantly better than vim or emacs

148152
nant	cruisecontrol
pattern0	
think about project management bug reports and it all adds up to something more than just cruisecontrol svn and nant

148194
apache	nginx
pattern0	less memory	
servers like lighthttp and nginx can handle large amounts of traffic in much less memory than apache if you can sacrifice apache s power and flexibility or if you just don t need those things which often you don t

149212
cpu	hyperthreading
pattern7	
almost any new cpu has more than one core or if it has just one it might support hyperthreading and thus pretending it has more than one

149409
3des	aes
pattern10	pattern10	more expensive	pattern8	more expensive	
3des is more expensive than aes for example

150964
range	max	range	min	min	max
pattern4	pattern4	
so you can either pick a date range run a select max and select min against your db or execute your query and then add the missing dates

151399
ogre	irrlicht
pattern7	cleaner	
irrlicht has a cleaner api lower system requirements and works better across platforms than ogre in my opinion

154057
inherited	subclassing
pattern10	pattern10	more useful	
inherited is more useful when a new subclassing wants to change the way a method works if you just need to change the data the class uses to work probably an approach like this would do the trick

157238
lwjgl	jogl
pattern10	pattern10	more java-like	pattern7	
jogl is more java-like whereas lwjgl provides more gaming functionality on top of opengl access

159944
cvs	svn
pattern4	
seriously why would you prefer cvs to svn

159971
cvs	svn
pattern7	better	pattern0	better	
svn is better than cvs

160021
cvs	svn
pattern7	
so what is with svn that your company dislikes so much and cvs does better

160037
cvs	svn
pattern7	better	pattern0	better	
svn is better than cvs because it was designed to be - it s roughly the same thing with some simplications and new features

161193
mouse	keyboard
pattern0	
for example do you use keyboard more than mouse

161202
cvs	svn
pattern8	more comparable format	
the first one can be solved by using svn +ssh which is the more comparable format as cvs uses its own protocol as well

161216
cvs	svn
pattern0	better	
svn was supposed to be better than cvs but in some areas that didn t work well

161216
cvs	svn
pattern8	more useful features	
the other distributed tools are a lot faster svn is slow as hell even cvs can be faster sometimes have much more useful features than svn are developing rapidly while seeing any new feature in svn takes years

161559
cvs	svn
pattern2	
nowadays i prefer git over svn but it takes a while to get over the threshold if you come from cvs svn land

162047
int	chars
pattern4	
then you need a function called int scanback const chars s const chars matches int start which starts at start goes down to z as long as the chars being scanned at s id contained in matches return the last index where a match is found

162785
post	put
pattern3	
you could put the text into an invisible span and read that spans width but basicly this looks like someone trying to sabotage your site and therefore i would recommend banning post with words longer than a certain lenth for example 30 characters without spaces allowing links to be longer

162991
swt	swing
pattern4	
i will probably choose swt swing or qtjambi for the ui controls but i am wondering what to do with the graphical part of the simulation

166196
des	aes
pattern10	pattern10	
i know you said you don t care about how secure it is but if you chose des you might as well take aes it is the more up-to-date encryption method

167539
getdate	dateadd
pattern4	
select dateadd dd 1 getdate will return a current date + 1 day

167922
mouse	keyboard
pattern4	
the net effect of this was that it was very difficult to get two machines to boot up and work on the kvm switch and the switch would lose keyboard or mouse input on one or both machines every few days

170948
lisp	scheme
pattern0	better common	
here is a solution in scheme because i know that better than common lisp and have an interpreter for checking my work

171958
merb	ruby-on-rails
pattern4	pattern2	
i personally prefer merb over ruby-on-rails as it adopts more ruby conventions

172177
apache	lighttpd
pattern10	pattern10	more powerful	pattern10	pattern10	
the benefit of both apache is more powerful and extensible useless if you don t need that power but anyway... and lighttpd is faster at static content

172992
disk	ram
pattern4	
but it basically matches ram blocks to disk blocks

173548
accurev	svn
pattern4	
we evaluated it alongside with plastic scm svn and clearcase-ucm that we already owned and used and decided to dump clearcase and svn both were used in two different groups and to purchase accurev

176144
firefox	safari
pattern7	
third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around

177532
verilog	vhdl
pattern4	
do you prefer vhdl or verilog and why

177565
verilog	vhdl
pattern10	pattern10	more popular	
vhdl is more popular in europe and verilog is dominating in the us

178555
verilog	vhdl	verilog	hdl
pattern4	
once you re ready to choose an hdl i heartily recommend verilog having learned vhdl first

178555
verilog	vhdl
pattern0	more feature-rich	
yes vhdl was once much more feature-rich than verilog but later revisions of the language verilog 2001 verilog 2005 systemverilog etc.. have cherry-picked most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for verilog and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience vhdl is only used here when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously

179294
post	get
pattern4	pattern2	
further i recommend to use post wherever possible avoid using get for form submits - if some users want to simulate a form submit via get make sure your application supports the desired parameters either via post or via get but when you submit the page yourself via a button or js prefer post over get

179520
google-chrome	safari
pattern7	also earlier	
google-chrome also uses an earlier version of webkit than the current safari so pages should be checked in both browsers

181450
coalesce	isnull
pattern0	
also you can make your code simpler by using isnull or coalesce to handle columns which contain nulls

183126
inherited	properties
pattern10	much more	pattern10	much more powerful	
now in .net for desktop controls you can use inherited which is much more powerful than the old tag properties anyway

183290
ant	maven
pattern10	pattern10	
as you ve already said ant is more a replacement for gnu make while maven is primary a buildout dependency-management application

184056
ant	maven
pattern4	
i find it most disturbing to see so few people around here are actually using maven or at least ant though i prefer maven for the dependency handling.

184381
webkit	gecko
pattern0	smaller	
my understanding is webkit is pretty good smaller than gecko

186645
perforce	svn
pattern4	
i would certainly recommend perforce for a number of reasons already covered in other answers but i m not in a position to offer a comparison with svn having never really used it

186990
configobj	configparser
pattern7	easier	
i ve heard that configobj is easier to work with than configparser

190913
subclass	abstract-class
pattern0	
making abstract-class before i had more than one subclass in mind for them

191616
cvs	svn
pattern8	more efficient	
in fact svn does stores binaries a lot more efficient than cvs for more info see the svn-faq

192156
coalesce	isnull
pattern4	
other rdbms would prefer coalesce instead of isnull

194130
ant	maven
pattern0	
it is much better than ant because for most common tasks you don t have to write a complicated build.xml maven has very good defaults and it s all convention over configuration

194197
lxml	elementtree
pattern4	
i actually prefer lxml as it has api like elementtree but has also nice additional features and performs well

194489
xstream	xom
pattern3	
if you decide to roll your own xml configuration i d recommend using xstream with customized serialization options or if you just need to parse some xml take a look at xom

195398
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	pattern10	
that s why it s usually said that mysql is best for webapps while postgresql is more enterprisey

195398
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	
at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks

195415
postgresql	mysql
pattern2	
you could then compare these with mysql and postgresql

196705
django	web2py	pylons	web2py
pattern7	easier	pattern0	easier	pattern0	easier	
anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and rails

197210
mouse	keyboard
pattern4	
this will not remove the key binding from vmware but you could set the option to grab keyboard and mouse intput on key press in the vmware preferences

198565
post	get
pattern10	pattern10	
neither one of get and post is inherently more secure than the other just like neither one of fax and phone is more secure than the other

198565
post	get
pattern10	pattern10	more appropiate	pattern10	pattern10	
get is more appropiate for idempotent queries while post is more appropiate for action queries but you can shoot yourself in the foot just as easily with any of them if you don t understand the security architecture for the application you re maintaining

198624
nfa	dfa
pattern7	far easier	
because representation of a given problem with a nfa is far easier than the equivalent dfa

199290
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
pattern0	longer	
decoding nullpointerexception is going to take a bit longer than illegalargumentexception filepath must be supplied or whatever

199835
vim	emacs
pattern4	
rather like editors do you prefer vim or emacs choice of shell is partly a question of familiarity and partly a question of preference

201030
csla	.net
pattern4	
i would recommend csla .net by rockford lhotka

201171
quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	worse	pattern0	worse complexity	
quicksort is worse complexity than mergesort in the worst case.

201950
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	much better	
postgresql gets much better performance and this is coming from a former mysql partisan

204778
django	web.py
pattern4	pattern2	
also this post by the web.py author is a very good explanation of why i much prefer web.py over django

205364
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	faster	
mysql i am told can be optimized to do faster reads than postgresql but both are pretty ridiculously fast in terms of # transactions sec they support and it doesn t sound like that s your problem

206134
pop-up	dialog
pattern0	less intrusive	
from a practice standpoint - excluding accessibility - modal windows provide an alternative that are less startling as say dialog boxes and feel less intrusive than pop-up windows

209147
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
pattern0	pattern0	
according to some - browser - statistics ie6 market share is still bigger than google-chrome safari and opera together nearly as much as ie7

215539
antivirus	norton
pattern0	better	
many other antivirus software that works just as well if not better than norton like avg avast and others do allow you to uninstall from the add remove

217708
config	ini
pattern0	
being php parseing it is nearly eg the file needs to be opened closed etc as fast as having the code at the top of each script and much faster than ini and xml config solutions

218031
mouse	keyboard
pattern7	
unless it s a usb keyboard mouse and 8042 emulation is disabled where you would need a usb stack but you can use the boot protocol for the keyboard mouse which is simpler

218544
centos	linux	centos	solaris	solaris	aix
pattern7	pattern7	
and i do as much work as possible on our linux centos 5 system simply because the tools on it are still newer than anything i can find readily packaged for aix solaris is somewhat better

219506
mouse	keyboard
pattern0	
some elements require more than simple mouse keyboard interactions due to the complex rendering carried out by extjs

220922
elf	coff
pattern0	
it runs on a number of platforms and supports more than just elf files i believe it also supports coff and a few others

222513
kate	kde
pattern4	
i prefer kate part of kde as it features a built-in terminal as well as many features you would expect from an editor inside an ide like code folding and regex search replace

222513
vim	emacs
pattern4	
many people also recommend vim or emacs both of which are probably available through your distro s repositories

223029
interpreted-language	compiled-language
pattern0	faster	
a compiled-language will generally run faster than an interpreted-language so i think ruby and php start behind the eight ball but it really comes down to how you use the language and how you structure the code

224223
innodb	myisam
pattern10	pattern10	
a better solution is not to use myisam for tables where the data is constantly changing - innodb is much more bulletproof and as paul correctly points out you can use transactions on innodb tables but not on myisam

226515
division	multiplication
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	pattern10	
multiplication is faster division is more accurate

226593
cruisecontrol	teamcity
pattern7	far easier	
for a one man shop teamcity is far easier to setup and configure than cruisecontrol

228750
innodb	myisam
pattern7	slower	pattern0	slower	
also innodb is slower than myisam unless myisam is blocking for a huge select

229915
for-loop	loops
pattern10	neater	pattern10	neater	
putting the whole thing in a for-loop makes it neater and ensures that the iterating isread is called each loops

232055
clistctrl	ccombobox
pattern0	
possibly faster than ccombobox with drawitem would be an owner data clistctrl

234378
accessor	properties
pattern0	pattern0	
specialname is more than properties accessor event add remove methods count here as well that s why you have to check the names as well

234591
tolower	toupper
pattern8	
it is suggested in this so post that c# is more efficient with toupper because microsoft optimized it that way. but i ve also read this argument that converting tolower vs

234639
tolower	toupper
pattern10	pattern10	
i can t say whether toupper or tolower is faster though

237472
vim	emacs
pattern4	
also whichever editor you prefer vim or emacs learn it back forth

241621
nstableview	nssplitview
pattern0	shorter	
a pattern i also use is to make the nstableview slightly shorter than the nssplitview and have buttons at the bottom add delete etc

242546
kerberos	ldap
pattern0	
one might want to define kerberos access to more than one ldap server

242991
rss	feed
pattern2	
i produce a feed reader and when scraping feed always prefer atom over rss

245323
cvs	svn
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
that being said i think svn is better in every other respect and you probably shouldn t start a new project with cvs

249589
perforce	svn
pattern4	
i agree with the previous yuval - having worked with perforce and svn both in gui and command-line mode i prefer svn

249617
bazaar	git	bazaar	perforce
pattern4	
for many of the cases where subversion trumps perforce many people seem to prefer the distributed systems like git bazaar mercurial these days

251995
getter	setter
pattern10	pattern10	
a getter without a setter is more like a public final member variable--but at that point why not just use a public final member variable they do no more harm.

254023
aptana	radrails
pattern4	
i prefer aptana radrails on both mac and linux

256092
bazaar	git
pattern7	
bazaar is a distributed version tool just like git but is imo simpler to setup and use

257953
width	height
pattern7	
safari will expand up to a width of 800px unless the width is already greater than 800 in which case it maintains that width and only modifies the window height

259080
bluej	greenfoot
pattern7	better	pattern0	better	
i think greenfoot is better than bluej for 8-years old

259460
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	pattern10	more compliant	
postgresql is more compliant but if you re comfortable with mysql and you re using an orm you should probably use that

259517
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	pattern10	more powerful	pattern8	more powerful	
i cannot propose any db not knowing your specific needs but if you want to use a free software which excludes oracle and you re not already experienced with mysql you should try postgresql which is more powerful than mysql

260148
lxml	libxml2	lxml	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
pattern10	pattern10	
libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well

262798
innodb	myisam
pattern7	heavier	pattern0	heavier	
i know innodb is heavier than myisam but just how much more

263966
ubuntu	centos
pattern10	pattern10	less desirable	
in this respect ubuntu is less desirable on a server than rhel or centos which stick to more mature versions

269117
swt	swing
pattern10	pattern10	more simple	
swt is more simple to use than swing especially if this is your first ui

270764
xsl-fo	xslt
pattern4	
you can also use apache fop if you prefer xslt and xsl-fo

277306
boost	stl
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
i ve used both for the same project boost is better integrated with the stl and especially c++ exceptions

277511
innodb	myisam
pattern7	slower	pattern0	slower	
innodb is slower than myisam for most uses but can perform faster in certain conditions due to a better locking mechanism

277564
bluecloth	rdiscount
pattern8	more reliable	
rdiscount seems to be much faster and more reliable than bluecloth

281802
cvsnt	tortoisecvs
pattern3	
firstly i d recommend using tortoisecvs as it has better cvsnt support

282643
codeigniter	cakephp
pattern4	pattern2	
on the other hand i ve never played around with codeigniter so i can t recommend cakephp over codeigniter

283151
coalesce	isnull
pattern4	
you also could read an article which compares coalesce and isnull

283405
jboss	glassfish
pattern7	better	
i think glassfish is a better j2ee app server to start with than jboss

283405
jboss	glassfish
pattern7	
jboss is a big and quite complex application and glassfish is smaller and i find it easier to understand

285023
quicksort	heapsort
pattern0	smaller sets	
i was just going to say radix sort however that could be a bit above what you were looking to implement introsort is generally the accepted sorting solution for data it s a variation of quicksort that switches to heapsort when it reaches smaller sets as it s faster on smaller sets than quicksort

288440
salt	md5
pattern4	
get md5 js implementation and compare salt

288727
floating-point	integer
pattern7	arithmetic usually faster	pattern0	faster	
which uses all integer arithmetic is usually faster than its floating-point equivalent likely significantly faster in the case of a floating-point type equivalent to t-sql s decimal type

289468
children	parent
pattern7	pattern0	more content	
i have come up with a few ideas such as traversing the html document tree to its leaves adding up the length of the text and only seeing what other text the parent has if the parent gives us more content than the children do

289841
inherited	properties
pattern4	
to access those properties or methods i need to make them public which defeats encapsulation or re-write them into my class which defeats inherited

291267
lisp	scheme
pattern3	
if you re shaky on recursion at all i highly recommend learning scheme or lisp

292975
domxpath	domdocument
pattern10	pattern10	
for this kind of task reading the document into a domdocument and using domxpath is probably more suitable

294097
redmine	trac
pattern0	nicer	
redmine handles multiple projects and sub-projects right out of the box and overall seems nicer than trac

294103
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
pattern4	
i worked on a project for one place that were forced to use a locking system and opted to use no control at all so i set up a secret svn branch even though i much prefer bazaar or git

294978
int	double
pattern7	
if you assign an int to a double there s no loss of precision because double is wider

298978
lxml	libxml2	lxml	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
pattern4	
gimel and tim recommend lxml which is a nicely pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries

303277
mapguide	arcmap
pattern0	
i mostly work with esri software though i ve had a little bit of work with mapguide mostly for clients whose engineering departments are using cad more than arcmap

303480
kate	kde
pattern4	
i recommend kate part of kde as an editor

304069
ant	maven
pattern7	better	pattern0	better	
however some things ant handles better than maven and if there s not a maven plugin for it it may be difficult to handle in maven

305216
ant	maven
pattern0	
i think that inventing something better than both ant and maven wouldn t be that difficult but that tool doesn t seem to exist yet

307238
getter	setter
pattern7	
from a performance and design perspective using annotations on getter is a better idea than member variables because the getter setter are called using reflection if placed on the field than a method

311896
lisp	scheme
pattern0	
i think architecture with sockets was chosen for better portability between different lisp btw slime also supports clojure and mit scheme and os-es slime works on windows too

315407
cos	sin
pattern0	
using a-star instead of brute force pathfinding will be faster just like how bresenham circles are better than using sin cos

317990
crypt	md5	crypt	hash	hash	md5
pattern7	pattern7	
my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords

319433
gif	png
pattern0	better	
paul points out that png compresses static line art better than gif for nearly every situation

323429
trac	bugzilla
pattern4	
i have used both and didn t like them at all i prefer trac thou if you really need to choose between those two i d go for bugzilla

323542
redmine	trac	redmine	mantis	redmine	bugzilla	trac	mantis	trac	bugzilla	mantis	bugzilla
pattern0	
i think you ll find that your team will like either trac or redmine more than bugzilla or mantis

323542
redmine	trac
pattern0	better	
the authors of redmine are trying to create a better trac than trac

323893
mantis	bugzilla
pattern4	
i ve used bugzilla and mantis but i prefer mantis simplicity

324355
lxml	libxml2
pattern4	
but i prefer libxml2 and lxml for python because it seems to be more actively developed and tested

327393
union	distinct
pattern4	
as other users said union is used to select distinct values from two tables

329742
vim	emacs
pattern4	
as for an editor if you like cli stuff then emacs or vim is the way to go i prefer emacs

330657
post	get
pattern3	
security wise i prefer using post than get as it gives at least some opaqueness as to what is being passed as a parameter and not anyone can just edit the url and play around

330918
min	max
pattern4	
does hibernate hql queries support using select min max count and other sql functions

332211
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	pattern10	
for large and complicated systems yes there are enough bugs quirks that can rear their ugly heads - i am convinced that the reason that people tend to always go with mysql over postgresql is that the name mysql is much more attractive

332459
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
i m currently considering which is a better choice for my php application - mysql which i m more familiar with or postgresql which has less php support no object-oriented wrapper but seems tried and tested

333440
activemq	rabbitmq
pattern10	way more	pattern10	way more popular	
apache activemq which is way more popular than qpid or rabbitmq - or indeed any jms provider would work just fine

337764
int	chars
pattern0	less room	
for lookup tables with a low volume of rows you can use a 3 chars code as the primary key as this takes less room than an int but the performance difference is negligible

338537
config	ini
pattern4	
i am using zend_config_ini config adapter i prefer ini for base config

340054
width	height
pattern7	greater	pattern0	greater	
add a new row until height is greater than width

340054
width	height
pattern7	greater	pattern0	greater	
add a new column until width is greater than height

344281
folder	directory
pattern7	
the problem is that i ve now accumulated a bunch of backup folder in each project directory which makes it harder to find the specific change i was looking for

344492
google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	
used to be firefox but google-chrome is nicer out of the box

348306
wordpress	phpbb
pattern7	
a typical lamp application like wordpress or phpbb runs more than 10 queries per pageview without problems

348548
codeigniter	kohana
pattern4	pattern2	
i prefer kohana over codeigniter ymmv

354420
listview	gridview	gridview	detailsview
pattern4	pattern2	
personally i prefer listview over gridview and detailsview if possible it gives you more control over your html

356602
innodb	myisam
pattern4	
if your application generates a lot of updates you ll prefer innodb storage engine which allows to lock only one row when updating vs all the table on myisam

360494
cpu	processors
pattern7	
passive loadbalancing if a physical cpu is running more than one task the scheduler will attempt to run any new tasks on a second physical processors

361372
moq	typemock
pattern4	
so far i found that we can buy typemock to mock the sharepoint objects and then use any free mocking framework moq

361681
range	min
pattern0	
grid min value should be either 0 or a nice value lower than the min value of the data in range

365630
for-loop	loops
pattern7	much faster	
i did test it a while ago with the result that a for-loop is much faster than a foreach loops

365804
dlsym	dlopen
pattern0	
given that i know little about apache modules i would try to remove apache from the equation try writing a simple c program that does little more than a dlopen and possibly the subsequent dlsym then exits

365834
innodb	myisam
pattern7	
innodb has more overhead but uses row-level locking so that reads and writes can happen concurrently without the problems that myisam s table locking incurs

365945
firefox	safari
pattern0	more forgiving	
but i haven t yet figured out whether it s me writing sloppy code with firefox perhaps being more forgiving than safari or if it s safari or if it s jquery

367387
versioning	upgrade
pattern0	
this code is more for an example and in this example below it is checking to see if the versioning of notepad.exe needs to be upgrade that means the versioning stored in the property table value notepad_verson is greater than the versioning of notepad.exe on the system

368466
directx	gdi
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
to say directx is faster than gdi is also something of a simplification - wpf and gdi-based rendering technologies just have different performance characteristics

369779
entity-relationship	diagram
pattern3	
well a picture tells a thousand words so i would recommend creating entity-relationship diagram where you can view the relationship between tables at a glance something that is hard to do with a text-only description

371821
apache	lighttpd
pattern10	even faster	pattern10	even faster	
for instance in some benchmarks lighttpd is even faster at serving static resources than apache

373983
rtp	rtcp	rtp	sdp	rtp	sip	sip	sdp	rtcp	sdp
pattern0	
internet telephony is a lot more than sip - rtp rtcp sdp on-device audio handling etc.

375160
getter	setter
pattern10	pattern10	pattern10	pattern10	
if the getter setter is any more complex than that i would use get_x and set_x

377519
int	double
pattern7	
i d guess that when calling mymethod 5 5 could be a double or an int as well and double has higher priority

380074
innodb	myisam
pattern7	better	pattern0	better performance	pattern7	pattern10	pattern10	
innodb has better performance than myisam though innodb needs more attention to tuning the configuration innodb supports atomic changes transactions foreign keys and innodb is much more resistant to corrupting data in a crash

380092
int	chars
pattern0	better bet	
well then an int field may just be a better bet than a chars 50

380757
redmine	trac
pattern4	pattern8	more complete	
i d recommend redmine like the other posters as it is more complete than trac

382518
imperative	declarative
pattern7	code easier	
declarative code is easier to make bug-free than imperative code

384083
googletest	cppunit
pattern2	
i prefer cruisecontrol.net with cppunit but i don t have any experience or knowledge of the googletest framework

384102
tortoisegit	svn
pattern0	better	
nobody has ever accused git of being easy-to-use no tortoisegit for example although i hear it s coming so you might be better off with svn beanstalk

386826
ati	nvidia
pattern0	
a co-worker says there s fewer issues with an ati card at home than with nvidia but i ve been updating my video drivers pretty much monthly for the past few months and it s still not resolved so we can t just release our product and just tell our customers that some day the driver manufacturers may get around to fixing this

386835
redmine	trac
pattern0	better	
redmine is an open source ruby on rails application that supports multiple projects much better than trac and seems to be much easier to administer

388146
free	memmove
pattern8	more efficient	
the compiler is free to choose a method that is more efficient than memmove

388422
fink	macports
pattern10	pattern10	
i second macports it is more up to date than fink and closer to the freebsd ports system where i come from

389813
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7	pattern0	less memory	
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

389813
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7	faster	
sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist

389813
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
if the list is populated all at once from sorted data sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary

389824
innodb	myisam
pattern7	actually faster	pattern0	faster	
innodb is actually faster than myisam in quite a few cases so it depends on what your application s mix of selects updates concurrent queries indexes buffer configuration etc

389824
innodb	myisam
pattern2	
innodb wins over myisam frequently enough that it s clearly not possible to say one is faster than the other

392733
haskell	scheme
pattern0	earlier	
some background i m learning haskell now having earlier worked with scheme and cl and a little foray into clojure

393362
perl	tcl
pattern0	worse	
tcl is no better nor worse than perl ruby python or any other scripting language in this regard -- they all do basic file operations with equal aplomb

396601
ienumerable	ilist
pattern2	
i would choose between ilist and ienumerable and wouldn t consider array at all

396838
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
pattern4	
you may prefer firefox opera safari because it s safer technologically superior or whatever but you may lose several users that way remember firefox has only recently reached 20 of usage share

399122
int	chars
pattern7	
there have been machines where sizeof int will be one value probably 4 but where sizeof chars is larger

400867
mouse	keyboard
pattern7	pattern7	
getting proficient with a mix of sr and keyboard mouse is much easier than full hands-free operation

401279
vsto	add-in
pattern10	pattern10	
vba add-in are a bit troublesome to deploy but vsto is even more so

402030
width	height
pattern0	
if the distance between the center of the circle and all of the vertices is greater than the radius of the circle and all of those distances are shorter than the width and height of the rectangle then the circle should be inside of the rectangle

402806
trie	tree
pattern10	pattern10	
a suffix tree is more or less an advanced trie here you can also search for any substrings in o c as for the trie

404634
freemarker	velocity
pattern4	
i actually slightly prefer freemarker to velocity just in case you re open to exploring other options

405022
innodb	myisam
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
myisam is faster in data warehousing situations such as full table scan reporting etc.. but innodb can actually be faster in many cases with normal oltp queries

405022
innodb	myisam
pattern7	pattern0	higher throughput	
innodb is harder to tune since it has more knobs but a properly tuned innodb system can often have higher throughput than myisam due to better locking and better i o patterns

406288
getter	setter
pattern10	pattern10	
i feel like the getter setter example is more clear and hides the implementation details of what name and description are

406323
google-chrome	safari
pattern4	
in this benchmark safari 3.1 2 actually beats google-chrome despite having a js engine that is clearly much much slower this is basically due to more efficient bindings between jsc webcore the dom rendering etc of webkit and v8 webcore

406426
lisp	prolog
pattern0	easier	
i also checked prolog and it seems a pretty cool language easy to do relations between data and easier than lisp but i d like to hear what you think

408820
awt	swing
pattern10	pattern10	more useful	
are there any cases where awt is more useful advised to use than swing or vice-versa

408853
vim	gedit
pattern4	
normal people prefer gedit instead of vim

408981
pyopengl	pyglet
pattern7	actually more	pattern0	
i d say that pyglet is actually more evolved than pyopengl

409563
int	boolean
pattern7	
returning boolean or an int is more of a c mindset than a java in java you would just handle the exception one

410176
photoshop	fireworks
pattern7	easier	
i find fireworks has an easier time dealing with vectors because they re first class objects while in photoshop they re actually a combination of a vector mask and a colour fill

410465
profiler	perf
pattern10	pattern10	more detailed	
a profiler gives you more detailed information which can help to diagnose and fix perf problems

411994
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	
with that said if you are worried about sql server licensing costs i d recommend postgresql first or mysql second as your database of choice

413752
ant	maven
pattern0	
i d definitely use ant or maven - my preference is ant because it s more flexible and i think it would suit your development style more than maven as well

414289
mouse	keyboard
pattern0	faster	
the keyboard is almost always faster than the mouse

414763
subtraction	modulo
pattern0	slower	
as you can see modulo is about an order of magnitude slower than subtraction

415743
vmware	virtualbox
pattern7	
i managed to use andlinux + wine to get this working but honestly i think the vmware virtual pc virtualbox route is simpler

416947
awt	swing
pattern0	less memory	
i mean by light weight i thought maybe the swing components occupy less memory than the awt components

417342
multiplying	subtract
pattern8	more reliable	
adding and subtract logarithms of factorials then taking the exponential at the end is more reliable than multiplying and dividing factorials directly

419590
gif	png
pattern4	
the web favors gif jpg and png mostly

421566
minimum	max
pattern0	
the plugin dll itself also does not expose anything more than the minimum interface required by max for adding a few top level scripted classes

422343
intersect	contains
pattern7	greater	
given two ranges a a b and c c d do they intersect is one greater than the other or does one contains the other

425058
tiff	png
pattern4	
tiff can beat png by about 2 1 43k vs

425355
width	height
pattern7	
for a cross-browser experience its either scroll width height or offset width height whichever is greater

430730
post	get
pattern0	
or how is it better than post redirect get if the functions can in fact be used in solving my particular problem

430883
junit	testng
pattern10	pattern10	more flexible	pattern8	more flexible	
testng is more flexible than junit and have multiple advantages like support for parallel testing for example

431398
apache	nginx
pattern0	
so you can do a django redirect_to urlconf entry but you d be better off with an apache or nginx or insert-your-webserver-here redirect so the initial request never has to hit django at all

432306
lisp	scheme
pattern4	
if you do choose a lisp variant i recommend scheme

433998
int	chars
pattern0	
note that in c++ literals having more than one chars still have type int although their value is implementation defined

434277
post	get
pattern0	
now that you accept more than simple get post json or xml your model will have to distinguish between each request type and know how to parse them

436503
google-chrome	firefox
pattern2	
currently there s somewhat of an arms race between google-chrome firefox and webkit s javascript interpreters which has really improved the speed situation with javascript

436535
division	multiplication
pattern0	slower	
can be fast or it can be awfully slow even if division is done entirely in hardware if it is done using a div instruction this instruction is about 3 to 4 times slower than a multiplication on modern cpus

436535
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division	division	multiplication
pattern0	
in a 64 bit application this code will be a lot faster than in a 32 bit application in a 32 bit application multiplying two 64 bit numbers take 3 multiplication and 3 additions on 32 bit values - however it might be still faster than a division on a 32 bit machine

436535
division	multiplication
pattern0	slower hardware	
you always need to know the magic number here 0xaaaaaaab and the correct operations after the multiplication shifts and or additions in most cases and both is different depending on the number you want to divide by and both take too much cpu time to calculate them on the fly that would be slower than hardware division

439818
postgresql	mysql
pattern2	
i have never used postgresql myself but i think it s mostly a matter of taste whether you prefer it over mysql

440239
int	double
pattern8	
this shouldn t come as any surprise - there are more long values than double given the nan values and plenty of double aren t int so we can t expect every long to be exactly representable

442181
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	better	
i also personally believe that postgresql has better handling of complex queries that include sub-selects and the like which most mysql users used to avoid

446962
ati	nvidia
pattern4	
are there any third-party reports that compare ati s stream framework to nvidia s cuda framework ie not from ati or nvidia talking themselves up

448892
mp3	flv
pattern3	
i would recommend using mp3 audio and flash using the free jw flv media player which should do everything that you want except for the low high quality thing but maybe you can just use two players if you need

449516
getdate	dateadd
pattern4	
select dateadd d getdate 8 - dow getdate

449918
webclient	webrequest
pattern7	simpler	
webclient is simpler to use than webrequest

453751
kerberos	ntlm
pattern7	better	pattern0	better	
in fact in some ways ntlm is better than kerberos

454121
x86	mips
pattern8	more complex instructions	
x86 have more complex instructions than mips

455359
int	double
pattern8	
int and string are really quite different certainly more different than int and double

456500
freemarker	velocity
pattern4	
i prefer freemarker here over velocity

460360
springsource	grails
pattern4	
i also choose grails over simplicity and there are lots of java lib such as jasper report jawr etc and i am glad that now they join with springsource which makes their base solid

462567
equals	gethashcode
pattern2	
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object

462722
textwrangler	bbedit
pattern4	
if the text editor in xcode doesn t suit you i d recommend bbedit or its free little brother textwrangler

463420
freemarker	velocity
pattern7	simpler	pattern0	simpler	
velocity is simpler than freemarker

463420
freemarker	velocity
pattern10	pattern10	more powerful	pattern8	more powerful	
freemarker is more powerful than velocity

463954
firefox	safari
pattern7	just better	pattern4	
firefox is just better for web development and i prefer safari overall

465728
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
pattern0	
i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric

466508
inherited	subclassing
pattern4	
if you still want to favor inherited without necessarily thinking in terms of base class and subclassing you can simply define an interface ex

467418
int	double	int	boolean
pattern4	
the surprising thing is that a single matlab data type may match different java data types logical matches boolean byte short int long float and double in that order of precedence

467696
vmware	virtualbox
pattern4	
it was developed with only various versions of windows in mind and from my experience there s always some sort of problem running any linux distro under it. i would recommend vmware as suggested above or alternatively virtualbox which has worked very well for me in the past it runs certain linux distros best though i can t remember which ones

468724
equals	gethashcode
pattern2	
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

470267
int	double
pattern10	pattern10	
this one s an overflow but i think it illustrates the unreliability of isnumeric in general especially for int - for double it s much more reliable

471259
trac	bugzilla
pattern0	better	
trac s issue tracking is little better than bugzilla s...i know a lot of folks love trac but i find it very inflexible

471804
rss	feed
pattern4	
i have used it for several years to grab rss feed

472158
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7	pattern0	less memory	
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

472158
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7	faster	
sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist

472283
for-loop	loops
pattern7	generally better	
the conclusion of the article is that using for-loop is generally better and faster than the foreach loops

472333
disk	ram
pattern7	much faster	pattern0	faster	
ram is much faster than disk

475026
crypt	hash
pattern4	
also instead of using crypt you may prefer hash because this allows you to keep the string setting for the hash algorithm elsewhere

476792
cvs	svn
pattern4	pattern2	
i would recommend svn over cvs although distributed version tracking tools like git and mercurial seem to be very popular among open source projects

480067
ftgl	freetype
pattern4	
id recommend ftgl as already recommended above however i have implemented a freetype opengl renderer myself and thought you might find the code handy if you want reinvent this wheel yourself

482268
hash	salt
pattern0	longer	
you can safely store the salt in the db because working out a string from its hash is just as hard when you know some of the string as it is when you know none of it provided the password itself is longer than the salt and long enough and strong enough to take a long time to crack by brute force at least 6 chars with at least one case change and a number or non-alphanumeric i d say

482412
ftp	smb
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
push log files to a central location ftp is faster than smb the windows ftp command can be automated with -s scriptfile

484066
hex	binary
pattern7	representation better	
it seems the from a readability and usability standpoint the hex representation is a better way of defining binary numbers

484840
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
pattern0	
note better than just runtimeexception would be to use a more specific unchecked-exception if one is available

484849
hex	binary
pattern7	just less	
hex is just less verbose and can express anything a binary number can

486951
nunit	mstest
pattern8	
attributes are used in a more meaningful manner than mstest or nunit

487454
quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	worse	
given that it is possible to vastly reduce the likelihood of the worst case of quicksort s time complexity via random selection of the pivot for example i think one could argue that mergesort is worse in all but the pathological case of quicksort

488946
superclass	subclassing
pattern10	pattern10	more specific	
if the subclassing is more specific then it might fill in all by 2 of the arguments to its superclass __init__ method

488978
mockito	easymock
pattern7	
the easymock support is complete but the mockito plugin needs some more work

491263
union	distinct
pattern4	
depending on the number of rows returned you may be best using union all on the selects with a select distinct query around it

492954
hash	salt
pattern4	
hash salt password that matches username and see if password matches hash

493221
codeigniter	cakephp
pattern4	
of the frameworks i ve tried cakephp and codeigniter i prefer cakephp

495528
vbscript	jscript
pattern10	infinitely more	pattern10	infinitely more elegant	pattern8	more elegant	
when writing code in jscript as i am wont to do as i have never been a fan of asp.net and jscript is infinitely more elegant than vbscript you can call upon the arguments collection

496124
toolbar	docking
pattern4	
however dockpaneleftof does not seem to work in this case so you lose docking toolbar next to each other

497794
quicksort	mergesort
pattern0	quicker	
i had been taught that quicksort is almost always quicker than mergesort and i understand that there is some debate on this topic but i at least expected it to be closer than this

497819
quicksort	mergesort
pattern0	better	
previously discussed on so why is quicksort better than mergesort

497849
mergesort	in-place
pattern7	
another reason is that mergesort needs more memory because it s hard to implement it as an in-place sort

497967
quicksort	mergesort
pattern4	
i actually just wrote a linked-list comparative sort demo program in c and arrived at a similar conclusion that mergesort will beat quicksort for most uses altho i have been told that quicksort is generally not used for linked lists anyway

497967
quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	better	pattern0	better	
the biggest difference that can be produced between the two of them will always be to quicksort s detriment and it involves lists that are already largely sorted or contain a large number of ties when quicksort does better than mergesort the difference will not be nearly so great

498069
inherited	properties
pattern0	
if a browser s stylesheet does define a style for all types of element and this style has a higher precendence than inherited then inherited properties values should never be observed

498840
integer	unsigned
pattern7	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

500622
komodo	notepad++
pattern2	
if i had to choose between notepad++ and komodo i would choose pyscripter

502658
vim	jedit
pattern4	
personally i would recommend jedit rather than vim

502970
calloc	malloc
pattern4	
just this feature alone would be enough for me to prefer calloc to malloc

503943
bazaar	git
pattern4	
as an alternative to git which has already been mentioned i would highly recommend bazaar

505839
width	height
pattern10	longer	pattern10	longer	
my fixed document xps has its page orientation set to landscape the page media size has a width that is longer that its height and it displays correctly in the viewer as landscape

505901
vb.net	vb6
pattern4	
if you want to learn more about tdd and unit testing you should apply it to functions or procedures in vb6 -- although i d recommend vb.net or c# and doing object-oriented development

506241
division	multiplication
pattern0	slower	
division is per se slower than multiplication however i don t know the details

506252
division	multiplication
pattern0	busier place	
both operations are done down at the floating point unit fpu level and even in the world of integral alus the division circuit is a far busier place than a multiplication circuit

509703
sproutcore	javascriptmvc
pattern0	more heavyweight	
it s probably overkill for what you need but sproutcore is an mvc framework and it doesn t look any more heavyweight than javascriptmvc or trimpath s junction

511928
int	double
pattern7	value also larger	
the largest double value is also larger than the largest int so it would have to be a long

511966
innodb	myisam
pattern10	pattern10	
if that s true then you might not need all the transactional safety provided by the innodb storage engine and you might be able to get away with switching to myisam which is considerably more efficient on aggregate queries

512569
xsl-fo	xslt
pattern7	
all in all t4 to me is more of a inside vs code-generation tool to quickly create c# or other files while xslt is more of a data-processing data-transformation tool to turn data from xml into another format typically html or pdf using xsl-fo

514184
floating-point	integer
pattern7	math slower	pattern0	slower	
they take up more space and floating-point math is slower than integer math

515325
wxpython	qt-designer
pattern10	pattern10	more powerful	
as far as i can tell qt-designer is more powerful than any wxpython counterpart like boa constructor and pyglade

515501
union	distinct
pattern4	
so there is no need to use select distinct combined with a union

516941
disk	ram
pattern0	cheaper	
disk space is probably always going to be cheaper than ram

518893
vim	emacs
pattern4	
i am capable of using vim in a pinch but i really prefer emacs

519191
emacs	jedit
pattern7	
jedit is still pretty good but emacs is quite better

521392
maven	pom.xml
pattern7	
sure there is a learning curve with maven but reading a pom.xml is far easier than reading a build.xml

522537
goto	break
pattern4	
a much simpler way of inspecting the code in msvc is to simply set a break point and inspect the disassembly right click on the line and select goto disassembly from the pop-up menu

522964
gif	png	tiff	png
pattern4	
other than that it s up to the uses of the images quality compression etc. in terms of whether you choose png gif jpeg tiff etc

525029
backtracking	greedy
pattern4	
it doesn t show how to do greedy nongreedy matches backtracking matching within a line instead of the whole line and other more esoteric features of state machines that are easily handled by the re syntax

526070
int	double
pattern7	greater	
today i noticed that when i cast a double that is greater than the maximum possible int to an int i get -2147483648

526070
int	double
pattern7	
similarly when i cast a double that is less than the minimum possible int i also get -2147483648

526337
lisp	scheme
pattern4	
ever since reading what paul graham has to say about lisp i ve been intending to go back and pick scheme up again and see if it ll improve my programming in general

530086
freebsd	linux
pattern10	much better	pattern10	much better	
just a tip but from personal experience i ve found that freebsd works much better on low-end hardware than a modern linux distro does

531772
x86	64bit
pattern7	
reason why double can t be declared volatile it s 64bit which makes it more than the word size on x86 which prevents it from being declared volatile in the cli if i remember correctly

534243
crypto++	libtomcrypt
pattern4	
i can recommend crypto++ or libtomcrypt for that

535933
apache	nginx
pattern0	faster	
not only is nginx supposedly faster than apache at delivering static content but this also offloads your rails application for every image stylesheet javascript or whatever other static content

539857
translation	localization
pattern7	easier	
localization it s easier to translation text than images

542234
awt	swing
pattern7	
which java framework awt or swing makes more sense for something this simple

544898
northwind	adventureworks
pattern0	
what are your strategies best practices when it comes to dealing with a reasonably sized sql server database anything larger than northwind or adventureworks - do you use multiple filegroups

548312
int	chars
pattern0	
the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-defined

548356
int	chars
pattern0	
when an int is declared using a chars constant of more than one chars it is sensitive to the byte order of the machine for which the constant was developed

548827
boost	stl
pattern8	less standard	
boost libraries are generally less mature and less standard than stl

548848
boost	stl
pattern0	better	
once you re past the basics with c++ learning how to use parts of stl and then how it works will be better than tackling boost

550564
int	double
pattern7	
even though a standard conversion sequence converting from int float double to long double is better than a user-defined conversion sequence converting from myclass to long double your operator version is not chosen because your other parameter long double requires a conversion from the argument which is worse than what the builtin operator needs for that argument perfect match

551068
datamapper	activerecord
pattern4	
if what you want is to compare activerecord rails and datamapper hibernate the data source architectural patterns chapter from patterns of enterprise application architecture is a good place to start

551342
vim	emacs
pattern7	much older	
since emacs is much older than the extensible vim as opposed to the relatively non-extensible vi it has a much larger collection of extension modes covering almost any purpose you can imagine

559225
cvsnt	svn
pattern7	simply much better	
just a wild guess here but if you re using cvsnt on the server this observation might be based on the fact that cvsnt simply is much better at merging than svn because it has the notion of mergepoints

559937
trac	bugzilla
pattern8	
i would suggest something more modern than bugzilla such as trac or lighthouse although bugzilla may fit your bill

560114
accessor	properties
pattern7	
and lastly the properties makes refactoring easier for example when the value later is no longer stored in a variable but is calculated inside the properties accessor or comes from some other source variable

562990
boost	stl
pattern0	
.net library support is way better and cleaner than stl mfc and boost

563472
lisp	scheme
pattern7	somewhat simpler	pattern0	simpler common	
it s popular it s actively developed it has many libraries offering the features of a modern programming environment and scheme is somewhat simpler not to say better just simpler than common lisp

565933
disk	ram
pattern7	alway faster	
buy as much memory as you can afford ram is alway faster than io from disk

568703
opensuse	linux
pattern0	
i have used a lot more than 10 linux distributions and i now stick to opensuse

569500
width	height
pattern0	
there is no automatic clipping performed so you have to ensure that parameters top and left are not smaller than 0 zero and left + as well as top + are not greater than the width or height of the destination image respectively

570223
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	
i also greatly prefer postgresql but i think if you re planning to use other peoples php applications forums blogs etc it s just a reality that you re probably going to have to run mysql to support them

570247
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
you re right postgresql has much better support for sql and other advanced features so there s a very good case for why postgresql is superior to mysql

572622
ubuntu	debian
pattern4	
i highly recommend debian or ubuntu server for domain-0

575934
opera	firefox
pattern4	
most of opera s features are eventually available copied to firefox as plugins but i still prefer opera at home because the text looks better

576296
skip-lists	tree
pattern0	better	
so as you can see the random binary search tree was rather a lot better than the skip-lists

579589
innodb	myisam
pattern7	higher	pattern0	higher performance	
their conclusion innodb has 30 higher performance than myisam on average

584128
udp	tcp
pattern0	lower overhead	
udp has a much lower overhead than tcp

584131
udp	tcp
pattern10	pattern10	more reliable	pattern0	faster	pattern0	faster	
tcp mounts are more reliable and you know you have a network problem much faster than with udp

584198
pdfbox	itext
pattern0	better	
start with pdfbox as it s text extraction abilities are better than itext s

584890
yslow	pagespeed
pattern0	better	
in my testing so far google s pagespeed addon is far and above much better than yslow

585100
asp.net-mvc	openrasta
pattern7	much closer	
i d suggest having a look at openrasta which is much closer to http semantics than asp.net asp.net-mvc is

585102
mockups	balsamiq
pattern4	
i d still recommend balsamiq mockups

585442
hudson	bamboo
pattern4	
i ve administered both bamboo and hudson and i would recommend hudson

586834
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	
i had mentioned that in our rails application all select queries dropped below 100ms after switching to postgresql whereas some of the complex joins generated by activerecord would occasionally take as much as 15s or more with mysql 5.1 because of nested loops with inner table scans even when indices were available

592265
vim	emacs
pattern2	
you will always be using the best editor for the job if you re able to choose between vim and emacs

592640
kerberos	ntlm
pattern0	faster	
kerberos is complex to set up and even though it generally is considered faster than ntlm this is only true when you reach a certain limit of simultanious users on your site

592640
kerberos	ntlm
pattern0	slower	
for a low traffic site the huge tokens that kerberos send across the network actually makes it slower than ntlm

593094
lift	wicket
pattern4	
however i strongly prefer wicket and or lift especially the latter

594466
int	double
pattern0	faster	
so i asked myself can a double be faster than a int

595351
stateless	stateful
pattern4	
one thing i ve learned over the years is that stateless trumps stateful for maintainability

595693
for-loop	loops
pattern4	
i would choose for-loop when there is known number maximum number of iterations before loops starts

597265
division	multiplication
pattern0	
for example a lot of people that started at a higher level have no idea why shifts are so much faster than multiplication and division or the impact of branching etc

597847
northwind	adventureworks
pattern7	better	pattern0	better	
talk about sql server 2005 adventureworks is better than northwind

598774
ant	maven
pattern4	
there are plenty of articles on the net that compare ant and maven so you can look at those but from my experience its always worthwhile to consider how you can improve a project

599070
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
pattern3	
if your long term goal is to migrate to using maven to manage the entire build process which one might intend to do for new greenfield projects then i heartily recommend using maven pom.xml files to manage dependencies on behalf of ant build.xml files

599070
ant	maven
pattern7	really better	
and it turns out maven really does a better job of managing dependencies for ant build.xml files than does ivy

600969
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
pattern4	
personally i prefer odp.net but system.data.oracleclient will get the job done

601626
getter	setter
pattern7	
or if your getter takes parameters or your setter takes more than a value parameter

debian	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos
pattern4	
you just need very basic functions mostly the standard toolchain. you could pick centos ubuntu fedora debian whatever

601996
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
pattern7	
wxhaskell is probably a little easier to build if you are not on linux gtk2hs is likely easier if you are linux hosted but both are pretty complex to build to be honest as there are a significant number of dependencies in both cases

602804
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	
the advantage with sphinx is easier integration with mysql and postgresql however lucene is more feature-rich

604314
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
pattern0	nicer	
edit someone else suggested css and i believe that using the height and width directives from css will give you the same result as using the same attributes of the tag but doesn t limit you strictly to images and a will play nicer with any margin or padding directives you might use

605544
int	double
pattern7	way greater	
the range of double is way greater than the range of 32 or 64 bit int which is why std floor returns a double

605544
int	double
pattern7	
casting to int should be fine so long as it s within the appropriate range - but be aware that a double can t represent all 64 bit int exactly so you may also end up with errors when you go beyond the point at which the accuracy of double is such that the difference between two consecutive double is greater than 1

605547
int	double
pattern7	far greater	
another reason is that the range of double is far greater than that of int

610260
memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy	strlen	strcpy	strlen	strncpy
pattern7	slower	
but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively

610494
strcpy	strncpy
pattern7	
of course you might still ask whether to use strncpy or strcpy in implementing that abstraction strncpy is safer there provided you fully grok what it does

610542
gif	png
pattern7	newer	
png is a newer format and often better than either jpeg of gif - especially for screenshots

610565
gif	png
pattern0	smaller	
if png isn t smaller than gif then your software may be saving it poorly - look for png optimisation progams like pngout and pngnq

610573
gif	png
pattern0	larger	
jpg and png work well for most applications but the files will be larger than gif for very simple graphics

610597

613917
opera	firefox
pattern4	
i do it with firefox opera but i prefer firefox because of firebug

614696
telerik	componentart
pattern7	
although it depends on your project size and requriments i recommend devxpress and telerik web windows .i ve used componentart telerik devxpress and i think telerik is better if u are developing web applications.and devxpress are better in winforms.by the way while developing in some cases i came across especially performance problems in telerik products.nevertheless telerik is good choice for web development

614786
nginx	lighttpd
pattern4	
this is all done with outer webserver which listens to the world i recommend nginx or lighttpd

618881

it is much more complicated at higher levels at deciding which function class choose named shadowing ambiguous named between namespaces etc. or when compiling to bytecode running ast

619544
cpython	pypy
pattern0	faster	
part of the compiler toolchain includes an experimental jit generator now in its fifth incarnation and starting to work really well - the goal is for a jited pypy to run much faster than cpython

620976
cpython	ironpython
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
i m not sure exactly how you re drawing the conclusion that ironpython is faster than cpython

628270
haskell	scheme	imperative	declarative	lisp	scheme
pattern10	pattern10	pattern8	
i think that functional declarative programming haskell scheme lisp etc is more powerful and more abstract than imperative programming and therefore is intrinsically harder to learn

630233
vmware	virtualbox
pattern0	faster	
in my experience i ve found that vmware seems to be faster than virtualbox although i don t have any hard data to back it up

630233
vmware	virtualbox
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
even though vmware has been faster for me i still use virtualbox because it s good enough and is free and im cheap

630770
uiview	catransition

in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

638446
udp	mtu	udp	tcp
pattern0	
for example i read an experiment in which a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

640303
google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	
using the same data google-chrome does in less than 5 seconds what took ie and firefox 10 to 15 seconds to accomplish

645799
disk	ram

writing to a local database or handling a data structure larger than ram will impact the disk making network calls will impact the network hardware cpu bound calculations will impact there

646086
rsa	aes
pattern4	
from what i could gather so far people either recommend aes or rsa for this

646461
vim	emacs

i d recommend vim if you are going to learn one or the other but i know emacs users will strongly disagree

646610
trac	mantis
pattern4	
i d recommend mantis or trac

649736
vim	emacs
pattern4	
i have only used emacs briefly and while i prefer vim i am jealous of some of its features

651200
rapidsvn	tortoisesvn

with a gui interface along with a command line one subversion has tortoisesvn rapidsvn which is more of a traditional ui or ankhsvn for visual studio integration

654112
svg	vml
pattern2	
i m writing a bit of javascript and need to choose between svg or vml or both or something else it s a weird world

655564
multiplying	multiplication
pattern10	pattern10	
if you re dividing or multiplying by a variable then it s likely that multiplication is slightly faster because the logic is generally more simple

655581
division	multiplication
pattern0	slower	
division algorithms are slower than multiplication algorithms in most cases

655584
division	multiplication
pattern0	slower	
which one is faster is indeed a cpu-specific issue or at least how much faster is cpu specific yes division is typically seen as slower than multiplication

656377
entity-relationship	diagram
pattern0	pattern0	
it s the only conceptual modeling tool available for relational data the others - erwin and its ilk - being at best logical modeling tools with nothing much better than entity-relationship diagram and ddl synchrnoization which are also provided by object role modeling tools

jquery is light weight especially in compare with scriptaculous

673046
folder	directory	folder	dir
pattern4	
i d recommend folder directory or even dir

674037
hash	salt
pattern7	
as others have mentioned you want to be careful with your hash since it s easy to do something that s not really secure h salt password is far weaker than h password salt but at the same time you want to balance the effort put into this with the value of the site content

674849
lxml	html5lib	lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup
pattern3	
i strongly recommend using html5lib + lxml instead of beautifulsoup

677447
gif	png
pattern4	
i prefer png for any internet image work i m doing as gif has a limited palette and jpg doesn t handle transparency

677459
config	ini
pattern0	
ini is really a much simpler format than xml if you have less than fifty config options and they are not nested

680030
spaces	delimiter
pattern3	
the following should do the necessary but it s inefficient doing two full table selects and it also relies on your exact match being delimiter by spaces

680382
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
pattern4	
i ve checked the site on two machines vista with firefox ie6 ie7 ie8 safari win opera win

680613
quicksort	mergesort
pattern10	also more	pattern10	also more complicated	pattern8	more complicated	
quicksort is also more complicated than mergesort especially if you want to write a really solid implementation and so if you re aiming for simplicity and maintainability merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance loss

681760
trie	dawg
pattern10	pattern10	more efficient	
it is a structure similar to but twice as space-efficient as the dawg that is more efficient than the trie which only compresses prefixes

683028
joomla	typo3
pattern8	more professional	
i didn t work with these applications yet but afaik typo3 and ezpublish both php are considered much more professional than joomla

686138
innodb	myisam

width	height
pattern0	
the padding on the #variablesize would have to be equal to or greater than the width height of the images

688135
disk	ram
pattern0	
vs.net makes tons of i o calls and ram disk are much faster than real disk

688567
disk	ram
pattern0	
you might want to investigate more than creating ram disk

690380
firebird	dbisam
pattern10	pattern10	
something like textolution s proprietary add-on for firebird looks like it could accommodate constructing single complex nested query that would apply both regular and fulltext criteria but dbisam does it more elegantly

691900
post	get
pattern8	
eval is more dangerous than get post because the submitted content can run functions like include which can access any file apache has read privileges for or shell_exec which can do anything in the shell the apache user can do etc

694874
cobertura	emma
pattern4	pattern2	
i prefer cobertura over emma

698048
post	get
pattern0	less subsequent	
an initial get request to a page usually costs less than subsequent post anyway so there s not much reason to avoid it

698780
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	addition	multiplication

706428
bazaar	git
pattern0	slower	
i hear all this stuff about bazaar being slower than git

706457
bazaar	git
pattern0	slower	
an incredibly rough eye balling of the numbers they posted showed bazaar to be 2-4x slower than either git or mercurial in the use cases tested

709465
nunit	mstest
pattern4	pattern2	
i strongly prefer nunit over mstest

710493
int	double
pattern7	
this prints derived.foo double - even though the compiler knows there is a matching method with a parameter of type int and the argument is type int and the conversion from int to int is better than the conversion from int to double the fact that only the foo double method is originally declared in derived means the compiler ignores foo int

712054
haskell	sml
pattern0	
it is semantically influenced more by java sml haskell and a very obscure oo language called gbeta

713801
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	
an alternative would be firebird which is not so flexible but in my experience it is in some cases performing much better than mysql and postgresql

714814
public	protected
pattern0	
package-private is stricter than protected and public scopes but more permissive than private scope

715836
vim	emacs
pattern2	
i would recommend trying out vim or emacs

718625
ienumerable	ilist
pattern3	
i recommend using ienumerable instead of ilist with it you will have more flexibility

720746
boost	stl
pattern3	
i would really recommend using stl vector or boost multi_array containers for this

721224
int	chars
pattern7	wider	
an implicit cast is disallowed as an int is wider has a greater range of values than a chars

721563
gridview	repeater
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
maybe a repeater is better but you will be fine with a gridview if you are familiar with it

723329
goto	break
pattern0	better	
labeled break like in java would be better than goto for this purpose

724260
nunit	mstest
pattern3	
lastly i would recommend using nunit with testdriven.net - a very useful plugin whether you re doing nunit or mstest

724272
post	get
pattern7	
sorry that this post is more of the and for further information... type than a direct answer which i think has now been given-- i just thought it was helpful not to get things lost inside comments

724365
free	malloc
pattern10	pattern10	
this avoids malloc free but is less extensible and more prone to buffer overflow issues so i rarely ever use it

725366
min	max
pattern4	
select min value1 max value1 from values_table

725366
min	max
pattern4	
select min value2 max value2 from values_table

726875
versioning	upgrade
pattern7	
upgrade_250 the wordpress 2.5.0 upgrade will be run if the database versioning is less than 7499. each of these functions run their own data migration and population procedures some of which are called during the initial database setup script

728426
filtering	grouping
pattern2	
certainly if your select with grouping by has no where clause it s going to be a lot more efficient if you run the report with filtering values

728716
width	height
pattern7	
unfortunately using nsstring -stringwithfont forwidth linebreakmode doesn t work - which ever wrap mode you choose the text wraps with a width that is less than the current width and the height becomes 0 on any overflow lines

731695
hash	md5
pattern4	
ldap signon should select md5 digest as the authentication type supply the username and then supply the md5 hash of the password

734559
typeerror	attributeerror
pattern7	
many times catching an attributeerror or typeerror is simpler and apparently faster

738996
readonly	temporary
pattern4	
when an ie user clicks the link of a file residing in sharepoint and user selects readonly access the file is copied to temporary internet files my application is opened and passed that filename as a parameter

741341
subtraction	addition
pattern8	
although i should warn you for anything more complicated than addition and subtraction and shifts you ll need to use non-trivial algorithms

744070
cdr	cons
pattern0	
hons generally runs slower than cons because in creating a hons an attempt is made to see whether a hons already exists with the same car and cdr

746301
junit	testng
pattern7	
you may want to use junit in the part of unit testing but testng is more than a unite testing framework

748094
jquery	jqmodal
pattern3	
i would recommend using jquery with the jqmodal plugin instead of using a â popupâ

752002
sum	coalesce
pattern4	
update users u mines m set u.mana u.mana + coalesce select sum m.mana_rate from mines m where m.user_id u.id 0

752147
union	distinct
pattern0	
union forces a distinct to occur and there s little slower than distinct

754021
vb.net	vb6
pattern4	
if your already familiar with vb5 and vb6 and your just building small desktop utilities then i would recommend vb.net

754723
innodb	myisam
pattern7	generally less	pattern0	less suitable	
plus you have to make your tables myisam which is generally less suitable than innodb

755202
union	distinct
pattern4	
select distinct table.column from table where column like union

756327
gridview	datalist
pattern10	much more	pattern10	much more bells	
gridview has much more bells and whistles than datalist

757699
telerik	radwindow
pattern10	pattern10	
telerik has a control called radwindow which is more or less a modal window

761581
postgresql	mysql
pattern8	more sane	
since postgresql is a lot more sane than mysql there are not that many tricks to report on

761596
codeigniter	kohana
pattern10	
and a thing about codeigniter i asked some time ago people about it and most says that kohana based on codeigniter is better

761864
public	protected
pattern7	much more	pattern0	more sense	
therefore the only types that should have access to a constructor are its derived types and hence protected makes much more sense than public

763284
swt	swing
pattern4	pattern2	
i would recommend swt over swing any day as it is very easy for an average programmer to create a responsive and native-feeling swt app while it takes a swing expert to create a decent swing app

763764
apache	nginx
pattern10	pattern10	
it seems to be common wisdom that if you are deploying django on an apache server then you should still put an nginx server in front of the application to serve static files at which nginx is more performant

764074
verilog	vhdl
pattern8	less common	
pacoblaze was written in verilog which like adam said less common than vhdl

764490
merb	ruby-on-rails
pattern8	
this will be made less onerous by ruby-on-rails 3 which is intended to be orm agnostic after the merge with merb

765929
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
pattern7	much better	
as for production side of things upgrading your database in transaction msi-style installation is much better than attempting to upgrade at each app startup since you can potentially end up with desynchronized database-application versioning

766479
inherited	properties
pattern7	easier	
multiple inherited makes it easier to compose classes from small mixin base classes that implement functionality and have properties to remember state

771139
ubuntu	linux
pattern4	
i usually prefer linux for programming i program in django on ubuntu

771892
quicksort	heapsort
pattern8	more efficient	
average asymptotic order of quicksort is o nlogn and it s usually more efficient than heapsort due to smaller constants tighter loops

772710
versioning	upgrade
pattern0	
i am not sure could this be because now the older links after upgrade is been pointed to newer versioning and just linking is not sufficient and need to modify something more on linux

773225
hide	show
pattern0	pattern0	
js for tabs generally does no more than show hide maybe load content

774381
ferret	sphinx
pattern10	
i ve used ferret in the past with few problems although i ve heard sphinx is better

780156
free	malloc
pattern0	pattern0	
i am wondering if there is a cross-platform allocator that is one step lower than malloc free

782375
cvs	svn
pattern8	more popular	
in addition another coworker said cvs was a lot more popular than svn

782494
cvs	svn
pattern4	pattern2	
there are arguments for keeping cvs if you already have it but for virtually any other case i d recommend svn over cvs and so would most of the people who use either heavily

783534
vb.net	vb6	vbscript	vb6
pattern4	
i m unusual in that i come from a c c++ background know c# but actually prefer vb.net i severely dislike vb6 vbscript

784328
int	chars
pattern0	
for example if the string is going to store a decimal-formatted 32-bit int you know that you do not need more than 11 chars to do so

784719
pop-up	dialog
pattern0	better	
use floating divs instead which looks like a modal dialog but are better than the pop-up

784951
fiddler	charles
pattern4	
if you use a transparent echoing proxy this can show you all http traffic charles and fiddler are two good example i recommend charles

786330
aggregate-functions	sum
pattern4	
you cannot nest aggregate-functions - select sum max x will always error

788881
width	height
pattern7	
what would be perfect is keeping the percent height and width while child width is smaller than parent a width

790473
rar	zip
pattern0	pattern0	
it s much better compressing than zip rar

790744
rsa	dsa
pattern4	
a practical introduction to gnu privacy guard in windows recommends dsa and elgamal but i would like to know if rsa is good enough to use these days and if so what minimum key size should i use

792460
floating-point	integer
pattern7	
the difference between each floating-point number and its corresponding integer is less than 1 or equal to 1 if you really must

794801
put	get
pattern10	method better	pattern10	method better	
right now i would have to say the put method is better since it works and i could not get the webservice to work

798046
floating-point	integer
pattern7	greater	
i know c++ have functions that return largest or smallest integer that is greater or lower than a like ceil or floor.is there a function that implement digit limitation of floating-point variable

799142
udp	tcp
pattern7	pattern0	less overhead	pattern10	
udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster

803700
nginx	lighttpd
pattern10	even more	pattern10	even more ridiculously	
it s simple and nginx is even more ridiculously fast and lightweight than lighttpd

804829
lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern0	
lxml is supposed to be much faster and efficient and can do much more than beautifulsoup

805392
ssl	https
pattern10	pattern10	
if you have a secure ftp sftp server or secure http ssl https server then curl can accept ssh keys although using an ssl key is more commonly accepted on the internet. it can use those keys to authenticate and establish a secure connection to the directories which have been made public to your user through the server

808889
glut	sdl
pattern10	
i have never used glut but i know that many people will say sdl is better

810193
addition	multiplication
pattern7	operator higher	
well we know it is the first one because of precedence - the binary multiplication operator has higher precedence than the binary + addition operator and is resolved first

811801
haskell	sml
pattern0	better	
because sml is eagerly evaluated the execution model is far easier to comprehend and debugging via printf works a lot better than in haskell

811937
junit	testng
pattern7	much friendlier	
testng is much friendlier to this paradigm than junit though

813646
haskell	sml
pattern4	
much as i love haskell here are the reasons i would prefer sml for a class in discrete math and data structures and most other beginners classes

813984
doc	rtf
pattern7	somewhat easier	pattern0	easier	
if the latter is what you want you could use rtf which is somewhat easier than the doc format

814811
actionscript	mxml
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	pattern10	pattern10	
i would say pure actionscript is better for programming whether you use flash ide or flex ide is not that relevant and mxml is better for non-programmers to combine the components programmed in as

816576
camping	ruby-on-rails	ramaze	camping
pattern0	
i would like to use a lighter framework than ruby-on-rails sinatra ramaze camping but am concerned that by doing so i will not be able to use a lot of shared libraries that have been tailored to ruby-on-rails in the form of plugins

817327
xslt	xquery
pattern4	pattern2	
i use and recommend xquery over xslt

818424
datamapper	activerecord
pattern4	pattern0	faster	
i d recommend datamapper for orm not only it s way faster than activerecord but it s also very modularly built and plugins are actual gems that you can easily install

819327
int	chars
pattern7	usually bigger	pattern0	bigger	
int is usually bigger than chars â more suitable for calculations but not so suitable for byte-level manipulation

824870
mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
pattern3	
that said if you are using only visual studio and will be doing ci builds using cruisecontrol.net or teamcity i d recommend using mbunit or nunit.net

827594
haskell	ocaml
pattern7	fewer	
haskell has fewer industrial users than ocaml and although it does have multicore support it is still being developed in a very unproductive direction

828631
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
pattern4	
it s much more difficult in 2.0 until you get your rythym down as previous poster i d recommend sqlconnection and sqldatareader etc

830892
cpython	ironpython
pattern4	
for example cpython beats ironpython hands down start up time

831519
aggregate-functions	sum
pattern2	
i want to take an ado.net datatable and perform the equivalent of a sql select query with aggregate-functions such as sum on some columns and group by set for the remaining columns

832483
post	get
pattern4	pattern2	
when i first started doing web development ten years ago the conventional wisdom was to always favor post over get for forms and to have the application on the server side require post for form submission for precisely this reason

832496
post	get
pattern4	pattern2	
the point isn t to prefer get over post the point is to use get where the request doesn t affect the data on the server and post where data is modified

832606
post	get
pattern4	pattern2	
the already-given answers really do answer your question - no prevention of xss is not a valid reason to prefer post over get

836856
division	multiplication	division	addition	addition	multiplication
pattern10	pattern10	pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
also addition is faster than multiplication and multiplication is faster than division

839116
int	chars	subtract	add
pattern4	
if you need to compare add and or subtract time only values think about the possibility to use a int to store the time value and then to convert it to chars when displaying the result

839664
superclass	subclassing
pattern7	always smaller	
for my understanding the superclass is always smaller less complex then the subclassing

840730
git-svn	svn2git
pattern0	better results	
using svn2git might produce better results than git-svn if you have tags or branches.

840989
int	boolean
pattern0	
so the best approach here is either to use a wider type than int number or pass some flag boolean value to function as well as int to indicate actual value absence

843650
django	turbogears
pattern4	
i usually prefer turbogears but django seems to be more smooth at the moment

843733
qcodo	qcubed
pattern7	community much stronger	
qcubed community is much stronger at the moment so you might want to check in qcodo forum for your answers on basic problems but post on the qcubed forum

beyond ones already suggested i would recommend checking out tapestry and wicket many developers like them

845066
cpython	ironpython
pattern0	
i am however no cpython guru and can get so much more out of ironpython than cpython as i can easily leverage the .net platform on which i am far more at home

846356
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	performance probably better	pattern10	performance probably better	
as i said postgresql is far superior and i hate mucking with mysql s bizarre bugs and i think that overall postgresql performance is probably better than mysql for any even slightly complicated query

848039
for-loop	loops
pattern7	wider	
the scope of the variable in the test of the while loops is wider than the scope of variables declared in the header of the for-loop

848572
disk	ram
pattern7	slower	
memory is a bottleneck to performance ram runs slower than the cpu and if you re paging to disk than it s really slow

851210
range	max	range	min	min	max
pattern7	
and during sometime i have a range where min and max is less than 1 and greater than 0

851468
strcpy	strncpy
pattern7	
concerning the problem your printpiglatin could use the existing function strcpy or better strncpy which is safer in regards to buffer overflows

851496
min	max
pattern4	
select min effdate max termdate from tab1

853042
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
pattern7	pattern7	
compared to ienumerable and icollection ilist performs much better for large or dynamic lists because it provides an indexer allowing us quick random access

857530
int	chars
pattern4	
is there any reason why i should choose int statusid over chars 4 statuscode

857530
int	chars
pattern10	far more	pattern10	far more descriptive	pattern8	more descriptive	
since sql server doesn t support named constants chars is far more descriptive than int when used in stored procedure and views as constants

857900
isnull	nullif
pattern10	pattern10	pattern10	pattern10	
in my opinion using isnull nullif is faster than using case when

859588
versioning	upgrade
pattern4	
bear in mind that you can buy upgrade editions of vs and upgrade from the express versioning or even eclipse

862585
button	checkbox
pattern4	
okay lets ignore safari for a while skinning input and button are rather easy but how to completely skin select checkbox radio etc

864659
des	rsa
pattern0	larger	
des code is 8 times larger than rsa

870080
union	distinct
pattern7	pattern0	
also a union all takes longer than a union distinct

871372
union	distinct
pattern7	pattern0	
also a union all takes longer than a union distinct

874977
innodb	myisam
pattern4	pattern2	
for mysql performance you should probably choose myisam over innodb as the storage engine provided your definition of optimal doesn t include most reliable

876774
pascal	delphi
pattern7	
delphi users might want to look at free pascal s paralel implementation of libchm since a pascal solution makes it easier embeddable

876945
filtering	grouping
pattern2	
select settings under filtering keys grouping in here you can switch off repeating keys for that user on that machine

879201
colt	jama
pattern8	more powerful	pattern0	slower	
colt does this already but i have found it is more complicated and more powerful than jama which may explain why simple functions are slower with colt

880821
lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
i ve found that even if lxml is faster than beautifulsoup for documents that size it s usually best to try to reduce the size to a few kb via regex or direct stripping and load that into bs as you are doing now

882318
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
pattern4	
if you return collections or instance and if you choose ienumerable iqueryable ilist list or whatever depends on your needs

882572
launch4j	jsmooth
pattern4	
if you want a no fuss way for the end user to kick off a program with multiple jar dependencies you may want to look at launch4j or jsmooth i prefer launch4j

883177
imagemagick	libtiff
pattern7	
ghostscript and imagemagick convert should also be able to do this for you although libtiff is supposedly quicker

884697
subtraction	addition	division	subtraction	division	addition
pattern10	pattern10	more tightly	
the addition and subtraction is okay because the types of a and b force them to be performed using floating point arithmetic - but because division binds more tightly than addition and subtraction it s like using the brackets above only the immediate operands are considered

885598
cifs	smb
pattern0	pattern0	
nfs with the right setup version and tuning is just a tad slower than smb cifs

886136
rank	max
pattern0	faster	
while i think gbn s answer is probably sufficient i m wondering whether use of an over clause to establish a max date per id attribute with which to reduce the select in a where clause wouldn t be faster than a rank

886207
int	double
pattern10	pattern10	
using string int double etc is more expected and therefore more maintainable

887983
udp	mtu
pattern0	
3 you are sending messages that are bigger than the udp max message size 4 each device in your network has a max message size mtu so you might be exceeding a limit there

888389
deselect	multi-select
pattern4	
you can multi-select with shift and then select deselect the group

890438
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7	pattern0	less memory	
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

890438
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern0	faster	
if the sortedlist is populated all at once from sorted data it s faster than sorteddictionary

893300
wmv	asf	wma	asf
pattern4	
if compatibility supercedes compression i would recommend asf which is basically just a container for wma and wmv

896482
webclient	httpwebrequest
pattern10	pattern10	
use httpwebrequest instead of webclient it s slightly less convenient but not by very much and set the keepalive property to false

897118
disk	ram
pattern0	
if your working set is larger than your ram the operating system will be constantly swapping pages out to disk to make room to swap in pages that an application wants to access

897862
bazaar	git
pattern0	pattern7	slower	pattern0	slower	
mercurial is significantly faster than bazaar it s slower than git though by a much smaller difference

898011
klocwork	coverity
pattern4	
many companies see value and choose coverity or klocwork for a longer term solution although i see also running findbugs and pmd

898763
subtraction	modulo	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	modulo	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	modulo	addition	multiplication	multiplication	modulo
pattern0	
integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

899887
division	multiplication
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
multiplication is faster than division so the second method is faster

899929
division	multiplication
pattern7	generally faster	pattern0	faster	
if the latter yes floating point multiplication is generally faster than division

899967
firefox	safari
pattern0	faster	
in safari we found that the dom level 0 took twice the time off the dom level 2 but was still four times faster than either firefox case

901588
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
pattern4	
n3 for web my preference will be vwd but for other stuff i ll prefer monodevelop and sharpdevelop

901826
ubuntu	linux
pattern7	
at home w ubuntu linux virtualbox is easier to maintain performs as well as i require and is free

903548
bitarray	bitvector
pattern8	more efficient	
why is the bitvector 32 structure more efficient than bitarray

905454
websphere	ibm
pattern4	
as stated by martin service is a crucial part of why people purchase ibm websphere products and btw

910557
width	height
pattern7	
then when an image is loaded the rectangle s style checks its triggers to see if the image has a height or width that is less than 100px

912233
pull	push
pattern10	far more	pattern10	far more scalable	
why do you think that push is far more scalable then pull for starters

913928
junit	testng
pattern0	better solution	
if there is a junit extension or similar framework that provides a better solution than testng then please let me know

914297
int	chars	implements	extends
pattern7	
plain chars having unspecified signed-ness allows compilers to select whichever representation is more efficient for the target architecture on some architectures zero extends a one-byte value to the size of int requires less operations thus making plain chars unsigned while on others the instruction set makes sign-extending more natural and plain chars gets implements as signed

917748
fileoutputstream	filewriter
pattern3	
note that i wouldn t recommend using filewriter to write to a file - use a fileoutputstream and an outputstreamwriter chained onto it as this lets you set the character encoding instead of using the platform default one

921679
children	parent
pattern0	
so long as the nodes in general have more parent than children this direction will be much faster

922429
width	height
pattern7	greater	pattern0	greater	
it s close - i m finding if height is greater than width the left position of the rotated image is incorrect

922429
width	height
pattern7	greater	pattern0	greater	
similarly if width is greater than height the top position of the rotated image is incorrect

923190
mouse	keyboard
pattern8	more important	
also in this case keyboard input is essential and more important than mouse interaction

924296
min	max
pattern0	pattern0	
probably the line drawer was a bresenham modified to skip the points drawn unless they were greater than max or less than min

928247
width	height
pattern7	
meaning if the height divided by width gives more than 1

928389
union	distinct
pattern4	pattern4	
insert b col1 select distinct col1 from a union select distinct col2 from a

929548
emacs	aquamacs
pattern7	
carbon emacs is closer to the unix emacs experience whereas the aquamacs people have put considerable effort into os x integration

931234
children	parent
pattern0	more n	
in the same breath i would also like to be able to run a specific number of child processes at any given time say for example n children running concurrently whenever one exits the parent process starts another child if needed but has no more than n children at any given moment

932360
postgresql	mysql	innodb	myisam
pattern4	
this blog does provide one reason to prefer postgresql you can have full-text search and still be transactional while in mysql full-text indexing only work on myisam tables not innodb except if you add sphinx of course also see this follow-on for a bit more on full-text search in postgresql and lucene

933047
superclass	subclassing
pattern0	bigger interface	
you can t cast a superclass in a subclassing because the subclassing may have a bigger interface than the superclass means the subclassing can have functions like getunixtimestamp that the superclass doesn t have

937211
disk	ram
pattern0	
at some point if you re doing randomish queries and your working set is sufficiently larger than ram then you ll be limited by the small number of random iops a disk can do

937557
filtering	grouping
pattern7	pattern7	
words grouping filtering has higher

941325
quicksort	heapsort
pattern10	usually faster	pattern10	usually faster then	
in practice however quicksort is usually faster then heapsort

941325
quicksort	heapsort
pattern0	simpler	
each iteration in quicksort is a lot simpler than heapsort

941685
xna	spritebatch
pattern0	
in xna when is it appropriate to render your game content using more than one spritebatch

942017
x86	64bit	16-bit	64bit
pattern8	less efficient	
in fact for x86 64 processors performing 32-bit or 16-bit operations are less efficient than 64bit or 8-bit operations due to the operand prefix byte that has to be decoded

942223
punctuation	words
pattern4	
this matches words digits and a number of punctuation characters though by no means all

942786
swt	swing
pattern2	
depending on who you ask it is either wonderful or evil since it competes with swing and makes use of native os widgets swt

943494
ant	maven
pattern7	
having said all of that i do think that maven is a very interesting and useful system i m not calling it a tool like ant is maven is broader than that for software development configuration and build management

953814
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
postgresql has more established support for this but mysql has played catch up in the last year or so and has a working method of this in the latest versions

953814
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	faster	
mysql s version is apparently marginally faster than postgresql but lacks some of the more advanced spatial features therefore it s pretty much limited to finding records that match a certain range of coordinates

955645
int	chars
pattern0	shorter	
if you use chars x where x 4 your chars key will be shorter than a int one

955645
int	chars
pattern0	greater	
if you use chars x where x 4 your chars key will be greater than a int one

957655
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	pattern10	more tricks	
in general postgresql knows more tricks for how to optimize complicated queries than the mysql optimizer does but it also relies heavily on your having given the optimizer enough data to work with

960774
sum	coalesce
pattern0	
i m pretty sure the linker will coalesce equivalent strings so the total will be less than the sum of the parts for these sections but i guess typically not by much

961662
quicksort	mergesort
pattern0	faster	
in most cases quicksort will run faster than mergesort even though the worst-case execution time is longer

962301
octal	binary
pattern10	pattern10	
when converting from binary to octal it s more easy each 3 bits give you 1 digit in octal

962399
vbscript	vba	vbscript	vb6	vb6	vba
pattern0	better	
vb6 vba though a little better than vbscript in general still has many similar issues where for their domain they require much more boiler plate to do simple tasks than what i would like and have seen in other scripting languages

962806
integer	unsigned	16-bit	64bit	unsigned	short
pattern0	
a number bigger than 64bit can never occur in a multiplication because c is an unsigned integer of 32 bits and k is a unsigned short of 16-bit

964541
int	chars
pattern10	type more	pattern10	type more usable	pattern8	more usable	
sometimes chars type is more usable than int - fixed size chars doesn t take much storage room and you can see enumerated values directly in database fields

965313
imagemagick	libjpeg
pattern0	slower	
basically imagemagick was only slightly slower than libjpeg

966107
int	chars
pattern10	often faster	pattern10	often faster	
far better to use a surrogate key and yes a join on an int is often faster and you can join in delete staments in many databases not use the slower subquery especially since names tend to be longer than a few chars

966689
coff	omf
pattern4	
watcom c c++ v11.0 seems to prefer coff when compiling and linking windows applications but generates omf object files for use with their dos4gw 32-bit protected-mode dos-extender

967805
emacs	textmate
pattern0	better	
i feel like emacs is so much better than textmate

967921
primes	modulus
pattern10	pattern10	
someone else in this thread makes a somewhat convincing argument that modulus a primes is better for detecting bit-swapping

968640
bazaar	git
pattern2	
as for the first tool to choose problem with git bazaar and mercurial is they are distributed vcs s

969709
disk	ram
pattern0	larger available	
in future these lists may be read from disk and larger than available ram

970621
lxml	elementtree
pattern4	
i would normally recommend lxml but since that uses a c-library libxml the alternative would have to be as aaron has already suggested elementtree as far as i know there is both a pure python and a c implementation of it available

971690
width	height
pattern4	
i disagree i have been able to set select width and height using css with something like this

972203
spaces	delimiter
pattern0	
this method can handle more delimiter than spaces by the regex being used

973083
google-chrome	firefox
pattern4	
you could also just recommend google-chrome or firefox

973361
ocamllex	ocamlyacc
pattern4	
one of the main reasons i still prefer ocamlyacc ocamllex over treetop despite its very sexy appearance. this means you need to convert from left recursive forms to right recursion

973476
redmine	trac
pattern4	
i would recommend redmine similar with trac in many aspects

977044
cvsnt	tortoisecvs
pattern3	
since you re on windows i recommend installing tortoisecvs and then configuring the included cvsnt server as follows

977462
vim	emacs
pattern10	pattern10	more powerful	pattern8	more powerful	
emacs is more powerful than vim it s scripting engine is far more flexible and there are far more scripts modes and the likes built around emacs

977462
vim	emacs
pattern7	quicker	pattern7	better	
maybe not productive in the same way - i d say vim is quicker for editing files emacs is better at doing everything else again i would personally say things like flymake-mode vcs bindings are such are quicker to use than the vim equivalent

980929
udp	tcp
pattern7	
udp is great if you plan to have your client for the game account for missing information by using approximation most fps games do this as well as just about any game that requires very quick reflexes where tcp ip is simpler will greatly reduce errors in transmission and be more prone to lag

980962
division	multiplication
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
on many processors integer multiplication is faster than integer division

981089
getdate	datepart
pattern4	
select datepart dd getdate

982185
sudo	passwd
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
sudo is better in most respects but still requires a passwd which asroot does not

982437
richfaces	icefaces
pattern7	
my personal experience with both richfaces mixed better with other jsf libs icefaces has more advanced ajax capabilities like server sided push kinda like comet the basic ajax functionality is easier to set up and use but plays difficult sometimes when you mix it with other jsf libs

986203
vim	emacs
pattern4	
a lot of people in the #python channel of freenode seem to prefer vim emacs nano and similar text editors in favor of ide s

989209
ant	maven
pattern0	clearer	
i find the ant one much clearer than the maven one

990780
innodb	myisam
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
i heard myisam is faster but others say innodb can be fast also but it takes abit more to optimize it

990830
innodb	myisam
pattern7	slower	
innodb is slower for read only databases because it has features acid compliant row level locking that myisam leaves out

994571
versioning	upgrade
pattern0	lower	pattern0	
if i enable this then any setup is ran every time it will be asking for upgrade either it is on lower versioning over higher versioning or higher versioning over lower versioning

995453
union	distinct
pattern4	
union is used to select distinct values from two tables

996052
haskell	ocaml
pattern0	better	
i would just use ocaml but haskell s syntax is so much better than ocaml s and haskell is pure and has cool features such as type classes

999268
width	height
pattern7	
if the orginal file s width is greater than 480 or lessthan 450 then i want to set the width of output image as 450px.and the height has to be proportional of the width

1001196
datamapper	activerecord
pattern7	
both use the activerecord pattern so you ll actually get your database tables back in objects without fancy domain logic but datamapper is way easier to work with and is thread-safe

1001806
ant	maven
pattern0	
it s a lot easier than ant fully compatible with eclipse use maven eclipse eclipse to create eclipse projects and easy to configure

1001855
vbscript	vba
pattern0	more sense	
i believe that the reports are using something more along the lines of vbscript edit oregonghost says vba which actually makes more sense than vbscript than vb.net and very limited at that

1003562
width	height
pattern2	
whenever you mix padding with ie you start to lose control over width height

1004225
disk	ram
pattern0	
the ssd is still slower than ram by orders of magnitude but it s quite reasonable to have a 50gb hash table on disk but not in ram unless you pay big money for big iron

1008671
post	get
pattern10	not more	pattern10	not more secure	pattern8	more secure	
post is not more secure than get as itâ s also send unencrypted

1008704
post	get
pattern7	better	pattern0	better	
yes post is better than get because post data is not usualy logged by a proxy or server but it is not secure

1010388
integer	unsigned
pattern7	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

1010388
int	chars
pattern7	
the unsigned chars would be converted to 152 as an int which is greater than 7

1010593
ant	maven
pattern10	pattern10	less reliable	pattern8	less reliable	
troubleshooting the build maven is less reliable than ant especially the non-core plugins

1011950
bazaar	git
pattern10	pattern10	
bazaar is more discoverable if you are given the tool wo any documentation any semi-competent user will be able to use bazaar that s not so true with git

1011950
bazaar	git
pattern7	easier	pattern7	
bazaar is easier to extend in an api way git is easier to extend in a unix way pipes

1014688
richfaces	icefaces
pattern0	better	
that said i found icefaces to be a useful product and much better than richfaces especially in terms of the quality of the documentation

1016512
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	better	
honestly though postgresql scales much better than mysql

1018142
vim	emacs
pattern8	
i m just looking for something a little more polished than vim or emacs but not quite as heavyweight as netbeans or eclipse

1018715
emacs	gedit
pattern4	
now on linux i still prefer gedit to the other options i ve tried with apologies to vi and emacs fans

1019594
getter	setter
pattern0	pattern0	
properties specially automatic properties in .net 3.5 are more concise than setter getter and less lines of code less code to maintain less bugs

1019808
multiplication	exponent
pattern7	larger	
as int exponent gets larger taking powers might be faster than multiplication

1019934
comparator	comparable
pattern2	
treeset uses comparator defined by comparable or compare defined by comparator

1020038
vim	emacs
pattern7	better	pattern0	better	
it is worth learning both because emacs is better than vim at editing certain languages and doing certain tasks and vice versa

1024985
photoshop	fireworks
pattern4	
i don t know either of them but i have always worked with fireworks for things as web design as seemingly opposed to a lot of people who prefer photoshop

1026810
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
pattern7	
an argumentnullexception would be misleading so argumentexception is a better fit

1027775
coalesce	isnull
pattern2	
i was playing around a little with some union selects with coalesce and isnull .

1027808
division	multiplication
pattern7	cheaper	pattern0	cheaper	
t is not very important as long as alpha is small otherwise you will run into some rather weird nyquist issues aliasing etc. and if you are working on a processor where multiplication is cheaper than division or fixed-point issues are important precalculate omega

1030688
post	get
pattern10	pattern10	more elegant	
i think using post is more elegant and has more options for further development than passing them via get

1032223
width	height
pattern7	
texture width or height is larger than the device supports

1032354
vmware	virtualbox
pattern4	
everyone seems to be suggesting virtualbox but in my opinion you can t beat vmware at the virtualization game

1034539
extjs	gxt
pattern0	more time	
i have worked pretty heavily with both flavors of the gwt extjs libraries though i ve spent more time with gxt recently

1034652
gprof	shark
pattern3	
regardless i d strongly recommend using shark instead of gprof - it s very easy to use and superior in pretty much every way to gprof - and doesn t require you to recompile your program

1035179
automake	autotools
pattern10	slightly more	pattern10	slightly more complicated	
in the case of autotools it is slightly more complicated because not everybody who compiles the software would need automake and autoconf installed only those that need to change the build system adding new files counts as changing the build system

1036076
int	chars
pattern0	
although they technically can contain more than one chars the endianness of the resulting int constant is implementation-defined and they re not what you want in this case

1037080
swt	swing
pattern2	
what criteria should i use to choose between swt and swing

1037130
swt	swing
pattern7	usually easier	
it can be hard to get the layuots exact the way you want in swt it s usually easier in swing

1037514
swt	swing
pattern2	
my criteria to choose between swt and swing

1037514
swt	swing
pattern4	
briefly after my swt eclipse rcp experience - on next project i would choose swing

1037514
swt	swing
pattern0	
it api seems for me easier than swt you haven t got to manage disposing components by hand to prevent memory leaks you adding component to panel instead of constructing components with parent panel information former is closer to my previous experience...etc. native look and feel you can get in swing too overall performance is enough good swt should be faster because it s using native components of backed os - but is the performance gain really big pro

1037788
coalesce	isnull	coalesce	nvl	isnull	nvl
pattern10	pattern10	more cross-compatible	pattern8	more cross-compatible	
coalesce is more cross-compatible than isnull or nvl it works on mssql oracle mysql derby et al.

1042989
innodb	myisam
pattern7	safer	
innodb is a safer acid compliant engine with some integrity features that myisam lacks

1043400
gif	png
pattern7	
for non-animated gif images a conversion to png8 should be painless and beneficial as png compresses much better

1047997
tolower	toupper
pattern10	pattern10	more efficient	
as a side note using toupper is more efficient than using tolower so toupper would be the way to go

1049679
getter	setter
pattern10	pattern10	
is this even possible for starters because this is about adding protocols to setter and a getter is much more easy like

1050080
bmp	png
pattern4	
textures use apple s own texture2d class from the samples bmp will work but i recommend png because of the platform optimizations

1050501
redmine	trac
pattern0	better	
we found redmine to be a better than trac simply because it is easier to use

1052188
dictionary	map
pattern3	
first regarding the dictionary class that class is considered obselete the documentation recommends using map instead

1053267
vb.net	vb6
pattern3	
however if your moving from vb6 then i d recommend learning vb.net or preferably c#

1056048
lisp	scheme
pattern4	
in that regard i d recommend scheme which is in my opinion more elegant than common lisp

1059847
ftp	telnet
pattern0	easier	
it is optimized for downloading larger files where the setup overhead is amortized over the size and number of downloads http is very light-weight you can communicate to an http server using telnet much easier than ftp especially before passive ftp and is designed around html -- the concept that in the course of your navigation you will be visiting many different servers and grabbing only a couple of files at a time from each

1063920
getter	setter
pattern10	pattern10	less restricted	
but then your setter is less restricted than your getter which is odd.

1066014
ubuntu	linux
pattern4	
if you are new to linux then i defiantly recommend ubuntu

1068152
freebsd	linux
pattern10	pattern10	
migrate to enterprise linux or freebsd postgres works much better on unix type systems mdash

1071887
richfaces	icefaces
pattern4	
you should be able to mix and match icefaces and richfaces just fine

1072917
ubuntu	linux
pattern4	
if you choose linux then i suggest going with ubuntu as that has one of the best automatic hardware configuration i have seen

1074018
button	checkbox
pattern10	pattern10	
for example tri-state checkbox aren t particularly intuitive and providing a drop-down or set of three radio button is more approchable for those less technically inclined

1075055
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
pattern3	
i would recommend using argumentexception or argumentnullexception for parameters passed to routines rather then local variables

1075277
bmp	png
pattern4	
also note that without compression also image size is just 30kb for rgb image and if you reduce size to 60x60 pixels image size would be only 10kb without any compression i.e you can use bmp images and if you want lesses sizer but lossless compression you can choose png

1077627
ant	maven
pattern7	usage lower	
maven usage is lower compared to ant but just how much lower is not really known

1078466
webkit	gecko
pattern7	stricter	pattern0	stricter	
webkit is stricter than gecko

1079716
icu	gettext
pattern3	
i would highly recommend using icu instead of gettext and the locale stuff offered by the standard library if you are developing a commercial application

1082128
cassini	iis
pattern0	slower	
for my webapp the integrated visual studio server cassini ist much slower than iis

1083732
webclient	webrequest
pattern8	pattern2	
or if you feel more comfortable with webclient i personnally prefer it over webrequest

1084126
gif	png
pattern0	better competition	
png images are always compressed lossless but their compression algorithm works better than competition gif

1090158
awt	swing
pattern8	more useful	
as far as when awt may be more useful than swing -

1092020
serializable	deserialization
pattern7	quicker	
the serializable seems quicker but deserialization much slower and the app is doing more deserializing than serializing

1092587
ant	maven
pattern3	
if you re just exporting from eclipse directly - i d recommend using ant or maven to get a repeatable build process not tied to the ide

1093097
mouseup	mousedown
pattern3	
value for right mouse button is 2 although also note that it recommends using mousedown or mouseup events rather than click

1093986
websphere	ibm
pattern4	
buy ibm websphere mq mqseries

1095291
mouse	keyboard
pattern4	
the entire taskpane loses keyboard focus to word s main window but retains mouse capture

1099669
awt	swing
pattern7	
imho the main reason that they didn t catch on is that they require tended to require too much skill and used awt swing which produces worse uis than what a designer with little programming skills could achieve with flash

1099695
udp	tcp
pattern0	less overhead	
most importantly you can easily supplement udp with some reliable delivery hand-shaking that s less overhead than tcp

1100412
union	distinct
pattern4	
i m sorry that i m not able to understand exactly what your issue is but i wonder if your issue stems from the fact that the union operator will eliminate duplicate rows kind of like a select distinct over the combined query

1100868
udp	tcp
pattern0	
some protocols are more complex because what s needed are some but not all of the features of tcp but more than what udp provides

1101716
cvs	svn
pattern0	better enviroment	
for all the reasons linked in the comment and elsewhere svn tends to be a much better enviroment than cvs or vss unless you have some weird requirements - so if you can successfully import your history and save the company money i wouldn t see why the bosses wouldn t go for it

1101923
vb.net	vb6
pattern10	tools more	pattern10	tools more	
however i ve noticed that running the vb6 tools is becoming more and more painful over time so i m looking at the possibility of migrating this code to vb.net 2008

1104571
int	chars
pattern4	
however you can easily get int representations of chars so you can compare chars like so

1105831
xfce	gnome
pattern7	much smaller	pattern0	smaller	
xfce runs much smaller than gnome and is full featured

1106588
getdate	dateadd
pattern4	
select dateadd dd ceiling datediff dd 1 1 09 getdate 14 14 1 1 09

1109951
int	boolean
pattern4	
we can mix and match boolean and int values in our designs obtaining an if then else that requires evaluating both branches simd style by evaluating cond then + 1 - cond else using 1 as true and 0 as false in cond so you can get away with using the built in arithmetic of your ring to make your circuits more shallow

1111015
free	malloc
pattern0	
now if you free some values on the heap and allocate more with malloc you may be given back some of that dirtied memory that you scribbed on earlier

1117074
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
pattern7	
i am writing an app based on uitabbarcontroller which has more than 10 viewcontrollers with corresponding uinavigationcontroller

1117426
nsexception	nserror
pattern10	much more	pattern10	much more robust	
aside from obejctive-c convention and best practices nserror is much more robust and flexibly than nsexception and allows the caller to effectively ignore the problem if they want to

1117688
division	multiplication
pattern10	much more	pattern10	much more complicated	pattern8	more complicated	
the cpu operation for float division is much more complicated than multiplication

1117702
division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
pattern0	pattern0	harder	
if you think back to grade school you ll recall that multiplication was harder than addition and division was harder than multiplication

1119713
distance	polygons
pattern7	
then i would simply check the edges of all blue polygons whose lower bound of distance is lower than the upper bound of minimal distance against all the edges of the red polygons

1120009
distance	polygons
pattern7	greater	
calculate the actual minimum distance and continue through the sorted list until the maximum distance between the polygons is greater than the minimum distance found so far

1122616
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
pattern10	pattern10	
however the transition from the initial touchesbegan event to the first touchesmoved is less obvious sometimes the device waits a while

1123182
gridview	repeater
pattern0	better decision	
a repeater might be a better decision than a gridview as they are friendlier for using custom layouts

1124819

1126681
codeigniter	cakephp
pattern4	
i would recommend codeigniter cakephp or zend framework

1128221
memcmp	strcmp
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
if you always keep track of the lengths of your strings you can compare lengths and use memcmp which is faster than strcmp

1129132
filtering	grouping
pattern4	
you can also filtering the display using the audiences functionality so that it only displays to a select grouping of users

1132284
ferret	sphinx
pattern4	
most of the articles compare ferret lucene to ultrasphinx or possibly thinking sphinx but none that talk about searchlogic

1135308
bazaar	git
pattern4	pattern2	
i choose bazaar over git mercurial coz bazaar is notifications are very well integrated in ubuntu

1135698
division	multiplication
pattern7	much faster	pattern0	faster	
integer multiplication is much faster than division

1137216
move	drag
pattern10	pattern10	
i use all the events for the drag operation so maybe the initial move is less laggy perceptually in this case

1139555
typedef	struct
pattern4	
for instance here is a regex which will match typedef of struct which point to a single name and may or may not have a pointer

1140056
equals	gethashcode
pattern2	
if you have written a class which implements its own equality that is different from reference equality then you are required to override gethashcode such that two objects that compare as equals have equals hash codes

1140923
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
mysql is more than capable of serving your needs as well as alex s suggestion of postgresql

1141264
client-side	server-side
pattern8	more valuable	
not all of the reasons given are necessarily valid but one important one is that unless you re google server-side cpu cycles are a lot more valuable than client-side cycles so it s easier to have the client compile optimize what is quite often dynamically generated html javascript rather than the server

1143578
gif	png
pattern10	pattern10	
this properly means if the file is an image of gif or jpeg or png and is less than that size

1144224
margin	height
pattern0	greater	
in conjunction with a negative margin equal to or greater than the height of the top and bottom borders if any to further remove the element

1144979

pattern0	better	
fyi postgresql scales better than mysql on multi-processor overlapping requests from a review i was reading a few months back sorry no link

1145134
post	get
pattern7	safer	pattern0	safer	
and apart from common misleading information where post is safer than get it is not

1146843
serializable	deserialization
pattern2	
you should have static xml data that can be used to compare against serializable output and to use as input data for deserialization

1147960
subtract	add
pattern0	
this garentees that while a can be issued to the pipeline every cycle it will have a higher latency than an add subtract circuit

1148222
versioning	upgrade
pattern7	
you have to make sure your local sql instance is exactly at the same build versioning versioning like the hosting provider otherwise your local sql may upgrade the database structure and you ll be unable to restore it back on the hosting provider or you ll be unable to restore in on your local server if your versioning is earlier than the host s

1148980
powerpc	i386
pattern0	
be aware that there is more than just powerpc and i386 although these are the safest architectures to choose for a universal binary

1149288
postgresql	mysql
pattern3	
if you want to go open source i would recommend using postgresql instead of mysql

1156709
disk	ram
pattern7	bigger	pattern0	bigger	
disk is bigger than ram

1158483
merb	ruby-on-rails
pattern4	pattern2	
matz himself prefers merb over ruby-on-rails 2 because ruby-on-rails create a dsl on top of ruby which is really against the ruby philosophy

1159503
width	height
pattern4	
you have to compare width and height in this method

1161907
pascal	delphi
pattern0	
you probably don t want to go back to anything earlier than delphi 3 but some pascal programming books can be helpful

1162378
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	pattern10	more tuning	
postgresql requires more tuning than mysql to achieve optimal performance

1162395
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	already slower	pattern0	slower	
postgresql is already slower than mysql up to a certain point it is actually faster when you have a ridiculously large database

1163358
gif	png
pattern4	pattern2	
and unless you require animation i d always recommend png over gif

1165594
for-loop	loops
pattern0	faster	
even if the hypothesis of the while loops being faster than the for-loop were true and it s not the loops you d had to change optimize wouldn t be the outer ones but the inner ones because those are executed more times

1168451
division	multiplication
pattern0	
shifting bits left and right is apparently faster than multiplication and division operations on most maybe even all cpus if you happen to be using a power of 2

1168616
division	multiplication
pattern0	faster	
this can be a major clock-cycle saver since multiplication is often much faster than a division operation

1168889
equals	compareto
pattern2	pattern0	
compareto compares values and returns an int which tells if the values compare less than equals or greater than

1168957
cpython	ironpython
pattern7	probably better	
cpython probably has better ide support at present than ironpython - so this may be a factor in the choosing of one over the other

1169717
hash	md5
pattern4	
for a programming exercise i designed for myself and for use in a pretty non-secure system later on i m trying to compare md5 hash

1172158
portrait	landscape
pattern4	
right-click the white space area of the design surface choose report properties page setup choose landscape portrait

1172381
sorting	filtering
pattern7	cheaper	pattern0	cheaper	
if your author field is selective and sorting is cheaper than filtering

1172817
maven	m2e
pattern4	
to enable m2e on an existing project right-click on it in the package explorer view then select maven - enable dependency management this will add the maven builder to the .project file and the classpath container to the .classpath file

1174754
width	height
pattern0	
if the player is moving towards one of the edges of the screen and bounds.x y + 30 is less than the height of the current map width it moves the origin so that the player is still centered and displayed on the map

1176994
freemarker	velocity
pattern4	
velocity did not give me any problems but having had some experience with freemarker i would probably pick freemarker now

1177246
width	height
pattern7	
the fact that you have height length and width makes it harder than a simple knapsack problem

1177422
stateless	stateful
pattern10	pattern10	more appropriate	pattern8	more appropriate	
do you have any situation where stateful is more appropriate than stateless

1177930
cassini	iis
pattern7	
cassini is not actually iis it is more of an emulation

1179563
fdt	swc
pattern4	
we build the majority of our flash projects in this manner or sort of in reverse where we build the assets in flash professional output a swc of the graphics and use that swc in a better development environment we prefer fdt

1180648
ienumerable	icollection
pattern7	
the second way i thought is testing for icollection instead of ienumerable since ienumerable is more of a potential collection than an actual one

1180732
gridview	datalist
pattern7	
from what you re describing perhaps a gridview or datalist is a better option

1181839
width	height
pattern0	
you re probably being hit by the borders or margins on the body element -- you re asking for document.width height effectively but putting it in an element with a border so the total width of the page canvas.width+ left right borders is then bigger than the width height you originally asked for

1181840
disk	ram
pattern0	
if the working set is smaller than your ram it should not be disk bound

1185123
haskell	sml
pattern4	pattern2	
i would probably recommend sml over haskell if you feel like trying on a functional language for the first time

1186715
pop-up	dialog
pattern7	
when you press print in calendar print preview the print dialog that pop-up has more options cross browsers

1188910
mantis	bugzilla
pattern8	more complete	
since mantis is a bit more complete than bugzilla when it comes to features you could define separate issues with custom field for your tasks

1190551
ant	maven
pattern7	better	pattern0	better tool	
while i personally think maven is a better tool than ant in the long run our experience will make maven3 a better tool than maven2

1190656
setinterval	settimeout
pattern7	
this is the proper solution don t ever rely on passing a string as a function when using settimeout or setinterval it s slower because it has to be evaluated and it just isn t right

1191410
folder	directory
pattern0	
if you think your users technical users will be happier with directory use that but otherwise i would go with folder

1192000
superclass	subclassing
pattern7	
say all instance variables are 32-bit ints for simplicity if the superclass has 3 and the subclassing adds 2 more then each instance of the subclassing will allocate 5 x 4 20 bytes -- 8 for its own instance variables plus 12 for the instance variables of the superclass

1192094
ubuntu	centos
pattern10	pattern10	
i don t know if it s activated by default on centos but it might be considering it is on ubuntu which is less entreprise oriented

1192201
disk	ram
pattern7	usually faster	
but becuase reading from ram is usually faster than from other kind of memory storage divice os copy the program from disk on ram and start executing program from there

1194866
freebsd	opensolaris
pattern0	
it s easy much easier than installing freebsd or god forbid opensolaris pretty straightforward and the perl and python will be 64 bits out of the box and part of default installation

1195244
union	distinct
pattern4	
select distinct and union intersect except no longer always produce sorted output tom

1197324
perl	tcl
pattern0	simpler	
it is written in tcl which is a language somewhat simpler than perl but broadly in the same family and not difficult to learn

1197869
lwjgl	jogl
pattern7	
you are mixing libraries and levels of libraries jogl and lwjgl are both pretty thin wrappers around opengl iirc lwjgl has more wrappers for openal audio

1198169
profiler	yourkit
pattern4	
i personally would recommend yourkit java profiler i ve found it much more user-friendly than tptp and while i haven t tested it it should work on os x

1198433
metaphone	soundex
pattern2	
if you implement it yourself you should look into the metaphone or double metaphone algorithms i d recommend them over soundex which is not nearly as good at this type of task to store phoenetic representations of all your words

1200232
gif	png
pattern7	much better	pattern0	better	pattern10	pattern10	
png compresses much better than gif and allows more colors at the same time

1201337
memcpy	memmove
pattern0	slower	
this means that memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy as it cannot make the same assumptions

1202296
imagemagick	im4java
pattern4	
if having imagemagick installed on your maschine is an option i recommend im4java

1204121
disk	ram
pattern0	faster	
loosely speaking ram is 1000 or more times faster than disk and cpu is faster still

1204968
client-side	server-side
pattern8	more powerful	
my guess is that server-side implementation may turn out to be more flexible and more powerful than client-side as i can add functionality to the server easily as long as the client understands it

1207519
maven	cobertura	cobertura	emma
pattern7	better	pattern7	
i find cobertura and emma to be largely interchangeable in terms of coverage checking just that cobertura has a better maven plugin and emma has a better eclipse plugin in my opinion

1208256
vim	emacs
pattern3	
for someone just starting to program would you recommend using vim emacs or should you use some ide

1211881
post	get
pattern10	method faster	pattern10	method faster	
it is said that get method is faster than post but i don t know why is it

1214032
versioning	upgrade
pattern7	easier	
does anyone know if the upcoming v8 versioning is easier to upgrade or if its easier to upgrade from a certain previous versioning compared to earlier versioning

1216039
punctuation	words
pattern4	
for matching and # tags i d suggest using the w metapattern matches words characters - so it ll match digits and letters but not whitespace punctuation

1217184
vim	emacs
pattern10	pattern10	
available on almost every platform true of vi vim too of course - whether gui- or text-based java ides are available on most platforms too but only in gui mode and are significantly larger and need to be installed separately whereas emacs is generally more widely available - bsd nix linux mac systems

1217263
nfa	dfa
pattern0	smaller	
in fact because you are eliminating the redundancy of epsilon transitions many simple dfa s actually get smaller than the nfa they represent but there is simply no way to guarantee that

1218185
subtraction	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
pattern7	
subtraction is similar using subtraction of the base type and borrow instead of carry multiplication can be done with repeated additions very slow or cross-products faster and division is trickier but can be done by shifting and subtraction of the numbers involved the long division you would have learned as a kid

1221973
post	get
pattern4	
to get the new post you select post which don t have a matching relation in that table for the current user

1223015
emacs	aquamacs
pattern4	
if you have a mac i would recommend aquamacs which is a beginner-friendly version of gnu-emacs and therefore has all the power of emacs while still offering standard copy-paste save and other features including normal file dialogs and windows

1223031
lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern0	pattern0	
it s much much faster than beautifulsoup and it even handles broken html better than beautifulsoup their claim to fame - lxml just isn t as vocal about it

1230528
width	height
pattern0	
so how can i determine a smaller width and height to which i will resize the watermark image something much less than 150 width 20 height so that it will appear still as a watermark and wont mask the image completely

1233693
google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	slower	pattern0	slower	
firefox is slower than google-chrome which boats one of the highest javascript engines a modified version of webkit

i m sure there s a work around to use get for emails but the alternative post is much more easier and doesn t require any hacks to get around

1243627
code128	code39
pattern7	better	pattern0	better	
data density in code128 is better than code39 - since it gets mentioned that often in other replies

1244820
jqgrid	datatables
pattern4	
i am currently using datatables because it is easy to implement on existing html but would prefer jqgrid s theme support and hooks

1245368
lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern4	pattern2	
ian bicking agrees and prefers lxml over beautifulsoup

1247801
innodb	myisam
pattern7	better	
innodb supports better locking semantics so if there will be occasional or frequent writes or if you want better data integrity i d suggest starting there and then benchmarking myisam later if you can t hit your performance targets

1248100
keydown	keyup
pattern0	
i finally figured out that keypress has a better compatibility than keydown or keyup on linux platform

and web2py is more lightweight than django rails whatever on pretty much all counts

1252126
jsf	seam
pattern10	pattern10	more general	
jsf is a web ui framework whereas seam is a more general web application framework that integrates not just jsf but conversational contexts workflow jbpm and object persistance preferably ejb3

1253366
jsf	seam
pattern7	certainly far better	
seam certainly is far better than using plain jsf refer the link posted by damo a couple of answers above

1253883
gcov	lcov

pattern10	pattern10	
though if you are going to eventually fill a substantial portion of the map the dictionary method is much less efficient

1258708
strcpy	strncpy
pattern7	not safer	pattern0	safer	
strncpy is not safer than strcpy it just trades one type of bugs with another

1258971
strcpy	strncpy
pattern8	
my personal opinion is that it is vastly more useful than strncpy and strcpy

1261364
rss	feed
pattern0	
i am scraping a list of rss feed by using curl - look at the xml from the rss feed that s giving the problem there s more than one feed so it s possible for some feed to be right and for the feed that are wrong to be wrong in different ways

1261500
serializable	deserialization
pattern0	
you can use the javascriptconverter class when you need more control over the serializable and deserialization process

pattern7	slower	pattern0	slower	
from my experience webrick is slower than mongrel is slower than thin

1268518
ienumerable	icollection
pattern8	more generic	
secondly i did not use ienumerable because it is more generic than icollection and does not even have simple properties like count

1270393
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
postgresql supports some more security features than mysql for example integration with gssapi or kerberos for logins last i checked mysql didn t have these

1270393
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	fewer	
traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but they are both doing very well on that

1271575
apache	nginx
pattern7	pattern0	less memory	
nginx uses less memory than apache given the size of your setup i would definitely recommend that

1273705
tapestry	wicket
pattern10	pattern10	
wicket s goal is to support static typing to the fullest extent whereas tapestry is more about saving lines of code

1275337

redmine was written to be a better trac than trac

1278273
opera	firefox
pattern0	slower	
for example i ve read that opera and ie will fix framerates slower than firefox

1283195
xdebug	xhprof
pattern0	lighter	
thanks mikushi for the comment another possibility that i haven t used much is the the xhprof extension it also helps with profiling can generate callgraphs -- but is lighter than xdebug which mean you should be able to install it on a production server

1284491
children	parent
pattern4	
any ways if you want to know what sql to use checkout select parent record with all children in sql

1287034
richtextbox	textblock
pattern0	simpler	
good advice but in the end i decided a bindable textblock was more useful and simpler than a richtextbox

1287890

but if you do decide on using a framework from my experience of having used stripes struts1 and jsf myfaces recommend stripes without hesitation

1295425
mouse	keyboard
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
i prefer the command line because i have a shell window open in the source anyway to run builds and tests and along with file name completion using the keyboard is faster than using the mouse for me

1295977
lxml	celementtree
pattern2	
i have no recent experience as to how pyrxp today compares with lxml or celementtree

1298305
feedback	review
pattern4	
firstly do not be discouraged or disheartened when something doesn t work or when something breaks or if you receive negative feedback the proverbial it sucks review

1298464
swt	swing
pattern0	faster	
is swt faster than swing

1301328
textmate	textwrangler
pattern4	
open a good text editor i d recommend textmate but the free textwrangler or vi or nano will do too and open

1302592
phpmyadmin	heidisql
pattern4	pattern2	
since you re on windows i can highly recommend heidisql over phpmyadmin for working with mysql

1305848
inherited	properties
pattern4	
if using tag properties isn t in principle i m recommend inherited treeitem

1306207
jboss	weblogic
pattern4	pattern10	pattern10	pattern10	pattern10	
regarding weblogic and jboss i d prefer jboss weblogic is more complex

1309433
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic
pattern4	
if money was not part of the equation and i had an employer that insisted on spending money that wasn t mine i d still choose weblogic over websphere or jboss or glassfish or anything else on the market

1309608
bazaar	svn
pattern10	pattern10	
you can not have multiple physical branches under one repository with mercurial like svn or bazaar but the good thing about mercurial imho is the easy user interface that is really straightforward and the performance that is faster than bazaar although bazaar is getting faster and faster in their recent release

1310736
git-svn	svn2git
pattern3	
a simple git-svn will reproduce the svn branches actually simple directory with copies in it so i would recommend using svn2git and git2svn

1311516
udp	tcp-ip
pattern4	
network cards and routers have a tendency to prefer tcp-ip packages above udp

1311580
lxml	elementtree
pattern10	
elementtree is included in the standard library but lxml is faster

1311750
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	pattern10	more widely	
mysql is more widely supported and a little easier to use but postgresql has some very cool features and functionality that s worth taking a gander at

1311780
post	get
pattern10	pattern10	more secure	pattern8	more secure	
there appears to be a common mis-conception that post is more secure than get simply because it seems more obvious how to get a browser to manipulate the post variable

1312826
for-loop	loops
pattern7	
getimagedata has a for-loop i realised that each index in loops is called more than once

1315178
apache	nginx
pattern7	much faster	pattern0	faster	
for example nginx is much faster than apache

1315231
jboss	weblogic
pattern4	
personally i would choose jboss community version over weblogic server because it s free you know like in freedom

1316114
disk	ram
pattern0	
i ve written my own protocol since i need it to be lightweight and i m sending files that may be bigger than the ram available on the device â â therefore the files are being streamed straight from the network to disk

1316308
button	checkbox	rss	feed
pattern4	
the user will select checkbox from a datagrid of rss feed on my site and when pressing a button the heavy lifting will happen

1316464
postgresql	mysql
pattern3	
otherwise i recommend using postgresql over mysql since it is more standards compliant and has a nicer license

1316580
ubuntu	debian
pattern0	more resources	
ubuntu heavily relies on python scripting and generally consumes more resources than debian

1317327
gedit	aptana
pattern4	
scratch be as close to just a text-editor as possible i use gedit for everything and i d recommend aptana in a heart-beat

1317710
mvp	presenter
pattern10	pattern10	
to summarise the differences controllers in the mvc have more control over the ui and handle events while a presenter in the mvp is more passive and just presents information through the ui

1318324
innodb	myisam
pattern0	better	
3 mysqlhotcopy inly works on myisam tables and in most applications you are better off with innodb

1319300
16-bit	64bit
pattern0	
the standard only requires that int be larger than 16-bit and no larger than a long so it s not 64bit safe

1320978
erlang	ocaml
pattern2	
ocaml is a great language -- one of my favorites -- but if your interest is distributed systems than i d recommend going with erlang which is head and shoulders ahead of the other fp languages with regards to distributed systems although there s an offshoot of ocaml called jocaml which has some interesting aspects

1322011
client-side	server-side
pattern10	javascript much more	pattern10	javascript much more common	
that said client-side javascript is much more common and if you were using server-side javascript you would probably know the answer to your question

1322771
momentjs	datejs
pattern7	
nowadays datejs is outdated and not maintained so use momentjs which is much better as pointed out by t.j

1324161
getdate	dateadd
pattern4	
select dateadd yy datediff yy -1 getdate 0

1324674
hash	md5
pattern0	
if you need a surrogate primary key using an auto_increment field is better than an md5 hash because it is fewer bytes of data and database backends optimize for integer primary keys

1325027
onchange	onfocus	onchange	onblur	onfocus	onblur
pattern4	
select onblur onchange onfocus

1325420
unsigned	short
pattern0	
if you really want all 8 bytes in a single number then you need to read more than the unsigned short

1331150
inherited	subclassing
pattern10	pattern10	more accurately	
since ireadwrite implements ireadonly ireadwrite is said to be a subclassing of ireadonly although subclassing is more accurately used to describe a class which inherited a base class rather then implements an interface--for the sake of simplicity they are very nearly the same concept

1332466
a-star	dijkstra
pattern2	
my question is how does a-star compare with dijkstra

1337085
portrait	landscape
pattern10	pattern10	
it will adapt the video frame height to landscape mode and it will play the video in the landscape mode whether or not a portrait mode is more suitable

1338597
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	much more	pattern10	much more complete	
postgresql is much more complete and solid and will much better support complex queries and their optimization while mysql may shine in terms of retrieval speed for extremely simple queries

1340207
nunit	mstest
pattern0	better	
if you have a full version of visual studio 2008 rather than the express edition it integrates the inbuilt mstest much better than nunit does and cruise control also supports mstest

1346820
vim	emacs
pattern4	
a number of people at the company i currently intern at prefer emacs or vim

1347625
perforce	cvs
pattern4	
it s probably easier to learn from scratch than cvs but i don t have experience that way. if someone needed a centralized source-control system i would recommend perforce as long as they had the resources to license it

1347760
interpreted-language	compiled-language
pattern10	pattern10	less common	
this is usually seen in dynamic interpreted-language but is less common in compiled-language

1347793
ant	maven
pattern7	better	pattern0	better	
this question is similar in nature to whether ant is better than maven or c# better than java

1348077
division	addition	division	modulo	addition	modulo
pattern0	faster	
performing addition on this slightly larger type will pretty much always be faster than doing division or modulo on the type itself

1348077
division	addition	division	modulo	addition	modulo
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
for example on most 32 bit systems 64-bit addition is faster than 32-bit division modulo

1348958
int	double
pattern7	much wider	
the range of double is much wider than the range of int or long

1352497
xrange	enumerate
pattern0	slower	
why is enumerate slower than xrange + lst i

1352521
xrange	enumerate
pattern7	microscopically faster	pattern0	faster	
if you measure properly you ll see there s essentially no difference enumerate is microscopically faster than xrange in this example but well within noise

1354946
hide	scrolltop	hide	show
pattern7	pattern0	
when scrolltop is less than 300 show the div otherwise hide it

1356125
disk	ram
pattern0	slower	
another option is to spend a bit of cash on a 15000 rpm disk or a ssd solid state disk although that ll be slower than a ram disk

1359270
innodb	myisam
pattern0	slower	
however innodb tends to be slower as myisam

1360435
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
pattern8	
ie is less performant than safari google-chrome and firefox when it comes to js - but have you really developed a page that is unusable in ie with js turned on

1361077
wordpress	joomla
pattern10	pattern10	more popular	pattern8	more popular	
i seem to be getting the impression that wordpress is more popular than joomla nowadays

1361527
uiview	subviews
pattern0	smaller frame	
i want to add a uiview of smaller frame as subviews to parental view but i am not getting the needed

1362458
int	chars
pattern7	bigger	pattern0	bigger	
since an int is bigger than a chars casting unsigned chars to signed int still retains the chars s original value

1363067
prepare	execute
pattern10	statement	pattern10	statement	
any execute statement becomes prepare sooner or later it need to be parsed optimized compiled and then execute

1363582
gridview	repeater
pattern7	
instead of using a gridview i d use a repeater which has less overhead and lets you write more compact html for a smaller payload to the client bind the master idatareader to that repeater

1363818
fontfamily	font-size
pattern3	
i recommend doing fontfamily helvetica neue helvetica arial font-size 20pt and setting the font weight to the lowest possible 100

1365849
textmate	gedit
pattern0	
i tried a few ides on ubuntu and it just didn t seem right - gedit is lightweight and i actually enjoy using it more than textmate on os x

1368849
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	pattern10	
i haven t chosen a db yet so if mysql or postgresql is better in some way over the other please provide your preference and perhaps why if you have time

1369608
xfce	gnome
pattern4	
don t uninstall gnome just select xfce in the graphical login screen

1370945
clang	llvm
pattern4	
if i choose llvm gcc 4.2 or clang llvm when i hit breakpoint local symbols are not available and gdb says no symbol self in current context if i try to print self or any other local symbol

1371569
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	pattern0	
other databases where it was about the same for a transactional database as oracle sql server where were better than mysql postgresql etc

1371975
cpu	processors
pattern7	indeed slower	
the cpu is indeed slower on sparc 1.2ghz and as answered by one of the sun s engineers t2 is usualy 3 times slower for single-threaded application than modern intel processors

1372564
bazaar	git
pattern0	slower	
a lot of articles about bazaar will tell you it is a lot slower than git or mercurial

1373072
width	height
pattern7	
another option might be to scale to maximum width and then check if the scaled height is greater then the maximum allowed height and if so scale by height or vice versa

1373566
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	pattern10	pattern10	
some people were saying that postgresql is better for security purposes whereas mysql is becoming more feature rich.

1373625
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
postgresql is faster than mysql s innodb

1374448
http.sys	httplistener
pattern8	more customizable	
and also don t forget - http.sys much more customizable than httplistener

1374694
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	fewer	
and postgresql has fewer experienced administrators than the big databases and mysql which i believe contributes to the reputation

1378686
equals	gethashcode
pattern2	
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

1378686
equals	gethashcode
pattern2	
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

1378796
equals	gethashcode
pattern2	
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

1379436
profiling	instrumentation
pattern8	
personally i find shark more useful than instrumentation for profiling my code and finding out what s taking up time when it matters

1380144
client-side	server-side
pattern7	
a lot of the solutions i ve seen are client-side - i think a server-side solution makes more sense for my needs since i can give feedback to the user if the javascript is invalid and only save it on the server once it s clean

1382010
ssl	https
pattern4	
i m not sure about iis 6 but in iis 7 you select the site and go to bindings and click add select https it will automaticaly chose port 443 and then chose your ssl cerificate

1382636
x86	mips
pattern0	easier	
do any of the other common architectures like arm mips sparc etc have an easier than x86 instruction set

1383228
ubuntu	linux
pattern0	easier other	
although if you aren t interested in using adobe cs you can use ubuntu distro which is easier than other linux distro and quiet popular so you won t have any problem finding solution

1386038
lambda	first-class-functions
pattern4	
first-class-functions functional match lambda libraries

1386828
range	max
pattern0	
the range function produces a list of integers from 0 less than the max len s by step 3

1390035
pexpect	subprocess
pattern3	
to avoid the many problems that can always arise with buffering for tasks such as getting the subprocess s output to the main process in real time i always recommend using pexpect for all non-windows platform wexpect on windows instead of subprocess when such tasks are desired

1397047
cvs	svn
pattern0	better	
if you use svn then it still okay because svn handles binary files much better than cvs

1397081
subtraction	addition
pattern10	pattern10	
re-order your script so the subtraction test is timed first then the addition and suddenly addition becomes the faster operation again

1399024
gradle	ivy	ant	maven
pattern8	
if you are looking for a more flexible build than ant or maven but at the same time utilize maven or ivy repositories you should consider gradle

1400465
int	double
pattern10	pattern10	more complex	
i am guessing this is because modifying a double is a more complex operation than modifying an int

1404965
vb6	vba
pattern0	
all the .net methods i tried were slower than vba and vb6 but the best ones were able to use the xll interface which gave better results than the automation interface

1405922
charindex	substr
pattern4	
select substr substr field1 field2 field3 charindex field1 field2 field3 + 1 999 1 charindex substr field1 field2 field3 charindex field1 field2 field3 + 1 999 -1

1405994
width	height
pattern7	greater	pattern0	greater	
the width is greater than the height so our calculations are

1408183
nfa	dfa
pattern0	larger	
if it can be practically determinized this give you a dfa that can be exponentially larger than the nfa then by all means do that

1414236
floyd-warshall	dijkstra
pattern10	pattern10	
short answer dijkstra s is your best bet if you want just a few shortest paths and the floyd-warshall algorithm is better if you want to find the shortest paths between every pair of nodes

1414531
migrate	upgrade
pattern4	
vss sucks migrate to a real scm microsoft will probably help you seamlessly upgrade to tfs which doesn t have this problem

1415328
union	distinct
pattern2	
i have tried the following select with union distinct but the problem is that the limit 0 10 applies to the whole result set

1418229
quicksort	mergesort
pattern4	
be aware of the real-world impact of the so-called hidden constants too - for instance the classic quicksort algorithm is o n 2 in the worst case and o n log n on average whereas mergesort is o n log n in the worst case but quicksort will outperform mergesort in practice

1421320
equals	icomparable
pattern0	
icomparable is an interface that defines that two instances of the implementing class can be seen as greater than less than or equals to one another

1422299
macvim	textmate
pattern4	
i would recommend textmate as above and also macvim if possible

1423595
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
pattern10	also more	pattern10	also more efficient	
objectdatasource also allows for more efficient paging than a simple sqldatasource i m assuming that s what you re using

1424117
apache	nginx
pattern0	
i switched from apache to nginx to save memory especially to serve static file i seem to be using about 75 less memory with nginx

1427158
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern0	less memory	
sortedlist tkey tvalue uses less memory than sorteddictionary tkey

1427191
mp3	wav
pattern7	file much easier	
either way applying gain and or attenuation to time-domain sample data as in a wav file is much easier than trying to apply these effects to frequency-domain data as in an mp3 file

1429767
maven	m2e
pattern7	steeper	
maven 2 has a steeper learning curve but provides a much richer set of functionality for building your projects and eclipse integration through m2e or iam

1430434
vim	emacs
pattern0	faster	
and i tend to think that after a moderate amount of customisation of either one vim will still start up faster than emacs

1430939
vim	emacs
pattern10	pattern10	more steps	
cut and paste in vim takes more steps than in emacs iirc

1432559
hash	salt
pattern4	
compare salt hash input with stored data to check a password

1433315
vim	emacs
pattern4	
even though i use emacs all day every day and love it unless you intend to spend a lot of time in the program you choose i would pick vim

1433909
128bit	64bit
pattern0	larger	
i ll just add that if the 128bit number is prime or has a prime factor larger than 64bit then there will be no solution to your problem

1434405
128bit	64bit
pattern0	larger	pattern0	
and i ll just add to previous comment if 128bit number has prime factor larger than 64bit then it certainly has a factor less than 64bit

1436154
udp	mtu
pattern0	bigger	
they are easily generated for udp simply by making the datagram bigger than the mtu

1436197
udp	mtu
pattern0	larger	
if you send a udp datagram larger than the mtu it will be fragmented

1437749
apache	nginx
pattern0	
as for apache vs nginx in regards to your django app it seems that mod_python is indeed faster than nginx lighty + fastcgi but that s no surprise because cgi regardless of any speed ups is still slow

1439284
googletest	gmock
pattern4	
i personally recommend googletest and gmock

1440450
uitableview	uipickerview
pattern10	much more	pattern10	much more customizable	pattern8	more customizable	
uitableview is much more customizable than uipickerview

1440679
entity-relationship	diagram
pattern0	
entity-relationship diagram are simpler than uml diagram

1441330
cpython	ironpython
pattern8	more comfortable	
my understanding was it was written in vanilla python cpython but if you are more comfortable with ironpython it shouldn t be hard to translate

1442201
django	web2py	django	turbogears	turbogears	web2py
pattern0	
web2py may be young but the mailing list has 2000 messages month which is similar to django and far more than turbogears

1442901
udp	tcp
pattern10	connectionless more	pattern10	connectionless more relevant	pattern8	more relevant here	
a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance so it goes that udp connectionless is more relevant here than tcp connection-oriented

1443062
ssl	https
pattern0	
if i try to add more than 1 ssl binding i get the error at least one other site is using the same https binding and the binding is configured with a different certificate ...

1444213
jdom	dom4j
pattern4	
i prefer dom4j personally but i don t mind other apis such as jdom or even xpp3 which has xpath support

1444549
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
pattern10	pattern10	
as others have said illegalargumentexception is an option but i think nullpointerexception is more communicative

1445294
int	double
pattern4	
i guess the question is then why does the compiler choose int instead of double in the first example

1445339
antialiasing	transparent
pattern7	much better	
and it seems working fine antialiasing is much better however this beats the idea of a transparent background in the process

1447805
versioning	upgrade
pattern7	newer	
running pear -v gives me versioning 1.7.2 when i run pear upgrade pear it says my versioning is newer than the current noe which is 1.9.0 if ran pear upgrade -f pear to force an upgrade it downloads the files and installs successfully but i still have versioning 1.7.2 and cannot install phpunit

1448859
pugixml	rapidxml
pattern0	
quoting rapidxml s author i would like to thank arseny kapoulkine for his work on pugixml which was an inspiration for this project and 5 - 30 faster than pugixml the fastest xml parser i know of he had tested against version 0.3 of pugixml which has reached recently version 0.42

1450896
allocator	stl
pattern4	
so my question is has anybody used this kind of allocator scheme in combination with stl would it just completely blow stl apart as i suspect

1451062
opera	firefox
pattern7	even worse	
the problem with this code is that it doesn t quite work on firefox and works even worse on opera

1453713
vtk	paraview
pattern2	
to see some of what vtk can do i recommend checking out paraview

1457281
fread	textscan
pattern8	more powerful	
then for reading i find textscan to be more powerful than fread fscanf the differences between them all are summarized here

1458750
jvisualvm	jstat
pattern10	pattern10	
the tooling provided with the jdk jstat jconsole jvisualvm is much more reliable

1459923
salt	md5
pattern8	more fancy	
decode the passwords yourself and re-encode them with a salt i recommend something a little more fancy than md5

1461340
width	height
pattern4	
i m required to write a function to overload the operator to compare width height and colour

1461675
int	chars
pattern0	larger	
i believe it was one of the early pdp machines in which a chars was larger than an int

1462618
client-side	server-side
pattern2	
use unique security token for each connection with client save security token on server-side session and compare with client-side stored value

1463254
clang	llvm
pattern7	pattern7	
clang llvm has much better separation between the parser and the other parts of the compiler chain

1464230
128bit	64bit
pattern0	
perhaps 128bit distributed-system internet-wide pointers but no more than 64bit in a system call or perhaps even a legacy 32-bit limit

1464476
free	malloc
pattern7	
most likely malloc allocates more memory and puts so-called guard values that happen to contain null bytes or it puts some metadata to be used by free later and this metadata happens to contain a null byte right at that position

1465066
richfaces	icefaces
pattern7	
richfaces looks more good option to work than icefaces bcoz it has inbuilt support its easy to learn its long time support guarantee for seam+richfaces combination

1467029
sorting	filtering
pattern8	
this may be optimal indeed if the table access to retrieve the values missing in the index is more expensive than filtering and sorting

1467079
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	better	pattern0	better	
if you need spatial data capabilities postgis with postgresql is better than mysql

1468030
spaces	delimiter
pattern0	field	
it checks for one or more spaces as field delimiter and also tabs

1468941
xunit.net	fsunit
pattern0	more natural oo	
i d rather use fsunit or fstest to write tests in f# it feels more natural than oo xunit.net style tests

1468983
cxxtest	cppunit
pattern4	
i prefer cxxtest as i find it easier not to have to register my test cases explicitly as you have to do with cppunit

1469813
apache	lighttpd
pattern4	
i don t have thorough benchmarks but i m personally convinced that just like lighttpd can outperform apache on simpler tasks mod_wsgi gives apache the laurel when it comes to serving python web apps

1469813
apache	nginx
pattern0	better	
nginx with its own mod_wsgi seems to perform even better than apache but hey you didn t ask about that

1470836
firefox	safari
pattern4	
unfortunately unless you re happy with supporting only specific browsers ie7 win safari firefox 3.5 there s no pure css solution to your problem

1471285
int	chars
pattern4	pattern2	
compare chars with chars not int

1477008
pascal	delphi
pattern10	pattern10	
while the delphi pascal syntax is more text oriented begin end or and so the underscores look a bit strange as you don t expect them there

1477841
django	web2py
pattern10	pattern10	more heavy	
to answer klochner both seems quite popular but ruby is not a language that i am familiar with and django seems more heavy and complex to me than web2py

1478633
folder	dir
pattern4	
iterate over every file in the client javascript folder that match dir command and for f are totally unneeded here though and only complicate things especially when file names contain spaces commas and the like

1480214
imperative	declarative
pattern7	
while neither the declarative nor imperative approach is really better than the other both have their merits

1481132
scheme	prolog
pattern10	pattern10	
in scheme or prolog it s often less than a page of code

1481174
int	double
pattern2	
because 1.0 has type double and compiler really doesn t know what type to choose between int and float so it asks you to give it a hint

1481257
getdate	dateadd
pattern4	
e.g select dateadd hh -1 getdate

1487773
nunit	mstest
pattern4	
mstest comparisons and the developer community seems to pretty much overwhelmingly choose nunit

1490225
getter	setter
pattern3	
do you recommend using getter and setter or accessing the member variables directly

1494219
post	get
pattern8	more compact	
is post more compact than get since get requests have to be url-encoded

1494266
post	get
pattern7	
post has one more letter in it than get so it s less compact

1497705
getter	setter
pattern8	
what you ll need to do than is to complete the javadoc comments for the classes and methods that are more sophisticated than getter setter or default constructors

1499590
width	height
pattern7	bigger	pattern7	
edit actually you resize the one that is the biggest if width is bigger you resize that and if height is bigger then you resize that

1500490
maven	m2e
pattern3	
i recommend using maven eclipse and m2e

1500539
post	get
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	pattern0	less secure	
since post is better suited to transfer large amounts of data or difficult formatted data it is the established standard for submitting forms but it is in no way safer unsafer or more less secure than get requests

1501406
range	max
pattern0	
if requestedsize bigger than max size of the range

1504631
children	parent
pattern0	
basically a given branch of the tree may be found under more than one parent branch but wherever it is found it has the same children

1514244
udp	tcp
pattern0	faster	pattern4	
theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control

1516459
yacc	bison
pattern0	pattern0	
this is sometimes easier than yacc bison and usually more intuitive

1517591
ant	maven
pattern4	
instead you should use an external dependency management system such as maven or ivy ivy works if you use ant but maven is both a build tool and a dependency management system so i would recommend maven if you can

1522558
min	max
pattern4	
select min p1.start_time max p2.end_time p1.partition p2.partition

1525321
addition	multiplication
pattern7	higher	pattern0	higher precedence	
just because multiplication has a higher precedence than addition doesn t mean we need to perform all multiplication in the expression before doing any addition

1526793
stateless	stateful
pattern10	pattern10	
i think stateful client stateless server makes you more aware of the amount of data that is transported back and forth between tires

1526793
stateless	stateful
pattern4	
anyhow gwt and many other modern toolkits silverlight talking to wcf seems to prefer stateful client stateless server due to scaleability issues

1527161
quicksort	mergesort
pattern0	better	
why is quicksort better than mergesort

1527533
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
installing a real database server is fairly easy so i d recommend sql server express as others have or even mysql or postgresql whatever is easier to set up

1527694
portrait	landscape
pattern4	
when user selects landscape printing from print setup it is printer in portrait again anyway

1527832
min	max
pattern0	pattern0	
the code will also record the edge cases so if the the function produces a value greater than the max or less than the min you.will.know.about.it

1529588
subclass	abstract-class
pattern0	
but unless you re using such excellent testing practices and patterns i d be suspicious of abstractions that have a single concrete example -- interfaces with just one implementation no less than abstract-class with just one concrete subclass

1529981
portrait	landscape
pattern4	
but this code give portrait even if i select landscape from setup

1535713
emacs	aquamacs
pattern7	
you may also want to look at aquamacs which currently has a beta for the latest emacs and offers somewhat better os x integration than the default build

1541739
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
pattern0	longer	
the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

1545598
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
mysql has some advantages like easy replication but postgresql is generally nicer to work with

1546912
postgresql	mysql
pattern8	more simple	
postgresql license bsd is undoubtedly more simple than mysql s

1546912
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
note i m not saying mysql s license won t work for you but postgresql is definitely simpler

1550588
codeigniter	yii
pattern4	
i don t recommend codeigniter as great and powerful framework but it s simple for beginners and they can learn a lot from it personally i m in favor of symfony and yii

1552911
simulation	sampling
pattern0	
by decoupling simulation from rendering you can render at a higher frequency than your simulation does for sampling

1554431
client-side	server-side
pattern2	
so honestly just have them all in one request you have a server-side race condition with client-side latency

1555170
gridview	repeater
pattern4	
for lists i d put hidden fields inside whatever list mechanic you prefer gridview repeater manually building tables yuk

1560687
quicksort	mergesort
pattern10	pattern10	
quicksort is a partitioning sorting algorithm you might refer to mergesort which also is a partitioning sorting algorithm the biggest difference is probably the speed quicksort is faster even though both of them are o n log n

1563301
lxml	elementtree
pattern0	better	
lxml -- 100x better than elementtree

1566777
kerberos	ntlm
pattern2	
yes negotiate will pick between kerberos and ntlm but this is a one time choice

1567102
for-loop	loops
pattern10	pattern10	
don t use a for-loop when a while loops is more appropriate

1567157
width	margin
pattern0	greater	
give the sample text div a right margin greater than the width of the right-floated element

1567753
for-loop	loops
pattern7	
i guess you can just manually check the condition within your for-loop continue if it s not met but a while loops makes more sense imo

1570729
x86	64bit
pattern7	pattern7	
longer answer 64bit x86 has more general purpose registers which gives the compiler more of an opportunity to optimize local variables into registers for faster access

1577097
boost	stl
pattern10	pattern10	more modern	
while boost is more modern c++ it also harder to use for non trivial tasks - and without a modern c++ experience and deep stl knowledge it is difficult to use correctly

1577549
post	put
pattern0	more secure http	
http put isn t inherently any more secure than http post if you re allowing the uploaded files to be exceuted on your server

1578512
cvs	svn
pattern7	pattern7	
i suspect the continued prevalence of cvs svn is much more to do with inertia than anything else

1579077
fossil	git
pattern4	
i d recommend git msysgit on windows mercurial tortoisehg makes a great explorer addin and fossil as an awesome lightweight alternative

1580034
cvs	svn
pattern0	easier	
part of the point of svn was to make the use of branches and merging much easier than in cvs

1581034
udp	tcp
pattern0	pattern0	faster	
at my company we have found memory mapped files to be much faster than loopback tcp ip for communication on the same box so i m assuming it would be faster than udp too

1581820
ienumerable	ienumerator
pattern7	
even though this is supported by c# via ienumerator ienumerable there is a better idiom foreach

1585115
getter	setter
pattern0	
on the other hand you may very well have legitimate reasons to have a bunch of properties that are no more than getter and setter

1585305
hash	md5
pattern0	
yes sha1 is a better hash than md5

1588866
gtk	drawingarea
pattern7	pattern0	
so if the gtk scrolledwindow is smaller than the gtk drawingarea inside it the scrolled window should change to scrollable - but the problem is that it does not work

1589215
cvs	svn
pattern0	better	
svn in much better than cvs and have lot of mature tools for every platform

1591315
hash	salt
pattern7	
in storing hash passwords is a common practice to add a nonce or a salt and is marginally true that this salt is better kept secret

1592749
ant	maven
pattern4	pattern2	
i prefer ant over maven personally

1595704
subtraction	addition
pattern0	
i can t use anything more than basic addition and subtraction and string parsing functions

1597598
post	get
pattern8	more secure	pattern7	request relatively harder	
for example post request are considered more secure than get request as creating a post request is relatively harder than creating a get request

1598764
client-side	server-side
pattern0	faster	
while not really a console skulpt.org runs python code client-side with no plugins or anything which makes it a lot faster than a server-side prompt

1603119
firefox	safari
pattern4	
this actually works fine on mac win firefox safari but on ie6 and ie8 only the first element grabbed by the selector displays the desired behavior

1603644
haskell	sml
pattern0	
i haven t read the paper on edison but if it s nothing more than the haskell implementation of purely functional data structures doesn t it make more sense to port the sml code that s in the book thesis

1618019
vim	emacs
pattern3	
i don t know about emacs but i would recommend learning vim for a beginner in a heartbeat

1618687
nsurl	nsdata
pattern10	pattern10	
1 it seems loading the sound file through nsdata rather than nsurl works faster later in playing

1618687
wav	caf
pattern0	better	
2 caf seems a little better than wav but not much

1618906
quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	
one can implement a version of quicksort for a single-linked list but normally this is only interesting as a puzzle since mergesort is much easier to implement and works equally well or better for sorting linked lists

1624744
disk	ram
pattern7	
in addition jemalloc tries to optimise for cache locality since the act of fetching data from ram is much slower than using data already in the cpu caches no different in concept to the difference between fast fetching from ram versus slow fetching from disk

1627072
antialiasing	transparent
pattern4	
the way i fixed it was to open up the png in gimp choose the fuzzy select tool set the threshold to 150 check antialiasing uncheck feather edges check select transparent areas

1627212
antialiasing	transparent
pattern4	
note on my fuzzy select tool my gimp settings were check antialiasing uncheck feather edges check select transparent areas uncheck sample merged and select by composite

1627531
webstorm	aptana
pattern0	better	
if you re focussing on pure client code then i find webstorm to be an excellent javascript html ide - even better than aptana

1628230
post	get
pattern7	
if you have the ajax use get rather than post this is simpler then you can test the response by just viewing the page with the appropriate query string

1628241
mp3	wav
pattern0	better	
if you ask if a uncompressed wav which contains pcm data is better than mp3 then yes but the question sometimes is how much this better really matters to the human ear and how much postprocessing you have to perform on that data

1630987
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	way more	pattern10	way more useful	
explain in postgresql is way more useful than in mysql

1633894
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	pattern2	
if i had to support a huge number users on a reasonably simple application and had the team to build a heavily partitioned and replicated database with eventual consistency i d pick mysql over postgresql for the low level data storage building block

1635130
int	chars
pattern4	
i m using strcmp to compare chars arrays in c++ but i get the following error for every occurrence of strcmp error invalid conversion from int to const chars followed by error initializing argument 2 of int strcmp const chars const chars

1637626
gridview	repeater
pattern0	
not necessarily better than the repeater suggestion but another option is to use a gridview control and a datatable data structure

1638861
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
pattern4	
i personally prefer git but some people find svn simpler to use and some people like mercuiral bazaar or darcs

1640244
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
pattern0	better	
i like the monodevelop ide even better than sharpdevelop but i m not sold on installing and using mono s compiler just yet nor do i know if it can even handle the latest vb.net c# language features

1641091
free	malloc
pattern4	
you also have to ensure that you do not destroy free the old block if the malloc fails - you just return 0

1643009
division	multiplication
pattern7	generally slower	pattern0	slower	
the tostring should be slower than parse since division is generally slower than multiplication

1643537
int	chars
pattern7	
i assumed the version using chars variables would run slower than that using int s due to the conversions but on my 64bit dual core ii system the int version is slower

1644071
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
pattern4	
i ve used this in ff2 ff3 ff3.5 safari 4 win opera 9+ google-chrome 2 google-chrome 3 and they all work

1645112
calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
pattern3	
your core graphics surface should be cleared to all zeroes before you render to it so i recommend using calloc instead of malloc or adding a memset after the malloc

1645672
bazaar	svn
pattern7	much more	
bazaar seems much more like svn with branches just being separate directories so maybe not

1647078
innodb	myisam
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads

1647114
innodb	myisam
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
ok there are some cases where myisam is faster than innodb but rarely enough that it s worth putting up with the lack of acid-compliance

1648539
lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern10	pattern10	more suitable	
beautifulsoup is more suitable for html parsing than lxml

1648619
nexus	artifactory
pattern2	
i can clearly state that while nexus is very simple and operative though i sometimes have problems with the installation process on ubuntu its free version cannot compete with artifactory s community free edition

1650091
int	double
pattern4	
so the question what s the best way to compare double and int

1653709
int	chars
pattern0	more sizeof	
senderid and sequencenumber are both int and will take up more than sizeof chars bytes on most architectures

1654239
int	chars
pattern0	larger	
as mentioned in other posts senderid and sequencenumber are both of type int which is likely to be larger than chars so these values will be truncated

1657538
websphere	ibm
pattern4	
so to me the choices are actually sun s jvm unless i ve to run some websphere stuff in which case i d choose ibm j9

1658665
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	pattern2	
i would recommend postgresql over mysql

1663230
int	boolean
pattern0	
obviously a string can hold far more information than an int or boolean

1664063
typedef	typename
pattern0	
they describe intent better than built-in typename do typedef int errcode

1667148
atomic	interlocked
pattern0	
but consider this it s literally impossible to do any better than interlocked operations for cross-process communication with atomic updates and no locks are held

1669936
bazaar	perforce	bazaar	git
pattern7	
you may also want to take a look at why git is better than x a site that attempts to convince you of the superiority of git over mercurial bazaar subversion and perforce

1670651
ironruby	ironpython
pattern10	much more	pattern10	much more mature	pattern0	better performance	
however as things stand right now ironpython is much more mature and has much better performance than ironruby so you may prefer to use that

1670683
vxworks	qnx
pattern4	
get a real-time linux distro or grab vxworks or qnx - something purpose-built for io intensive requirements

1672672
children	parent
pattern7	
if an element has only 1 child then the child is placed below the parent on the same x co-ordinate if the parent has more than one child then the children are placed with equal spaces apart and the parent needs to be in the middle above the children to two equal length lines join to both the children from the parent

1674236
unicode	ucs
pattern7	pattern7	
according to wikipedia the bmp of the ucs has 65536 characters the latest version of unicode contains more than 107000 characters and the ucs has more than one million code points

1678683
post	get
pattern7	lower	
generally when passing lots of data to the server to be processed or stored using post is a good idea since get has a lower limit than that of post

1678727
post	get
pattern7	better	pattern0	better	
when post is better than get

1678727
post	get
pattern7	better	pattern0	better	
when get is better than post

1679092
width	height
pattern7	greater	pattern0	greater	
whenever i resize an image to a desired size there whe width is greater than the height the proportions get screwed

1685542
int	chars
pattern7	id only lower	
it takes a pathname and an arbitrary int id uses only lower 8 bits so a chars is usually used and generates a probably unique key_t

1686834
junit	testng
pattern10	pattern10	more direct	pattern7	
junit is more direct and simpel to use if you start to learn java testng has more features but maybe is more complex

1687594
serializable	deserialization
pattern7	pattern7	
serializable deserialization becomes a bigger bottleneck when you scale out to a session server or use sql server to manage session state

1688299
implements	extends
pattern0	
if your goal is education and not ease of implementation you would probably be better served by extends the uicomponent class and using the treeitemrenderer code as a reference to create a class that implements the same interfaces

1691050
int	chars
pattern7	much wider	
normally range of int is much wider than that of chars

1694508
interpreted-language	compiled-language
pattern0	slower	
this is a good question but should be formulated a little different in my opinion for example why are interpreted-language slower than compiled-language

1696724
int	double
pattern0	smaller range	
int can hold a smaller range than double

1702833
min	max
pattern7	value greater	pattern0	greater	
in addition i noticed that you also have a possible exceptional scenario for your full constructor when the min value is greater than the max value

1705367
junit	testng
pattern3	
third i d recommend using junit 4.4 or better yet the testng idiom - annotations

1706281
strcpy	strncpy
pattern4	
usually when people use strncpy they forget to do this which is why i recommend strcpy

1706506
disk	ram
pattern0	slower	
disk io - even ssd - is many orders of magnitude slower than the ram that the hashing is going though

1709198
min	max
pattern4	
if this is the case the query could be modified to choose max min etc.

1710652
codeigniter	kohana
pattern8	less bloated	
but if codeigniter has a bit too much bloat for you maybe you can try kohana which is a bit less bloated than codeigniter started as a fork

1712946
hex	binary
pattern7	somewhat more	pattern0	more readable	
hex is somewhat more readable than binary if i happen to be loading a data dump in a text editor etc

1713083
hex	binary
pattern4	
the biggest problem we ran into was constantly annoyingly having binary data show up in the console everytime you type select you hear a million beeps and you have to always do select hex or insert unhex which is a pain

1715710
margin	height
pattern7	
the issue is that without the margin on the bottom the page height is shorter then the window bounds thus your footer div ends and the body of the page bleeds through

1716751
arp	tcp
pattern7	message shorter	pattern0	shorter	
it would appear from your question that the period of the tcp message is shorter than the arp refresh time

1717152
postgresql	mysql
pattern8	more restrictive	
postgresql is a bit more restrictive than mysql

1719752
ceil	floor
pattern0	greater	
the floor times the ceil are greater than the floor xy...that s very much possible

1722180
innodb	myisam
pattern3	
you should use innodb in such scenarios and most mysql gurus recommend using innodb by default anyway because it s considered more generally reliable than myisam despite being slower under some use cases

1722910
bottle	turbogears
pattern4	
i strongly recommend turbogears or bottle

1723888
aptana	rubymine
pattern4	
if you need an ide i personally recommend rubymine although aptana is a worthy offering as well and free

1725214
width	height
pattern0	bigger original	
if set true then it might increase the width or height if the given width and height are bigger than original width and height

1725935
int	chars
pattern0	
from portability viewpoint chars cannot be smaller than 8 bits and nothing can be smaller than chars so if a given c implementation has an unsigned 8-bit int type it s going to be chars

1725999
versioning	upgrade
pattern4	
strongly recommend upgrade your versioning of memcached

1726749
webclient	webrequest
pattern10	pattern10	more access	
update i ve created a webhelper class that takes the place of webclient but provides more access to the necessary features of the underlying webrequest

1727859
gdi	directwrite	gdi	direct2d	directwrite	direct2d
pattern4	
i recommend direct2d and directwrite as you get high-quality rendering that s also ridiculously fast compared to either gdi or anything done in the .net space

1729502
phpunit	simpletest
pattern4	
i would recommend phpunit for your testing as it seems to be the most complete package for php imho many are fans of simpletest as well .

1729806
innodb	myisam
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
am i right that innodb is better for frequent concurrent updates and inserts than myisam

1729806
innodb	myisam
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
we know that myisam is faster than innodb when we don t have many concurrent updates inserts

1730317
innodb	myisam
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
it is a massive over simplification in some cases and plain wrong in others to say we know that myisam is faster than innodb

1730317
innodb	myisam
pattern2	
if you ve tuned innodb properly for your server and are running proper server-grade hardware innodb should be able to compete with myisam on most queries excluding full table scans but you re not doing many of those right

1730317
innodb	myisam
pattern7	much slower	
if you find that innodb is much slower for inserts updates bear in mind that it offers a much better level of durability - if you tune it for approximately the same durability as myisam then you ll see good performance hopefully

1731950
tinyint	boolean
pattern0	more space	
does tinyint in mysql take up more space than boolean

1732320
ant	maven
pattern0	younger tool	
first maven is a much younger tool than ant or make so you have to expect that its going to take time to get to the maturity level of those applications

1734609
gtk	cairo
pattern10	pattern10	more common	
with gtk it s more common to use cairo already mentioned by jeff foster

1734992
fseek	ftell
pattern7	pattern7	
unless there is specific reason to do it fopen fseek ftell is a better idea portable staying within the c standard library

1735122
division	multiplication
pattern10	pattern10	less expensive	pattern8	less expensive	
multiplication is less expensive than division so

1737240
interpreted-language	compiled-language
pattern0	slower	
fact is that interpreted-language like php are always slower than a compiled-language

1737864
pylons	turbogears
pattern4	
others prefer turbogears and or pylons maybe bfg maybe grok maybe zope maybe plone

1738477
appkit	nsapplication
pattern7	
the documentation for deactivate method for nsapplication says that i shouldn t call this method directly since appkit knows better how to deactivate stuff

1741448
ftp	telnet
pattern10	protocol more	pattern10	protocol more complex	
ftp protocol is more complex than http or telnet form example

1744404
post	get
pattern7	request marginally less	pattern0	less secure	
the get request is marginally less secure than the post request

1744404
post	get
pattern10	slightly less	pattern10	slightly less susceptible	
the only scenario in which post is slightly less susceptible is that many websites that arenâ t under the attackerâ s control say a third-party forum allow embedding arbitrary images allowing the attacker to inject an arbitrary get request but prevent all ways of injecting an arbitary post request whether automatic or manual

1745229
int	chars
pattern0	bigger	
because int can become arbitrarily large in clojure the resulting number becomes bigger with every chars thanks to the

1746488
apache	nginx
pattern4	
for several reasons i would pick nginx as a reversed proxy instead of apache and configure it accordingly

1749841
onchange	onkeydown
pattern10	
onkeydown although it wouldn t work for pasted data where onchange is probably better

1751849
minimum	max
pattern0	
so i use the formula you have in your second query to first calculate the bounds -- the four lat long values at the extremes of the allowed radius then take those bounds and do a simple query to find the matches within them less than the max lat long more than the minimum lat long

1752722
post	get
pattern10	pattern10	pattern10	pattern10	
you would allow post get post is more secure to the php file and would then run an http post get request from c#

1753093
min	max
pattern0	pattern0	
if i is less than min and more than max

1753093
min	max
pattern7	pattern0	
if min is less than is and is is less than max

1753801
width	height
pattern7	greater	
when working with a landscape photo the photo width is greater than the photo height

1753801
width	height
pattern7	greater	pattern0	greater	
when working with a portrait photo the height is greater than the width

1757465
hash	hmac
pattern7	better	
hmac is better than a plain hash because it is not vulnerable to hash length extension attacks

1758133
width	height
pattern4	
var jscommand string window.open win height 200 width 300 toolbar no scrollbars yes

1760867
public	protected
pattern3	
personally i prefer putting public methods first followed by protected methods following by private methods

1761942
wordpress	joomla
pattern7	
me too don t get any advantages for joomla it s big system and it just as good as wordpress for regular projects just wordpress is much simplier

1765712
spaces	delimiter
pattern4	
i prefer spaces delimiter since it works nice with unix text tools and with excel

1766649
width	height
pattern7	
unless the screen height is less than 580px or width less than 930px

1767979
boost	stl
pattern0	
maybe this would have all been better with boost but i m still learning stl and didn t go that way

1768222
pull	push
pattern10	pattern10	more scalable	pattern8	more scalable	
i have found that pull is more scalable than push

1768520
perforce	svn
pattern10	pattern10	more advanced	
perforce offers more advanced branching and merging capabilities than svn

1769414
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	pattern10	more sql	
postgresql is more sql compliant than mysql

1769850
min	max
pattern4	
otherwise you couldn t have results for things like select min col1 max col1 .

1772728
post	get
pattern7	better	
sometimes get is a better option in those read-only scenarios because it makes your url scheme richer and avoids these sort of post warnings

1772948
joptionpane	jdialog
pattern0	
usually when people want more flexibility than joptionpane offers it s basically a bunch of static factories for a few dialogs they write their own dialogs using jdialog

1774364
haskell	ocaml
pattern7	
haskell has more momentum these days but there are plenty of good parsing libraries for ocaml as well including the peg parser generator aurochs menhir and the glr parser generator dypgen

1774377
innodb	myisam
pattern0	faster	
myisam inserts are going to be faster than innodb so if you re logging data and retrieving it later that will be a win

1774432
integer	unsigned
pattern7	
find the closest 32bit unsigned integer that is larger than x

1776455
haskell	ocaml
pattern7	higher	
haskell has higher level bindings to llvm than ocaml the haskell ones provide some interesting type safety guarantees and haskell has by far more libraries to use 1700 packages on making it easier to glue together components

1779317
apache	lighttpd
pattern3	
long polling that s the way i ll choose using lighttpd under apache to load static files images css js etc.. and just for this type of long-polling

1780489
rational-numbers	zero
pattern0	greater	
is there any way in haskell to get the constant that is the largest and smallest possible positive rational-numbers greater than zero that can be represented by doubles

1785109
imperative	declarative
pattern7	
also one benefit of declarative programming is that purpose is usually more easily understood from reading the code whereas imperative gives you finer control over execution

1786428
hash	md5
pattern0	higher strength	
it is likely that you could do an sha hash of 100kb in well less than 10 second though and though sha-1 is still theoretically flawed it is of higher strength than md5

1786996
vim	emacs
pattern10	far more	pattern10	far more likely	
on today s machines that s a non-issue but if you ever find yourself dealing with older gear it s my experience that vim is far more likely to work on a wonky terminal than emacs is

1790008
put	get
pattern4	
just to get closer to the solution write a javahelp.bat or .cmd if you prefer put it on the path and call that from ruby

1790277
mouseleave	mouseenter
pattern7	
i suggest using hover this instead of binding to mouseenter and mouseleave looks cleaner to me

1790470
jdom	dom4j	jdom	xom	dom4j	xom
pattern4	
there are at least 3 different ways to implement the xml-wrapping part sax xslt and xml libraries like jdom dom4j and xom--i prefer xom but any of them will work

1792196
int	chars
pattern4	
public int compare chars x chars y

1792370
postgresql	greenplum
pattern0	better	
greenplum and other similar solutions should work a bit better than postgresql depending on your data sets and use cases

1795117
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	generally better	pattern0	better	pattern7	
now i m not sure if i d say postgresql is generally better than mysql -- there are certainly things that mysql does much better and so it certainly has its uses -- but these are a few things i absolutely love about it

1798503
google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	
in ie6 7 8 and in google-chrome text has proper size but in firefox it s bigger

1798628
strsplit	substr
pattern7	
usually you use strsplit to break a string in parts but with substr there s an easier solution for your problem

1802010
pascal	delphi
pattern10	pattern10	
there is the mono project that aims to allow .net code to run on mac and linux but between the two delphi being pascal is somewhat more portable

1803139
memcached	apc
pattern4	
you want to compare apc key-value store vs memcached right

1803139
memcached	apc
pattern7	
memcached has more functionality but is intended for distributed environments while apc works on single servers only

1804853
union	distinct
pattern0	slower	
keep in mind that union will return a distinct list - duplicates will be removed but it will perform slower than using union all which will not remove duplicates

1808814
memcached	apc
pattern0	slower	
memcached around 4-5 times slower than apc but run as a single process that can be touched everywhere in my environment

1808990
aptana	radrails
pattern4	
the rails framework is a great setup for doing web development and i would highly recommend radrails as your ide or it s base aptana

1810501
strtol	atoi
pattern4	
also atoi doesn t provide any way to detect errors so prefer strtol and similar functions

1811607
profiling	instrumentation
pattern3	
i recommend using instrumentation performance profiling tool that is bundled with xcode and the developer tools

1812152
free	realloc
pattern7	
i know that memory blocks and reallocation are implementation so specific but when there are contiguous free blocks of memory realloc works better than a new buffer allocation and memory copy

1813665
postgresql	mysql
pattern2	
i would still recommend checking out postgresql and postgis in comparison to mysql if you intend to do more complex queries in the foreseeable future

1814118
equals	compareto
pattern0	
per the page i linked to compareto returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object.

1816406
ant	maven
pattern4	
but instead of ant i d choose maven because it will require less work imho and it has a built-in feature called profiles that is perfect to manage environment specific stuff like here

1817949
apache-fop	xhtml
pattern3	
given that xhtml is an extension from xml i d recommend using apache-fop

1819246
hide	show
pattern4	
right-click the cell with the comment and choose show hide comment might do the trick

1819483
phpunit	simpletest
pattern0	
is there any easy php testing framework and may be simpler than simpletest and not command line based like phpunit

1823057
junit	testng
pattern10	pattern10	more flexible	
if you have to do a lot of this honestly testng is more flexible but you can absolutely get it done in junit

1825371
udp	tcp
pattern4	
udp makes sense if you want to make your stream multicast otherwise i would prefer tcp because it is more reliable

1825484
memcached	apc
pattern0	faster	
a quick googling says that apc is 5 times faster than memcached

1825484
memcached	apc
pattern0	faster	
my experience say that apc is nearly 7-8 times faster than memcached

1825484
memcached	apc
pattern0	less feature	
apc have less feature than memcached and is easly to use and optimize but this depends on your needs

1826194
subtraction	addition
pattern8	
for the sake of completeness i would like to mention another less powerful algorithm with addition subtraction

1826333
union	distinct
pattern4	
a union essentially performs a select distinct so that it can remove duplicate records

1827397
colorbox	simplemodal
pattern4	
simplemodal has a similar function but i much prefer colorbox s implementation and documentation otherwise i d use the latter

1829072
disk	ram
pattern0	slower	
as disk i o is orders of magnitude slower than ram i o this can cause a very significant difference in query execution times

1830829
width	height	portrait	landscape
pattern0	larger	pattern0	larger	
such that a landscape image would have an ideal height of 300 or slightly larger with a width 400 and a portrait image would have an ideal width of 400 or slightly larger with a height 300

1835023
mako	genshi
pattern2	
or you can choose between mako genshi jinja2 or whatever you like for your templates

1835614
union	distinct
pattern4	
also if you use union all it will be faster if the result you want is all of the rows as opposed to distinct rows and you can still grab distinct rows by selecting distinct from the view if you need it sometimes

1838114
notepad++	scite
pattern0	more lightweight	
by the way if you like minimalistic approach there is also scite editor which is my personal preference for doing small bits of code it s even more lightweight than notepad++

1839558
button	checkbox
pattern4	
as i have check box in gridview if i dont select any one checkbox and if i click asp button then i have to show message to user to select checkbox

1839854
udp	tftp
pattern7	
tftp is used because it uses udp which is simpler and had a smaller footprint than a full tcp-based ftp server

1840568
division	multiplication
pattern7	cheaper	pattern0	cheaper	
if a remains the same and b is changing say if your code is in a loop and it s clear that a does not change between two iterations for instance because it s a const variable then the original version can execute faster because multiplication is cheaper than division assuming the compiler moves the computation of 1 .

1840999
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	
the biggest reason why i recommend postgresql to people who have more oracle mssql experience as opposed to mysql is that the sql syntaxes and general feel of the database engine match pretty closely

1841772
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	slower	
i ve found that postgresql is in my expirience is slower as mysql

1841996
gif	png
pattern7	shim smaller	
a 8-bit png shim is smaller than the same dimension 1 pixel gif and everything will still work as planned

1846862
floyd-warshall	dijkstra
pattern7	
the floyd-warshall algorithm has a worst case performance of o |v| 3 where as dijkstra s has a worse case performance of o |e| + |v|log |v|

1847205
switching	screens
pattern4	
the advantage of this dual-natured solution is that the tabbed approach will work the way you want it to work for the majority of cases but for users with say two screens or who prefer switching between browser tabs they will still have the flexibility to work in multi-window mode

1849303
pascal	delphi
pattern4	
i prefer delphi pascal but i can read other languages if the example isn t overly complex

1849455
cassini	iis
pattern0	better performance	
while iis does give us better performance than cassini we would still like to be able to hit f5 to run our application from within visual studio

1849962
post	get
pattern8	more performant	
ajax calls using get are more performant than post according to yahoo

1850196
post	get
pattern10	pattern10	more performant	
get is more performant as it is idempotent and does not contain a message body where as post does

1852321
width	height
pattern0	
however this does not take into account the space taken by the notification bar or window decorations so in reality you have less space than width times height

1853219
quicksort	heapsort
pattern0	worse	
however quicksort s worst-case performance is significantly worse than heapsort s is

1855222
int	chars
pattern0	faster	
running the same test on linux with gcc similarly pegs int and long as similar and both faster than chars although the difference is less pronounced

1856019
lxml	html5lib	lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup
pattern4	
out of these i would recommend lxml html5lib and beautifulsoup

1859322
maven	m2e
pattern4	
i recommend m2e plugin for eclipse maven integration

1859872
cpython	ironpython
pattern4	
performance measurements of jython ironpython and cpython show that both jython and ironpython outperform cpython for some cases with large datasets

1860622
notepad	textpad
pattern8	more advanced	
as it happens my choice is textpad but just about anything which is more advanced than notepad ought to be able to do this

1860743
post	get
pattern7	much smaller	pattern0	smaller	
you ll hit problems with larger submissions and file-uploads as the size limit for a get is much smaller than a post

1870710
photoshop	fireworks
pattern8	more familiar	
i have fireworks 8 as well as photoshop cs3 on my windows pc but i m more familiar with fireworks

1871301
jquery	jqtransform
pattern3	
yes i would also recommend using jquery a very nice plugin is the jqtransform plugin

1872424
google-chrome	firefox
pattern3	
we recommend using google-chrome download here or mozilla firefox download here

1872552
versioning	upgrade
pattern7	newer	
these locations will convert when they go to windows 7 perhaps or because the application they use internally is upgrade and needs the newer browser versioning

1874031
apache	lighttpd
pattern4	
i prefer apache 2.2 however lighttpd can also be deployed if it offers a feature for the implementation

1874682
maven	m2e
pattern4	
once you do that open up the console view and select maven console you should see m2e printing out log messages detailing the index download

1879340
listview	gridview
pattern10	pattern10	more lightweight	
regarding comparison between gridview and listview my experience is that listview is more lightweight as compared to gridview

1880342
gif	png
pattern4	pattern2	
i would recommend gif over png because there are some issues with color profiles in webbrowsers and pngs

1884878
firefox	safari
pattern4	
overflow-x and overflow-y are supported by ie5+ win firefox 1.5+ mozilla 1.8+ and safari 3+

1887931
zoo	xts
pattern10	pattern10	
xts extends this further but zoo is a better starting point

1889564
georss	kml
pattern4	
the amount of data will vary depending on whether you choose kml or json or georss but if you end up with 20 bytes per line segment that would take 50 seconds to fetch on a 1 megabit broadband connection

1892208
inherited	subclassing
pattern0	
this example is a bit looser than the inherited model provided by languages such as java -- an animal instance can have any behaviour at all rather than one of a specific set of behaviours depending on its subclassing

1892562
hindi	tamil	hindi	french
pattern2	
i have a doubt is it possible to give text other than english in my latest project i need to support hindi tamil and french so if user selects language as hindi or tamil or french so what ever value the user is giving in the textbox it must be displayed in the corresponding language selected

1896687
disk	ram
pattern7	not larger	pattern0	larger	pattern0	
edit true the file on disk is not larger than ram but the in-memory representation can easily become much larger than available ram

1896889
setinterval	settimeout
pattern7	
you may want to consider using jquery timers instead which abstracts away many of the ugly details of settimeout setinterval and makes them easier to use in your code for things like what you are describing

1897818
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
pattern4	
if you really mean unix and not linux i would recommend solaris eclipse does run on solaris and it s much easier to understand than aix

1897910
r-tree	quadtree
pattern2	
your r-tree approach is the best approach i know of that s the approach i would choose over quadtree b+ trees or bsp trees as r-tree seem convenient to build in your case

1898944
udp	tcp
pattern8	more reliable	
what i have thought of so far is that tcp is going to be more reliable than udp and in rmi corba we want network reliability

1900794
floating-point	integer
pattern0	faster	
depending on context floating-point code may be as fast as or faster than integer code or it may be four times slower

1902994
min	max
pattern4	
write a loop that goes through every element and compares min max values with your arguments

1905090
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
pattern7	far easier	pattern0	easier	
boxlayout is far easier than gridbaglayout because you don t have to learn how to specify constraints

1906226
udp	tcp
pattern2	
then you have to choose between udp and tcp

1907934
addition	multiplication
pattern10	pattern10	more expensive	pattern8	more expensive	
since multiplication is more expensive than addition you want to let the machine paralleliz it as much as possible so saving your stalls for the addition means you spend less time waiting in the addition loop than you would in the multiplication loop

1907942
xslt	xquery
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	pattern10	pattern10	
as for whether to use xslt or xquery the proof is in the pudding xslt is better at transforms and xquery is better at queries

1908733
xslt	xquery
pattern10	pattern10	
the flwr syntax of xquery is quite intuitive if you have an sql back-ground imo xslt is the more powerful language when dealing with one input one output situations especially if the output will not be xml

1908876
xslt	xquery
pattern10	pattern10	more strongly	
unless you are using the static typing feature xquery is no more strongly typed than xslt

1910089
vbscript	jscript
pattern0	simpler nicer	pattern0	nicer	
asp with jscript is 100 times better cleaner simpler nicer than vbscript and makes my job a joy rather than a vbscript head ache

1910542
integer	fractions
pattern7	
that means that the 16 upper bits of a glfixed represents the integer part and the fractions is the lower 16 bits divided by 65536

1917713
division	multiplication
pattern7	far easier	
multiplication is far easier and faster for a cpu to do than division

1920516
free	malloc
pattern7	bigger	
here is a solution which encapsulates the call to malloc allocates a bigger buffer for alignment purpose and stores the original allocated address just before the aligned buffer for a later call to free

1922064
lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern10	no longer	pattern10	no longer actively	
for starters beautifulsoup is no longer actively maintained and the author even recommends alternatives such as lxml

1922486
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	not less	pattern10	not less	
mysql is not less complicated that postgresql -- they re the same thing

1924122
ienumerable	ilist
pattern3	
if your method could return either an ilist or an ienumerable prefer returning ilist

1924856
getdate	dateadd
pattern4	
select dateadd dd 0 datediff dd 0 getdate

1925238
min	max
pattern4	
the easy option is to use group by and select min max for all other fields

1926885
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	bigger	
b use indexes - postgresql has bigger repertoar of indexes then mysql so use it - there are gist gin indexes

1930483
udp	tcp
pattern10	windowing more	pattern10	windowing more expensive	
tcp windowing is more expensive than raw udp but if you use udp to go faster and add a custom loss-recovery or seqno ack resend manager then that may slow you down again

1931833
eurekalog	madexcept
pattern4	
how would you compare madexcept to eurekalog as an exception handler for your delphi application

1932229
hex	binary
pattern4	
i ve used both otool and otx to disassemble various binaries and i ve found the easiest way to edit them is to figure out what the assembly of the new code i want is using nasm or similar then just use a hex editor i prefer hex fiend on the binary file

1933827
quicksort	heapsort	heapsort	in-place
pattern0	
heapsort can sort in-place and doesn t have the worst case quadratic behavior but on average is slower than quicksort in most cases

1935145
int	double
pattern0	more space ints-an	
you re getting the outofmemory because if you declare int 1000 the memory is allocated immediately additionally double take up more space than ints-an int representation will also save you space

1935264
memcached	apc
pattern10	pattern10	
memcached is more along the lines of a distributed object cache vs something like apc or xcache which stores php bytecode in memory so you avoid having to parse it each time

1935264
memcached	apc
pattern7	
memcached has more overhead since you have to use a tcp connection to access it versus just a function call for apc xcache shared objects

1935994
phpunit	simpletest
pattern4	
if you prefer phpunit i think you can fairly easily use simpletest s browser from within phpunit

1936043
redmine	trac
pattern7	
i understand redmine is more of a trac clone but retrospectiva seem to support agile methodologies via a nice plugin

1936127
ireport	subreports
pattern7	better	
if your report is complicated and have many subreports and subdatasets its better to go this approach since ireport will make it quicker and easier for you to design and maintain later

1937370
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	pattern10	
in my experiance with the two postgresql has shown to be faster on most write operations while mysql is slightly faster on the reads

1946932
udp	tcp
pattern10	far more	pattern10	far more appropriate	pattern8	more appropriate	
btw i concur that udp is far more appropriate than tcp in this case

1946968
for-loop	loops
pattern10	pattern10	
i would say personally i find foreach a bit more readable over for loops but you should use the best for the job at hand and not have to write extra long code to include a foreach loops if a for-loop is more appropriate

1948765
mouse	keyboard
pattern4	
i find most users prefer keyboard data entry as opposed to mouse click data entry - it is a lot faster

1949361
getter	setter
pattern4	
depending on your language you should prefer getter setter up front because you can t introduce them later i m looking at you java if it turns out you do need them

1949368
strcpy	strncpy
pattern4	pattern2	
not related to the leak but if you know the length prefer strncpy over strcpy

1949511
division	modulo	bitwise-and	modulo
pattern7	
in this particular case you concluded that a bitwise-and operation of c++ language must be implemented by a bitwise-and machine operation while a modulo must somehow involve machine division which is allegedly slower

1951706
screens	mdpi
pattern0	
so a g1 will show mdpi bitmaps slightly smaller than a mdpi device with a true 160dpi screens but this is a very small difference so it s not a big deal

1957876
erd	diagram
pattern4	
personally i prefer erd diagram for databaser data models

1958038
trie	dawg
pattern7	
it combines efficiency of a trie trie can be seen as a special case of dawg but is much more space efficient

1958901
redmine	trac
pattern4	
grab redmine or trac and take on the challenge of getting everyone to standardize

1959310
mapquest	directions
pattern10	pattern10	
as accuracy goes i ve noticed that for directions here in north carolina mapquest is slightly more accurate

1959633
width	height
pattern0	
my array larger than max height width but not max height max width

1959795
innodb	myisam
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
anyone who thinks myisam is faster is either not tuning innodb correctly or has such small data that who cares

1959842
switching	screens
pattern7	bigger	
when the switching gets bigger than a couple of screens full split it into functions that handle each state using a state table to look up the function directly

1961714
vsts	tfs
pattern10	pattern10	
unless something has changed a lot with 2010 the basic vsts install is more or less the same as the pro version of vs - and then you install the team explorer on top to gain the tfs specific client-side extensions

1961894
maven	m2e
pattern4	
this has worked tremendously well and doesn t require any additional support or plugins from any of ides out there which is a great plus - number two reason we didn t choose maven was seeing how m2e basically took over eclipse

1962727
firefox	safari
pattern7	
using proprietary extensions from firefox is almost as myopic -- you ll have a hard time convincing all visitors to switch to firefox for your site from ie safari or whatever else they prefer and although the range of devices on which you can install firefox is broader than those on which you can install ie you re still cutting off devices such as iphones and android a segment of the market that s growing much faster than traditional pcs

1962928
ati	nvidia
pattern8	more flexible	
4 is nvidia cuda technology is easier more flexible than ati brook+ language

1964701
atomikos	bitronix
pattern4	
personally i d choose bitronix or atomikos

1965541
division	multiplication
pattern0	shorter	
i haven t benchmarked any of this code but just by examining the code you can see that using integers division by 2 is shorter than multiplication by 2

1967549
launch4j	jsmooth
pattern4	
launch4j - no new development in over a year supports 64 bit but you can t sign the exe created by launch4j so i prefer jsmooth but it does not support 64 bit

1969120
addition	multiplication
pattern7	operator lower	pattern0	lower precedence	
of course it is 10 because the addition operator has a lower precedence than the multiplication operator and so 4 + 3 2 always means 4 + 3 2

1969127
strcpy	strdup
pattern7	nicer	
in general it is nicer in c to have the caller allocate memory not the callee - hence why strcpy is a nicer function in my opinion than strdup

1970160
innodb	myisam
pattern7	much better	pattern0	better	
someone just told me that innodb is much better than myisam

1970176
innodb	myisam
pattern4	pattern2	
imho you should always prefer innodb over myisam because of the transactional support which is at the heart of every relational database system

1970258
innodb	myisam
pattern4	
i do this all the time because i prefer innodb for the fks but i sometimes need myisam for the full-text search

1971063
invokelater	invokeandwait
pattern3	
if so i would recommend using invokelater to build the swing components as i have noticed that opera can sporadically crash at start up with invokeandwait

1972630
ironruby	ironpython
pattern7	
ironpython has had more time to focus on performance improvements but ironruby has made significant performance improvements as of late

1978345
gprof	shark
pattern4	
personally i prefer shark for mac os x and gprof for linux

1981175
width	height
pattern0	
my array larger than max height width but not max height max width

1983147
accessor	properties
pattern4	
well your synthesize doesn t match properties declaration - you re declaring properties for mobinfo but generating synthesized accessor for mobinfo

1988545
division	multiplication
pattern0	worse	
so division is always a bit worse than multiplication

1989494
swt	swing
pattern2	
i m writing an application that has an swt gui currently but would like the end-users to be able to choose between swt and swing

1989900
nunit	mstest
pattern0	better	
various people told me to go with nunit since it s better than mstest apparently i have no idea and it also has very good support in resharper which i m using

1990334
range	minimum
pattern0	smaller	
a range is contiguous when there is no value one smaller than the minimum and no value one bigger than the maximum and there is no gap within the range

1995717
hash	salt
pattern7	better	
the more randomness and more characters your salt has the better for the hash but anything that s several characters long and random works

1996484
google-chrome	firefox
pattern0	earlier	
i suspect that this may be the case because ie and google-chrome need to know about the content of the div earlier than firefox

2000182
spweb	spsite
pattern10	longer	pattern10	longer url	
since spsite takes a longer url you may also be able to open the right spweb as well using site.openweb

2000205
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	pattern0	better	
also you might take the time to compare postgresql and see if there is something about it that meets your needs as well or better than mysql

2000456
ienumerable	ilist
pattern7	pattern0	
thus ilist is more than ienumerable and you won t be able to get away with it

2003818
hash	md5
pattern4	
however to answer your original question there is really is no way to compare md5 or any hash against any type of encryption

2004718
vim	emacs
pattern10	pattern10	
in many cases emacs or vim is more productive than a huge ide that makes coffee

2006698
swt	swing
pattern2	
if your only goal is to let users choose between swt or swing drawing their ui then swtswing would have been an option

2006809
trac	bugzilla
pattern0	pattern0	
in my experience this is a much simpler sell than trac bugzilla and all the rest

2013301
int	chars
pattern7	greater	
and sizeof int is greater than one and the compiler adds padding for the chars member variable - is the compiler-generated code allowed to change the values of the padding bytes

2014241
apache	nginx
pattern0	better	
nginx also happens to be better than apache at writing logfiles interestingly

2015715
config	ini
pattern0	faster	
since json can store arrays i can create quite complex config with it and it parses faster than ini files

2019939
django	web2py
pattern4	
i think i prefer web2py because it does more for me that i don t have to do but from the pov of say java frameworks django and web2py may as well be the same thing

2021396
reportlab	xhtml2pdf
pattern0	pattern0	
or go a little higher level than reportlab xhtml2pdf - now weasyprint built on top of reportlab

2021716
public	protected
pattern4	
so i d prefer public or package protected

2022693
range	max
pattern7	larger	pattern0	larger	
basically if you know that your events are never larger than a given duration you can search for a bounded range that s larger than the max duration then add restrictions to get rid of the extra stuff that matched

2022775
post	get
pattern7	
what i am hoping to get from this post is a better way to do this or hopefully someone can tell me why is happening i know that the latter might be hard since it can be a bunch of reasons

2023144
post	put
pattern0	moreso	
put is designed for file uploads moreso than post which requires doing a multipart upload but then it comes down to what your server can do as to which is more convenient for you to implement

2023431
public	protected
pattern4	
do prefer protected accessibility over public accessibility for virtual members

2023499
int	chars
pattern10	fields faster	pattern10	fields faster	
i m not an expert in the inner workings of mysql but it intuitively feels that retrieving and sorting int fields is faster than chars fields i just get a feeling that a z is more work that 0 1 and seems to feel much more familiar from a computing perspective in which 0s and 1s are the standard on off flags

2025883
ubuntu	linux
pattern4	
hard to beat ubuntu though i personally use mostly macs that s because mac os x still offers a superior laptop experience and my personal machines are mostly laptops by now -- my workstation at work does run ubuntu -- though i m pretty sure other modern linux distros would be shoulder and shoulder with it

2034023
versioning	upgrade
pattern7	pattern0	
application expects grails versioning 1.1.1 but grails_home is versioning 1.2.0 - use the correct grails versioning or run grails upgrade if this grails versioning is newer than the versioning your application expects

2034228
int	chars
pattern4	
most importantly you would pick int or chars at the language level depending on whether you wanted to treat the variable as a number or a letter to switch you would need to cast to the other type

2037401
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7	smaller	
ignoring the cost of providing sorted input the oh of sortedlist is smaller than the oh of sorteddictionary

2037706
maven	pom.xml
pattern4	
now to add a dependency either right-click the project and select maven add dependency or edit the pom.xml manually

2040472
zen-cart	oscommerce
pattern0	
it seems to be younger than zen-cart and oscommerce

2043996
youtube	vimeo
pattern7	
while vimeo is more of a professional site youtube offers html5 h.264 video playback support for all videos so they ll play on iphone

2044311
awt	swing
pattern7	richer	
well swing is richer in terms of out-of-the-box components than awt

2044311
awt	swing
pattern4	pattern2	
i have used both and i prefer swing over awt

2045608
equals	compareto
pattern0	
in the compareto method you can then write the code which will call the getters for the year month and so on until it figures out whether the current object is less than equals to or greater than the object o being passed into the compareto method

2051851
struts	stripes
pattern0	better	
stripes the actionbean approach doesn t look much better than struts

2052095
range	infinity	interpolation	splines
pattern10	pattern10	pattern10	pattern10	
splines interpolation is probably more useful for you than polynomial interpolation if you fit a polynomial it must inevitably head off to + - infinity outside your data range

2059539
getter	setter
pattern0	
you can do it using rhino 1.6r6 or higher with javascript getter and setter

2063535
ord	chr
pattern0	
i simplified the 0-9 case in digit_to_char i think str is clearer than the chr ord construct

2064683
phpmyadmin	heidisql
pattern2	
i m using heidisql to manage my databases at work i prefer this over phpmyadmin

2066036
komodo	gedit
pattern0	quicker	
when i m in a hurry i use gedit purely because it is quicker than komodo edit

2067125
int	boolean
pattern0	
relatively speaking the string concatenation in your code is probably going to be slower than the int and boolean comparison operations you have here

2072860
ienumerable	ilist
pattern7	
another thing that bothers me is why in nhibernate always it is being used ilist and not ienumerable which has less functionality

2075060
interpolation	splines
pattern3	
if you are doing more than three points however i would strongly recommend using interpolation as using guassian elimination scales incredibly poorly o n 3 and splines or another interpolation technique are less likely to fail

2076025
calloc	malloc
pattern7	longer	pattern0	longer	
calloc does take longer than malloc because it has to zero out all the memory you asked for before giving it to you

2077157
tapestry	wicket
pattern8	
click is tapestry-like but much more easy than tapestry and wicket

2079164
post	get
pattern0	
using the ajax method really shouldn t take much more than using post get

2080901
post	get
pattern8	less secure	
i wouldn t call post more or less secure than get

2083832
g++	gcc
pattern4	
compare gcc -v file.cpp gcc can work with c++ files and g++ -v file.cpp to see the difference in linker commands that often causes the first to fail for example

2085070
struts	stripes
pattern0	more lightweight	
i ve found stripes to be really effective and surprisingly lightweight....it aims to be more lightweight than struts

2089364
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
pattern10	pattern10	more widespread	pattern7	
nunit is more widespread mbunit has the most features but mstest has more manpower behind it

2089812
union	distinct
pattern4	
you d have to probably do a select distinct on the data set produced by the union

2093262
min	max
pattern7	
actually for min max it is easier to use which also supports handles lifted operators etc

2096222
tortoisegit	svn
pattern10	pattern10	
the compare dialog of tortoisegit is more about file and with git you have to compare two master branches not just two commits of the same branches both pointing to the same svn central repo

2096899
mod-alias	mod-rewrite
pattern0	faster	
evidently though mod-alias can be somewhat faster than mod-rewrite all other things being equal of course

2097534
udp	tcp
pattern4	
the skype protocol prefers udp where possible and falls back to tcp

2098528
for-loop	loops
pattern10	strictly more	pattern10	strictly more powerful	
the class of problems you can solve with while loops is strictly more powerful than those you could have solved with the strict for-loop found in pascal

2100226
equals	gethashcode
pattern3	
we recommend implementing equals and gethashcode using business key equality

2102058
range	max	range	min	min	max
pattern4	
currently i m joining a range of dates that covers the full range of possible dates select min start date max end date

2103122
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd
pattern10	pattern10	
tail -f that is capital -f as opposed to lowercase -f is a non-standard flag available on linux cygwin macos x freebsd and netbsd that works better for watching log files which may be rotated occasionally

2104081
cvs	svn
pattern8	
it s model it s much more twisted than svn cvs git

2104724
lift	wicket
pattern4	pattern2	
why did would you prefer wicket over lift

2105917
lift	wicket
pattern4	
even dave pollak once suggested this combination if you prefer wicket to lift or have an existing wicket application you want to retrofit scala with

2108646
pascal	delphi
pattern10	pattern10	
pascal and also delphi is more centered on readability than the c syntax languages which are more centered on character power as much information per character as possible

2111585
springsource	grails
pattern4	
then in springsource tool suite right-click your project and select grails tools - refresh dependencies

2114537
innodb	myisam
pattern0	bigger	
innodb tables are about 4x bigger than their myisam counterparts

2115070
lisp	scheme
pattern8	more user-friendly	
i ve also found scheme ides much more user-friendly than lisp s plt scheme is a good one

2115099
lisp	scheme
pattern7	
i suggest that you start with scheme and then move on to common lisp as scheme is simpler

2120804
fossil	git
pattern0	
from the article it sounds like fossil isn t a database any more than git is a database

2121325
pull	push
pattern7	
before do git pull and git push it s better to make sure that git status result is contain text working directory clean

2126531
appfuse	spring	wicket	appfuse
pattern4	
so while you can compare spring web flow + spring and wicket + spring the later combo doesn t offer anything comparable to roo out of the box maybe appfuse or appfuse light but you didn t mention them and they are third-party projects

2128783
lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern4	
since beautifulsoup is no longer being actively developed i would recommend lxml since it does all the things that beautifulsoup can do and a lot more

2132643
floating-point	fractions
pattern10	values more	pattern10	values more realistic	
and using floating-point values is more realistic - you need fractions values because when you rotate something the new coordinates will nearly always be non integral

2133147
min	max
pattern0	greater	
i d just make two properties min max assign them the value of the first item you add to the array then each time you add a new item just check if its datetime is less or greater than the min max ones

2136850
width	height
pattern7	much bigger	
however after rotating a rectangular image its new width and height is much bigger as these two screenshots should help clarify during rotation and after rotating then rotating again -- the little handles show where the images x y width height extends to

2137586
phpunit	simpletest
pattern4	
i would recommend phpunit but there is also simpletest which i know some people prefer

2138363
children	parent
pattern7	greater	pattern0	greater	
if smallest state of all children is greater than parent s state then update parent

2141417
move	drag
pattern4	
i have tried moving the files using the repo-browser right-click drag the files and select move items to here as well in the working folder right-click drag select svn move versioned files here and commit the parent folder

2141762
mef	prism
pattern7	
i personally think combining prism with mef makes this type of situation easier though since mef allows for easier dynamic extensibility for roles

2143377
post	get
pattern0	safer	
is post safer than get

2143772
getdate	datepart
pattern4	
select datepart dw getdate

2148905
hash	salt
pattern0	
if their original password was longer than the salt + hash you may have just reduced the security of their password assuming a good password and ignoring hash collisions

2149859
floating-point	integer
pattern10	divide faster	pattern10	divide faster	
floating-point divide is faster than integer fewer bits to divide assuming your cpu has floating-point unit

2152421
webclient	httpwebrequest
pattern7	much simpler	pattern0	simpler	
you can also use webclient which is much simpler than httpwebrequest but in order to set a cookiecontainer you ll need to derive from webclient and override the protected getwebrequest method

2153892
vim	emacs
pattern0	weaker	
i ve used vim for 10+ years but never really into vim scripting always subjectively beliving that this was one area where vim was weaker than emacs

2154572
subtraction	addition
pattern0	pattern0	
source unary + - bind tighter than addition subtraction + - and associate right

2156868
width	height
pattern7	greater	
now i want an array which contain those books id s which their height is greater than or equal to their width

2157980
mouseover	mouseenter
pattern0	better choice	
the mouseenter event is usually a better choice than mouseover

2159239
tinyint	varchar
pattern4	
also the regexp only matches tinyint bigint int long and varchar as an example to get you started

2163475
free	malloc
pattern0	
garbage-collection may be slower than malloc and free for programs that allocate at once all the memory they need and work with that

2165195
ant	maven
pattern3	
i don t know exactly how your sources are structured under jdeveloper but you best option here to automate the packaging and the deployment of this ear is imo to use ant or maven but if all this is totally new for you i would recommend using ant

2165425
fadein	fadeout
pattern0	longer	
more detail set the amount of time the animation will take for fadeout and use a delay for the fadein animation that is longer than the fadeout animation time

2167978
tinyint	boolean
pattern3	
the mysql documentation recommends using tinyint 1 for boolean values so tinyint 1 is probably the best

2171388
gif	png
pattern7	
choose the correct type of image extension sometimes gif or png delivers better results then jpg s

2171608
prng	random
pattern4	
sqlite contains a high-quality pseudo-random number generator prng used to select random rowids when inserting new records into a table that already uses the largest possible rowid

2172507
getdate	dateadd
pattern4	
if i run the query select dateadd d -500 getdate

2173609
getter	setter
pattern0	
property declarations are nothing more than compiler-generated getter and setter methods

2173619
imperative	declarative
pattern4	
imperative run-time code trumps declarative settings

2183918
websphere	ibm
pattern0	newer libraries	
other solution is to upgrade websphere with newer libraries as per ibm websphere upgrade service instructions

2185953
min	max
pattern0	pattern0	bigger	
2 also i notice that the inverse of the maximum value of a double precision type is bigger than its min value and inverse of its min value is inf way bigger than its max value

2188918
latex	katex
pattern4	
as of 5-feb-2015 i d switch to recommend katex - most performant javascript latex library from khan academy

2193943
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	easier	pattern0	easier	
mysql is easier than postgresql but it doesn t really matter either way

2195118
client-side	server-side
pattern10	pattern10	
i ve found that rendering client-side is nice for small controlled internal uses but for anything where you want tight control over the output server-side is more reliable

2198143
multiplying	multiplication
pattern7	slightly harder	
multiplication is slightly harder just multiplying two scaled numbers and then divide by your scale factor

2205247
min	max
pattern0	larger	
it s interesting that this works since the documentation states that max must be larger than min but it looks like -1 is treated more like an empty or null value

2205637
jax-ws	saaj
pattern0	lower level	
one could use saaj soap with attachments api for java which runs at a lower level than jax-ws

2207296
nuxeo	alfresco
pattern2	
at the moment i am in doubth to choose between alfresco and nuxeo

2211122
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
pattern4	pattern4	
we have a list in particular that works on every other browser ie 7 8 firefox 3.0.13 linux and 3.5.7 win mac opera win google-chrome 4.0.249.30 linux and 4.0.249.78 win safari win and mac

2211693
rss	feed
pattern4	
selects rss feed

2213961
google-chrome	firefox
pattern0	richer	
i inspected the range object in both google-chrome and firefox and then noticed that firefox s range object is far richer than google-chrome s

2214345
hash-collision	key
pattern4	
also as sellibitze says an operator is needed to compare key in case of hash-collision

2215853
wadl	wsdl
pattern2	
wsdl 2.0 can be used to describe rest web services and thus competes with wadl

2215853
wadl	wsdl
pattern2	
so while wsdl 2.0 competes with wadl as rest web service description languages wdl 2.0 has more but lets forget that for now xrd is a metadata discovery format for any uri openid discovery being one of the primary use case

2221787
postgresql	mysql
pattern8	more resistant	
the question is is mysql somehow more resistant than postgresql to sql injection attack under the perl dbi and why might this be the case

2224831
jruby	mri
pattern0	heavier	
the jruby runtime alone is already pretty heavy much heavier than mri

2225196
getter	setter
pattern3	
i think most people will recommend using setter getter

2225598
zen-cart	magento
pattern7	simpler	pattern0	simpler	
alternatively zen-cart looks simpler than magento but without some of the flexibility

2228203
min	max
pattern4	
i need to select max and min of one column accrding to some criteria process this information and remove data according to the same criteria

2230024
ant	maven
pattern7	pattern0	
the quotation you brought up just claim that maven does more than ant so that it s not fair to compare the two

2233076
width	height
pattern7	
details i wish to resize it to a specified width keep the proportions and if the height is bigger than a specified value to crop it to the specified height

2237879
haskell	scheme
pattern2	
haskell and f# are statically typed which is a big advantage for real-life projects but imho they have a little too much syntax and are not as easy to pick up as scheme

2238063
strtol	atoi
pattern7	much better	
the c function strtol is much better make it a habit to prefer that one to atoi

2239021
wcat	loadrunner
pattern7	
microsoft s free application for stress-testing wcat is underpowered and buggy but the full blown test edition goes up against products like loadrunner but is easier to use better-integrated with vs asp.net and for much less money per virtual user

2242618
int	double
pattern7	slower	
using and at the same time to check equality on a int results in slower code because it takes two comparisons instead of one taking the double amount of time

2242654
for-loop	loops
pattern7	easier	
further as a for-loop it is easier to read as everything initialization loops condition expression to be executed after each iteration are all on one line

2245273
feedparser	beautifulsoup
pattern7	
you could use beautifulsoup - but feedparser is much better geared towards rss handing

2248145
google-chrome	firefox
pattern0	
this alleviated some of our performance issues but even on subsequent refreshes we noticed ie6 taking substantially longer than ie7+ firefox google-chrome etc

2248328
put	get
pattern4	
if generated by the matches for this regex was not the whole capture - then a single-call replace would not be possible - and your question would probably be asking why doesn t the whole match get put into instead of the other way round

2251790
jar	manifest.mf
pattern7	
putting it in the jar file among the classes or adding its jar-relative path to the class-path entry of the jar s manifest.mf file is more than sufficient

2252782
uiview	subviews
pattern0	
if you take a look at the associated guides you ll see core animation and layers does require hit testing though that s relatively easy but it s far cleaner than the uiview doing all the drawing and more efficient than many subviews

2252951
set	bag
pattern7	
a set or bag is easier to map in hibernate and requires fewer database columns

2253645
wxpython	pygtk	wxpython	pyqt
pattern8	
now all that said...you might get more visual appeal with pygtk pyqt or wxpython though tkinter coming standard is a nice feature

2254734
javassist	cglib
pattern2	
another similar example is hibernate that lets you choose between cglib and javassist in hibernate-core in the same way

2254966
glut	glfw
pattern7	much closer	
between these glfw is much closer to glut in character -- a small toolkit for abstracting away most of the os-dependent parts so you can produce opengl programs with relatively little hassle

2254966
glut	fltk
pattern0	
fltk is really a full-blown gui toolkit though rather small as gui toolkits go that has a built-in glut emulation that at least the last time i played with it seemed considerably better implemented than glut itself

2256282
calloc	malloc
pattern4	pattern2	
if you belong to the second camp which apparently you do then you prefer malloc over calloc

2256479
tolower	uppercase
pattern10	comparison more	pattern10	comparison more	
further uppercase comparison is more optimized than tolower if that tiny degree of performance matters

2258346
maven	cargo
pattern0	
section 4.13 of better builds with maven describes using cargo to deploy a war specified using maven coordinates but that s serious overkill given that we re using jetty

2258513
min	max
pattern7	greater	pattern0	greater	
you might want to ensure that max is greater than min

2259414
maven	cargo
pattern0	
section 4.13 of better builds with maven describes using cargo to deploy a war specified using maven coordinates

2259852
kde	gnome
pattern4	
in general you can choose gnome or kde with any distro and you can even install both

2260142
width	height
pattern7	pattern0	
this code should draw the test rectangles only when the height is less than the width and otherwise the window should remain clear

2261289
cos	sin
pattern0	pattern0	
no for-loops or math.pow which is amazingly slow way slower than sin cos etc

2262152
division	modulo
pattern0	
if so this should work and it should also be a lot quicker than using modulo and division

2264994
freemarker	velocity
pattern7	
i suggest using a template engine such as freemarker for this or velocity but freemarker is better imo

2265491
rss	feed
pattern3	
i would recommend using rss feed to extract content

2268913
min	max
pattern4	
i could find only this one which produces somewhat clean sql still not really effective comparing to select min val max val from table

2269313
haskell	ocaml
pattern10	ffi more	pattern10	ffi more powerful	pattern0	less code	
secondly the haskell ffi is more powerful that is it does more with less code than ocaml s and more libraries are avaliable via hackage so i don t think foreign interfaces will be a deciding factor

2269993
haskell	ocaml
pattern8	more intuitive	
you will also likely find the performance characteristics of your ocaml code more intuitive than haskell because of haskell s lazy evaluation

2272341
bazaar	git
pattern3	
i would recommend using git bazaar or another vcs which doesn t require you to tell it when you move sources around

2273770
post	get
pattern4	
jsf favors post requests but you can still use get if you want -- it depends on your need and if the page needs to be bookmarkable

2275121
min	max
pattern4	pattern4	
note this example also demonstrates that it is not safe to use select max id +1 or select min id -1 as the next available unique value if we do it under concurrency

2277052
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	older	pattern0	older	
postgresql is older than mysql so it might have influenced them

2277387
explode	implode
pattern4	
i have an ugly solution that works explode the search string into an array of words look up each word in the array of stopwords unset them if there is a match implode the remaining words and finally run a regex to add the boolean mode formatting

2277474
daemons	systemd
pattern0	safer	
use daemons mode and then simply touching the wsgi script file when an atomic set of changes have been completed isn t that hard and certainly safer than a systemd which restarts arbitrarily when it detects any single change

2278301
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
i ve used both db systems before and while postgresql is great for it s licensing terms and standards compliance mysql is definitely easier to get up and running quickly

2278301
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	pattern7	pattern0	pattern0	
i don t want this to be a mysql postgresql is better than postgresql mysql debate

2279388
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	pattern2	
as a developer i prefer postgresql over mysql as the latter behaves different from version to version they re still playing catchup to the sql standard and probably always will

2279388
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	pattern2	
if you actually prefer mysql over postgresql i d lay out a migration plan just to be ready if need arises as a kind of lazy proactiveness .

2280675
udp	tcp
pattern7	always faster	pattern0	faster	
also see this other so answer about the misconception that udp is always faster than tcp

2280810
integer	unsigned
pattern7	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

2281068
swt	swing
pattern10	pattern10	more platform-specific	
swt has a more platform-specific look about it but java ships with swing built-in there s no messing about with external libraries as with swt although the use of eclipse may make that much easier i still develop quite a bit of my stuff from the command line unfortunately

2282055
x509	openpgp
pattern7	simpler	pattern0	simpler	
openpgp is simpler than x509 but more limited especially if you wish to have a strong legal meaning behind the certificates

2284148
google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	not slower	pattern0	slower	
better use google-chrome even thought firefox is not slower than google-chrome for once probably the tracing for the image comparison pays off yay

2285241
width	height
pattern7	
tablelayout gives you a good mechanism for rows and columns managing width and height is easier but you d need more code to change the placement of all controls if you want to remove one from the form dynamically

2285314
tcpdf	fpdf
pattern0	slower	
if anyone has some information on this problem i d really appreciate it - either things you did to make tcpdf faster or just confirmation that it runs slower than fpdf so i can forget about it and just stick with fpdf

2287642
coalesce	isnull
pattern0	quicker	
i understand the difference between these functions but my question is when checking for a single null value would isnull be any quicker than using coalesce

2287656
coalesce	isnull
pattern0	faster	
isnull will be faster i think because it has lesser function code implementation for itself making it faster than coalesce

2287673
coalesce	isnull
pattern4	pattern2	pattern8	more efficient	
to prefer isnull over coalesce when given the choice is that isnull tends to produce query plans that are more efficient than coalesce

2288413
wcf	openrasta
