3504942
getter	setter
in practice there is an actual getter setter model in actionscript

3504942
int	boolean
this limits the user to setting per your requirements the value of this value property to data types int boolean or string

3505006
rsa	aes
first of all rsa can be used to encrypt a message so aes is unnecessary

3505009
typedef	struct
typedef struct

3505026
rss	feed
since we cannot guarantee that new pages are being added to the sitemap is it better to submit a sitemap as an rss feed

and this brings up the issue of pushing duplicate content to google as the sitemap and the rss feed might contain the same urls

3505027
postgresql	mysql
make sure you study up on both html and a database language most likely mysql postgresql is another popular platform for retailers.

3505034

3505357
implements	extends
i m also thinking if it s possible to extends the import loader to implements the db loading

3505368
hash	md5
after you authenticate a user you start a session and in that session you store md5 username+time and also store a cookie on users browser of md5 username+time then on subsequent page requests you could check your session hash matches the cookie hash to assert the user is who they say they are

3505368
hash	md5
md5 is not a good hash for this type of thing but hashing in general can help in situations such as these

3505370
hash	md5
md5 is a one way encryption hash

3505370
hash	md5
it doesn t decrypt anything rather it creates you a hash code that you can use to compare with other md5 hash

3505448
mouseout	mouseleave
unlike mouseout which fires even when entering children mouseleave won t

3505448
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseleave event differs from mouseout in the way it handles event bubbling

3505490

3505609
int	chars
makes message2 an int and so of course you cannot then call split on it -- it s a single int representing a single chars why ever would you want to split it

3505615
min	max
you use delegates like min and max to determine this and for numerical data there are also delegates like avg and count

3505623

3505877
printf	strtol
it uses strtol string to long and printf to convert from string to int and back respectively

3505879
free	malloc
additionally c++ s new and delete could actually request a larger amount of memory from malloc and use the extra for book keeping like storing the address of the destructor function and so the pointer you passed to free would not actually be one that was malloc ed

3505894
free	malloc
the standard says you have to match the allocation deallocation function perfectly new - delete - malloc - free

3505894
free	malloc
however may store the number of elements in the allocated chunk of memory in which case the address returned by points inside some block allocated by malloc not to the beginning which means you can t free it with free

3505900
versioning	upgrade
when the app is upgrade through the android marketplace does the database know its versioning number

opera	google-chrome
initial request to a method are around 30ms but over about a half hour i can watch using opera s dragonfly and verified with google-chrome s tools too my request times slowly increase

3506545
implements	extends
in order to do that i would create either an abstract class or an interface depending on the rest of your architecture and then make the words class either extends it or implements

3506546
innodb	myisam
since you re using innodb tables the easiest solution is to create a new myisam table with only the text content and an index to join with the original table this also helps with seek efficiency in some common cases

3506551
free	malloc
wrap new malloc and delete free and bookkeep all allocations deallocations

3506554

post	get
is it based on url and http get post requests

3507267
introspection	typechecking
my one-sentence description of why it s an awesome language is that its generic programming compile-time introspection template metaprogramming facilities are good enough to give you almost flexibility of a duck-typed language while its execution speed and static typechecking rival or exceed c++ and c#

3507267
freebsd	linux

xts	quantmod
your best bet is to use quantmod and store the results as a time series in this case it will be xts

3507961
width	height
however there s a bug with uiview auto-sizing when the parent view s height width become small and everything breaks when it becomes zero mdash

3507961
width	height
it might just be that uiview height width can t go negative

3507970
free	malloc
he will use malloc and free unsafe pointers and preprocessor to define inline functions

3507978

since it is rest based you can do crud from virtually any client that is able to do a http get or post

3508046
ravendb	couchdb
i would possibly consider a different datastore such as couchdb or ravendb

3508052
firefox	safari
i m pretty sure safari has a default left position of auto while firefox gives you a position in pixels

3508065
children	parent
but in order to implement drag and drop i need to get the parent children and the opaque pointer that internalpointer returns

3508082
pascal	delphi
well i think the easier way to perform this may be creating a dll in delphi that detects if your program is running and ask the user to close it put that dll in your setup and use the flag dontcopy check in under pascal scripting using dlls for an example

min	max
and what i am attempting to do is for each unique name in the first column retrieve the min value for column 3 and the max value for column 4

3508116
min	max
so the final input will look the same a tab-delimited file except that it will have the 1st 2 columns for each unique name then the 3rd and 4th columns be the min and max values mentioned above

3508137
hash	salt
prepend the password hash with the salt and save it in the password column

wow64 stands for windows 32 on windows 64

3508230
windows	wow64
by the way if you are running the x64 version of windows you can see which processes are running through wow64 because they will have a 32 appended to the process name in the process list

3508231
hash	salt
the point of salt is to thwart rainbow table attacks where the attacker has precomputed the hash of a big number of strings in order to find a reverse correspondence from hash to original string

3508231
hash	salt
it s pointless to prepend the salt to the hash password because the attacker can simply strip the salt

3508231
hash	salt
store a hash of the salt+password together with the salt

3508369
int	chars
what i don t understand is why a chars array is treated somewhat different from say int and gets destroyed when you exit the function

3508374
public	protected
you have access to this classes and their public members or functions or even protected if the class where you are referring to them is in the same package

3508391
public	protected
by extending them you can keep a method signature thats its accessor public protected etc return type void int someobject etc and its parameters but make it act completely different

3508391
public	protected
that is you write your own class and inherit all of the public protected method of the upper class

3508412
subtract	add
this class has public methods that add subtract and report the balance of euros and pounds

3508415
opera	google-chrome
the problem that i am having is that both opera and google-chrome don t display this the way i expect

3508586
jobs	cron
yes the 30-seconds deadline applies to cron jobs too just as to regular requests and task queue jobs

3508591
mpfr	mpc
i was able to build gcc 4.5.1 on macos x 10.6.4 recently but i built and installed the gmp mpfr and mpc libraries myself - in usr gnu64 a non-standard location that i use for stuff that i install for my own benefit

3508591
mpfr	mpc
i had similar problems on linux plus a problem with a regex in opt-functions.awk - easily fixed with two back-slashes in front of an open brace and found that there were updates to the mpfr and mpc libraries since i built on macos x

3508591
put	get	mpfr	mpc
basically i get the current versions of gmp mpc mpfr and put their source code into the gcc source directory and let gcc compile the libraries for itself

try looking up the stl design of allocator

3509536
udp	tcp
the posix c api is fairly portable the gnu libc documentation provides examples of udp and tcp clients and servers that i usually turn to when i m scratching together another server or you could use the boost.asio library for a more c++ experience..

3509553
hide	show
just call hide_spines before show and it will hide them in all of the figures that show displays

3509578

when serializing i d use ntohs htons or ntohl htonl see their man pages to always make sure the serializable is in network byte order and the deserialization is in host byte order

3509635
put	get
this works just fine the first time that i put in the info but if i try to edit the order the total_price doesn t get updated because update_total_price doesn t get called because self.saved is not nil

3509648
profiling	debugging
if you need it temporarily for debugging purposes you could use sql profiling

3509714

output is 123456789 on both gcc linux and visual c++ express does that mean when there is free memory i can actually use more than what i ve allocated with malloc

3509755
post	get
i see that there is already some great advice and methods suggest for how to get the post back control

3509775

3510075
websphere	ibm
the ibm websphere application engine service was configured to be started by the local system so the wasservice.exe and the java.exe services are started by the local system and when jacob runs and calls msword.exe the msword.exe started by local system also till now everything is ok but since i was invoking the applypolicy method which apply the rms on the document so the msword.exe was trying to apply policy using local system and that is wrong because when you are trying to apply rms you must apply it by the user you logged by it to the system domain user which can apply the rms policy over a document

3510075
websphere	ibm
so to solve the problem i changed the user who is responsible for running the ibm websphere application engine service from local system to real domain user go to run - services.exe search for ibm service and changed the logon user and everything is ok now

uicontrol	uibutton
these are defined on uibutton s ancestor uicontrol

3510137
int	double
int float or double of the

3510195
free	malloc
when malloc doesn t have enough free memory in its reserve pool to satisfy an allocation it grabs pages from the kernel in chunks of at least 4 kb and often much larger so you re probably writing into reserved but un-malloc ed space when you initially exceed the bounds of your allocation which is why your test case always works

3510250
addclass	removeclass
i want to animate addclass and removeclass on this interface that i ve made

3510250
addclass	removeclass
what would be the best way to animate the addclass removeclass

accessor	properties
in c# 3.0 and later auto-implemented properties make property-declaration more concise when no additional logic is required in the properties accessor

3510684
accessor	properties
the compiler creates a private anonymous backing field that can only be accessed through the properties s get and set accessor

3510684
getter	setter
essentially its simpler syntax for declaring properties that have simple getter and setter

3510687
post	get
session id s should always be passed using cookie and never passed as get or post

3510700
getter	setter
you can mix and match different visibility levels of the getter setter too as long as you still obey the same rules as traditional properties

3510709
hide	show
and show hide enable disable components based on state of checkbox

3510759
free	malloc
when i used to work intensively on c c++ at work we used rational purify that in practice replace the standard malloc new in c++ and free delete in c++ and it is able to return quite accurate report on where the program did something it was not supposed

3510774
screens	hdpi
you only need to use hdpi if you want to provide different assets for different screens densities

3510783

if its a checkbox or radio button it doesnt have a length no strings in it otherwise if its a textfield i need to check whether or not it contains characters

3510887
int	chars
it s used to specify that a string value of len value chars is to be packed after those two int

3510947
put	get
however if the pages are going to disappear after the match then i wouldn t put them on the site map as they may get indexed then disappear which may have a negative impact on your search engine rankings

3510954

i am using touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended and touchescancelled in the view below

3511001
rel	attr
even if you have more than one element the attr method will return the desired attribute for the firsts known element so perhaps your .jstree-clicked class exists elsewhere without a rel attribute

3511004
min	max

3511133
hide	show
anyway what this code does is it hide show the province input when the option selected is usa notusa

3511133

3511204
equals	tostring
java.util.arrays - has many array-related utility methods like equals tostring etc

3511215
modifiers	sealed
properly said you still need to add an access modifiers if you use the sealed keyword unless the default access modifiers suits you

3511215
modifiers	sealed
the sealed keyword is called the sealed modifiers because it modifies a class or method to be sealed off

3511215
modifiers	sealed
this is like a boolean switch a class or method is either sealed or it is not regardless of its access modifiers

3511277
modifiers	sealed
all the following valid class definitions feature sealed classes but they all have different levels of access so you can see that sealed isn t an access modifiers and hence isn t listed as one by microsoft

3511287
min	max
the condition on the min and max areas is necessary for this to work

3511321
prng	random
windows uses microsoft crypto api capi when the dev random string is used to state the required prng source the securerandom.source property in the jre_home lib security java.security file

3511501
decimal	ieee
though note that exactly what form the decimal strings are allowed to take is outside the scope of ieee 754

3511501
decimal	ieee
the current version of ieee 754 seems to be a bit different in this respect judging by the publicly available draft version version 1.2.5 it just requires each implementation to specify bounds -î î on the exponent of the decimal string with î large enough to accomodate the decimal strings corresponding to finite binary values in the largest supported binary format

3511541
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
change width and height to actualwidth and actualheight

3511541
width	height
line polygon etc which are defined via points have undefined width and height

you ll receive a warning because parentviewcontroller may not respond to pushviewcontroller animated but with a nslog you ll see that your parentviewcontroller is actually a uinavigationcontroller

3512828
int	chars
the problem is not memcpy unless your chars type really is 32 bits rather than 8 it looks more like int sign extension while printing

3512836
opera	firefox
firefox somehow doesn t seem to have a problem with those numbers though and i don t get them at all in opera so i m not sure what your php script is doing there

3512838
int	chars
you should mask off the higher bits since your chars will be extended to int size when calling a varargs function

3512855
ostringstream	std
it attempts to use a std ostringstream to convert the value to a std string using the formatting conversions supplied by output streams

3512859
equals	tostring
tostring on both guid s they were equals thats odd

3512881
int	chars
when passed to printf the chars are promoted to int types which effectively means a sign extension

3512881
hex	binary
as the value was only slightly negative coming from a narrow signed type post conversion the value is close to the maximum possible unsigned int value it has many leading 1 s in binary or leading f in hex

3512970
post	get
scott guthrie has a blog post that describes how to get linq to sql to work with stored procedures

3513062

since there is a variable number of children per parent the only way it can be done in sql is presenting all gifts semicolon separated in a single record

3513074
min	max
note that this could result in an infinite loop if you provide a min and max that force mt_rand to return an exception character

3513083

3513362
int	chars
the standard does not require the compiler to pack the bit fields into a single storage unit int chars whatever

3513362
int	chars
so even with the pragma i would expect those 2 bitfields to take up 2 chars or int

3513370
codeigniter	cakephp
use a php framework such as cakephp codeigniter etc

3513371
post	put
but you have to put the following in your application_controller to access the facebook_session this was non-obvious and only discovered from another person s obscure post

3513372
int	chars
your #pragma pack directive is right but i think the underlying type of your bifields verlen and flagfrag are int instead of the chars and short you were expecting

hide	show
a quick test with slightly modified code show that a variable hide the struct by the same name

3513565
width	height
i m a bit unclear on some of your input parameters but i m assuming that you have rectangle height and width the number of rectangles and the ideal height-width ratio ie preferred gridheight gridwidth

3513565
width	height
if this is the case then i d probably start off by normalizing your dimensions so for the purpose of the following calculations we say a unit of width is the same as the width of a rectangle and likewise for a unit of height

3513565
width	height
if your height width ratio in real units was k then your height width ratio in rectange units would be k rectwidth rectheight

3513565
width	height
we can then approximate our height add width to give ourselves our preferred grid aspect ratio by saying gridheight gridwidth n and gridheight gridwidth k

3513565
width	height
required final grid aspect ratio 1024 768 k assumes that 768 is width and 1024 is height - i kept wanting to put it the other way around as a standard screen resolution

3513565
width	height
looking at this we can see intuitively that width 5 and height 20 will be our best match

3513565
width	height
but that will waste more space i think possibly actually minimizing the product of the width and height here migth be the best calculation but i m not sure

3513582
viewdidload	viewdidappear
the activity class has oncreate and onresume methods that are pretty analagous to viewdidload and viewdidappear

subtract	add
then write mutators to add or subtract one from the value represented by the object and handle carrying between fields and an accessor that allows you to check if the value is zero

3513916
subtract	add
then have a loop where you subtract one from the input number and add one to the output number until the input number reaches zero

3513932
client-side	server-side
the trick however is that silverlight is a client technology so the server-side piece would house all that shared logic and you d need to then interface that through a web-service your client could talk to but that goes without saying when it comes to silverlight client-side technologies

3513934

jar	war
for the life of me i can t figure out where the .cfg file should go in either the jar the war or in glassfish so that it can be found on the classpath

3517786
folder	directory
in my project there is a folder structure from my project directory that looks like this

3517798

3517821
fadein	fadeout
jquery ie fadein and fadeout opacity

the standard containers define the requirements copyconstructible and assignable on the value type and those requirements are sufficient to support all of the operations on containers and sequences you might also want them to be comparable for associative containers but even that s not required since you can instead supply a comparator

int	chars
if a and b are arrays of chars then you don t want to create int s to them.

3518755

3521290
post	get
i have found plenty of information on the differences between get and post in the general sense but i did not find a definite answer for this particular scenario

3521290
post	get

3521290
post	get
everything i have read so far suggest that post should be used for destructive actions whereas actions that do not alter the internal state of the application -like querying and such- should be handled with get

3521328

to be correct get post or other verbs are actions on some resource addressed by url - so its generally about resource s state and not about application state as such

3521328

ienumerable	ilist
ienumerable to ilist or also as an option i may have additional method in repository which return ilist by default e.g

3522746
ienumerable	ilist
in that case i may remove ienumerable findentity implementation at all because i may simply cast ilist to ienumerable when i need it or i can live both implementations just avoid any casts

3522746
ienumerable	ilist
why common repository implementation practice to have only ienumerable not ilist there should be explanation for that

3522746
ienumerable	ilist

int	chars
when a pointer to a particular type say int chars float .. is incremented its value is increased by the size of that data type

3523146
folder	directory
so you could order by metadata that is contained as part of the file folder name scheme as you have started to do here your threads directory would contain a 1_2 first thread second order 2_1 second thread most recent 3_0 third thread sticky --please forgive the feature creep this would allow you to use the split function to get relevant metadata from the file names

3523501
superclass	subclassing
if for some reason this all-around-win solution is not available to you there are hacks and tricks subclassing pickle.pickler use directly an instance of your subclassing rather than the base one as pickle.dumps does override the save method so it traces the type obj before delegating to the superclass but upgrading to the right most up-to-date protocol -1 is guaranteed to be on any given python version the most advanced one that version supports would be a good idea anyway if at all feasible

3523529
put	get
also i ve been unsuccessfully reading about ways to do this and i get the impression i might have to have the publisher put a new snapshot on all the subscribers systems to do this

3523826
nunit	mstest
i can do this using nunit but when using mstest i get problems

3523826

this would be very useful especially when testing production types that implement an interface or are part of an inherited hierarcy where certain members have semantic contract type properties or invariants - if that makes sense

3523878
google-chrome	safari
applewebkit 533.4 khtml like gecko google-chrome 5.0.375.126 safari 533.4

3523891

3523913
hide	show
now how do we handle the click of show hide for each row

3523963
stdout	stderr
for more advanced things like writing to its stdin stream or reading from its stdout or stderr streams use the open4 gem

3524035
coalesce	nvl	coalesce	isnull	isnull	nvl
coalesce is supported in both oracle and sql server and serves essentially the same function as nvl and isnull

3524035
coalesce	isnull
the return type for isnull matches the type of the first argument that is not true for coalesce at least on sql server.

firebird	paradox
if you can open those .db files using borland database desktop then they are paradox tables and not firebird ones

i heard it is not really good idea to work with class attributes directly instead using setter and getter

3524106
x86	64bit
i have edit and continue turned on and am targeting x86 as 64bit e c doesn t work

3524125
getter	setter
in a nutshell if you code to interfaces which contain getter and setter to a private field then you can swap out any object that conforms to the interface

3524137
getter	setter	mutators	setter	mutators	getter
in short a class should use mutators methods getter setter etc to validate the input before it is stored privately

3524146
apache	nginx
it s just a little slower than using apache bench directly against nginx

3524172
udp	tcp
layer-4 tcp udp comes into picture only at the end points sender receiver

sometimes you will want to create virtual attributes the classical example being complex numbers where you have the attributes x and y and offer mod and angle through calculation in the setter and getter

3524180
sorting	grouping
this would make it easier to show warnings and errors different than other things you could use collectionviewsource for sorting and grouping etc

3524194
getelementsbyname	domdocument
with domdocument loadhtml getelementsbyname and so on you ll have a much more reliable way of scraping page data

3524206

cvs	svn
i know about cvs svn git and all the other source control solutions and to change the tool is not an option at present

3524264
width	margin
normal margin and padding won t work because the ol and li elements extend in width behind the image

3524270
clang	icc
clang and icc likely allow arithmetic for the purposes of compatibility with gcc

3524351
expander	itemscontrol
i have an expander that contains an itemscontrol that looks something like this

3524353
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
you can optionally assign a different ivar in the properties declaration but the fact that by default synthesized accessor for a properties will access the ivar with the same name as the properties indicates that s the pattern they expect you to follow

3524356
minimum	max
there are limits to the max and minimum values of an int and those may play into your loop

3524381
lxml	beautifulsoup
try beautifulsoup or lxml

3524487
width	height
i have a grid with a fixed width and height

3524487

just as a point of reference the height and width that the rectangle binds do are essentially 900 by 600 respectively

3524497
ada	pascal
programmers generally prefer terse syntax a la c lisp etc. to verbose syntax a la pascal ada etc.

3524508

you want to be reactive to input output that s another thread indeed most io require a dedicated thread you can pair keyboard + mouse in one but you ll need two for networking one to send one to receive

3524510
hash	md5
also remember to hash the password you should use md5 at least

3524530
dictionary	map
a variable variable is essentially an array map dictionary

3524531
portrait	landscape
there are also macros for portrait and landscape but this should work just fine

3524538
mako	genshi
you can then use conditionals to render the appropriate mako or genshi template depending on the result of that test

3524613
getter	setter
in languages that respect the uap such as scala it is quite common to use public fields instead of getter setter

3524629
gridview	detailsview
a master page shows a gridview of database records and clicking on edit for a given row brings up an edit form with a detailsview

3524652
int	chars
if an int parameter costs 3 instructions and a chars parameter costs 1 you could pass an extra chars parameter for the extra 1 bit you re missing

3524652
int	chars
it seems pretty silly that your presumably 16-bit int takes more than twice as many instructions as an 8-bit chars

3524659
expander	itemscontrol
each of theses child object got another expander with an itemscontrol having around 10 childs

3524696

3524745
width	height
i ve tried setting the width height in code with layoutparams and with setmaxwidth setmaxheight...neither seem to be working

3524748
width	height
you can probably call that with half the height and width of the listview to get the position for the center item

3524751
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried it in google-chrome and in firefox

3524778
hide	show
when you tap a button hide the others and show the correct one

3524795
jstl	taglib
that said i don t want to disappoint you but it is also not recommended to use jstl sql taglib

3524795
jstl	taglib
to be clear using jstl instead of scriptlets is perfectly fine you should only avoid the sql and xml taglib as they are intented for quick prototyping only

3524817
google-chrome	firefox
this problem doesn t come in firefox and google-chrome

3524873
ant	maven
i use a project building tool like ant or maven to make some very specific steps of my build like your o or d tasks for example

tabcontrol	tabitem
i am creating a sl app that has a tabcontrol with dynamically created tabitem which are added via code behind

3524900

i d like said tabitem to size proportionally to the tabcontrol full width much like what is described here

3524975
post	get
i have a page that does a json result get and post method in the controller with two submit buttons

the ads show on all other browsers i tried ie firefox opera but google-chrome

3524995
actualheight	actualwidth
what is actualwidth and actualheight

3524995
actualheight	actualwidth

the only take the output on stdout not on stderr

3525066

union	distinct
when a union distinct which is the same as union is performed the temporary table is created with an index so that duplicates can be removed

3525201
margin	height
the top margin can be the height of the entire box

3525206
width	height
it may be because i need to have the width and height properties specified in my css first

3525228
infobox	infowindow
then in turn on clicking them i open up an infobox as a infowindow replacement

3525229
getter	setter
it might be the case that you need to use thread.memorybarrier at the start of the getter and at the end of the setter to ensure that readers only see completely initialized arrays

3525231
switching	screens
for example i have ctrl + mapped to switching screens so i d send that and then windows key + up to do it

3525244
children	parent
not only you don t have to tell your user s browser to make another request you also don t need to keep track of everywhere in the code where you delete children so you don t end up with hanging parent

3525247
gridview	detailsview
i figured out how to do this using gridview and then render a detailsview depending on what you click in the grid but it s so ugly

3525289
openrowset	openquery
also i want to avoid adding . as linked server just to make openquery and openrowset work anyhow

google-chrome	firefox
on this site the rotating flash banner at the top works fine in ie and google-chrome but when opened in firefox it doesn t load the picture or advance automatically

3525405
public	protected
do you have a good rule of thumb as to when a field absolutely must be private and when is it maybe okay to mark it protected or public

3525415
int	chars
as an alternative to using int to contain the result you might want to use a chars buffer appending the loop index

3525420
springsource	grails
i installed the jquery and jquery-ui plugins for grails into springsource tool suite sts-eclipse following the documentation located at and using the grails command-line tool included with sts-eclipse as follows

3525444
union	distinct
and if you re searching for distinct rows doing a union instead of a union all will accomplish that thanks to jeffrey l whitledge for pointing this out

3525464
pop-up	dialog
when i press ctrl+shift+t dialog for file search pop-up i find file i m interested in and when i press enter - if file is .resx or .dbml - it s opens in text editor

3525470

so i want to create a class cachablerepository that will accept parameters check if object for them is cached already if not - get data from db and put to cache

3525498
width	height
at the same time i want to let the user have arbitrary big size and let the components have equal share of the width and height

3525515
apache	nginx
i tried your tests using apache yaws and nginx as the webservers and found very little variation run with and without the proxy with any of them

3525598
mouseover	mouseout
the mouseover mouseout are there to prevent the onblur to fire when the user click an item in the menu

3525629
public	protected
when you make a field public or even protected you are effectively declaring it as part of the interface

3525629
getter	setter
and in the cases where you find you need any of that validation later you can t just convert a field to a getter setter without breaking binary compatibility meaning anyone who used your code will have to recompile everything that used that field in order for it to work again

3525629
getter	setter
getter and setter separate the implementation from the interface

3525629
getter	setter
so if you write code that will ever be used after you write it non-trivial getter and setter that validate the value maybe synchronize etc -- ie do more than just blindly get and set a variable are a good idea

3525675
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
internet explorer 5 and up firefox safari opera and more

3525733
puts	gets
the ajax requests are a mix of puts and gets using syntax like

3525765
getter	setter
i am being told that all the data should be private and protected getter setter used only

3525765
public	protected
i have looked at java protected fields vs public getters java protected fields vs public getters but i still am dubious that

3525765
children	parent
i am just not seeing the down side when the abstract class is there precisely to provide parent common facility to the children classes and the protected scope is meant to provide access to children while protecting the data from casual users

3525765
children	parent
i am trying to focus my question specifically on data existing in an abstract parent intended for use by the children

3525795
getter	setter
if the field is private and access is through getter and setter you will be able to reimplement getter and setter for instance dropping the field and updating reading the value from an external source and thus change how the field works without touching any child classes

3525804
public	protected
think of protected methods as an interface for subclasses in the same way that public methods are an interface for everyone else

3525804
subclass	accessor
providing accessor enables the base class to maintain its state there s no way a subclass would corrupt it without an intentional trick

3525822
switching	screens
i like to switching between the new full screens and old delphi-7-like ide

3525831
getter	setter
if someone subclasses your class and puts the subclass in the same package as your current class they may want to override your getter and setter

3525831
getter	setter
the convention is that there are getter and setter for everything though

3525838
unsigned	short
i use typedef const unsigned short lpcwstr

3525864

3526048
post	get
i would like to get similiar behaviour as spring message tag post message code and get string representation on localized message

3526061
getter	setter
the void createfieldfortype typebuilder typebuilder type fieldtype string fieldname method basically creates a private field and then a public property annotated with datamemberattribute with a public getter and setter

3526103
try-catch	exception-handling
if-else is faster because a try-catch block raises an exception-handling stack trace

3526103
try-catch	exception-handling
you can take it as the if-else block is executing one instruction to do the evaluation but the try-catch will run thousands of instructions to raise the exception-handling when it happens

3526126
formview	entitydatasource
this button updates an entitydatasource that is bound to the formview

3526126

i m developing a vb6 standalone application that i d like to be able to call from vba modules running in excel outlook etc

3526276

ideally i d like the vba module to check whether the vb6 application is already running if not open it then populate certain controls textbox listbox etc in the vb6 application with information from the vba module

3526284
calloc	malloc
one may not safely assume anything about the relative addresses of things in the stack relative to those on the heap nor for that matter the relative addresses of any pointers that are not all derived from the same array or allocated via malloc calloc etc. block

3526299
subtract	add
for example say i had a vector class template with methods for vector operations add subtract dot etc.

3526338
for-loop	loops
in your inner for-loop you are using values of buffer which have not yet been set by your outer loops

3526379

perhaps put in a date also and delete after 10 days in case any rows get left behind

int	chars
if you absolutely want to use filter_var because you want to remove all other chars use filter_sanitize_number_float and then cast to int

3537467

an integer does not have decimal fractions so the validation must fail although i find the sanitation result of 100.50 turning into 10050 pretty bizarre on php s end

3537515

i use jquery to access the height or width i either use

3537515

this may be a newbie question but could anyone please explain the difference between uitouch and uigesturerecognizer

3537528
width	height
i usually do this when you cache the width and height before the hiding you can still use them

when the select is updated i hide the fields that are show so that things like day of the week or days of the month aren t show when it s inappropriate

3537895
int	boolean
because remove int returns the object removed from the list instead of a boolean indicating whether it removed anything

3537906
hide	show
then you would need server-side logic to show hide the fields

3537926
width	height
it could very possibly be that your embed script s width and height attributes are smaller than the movie

3537930
affinity	processors
direct access to system level constructs such as processors affinity and inline assembly can certainly have an impact on performance

3538260
width	height
chrome does something strange in which it resizes only the height but not the width

3538267
ready	each
without this it means making each page live before the whole section is ready - and that s not a suitable solution

3538294
rss	feed
if new articles are added every 10-20 minutes then after an hour you ll have 3-6 after a day you ll have 72-144 after a week you ll have around 500-1000 and after a month you ll have several thousand entries in your rss feed

3538294
rss	feed
i think most desktop rss readers can be configured for how often they should check for updates and for a feed with this kind of traffic most users would probably set their reader to check once an hour or maybe even every 15 minutes

maven	m2e
but unlike with the command-line version of maven which built everything perfectly m2e leaves a large number of build errors in the source code

maven	m2e
when i run the project as maven build right-click- run- maven package it sucessfully creates the war with m2e

stdout	stderr
next we use a little extra helper to handle the merging of the stdout and stderr streams splitting the command over several lines for clarity only so that we can see where the catch wrapper is and where the wrapped exec is

3547385
stdout	stderr
if you re using tcl 8.6 in beta you can use chan pipe to produce a channel that you can redirect stdout and stderr into with the form but that s not so useful to you

unix	solaris
i even tried similar code compiling and usage on solaris unix and i am facing same issue there

3547792
implements	modifiers
my question is is grouping related constants note these are not suitable for an enum consider the math example of the related constants pi and e in an interface versus a non-instantiable class a good idea provided you only access the values via static references and static imports keep the interace hidden from your api w a default access modifiers and never actually implements the interface

3547793
memcpy	strcpy
if you are using memcpy instead of strcpy for some reason you ll have to manually null terminate your buffer

3547961
gif	ico
since ico is vendor specific some choose to go with gif

3547961
png	ico
after reviewing supported formats your best bet is to go with png files if you are trying to get away from ico

3547981
opera	firefox
according to that list firefox and opera are the only ones that support animated gifs and ie doesn t support gif at all

3547989
backgrounding	multitasking
otherwise the app either exits or backgrounding depending on whether you want it to support multitasking and you ll also have to handle it from there

3548431
ant	maven
ant tasks maven plugins for javascript

3548478
dynamic-languages	compiled-language
because you can determine what code in a compiled-language is likely to do better than a dynamic-languages it has been determined more error free to use a compiled perspective for more things so as you can see with the availability of offset-management and lookup compiled behavior given to you in core perl there is no reason to mess with the symbol table if you don t have to

3548487
rpm	yum
i was hoping there was a --test command line argument to yum in a similar way to rpm -i --test but i don t see one

3548771
inherited	properties
by the way if you want to use inherited just to extend some properties and methods you can do this by using composition instead of inherited

3548829
put	get
of course you will need to put the functionality which takes time to a new php file or call the old one with a get parameter which will activate that functionality only

3548832
getter	setter
yes you should unit test even the simplest logic in your getter and setter

3548832
getter	setter
the only time i don t test getter and setter is if they are doing only simple assignment or returning a value

3548861
serializable	deserialization
i had a similar problem with serializing immutable types before in the end i decided to implement the iserializable interface and use the serializationinfo to store retrieve the private variables at both ends of the serializable deserialization process

3548867
hex	binary	octal	binary	octal	hex
for integers using binary octal and hexadecimal seems fairly straight forward since each digit in the string represents a set group of bits eg for the 2 hex digits i know its xxxxyyyy so i could do it with bit shifts and taking one digit at a time eg for the hex string 0xfa20 the value is 15 12 | 10 8 | 2 4 | 0 0

3548869
maven	pom.xml

if the super implementation of initwithcolor calls self init - which is often the case and even if not could change with future releases of cocos2d - it would call your implementation of init resulting in an endless loop stack overflow

3549252
udp	tcp
check if tcp is matched on the first line and udp on the second line

3549260
int	double
option 1 gives you an if parsed block whereas option 2 throws an error for any double that s not representable as an int

3551163
inherited	properties
the following class provides a generic base class for outerspace with constraints on its parameters that enforce inherited rules on the properties types

3551163
inherited	properties
the appeal of this approach is that it permits you to return strongly typed properties and enforce a basic inherited constraint on the types of those properties

3551172
width	height
additionally you can limit width and height setting android maxwidth and android maxheight attributes to prevent minature to be too large

3551188
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
rather you should use a series of waithandles specifically an autoresetevent or manualresetevent which your threads will signal when they are done with their work

children	parent
or more to the point each parent has a variable number of children where the number is always greater than zero but can and will vary from instance to instance

3551388
children	parent
if this is not the case if a parent tournament or match will always have the same number of children then there might be some minor advantage in denormalizing the data like a table with seven columns for the weekdays but that may prove awkward in the long run

3551406
serializable	deserialization
if the entire purpose of the serializable deserialization is to be able to transfer data via http odata already solves this for you

3551451
post	get
i can access the service fine through my browser post to but if i try to post the same information via curl i get a 404 error

what lib is better to use to unrar rar files and unzip zip files in java 1.4

3551470
illegalstateexception	illegalargumentexception
the exception classes that are recommended here include illegalstateexception illegalargumentexception unsupportedoperationexception etc

3551485
ssl	https
it looks like you re serving your site over ssl https but serving some of the content almost certainly something in the menu - such as an image over http hence you re receiving the mixed mode warning

3551567
post	get
anyway i can post with curl to this page and get a response

3551585
awt	swing
every update to the ui must happen from the so-called edt â the event-dispather thread which is the main gui thread swing and i think awt uses

3551588
post	get
ok i m pretty new at programming and have been using curl to execute scripts in other folders of my site and passing get and post variable that way

3551614
spaces	delimiter
not having a spaces delimiter between attribute name and its value actually improves the readability as it visually shows the coupling between these

3551614
spaces	delimiter
no spaces delimiter

3551614
spaces	delimiter
spaces delimiter

3551657
raphael	excanvas
conversely if you want something that will work with old versions of internet excanvas may not work not sure if excanvas supports ie6 but svg does to some extent raphael supports ie6

3551661
post	get
i know thats where any cookies i get back are stored when i do any post

3551662
post	get
i think this is the only way to do this if the script is expecting get or post variables

3551676
folder	directory
also see if there is any path in the linker - additional include directory refers to my documents ... projects folder

3551692
spaces	delimiter
the equal sign the quotes and the fact that the attribute is always on the left and the value on the right is a clear enough visual delimiter adding spaces breaks this effect and adds unnecessary bytes to the file

3551740
children	parent
when a click occurs the tree is walked from top-down which means children before parent and siblings in order

3551752
r-tree	quadtree
i guess an r-tree or quadtree would be a perfect data structure for this but i haven t been able to find a working ruby implementation

3551760
gridview	repeater
now if your linkbutton is used in a gridview repeater or some type of control that requires binding to fill it in then you will probably need to implement a rowcommand event handler to figure out which linkbutton is pressed

3551760
post	get
since you are using a linkbutton you can use the following to get what control caused the post back

3551794
dns	spf
i have spf set up on my dns and i m sending from the spf verified server if that s of any help

3551813
submit	submission
search engine submission - allows you to submit the website to a variety of search engines from an admin interface

3551823
equals	gethashcode
in your last edit you mention that the reason that you don t implement equals and gethashcode is because the code for your classes is auto-generated and you don t want to have to re-implement that code each time you regenerate the code

3551946
post	get
get and post information would be vital too

3551958
post	get
on the torrent for your software post a comment saying you re the developer of this software and while you re glad to see that people like it the money from software sales goes directly to you and your dog and no one else and you can t afford to keep making software if you don t get paid

3551961
cpu	processors
for example on the zilog z80 processors the machine code 00000101 which causes the cpu to decrement the b processors register would be represented in assembly language as dec b

3551972
sqldatasource	detailsview
i have the following detailsview with several boundfields and sqldatasource that populates the fields

3551999
int	double
there is an example on cdecl that goes double int foofoo means cast foofoo into block int returning double

3552019
post	get
you asked for get and post information

3552031
arcgis	proj

3552108
cgpoint	cgrect
i have the cgpoint and frame cgrect of the objects within each quartile

3552128
google-chrome	safari
there is the use of a custom protocol for sure but some browsers like google-chrome safari sometimes have issues with custom protocol handling so it is not reliable enough .

3552153
cout	cin
cout and cin have applications that fprintf and fscanf are very difficult to use

3552153
cout	cin
when tuning a program s performance based on cout cin vs

3552177
kerberos	ntlm
the only difference between the between the 2 environments is we are using kerberos instead of ntlm in our production environment

3552240
switching	screens
if you switching off the optimize code option in the project properties - build screens then both release and debug build produces the same result which shows badguy at the top of the stack trace

3552242
int	chars
add up all the chars casted as int

3552242
int	chars
add up squares of chars again casted as int

3552244
inline	inlining
inlining that makes an inline

3552253
mongoid	mongomapper
mongodb has two popular orms for rails mongoid and mongomapper

3552262
apache	nginx
i think there are also plugins for apache and i am sure for nginx

3552266
kerberos	ntlm
the difference between ntlm and kerberos is huge

3552266
kerberos	ntlm
with ntlm you can use pass-through authentication with kerberos you cannot

3552266
kerberos	ntlm
understanding kerberos and ntlm authentication in sql server connections

3552295
enlive	hiccup
there is a number of clojure-specific solutions including enlive and hiccup enlive is a very powerful html scraping templating transforming engine

3552346
typedef	struct
now symtable is the typedef for a struct

3552346
typedef	struct
the struct and typedef are in an included file

3552346
typedef	struct
quad is the typedef for a struct typedef struct quad quad

3552346
typedef	struct
the struct and typedef are in an included file

3552357
textview	imageview
my app has widgets that have an imageview and a textview

3552430

post	put
verbs are post delete and put

3552444
wordpress	joomla
i would start with a cms such as joomla or perhaps even wordpress

3552464
hash	md5
recently i discovered that it stores passwords as plain md5 hash which is quite bothersome to me

3552483
textarea	textbox
i don t see any dom methods for a textbox or textarea that allow control of scroll position

3552521
960.gs	fluid
you can try fluid24 it is a fluid 24 columns grid system based on 960.gs

3552536
hash	salt
i believe it hash passwords and security answers using salt sha1

3552541
put	get
you could put that into a for-loop to get them all

3552544
hash	salt
passwords should be hash and salt never encrypted much less encoded

3552544
hash	md5
also all hash functions will generate an output that has a fixed size 32 characters in case of md5 40 in sha1 etc. so you don t need all that extra space

3552631
spaces	delimiter
they are tab delimiter and some are spaces delimiter

3552634
subtract	add
you can edit the link later on to add or subtract typeids

3552667
rss	feed
just grab the rss feed from your blog and parse it

3552675
double-pointer	pointers
problem 2 you need to know the size of the string for each pointers in the double-pointer

3552697
put	get
at least try to get some funding for a full size test system and put the procedures in place to make moving production data to it automatic so you can fully test this thing

3552711
twitter	bit.ly
i ve tried using localhost 300 twitter auth and a bit.ly for each of the former 2

3552801
lisp	scheme
swank servers exist for many common lisp implementations and lisp dialects such as clojure and gambit scheme

3552828
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox google-chrome ect

3552886
implements	extends
you could implements extends your own priorityqueue that simply checks every new intent added to the queue

3552889
width	height
taking either the width of your object or the height of your object you can come up with a relationship between constant width in your object and the width of your object in the scene as it changes in distance

3552914
subtract	add
both allows you to perform simple atomic operations on data such as simple add subtract on values though

3552920
post	get
resolved 405 was because i was sending a post instead of a get

3552938
hide	show
if you show and hide scope buttons on some event you need to adjust the frame size each time

3552958
prepare	execute
the benefits of prepare statements can be read here but in general the same statement will only need to be compiled once but can be execute as many times as you want with different parameters which can make your script more efficient

3552999
children	parent
the entire purpose of inheritance is that multiple children can inherit common functionality from a parent

3553037
getter	setter
for example i d create customer with it s property getter and setter and then customermanager with all the methods related to customer class for example getcustomer getorders etc...

3553039
textmate	aptana	dreamweaver	aptana
the coding environment they use reflects this variety and whilst some coders are comfortable writing an entire application using only textmate some others prefer to work with aptana the flash ide or dreamweaver no quality comparison here

3553047
int	double
i am dividing two int values and im expecting to get a double one

3553049
int	chars
when converting form string to int what happens if i pass a chars string

3553059
int	double
cast at least one of the int to double before dividing

3553069
google-chrome	firefox
watin or imacros for ie firefox google-chrome

3553071
int	double
the result of the division is cast to a double after int division with rounding down is performed

3553071
int	double
cast one of the int to a double before dividing so that double division occurs

3553075
int	double
in order to get a double answer you must cast one of the int to a double

3553085
firefox	safari
i didnt have prblems with safari nor firefox

3553085

it works fine in firefox and opera but ie safari and google-chrome do not work

3553156
put	get
i would like to get all of the values and put it into a array

3553157
prepare	execute
prepare execution is commonly used by applications to execute the same parameterized sql statement repeatedly

3553157
prepare	execute
prepare execution is faster than direct execution for statements execute more than three or four times because the statement is compiled only once while statements execute directly are compiled each time they are execute

3553157
prepare	execute
prepare execution can also provide a reduction in network traffic because the driver can send an execution plan identifier and the parameter values rather than an entire sql statement to the data source each time the statement is execute

3553203
zoo	xts
xts requires an explicit time index but it s based on zoo which has no such requirement

3553203
xts	quantmod
the downside is that you won t be able to use those objects with quantmod chartseries because it requires an xts object

3553214
nextuntil	each
you could loop through each question and looking through it s answers using nextuntil with .filter to see if there any checked ones like this

3553235
installation	upgrade
if they are not provided the installation may silently fail to upgrade your app or at least that s what i ve found though i m still a little unsure whether the same behaviour applies under system.diagnostics.process.start

3553255
hide	show
to get around this you could add an onchange handler to your and then check in that function if you should show or hide the address

3553328
width	height
it can resize images by specifying height and width attributes but they won t look good

3553376
ssl	https
then the info therein should be safe to use one-time as basically a temporary password sent again over ssl because the gateway is also https

3553387
inherited	subclassing	public	protected
of course when you extend a class the subclassing inherited all of the public and protected methods from the parent class

3553407
versioning	upgrade
just upgrade my laptop s ram 3 days ago and switched to 64-bit versioning of win7

3553408
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox does not support mp3 files in html5 only google-chrome and safari so far may be ie9 will later

3553428
qmainwindow	qwidget
the app has a qwidget as its main window not qmainwindow qlistview is contained in the qwidget object and created by passing a point to the main window

3553454
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
like many other developers out there i ve created iphone projects that use a uitabbarcontroller as the root controller with the tab views using uinavigationcontroller s to drill down from lists to detail views

3553492
put	get
the filename needs to get placed inside the image column in the database table and the file needs to be put in the directory as well

3553516
put	get
also a bit of multitasking advice if you get bored doing any one thing for too long put it down and come back and finish it later

3553519
for-loop	loops
and so on - and we break off that loops after 100 000 lines next time the for-loop will continue reading exactly where this one left off

3553519
for-loop	loops
the for-loop s else clause executes if and only if the break within that loops didn t therefore if we ve read less than 100 000 lines -- when the input file is finished

3553544
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works on firefox google-chrome safari and opera .

3553550
folder	directory
it takes a folder name in a specified directory on the server and calls a php page using urlrequest to get the workable contents of the folder

3553577
glassfish	geronimo
for example say i want to deploy on geronimo and later want to use glassfish how difficult would the transition be

3553589
onclick	onscroll
when i swipe on a page that scrolls i get something full of in onclick in onscroll in onfling etc

3553600
accessor	properties
this happens because browsers provide shortcut accessor to form elements properties that refer to the elements are bound to the form element using the name attribute as the properties name

3553618
integer	unsigned
as to why you can t get a full 2 32 perhaps something is using a signed rather than unsigned integer to store addresses and one bit is unavailable

3553625
min	max	minimum	max
if you re looking for the minimum and maximum from a list just set min and max initially to the first value in the list then run through the list comparing each value with min and max and adjusting them accordingly

3553626
hide	show
i need to show hide this stackpanel what is the best way

3553634
powerpc	i386
so to be able to build a python interpreter that will work on 10.4 through 10.6 you would use gcc-4.0 set macosx_deployment_target to 10.4 the minimum os x level needed to run use the corresponding sdk for 10.4 it s somewhat confusingly called 10.4u as in universal and is an optional install for the 10.6 versions of the xcode developer tools and set the universal architectures to i386 and powerpc the only two that are fully supported at run time on all of those systems

3553634
powerpc	i386
this can result in the problem that 3rd-party non-python libraries you install can t be statically or dynamically linked with the python extension module because there is no compatible common architecture since the python.org python includes only the 32-bit i386 and powerpc archs

3553634
macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew	fink	macports
for many popular python packages with 3rd-party library dependencies pil and mysqldb come to mind there is another approach to minimizing compatibility problems and that it is to use a complete solution python python packages and 3rd-party libraries from one of the third-party open source package distributors for os x such as macports homebrew or fink

3553680
int	double
passing double int strings arrays

3553693
vaadin	wicket
am torn between wicket and vaadin

3553693
vaadin	wicket
i have narrowed down my choices to wicket and vaadin

3553715
post	put
i m getting an argument error whenever i run an rspec test on any controller action that uses a post or put action

3553739
mongoid	activemodel
it s even easier if you use rails 3 because mongoid and activerecords uses activemodel as the interface

3553755
free	malloc
gdb-arm-apple-darwin 3441 malloc error for object 0x4601e0 incorrect checksum for free object - object was probably modified after being free

3553755
free	malloc
gdb-arm-apple-darwin 3441 malloc error for object 0x42a7d0 incorrect checksum for free object - object was probably modified after being free

3553755
free	malloc
gdb-arm-apple-darwin 4195 malloc error for object 0x45e710 incorrect checksum for free object - object was probably modified after being free

3553776
children	parent
i want to match parent s height with the total height of its children so the content does not flow out from parent s border

3553785
width	height
make sure you change the width height parameters i set if you use mine

3553792
graphviz	gephi
i suggest you give gephi a try as i have found it easier to use than graphviz

3553794
typedef	struct
so the first thing i would recommend is giving the struct proper a name and since this is c++ a typedef does not add any benefit so just drop the typedef

3553818
pop-up	dialog
in the pop-up dialog navigate to jvm tab and check which jre is used to run your script

3553824
gmail	hotmail
in my asp.net application i need to show the email preview of created email like with gmail the email will display some different formatting with hotmail it will some different formatting... p

3553824
gmail	hotmail
so how to provide email preview for the different email providers like gmail hotmail rediffmail etc.

3553905
yacc	bison
is it possible to generate a parser for a scripting language that uses the reverse polish notation and a postscript-like syntax using bison yacc

3553937
hide	show
what i want to do is to show and hide some items above the uiswitch control according to the state of the switch

3553937
hide	show
and the elements should hide and show using the common tableview animations just like the user has added or removed an item

3553940
postgresql	mysql
you might look at postgresql as i find it a bit easier to manage and maintain as i feel some aspects are more logical than mysql

3553973
hide	show
sometimes depends of the input data only one of uitextfields must be show so when second uitextfield is not needed i hide it and recalculate the height of my item renderer

3553979
ubuntu	centos
this used to work on an old centos server with pylons 0.9.7 but now i m trying to set it up on a new one running ubuntu 10.04 and pylons 1.0

3553987
fadein	fadeout
however the built in fadein fadeout methods throw this centering awry and i m not completely sure what is going on

3553991
google-chrome	firefox
in case of google-chrome firefox safari..

3554078
width	height
i need to show the below data in a jtable cell.as of now everything comes in a single line even-though i m overriding the object s tostring method with newline characters.how can i set the jtable to adjust the cell height and width depending on the data

3554079
ienumerable	icollection
well dosomethingwithcollection should accept two parameters - 1 icollection ienumerable that will allow you to enumerate through all values 2 delegate that will take the object and give you key and value back

3554080
getter	setter
for really small functions property getter and setter this cost can be high relative to the actual work done in the function

3554117
ienumerable	icollection
as far as both collections namevaluecollection and keyvalueconfigurationcollection implements both icollection and ienumerable you can do next

3554156
skip-lists	queue	skip-lists	tree
the most simple would be an array but a double-ended queue or an indexed skip-lists b tree could be better depending on the data size we are talking about

3554156
skip-lists	tree	skip-lists	linked-list
conceptually it doesn t change much yet however you get the ability to move to a given index in o 1 array deque o log n skip-lists b tree operations rather than o n with a simple linked-list

3554184
hide	show
while doing so i will show a small div and hide it when we re done hiding it doesnâ t matter the page will already be gone

3554197
put	get
when you drag and drop the source application supplies the data object and that gets put into the system clipboard so that target app where drop would occur could get the data

3554296
hash	md5
i m storing unique user-agents in a mysql myisam table so when i have to look if it exists in the table i check the md5 hash that is stored next to the text field

3554298
activemq	rabbitmq
i have not used activemq or rabbitmq but have used zeromq

3554329
google-chrome	safari
the acceptable web page footprint will be completely different between a user base with 80 ie6 users than that of a page where all users use safari and google-chrome

3554336
coalesce	isnull
i know your schema is contrived but as it stands an isnull or coalesce statement as suggested by mike wonâ t work because the workinglocationid is not nullable and therefore the employee will have to have a location

3554348
hash	md5
you can t store an md5 hash in a 32-bit int it simply won t fit

3554348
hash	md5
in your case binary 16 or varbinary 16 but since md5 hash are always 16 bytes the latter seems a bit pointless

3554350
hash	md5
you can store md5 hash in char 32 which is a bit faster than varchar 32

3554350
hash	md5
it s also possible to make two bigint fields and keep first half of md5 hash in first field and second part in second field

3554386
min	max
above the space where the patches appear is a button labeled settings... click that and then adjust the min max pxcor pycor to create an environment that is the size you wish

3554398
super	self
i would use super b self to get instances of b to call the methods of a

3554403
hash	md5
if your field hash is always an md5 value generated by php then you can safely set it to char 32

3554426
folder	directory
what i end up with in my build folder if i run this is for whatever reason assemblies that aren t fully rewritten by ccrewrite alongside .pdb.original .rewritten and .csproj.filelistabsolute.txt files that litter the output directory

3554547
typhoeus	eventmachine
i believe that libraries such as eventmachine and typhoeus can remedy that but i am also strongly considering node.js because i know javascript quite well and seems to be built for this kind of thing

3554547
websocket	pusher
i am considering plain ajax but that would require polling the server websocket but that would require fallback for older browsers and specific solutions for persistent client server communication such as cramp juggernaut and pusher

3554609
wikitext	mediawiki
my question is is there a convenient way to do the work from markdown to mediawiki wikitext

3554610
user-controls	tabcontrol
edit by trial and error i ve narrowed it down to a single system windows forms user-controls derived control and the crash only occurs when that control is nested within a system windows forms tabcontrol

3554615
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
what you can do is quite involved and a bit of a hack that will work in firefox 2+ ie 5.5+ and recent webkit browsers such as safari 4 or google-chrome untested on older versions

3554624
g++	gcc
i was able to compile your code with g++ with just -pthread and flags alone or with gcc using the previous flags plus -lstdc++

3554673
prepare	execute
i solved it instead of using the prepare statement i used execute statement instead

3554685
fadein	fadeout
what i try is beforchange fadeout and onchange or after fadein

3554685
fadein	fadeout
what i have now is on every settext the changed text only fadeout but after the text has changed and never fadein

3554757
post	get
i ll try to post some actual code when i get home but i hope this helped

3554780
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
turns out it s a bit trickier than that because the behavior is different in firefox than ie safari and google-chrome

3554780
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
example - firefox 3+ ie5+ google-chrome and safari

3554813
config	ini
fwiw i will include ini files in application.cfc based on the environment name that i use for storing environment specific config

3554833
getter	setter
i wonder where did serviceproviderdao come from as i dont remember not using eclipse source creater for getter and setter

3554840
fadein	fadeout
i would give the fadeout animation an animationlistener and on animationend you can then set the new text before starting your fadein animation

3554899
put	get
but when i put a as range after end i get an error

3554908
hash	salt
so after all do i still need to hash and even salt the users passwords

3555010
magick++	pythonmagick

you re probably getting a benign form of undefined behaviour because the x modifier expects an unsigned int parameter and a chars will usually be promoted to an int when passed to a varargs function

3555936
int	chars
you should explicitly cast the chars to an unsigned int to get predictable results

3555936
int	chars
if chars on your platform is signed then this conversion will convert negative chars values to large unsigned int values fffffff5

3555936
int	chars
if you want to treat byte values as unsigned values and just zero extend when converting to unsigned int you should use unsigned chars for pixel_data or cast via unsigned chars or use a masking operation after promotion

of course you need to have apc memcached and memcached installed first

3558172
jax-ws	jax-rs
it is standard included in java se 6 binding layer for jax-ws jax-rs multiple impls

3558357
salt	md5
as said already in the other responses doing a sha1 or an md5 of the userid combined with microtime and some salt string is usually a safe bet

3558369
min	max
for this exercise you have to use the having clause - the where clause doesn t allow you to use aggregate functions min max count... without them being in a subquery but the having clause doesn t have that restriction

3558466
put	get
also the placement of the criteria makes a big difference in results when using an outer join so it is a good habit to get into to put the join criteria in the on in all cases

3558493
selenium	sahi
to easy the writing of each test we are designing a java dsl that can be implemented using different adapters we ve chosen sahi and selenium webdriver so far as we want to measure them side by side in terms of performance readability maintainability etc.

the problem is that the setcontentview of your settings class will reset the layout that was created by your parent class oncreate

3558823
hash	salt
this can be thwarted by a challenge response where the server sends with the page a salt a big random number which is jumbled up with the password and then hash so the response is always different

3558823
hash	salt
so you might have to end up with a sending a salt hashing your password jumbling the hash with the salt by hashing it again and sending that to the server

3558823
hash	salt
the server hash the stored hash of the password from the user db with the salt and compares both

3558826
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
you need to set the qgraphicsscene to the qgraphicsview before anything is drawn

put	get
how do i get a little box to pop up with custom text when i put my mouse over certain text and disappear once i move the mouse to a different object.

3559475
vaadin	wicket
wicket starts off as plain old html and vaadin starts off with a macosx-like theme by default but almost any web-app you write will require at least some customization

3559475
vaadin	wicket
with this in mind customizing the css of a wicket app is significantly easier than vaadin for the simple reason that you control the markup

3559482
actionscript	mxml
you re mixing mxml and actionscript syntax i think

3559482
actionscript	mxml
i do not believe that actionscript can reference the namespace you define in mxml

int	chars
supplying a chars to a d format specifier that expects an int is probably unwise

3560842
int	chars
in this case not only is it apparently signed but also the chars argument has been pushed on to the stack an an int sized object and sign extended so that the higher order bits are all set to the same value as the high order bit of the original chars

3560842
int	chars
i am not sure whether this is defined behaviour or not without looking it up but personally i d have cast the chars to an int when formatting it with d

the file test.php is in htdocs drupal folder is also in the same directory where the include files is

int	chars
a work around solution would be to create a struct or class that contains both an int and a chars variable and assign them accordingly

int	chars
i am not a pro at c++ but i guess you can declare 2 variables one chars and one int

3561471
int	chars
first you can assign the users input to chars than test it if it can be assigned as int and if it can be than your program will start using that

3561497
free	malloc
memory allocation is very slow in my opinion so whatever you can do to get away from malloc free and new in java the better off you ll be

3561804
nasm	fasm
the org statement works the same in fasm as it does in nasm but differently in masm

3561945
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome and firefox 4 beta i don t start seeing output until i ve sent somewhere around 1000 characters i would guess 1024 including the headers or something like that but i haven t narrowed it down to the exact behavior

awk -f 3 499 print 1 etc passwd | sudo grep -f - etc shadow shadow.out

3562070

3562121
post	get
but when i post the data to the controller i can t figure out how to get the data in the expected format

3562251
free	malloc
that said if you are using c++ you shouldn t be using malloc or free at all nor should you be using fread ..

kde	gnome
on linux if you are in gnome kde or probably almost any graphical environment there is probably a command called xdg-open

3562365
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
from my latest experience it s almost always possible to maintain only two versions of these diff files - one for firefox safari google-chrome and another for ie family

3562388
width	height
i personally prefer to concentrate all things like width and height within css classes and avoid to use both attributes like width and inline styles like style width 100px just because it results in nice logical separation - html markup tells what should be displayed and css rules - how exactly it will look

3562394

i don t know about profiling windows code but your program is so small and simple in absolute terms - it s a lot to read on stackoverflow that you could easily instrumentation it manually

3562844
for-loop	loops
also in all the for loops you can make one call to the size function of your vector store it in a temporary variable and use that variable in the for-loop for the condition as long as the size of the vectors doesn t change in the for loops

3562870
profiler	aqtime
a good profiler will do wonders - i ve had good luck on windows with aqtime although it s not free which may not suit you

3562973
jobs	cron
i m really after some other input as i d prefer it to be a background service always running - having a cron execute jobs was painful since some jobs run for 20+ hours so adding new ones was a pain with new php no threading java calls having to check if a service was running with outstanding jobs to add to instead of starting a new service but also have a very simple web interface without too much resource wastage

3562974
mongoid	mongomapper
the last time i used mongoid and mongomapper does not support mapping to gridfs so you would use the driver api for this

3562974
mongoid	mongomapper
and the last time i used mongoid and mongomapper does not support map-reduce again you have to use the driver api for this situation

3562974
mongoid	mongomapper
mongomapper and mongoid is used to map your domain object to mongo document at some stage where the odm is lack of you have to have the fallback plan which is to use the mongo driver api

3562985
button	checkbox
is there an example of a browser-based and preferably open source visual javascript application designer using contenteditable or canvas or whatever perhaps with support for embedded controls and so forth checkbox button etc. or ui controls for various javascript frameworks like jquery.ui dojo yui ... or else support for vector graphics and shapes and so forth canvas svg vector graphics designer

post	get
there are still some problems for me it only post 25 results and i cannot seem to get setmaxresults to work.

3563082
wordpress	joomla
as far as i know the sandbox theme is available across wordpress drupal and joomla

3563082
wordpress	joomla
granted it won t be coded in the same way afaik because wordpress drupal and joomla are structured differently but sandbox is a base designers theme so you could just customize it and your customizations should be fairly easy to cascade through your other systems

opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
in ie and firefox it s 51 66 58 but in opera and google-chrome it s 51 58 66

3563296
opera	google-chrome
why jquery.each sort by key in opera google-chrome

i ve worked extensively with wicket but i ve not had any experience with vaadin so this might be a little biased

to make the widget properly scale to full width and height

3563719

maybe you can extends the uitabbar and implements a scrolling swiping mechanism but i suggest you not to do that

3563733
width	height
the actual problem is not with the initial file size but with the dimensions of the image itself height width colordepth since you don t have access to this information before the file has been uploaded for security reasons you should probably use an uploader written in flash java or silverlight since they do have access to this information beforehand

3563733
width	height
after the upload you can check if the image will exceed your memory limit by calculating the dimensions of the uncompressed image by using getimagesize and using the returned width height and bit depth

3563743

i use the following code to hide and show a box on a bunch of search results

3565078
hide	show
each result has its own toggle and box to show and hide

3565078
hide	show
the problem i have is that clicking any one of the toggles will show and hide all of the boxes on the page and not just the box for the one result

3565091
button	checkbox
button listview combobox checkbox and other therefore library must be small

aren t you after the onpause onresume events

3565195
ienumerable	iqueryable
your find method returns ienumerable which could be the iqueryable returned from your when clause

3565199
button	checkbox
i have to admit for me it sounds a bit unusual and i would probably prefer not to install dynamic button acting on pre-coded sub s instead i would do an initial dialog before the query giving options via checkbox like truncate after x rows y n and the like - but you will have good reasons for doing it your way

3565204

because d specifies that you want to print an int but i is a double

3565233
int	double
because i is a double and you tell printf to use it as if it were an int d

3565296
sorting	grouping
i think you are going to have to sort it in the view because if you want each grouping to have a different sorting you have to do that manually

3565314
free	malloc
how are new delete malloc and free intercepted

3565314
free	malloc
some tools use #define to redefine new delete malloc and free but this relies on the correct order of the include files and may give problems if a class contains a method called free as is the case in qt

3565350
integer	fractions
in your example the sign bit is 0 because the number is positive the fractions part is 0 because the number is initialised as an integer and the exponent part contains the value 1025 2 with an offset of 1023

3565350
floating-point	integer
since the first rightmost 32 bits of the 64-bit floating-point number you supply are all 0 it stands to reason that printf produces 0 as its integer output

3565382
int	double
the simple answer to your question is as others have said that you re telling printf to print a int number for example a variable of the type int whilst passing it a double-precision number as your variable is of the type double which is wrong

3565382
int	double
the other thing you can do is to cast your double to an int like this

3565437
innodb	myisam
first of all mysql allows you to use different table engines in a single table so for example one table could be a myisam table and the other table could be an innodb table it all depends on your need

3565488

3565754
stdout	stderr
think of the console window as nothing more than a ui element that allows the user to view the stdout stderr of your program and to provide stdin

3565769
onfocus	onblur
you should use the onfocus and onblur events rather than relying on click events

3565770
disk	ram
i write a bunch of same-size files on a partition tried both ram disk and virtual disk created via diskmgmt.msc

3565770
disk	ram
it doesn t depend on whether i use a ram disk or a virtual disk hence it is not a problem of a particular implementation

3565770
disk	ram
no bad clusters this is a virtual or a ram disk

3565803
google-chrome	firefox
i want to make a browser toolbar for windows that should work for existing browsers like firefox 2.x 3.x and google-chrome as well in c#.net

3565808
int	chars
the way i ve solved this problem is by using a template class called pod stands for plain old data like chars and int which usually transfer fine between dlls

3565808
free	malloc
note the memory allocation functions used are pod_malloc and pod_free - these are simply malloc and free but using the same function between all dlls

3565808
free	malloc
in my case all dlls use the malloc and free from the host exe so they are all using the same heap which solves the heap memory issue

3565835
opera	firefox
when i press alt ley the keyboardevent.key_down event is not fired and focus moves to browser s main menu ie opera firefox

3565914
fast-forward	merge
so if you actually made commit b on some other branch then merge it fast-forward into jack b would still be listed

3565939
innodb	myisam
james day a mysql support engineer and wikipedia engineer recommends that people use innodb all the time unless for some reason if becomes apparent that you need myisam

3565939
innodb	myisam
for reliability and performance we use innodb for almost everything at wikipedia - we just can t afford the downtime implied by myisam use and check table for 400gb of data when we get a crash.

3565975
udp	tcp
i remember from the networking class in college that udp isn t guaranteed delivery like tcp ip

3565975
udp	tcp
and wikipedia says that snmp can be run over tcp ip but udp is more common

3565975
udp	tcp
i get that some of the advantages of udp over tcp ip are speed broadcasting and multicasting

3565975
udp	tcp
that is yet another reason to prefer tcp ip over udp for network monitoring imo

3566014
udp	tcp
try implementing tcp on your basic agent - it s considerably more complex than a simple agent coded using udp

3566043
google-chrome	firefox
i had a mouseover submenu working very nicely on my site so nicely in fact that it was working exactly right in google-chrome ie 7 8 and firefox but now it s broken somehow and i can t see the problem

3566057

i have all of that done fine but now i d like to embed an image and even audio within the alert dialog that pop-up

3566308
hide	show
starting from this the element s called on find the nearest parent tr then look for the next tr meaning a brother of this parent and find an img with the class of cc and toggle its display value meaning if its visible then hide it and if its hidden show it

3566325
hide	show
.toggle - toggle it show if hidden hide if show

3566375
hash	salt
the password and salt clear values are concatenated and the resulting string is hash

3566375
hash	salt
the salt is then stored in original clear format along with the hash result

3566375
hash	salt
combine the salt from the record with the password the user provided hash the result compare the hash

3566375
hash	salt
in your database now you would store the hash and salt used

3566375
hash	salt
in either case you have to load the salt and password hash out of your database and redo the hash for comparison

3566398
width	height
if i set a fixed width they work as well but i can t set the width as fixed they need to be fluid in case the content of the tab exceeds the basic height

3566463
hash	salt
according to practical cryptography neils ferguson and bruce schneier you should use salt stretched hash for maximum security

3566478
versioning	upgrade
the third is to upgrade to a new versioning of delphi and hope that it solves your problems without creating new ones

addclass	removeclass
and addclass when dragging start with styles that couse image will be bigger and removeclass when drag stops

3566504
hash	salt
i am querying if you know the users salt and hash isn t it quite easy to calculate their password

3566504
hash	salt
we will assume we are a corrupt webhost that has access to a database of sha1 hash and salt along with your algorithm to blend them

3566508
post	get
post full code pinvoke definitions and call to setscrollinfo to get more information

3566519
post	get
you are using the post method to send the data but then are trying to get it with the get method

3566551
hash	salt
an additional benefit of using salt is that an attacker cannot pre-compute the password hash from his dictionary

3566551
hash	salt
corollary of the article use salt hash created with bcrypt based on blowfish or eksblowfish that allows you to use a configurable setup time to make hashing slow

3566555
hash	salt
adding a salt make attacker perform hash calculation of all possible passwords even for dictionary attach this significantly increases time of attack

3566580
pbkdf2	hash
many people use pbkdf2 a key derivation function that feeds back results to the hash function thousands of times

3566580
pbkdf2	hash
key-strengthening is part of the standard key derivation algorithms pbkdf1 and pbkdf2 from pkcs #5 which make great password obfuscation algorithms the derived key is the hash

3566580
hash	salt
of course you assume the attacker has everything salt hash user name

3566582
crypt	hash
this is how the unix crypt library works and modern unix-like oses have extended this library with new hash algorithms

3566625
hash	salt
salt makes rainbow table attacks much more difficult since it makes a single password hash much harder to crack

3566625
hash	salt
now your lousy password of 1 is stored in the db as a hash of 1 plus a bunch of random characters the salt so in this example the rainbow table needs to have the hash for something like 1

3566650
tiff	png
i am able to convert a single page tiff to a png in .net however how would i do this for a multipage tiff

3566658

3566725
listview	gridview
someone suggested using listview with a gridview grouping my items of same bar in another object this would relieve me of creating the rows dynamicly but creating the columns dynamicly seems quite complicated

the problem occurs on webkit engine browsers safari google-chrome which just put normal characters l instead of å like i wouldn t hold my alt key

3567222
opera	firefox
internet explorer and firefox don t have such problems while opera prevents from typing anything in

3567250
versioning	upgrade
a database obviously can have only one versioning 10.2.0.5 for example which means that upgrade and patches will affect all schemas -- this may be a bad thing in case of multiple vendor app requirement mismatch

3567297
hash	salt
with salting if the number of possible salt values substantially exceeds the number of users in the known universe each candidate password must be hash separately for each user against whom it will be tested

3567313
public	protected
but your functions and variables in the user class have to be protected or public to be accessible for the user_add class

3568744
versioning	upgrade
i can see two reason based on the info provided either its a object corruption issue due to access garbage collection or compaction in a java heap possibly perm region--just a guess based on the occupancy shown in the heap stats or may be a object corruption due to jit compiled code.first is kinda difficult to figure out because it needs the system dump analysis but looks like second one is easy to check by disabling jit using -xint option.you can try this and if it resolves the issue than possibly jit is doing something bad.you can check in the latest release if something is fixed in jit in recent time and can upgrade to latest versioning

3568783
udp	tcp
udp is significantly easier do you really need tcp btw

3568824

ubuntu	debian
under debian and ubuntu s default configuration sites are loaded in alphabetical order using apache s include directive so you can change the order in which your sites load by changing their names

i have already converted a string and int into their respective hex values but a double seems to be much more tricky

3569092
keydown	keyup
note that keydown and keyup provide a code indicating which key is pressed while keypress indicates which character was entered

3569092
keydown	keyup
for example a lowercase a will be reported as 65 by keydown and keyup but as 97 by keypress

3569120
min	max
you need to use an aggregate function such as min or max to pick a value that represents the collection and use that value for the ordering

3569148
accessor	properties
your properties could also have accessor only

3569148
getter	setter
the problem with this however is properties that have different getter setter name

3569217
folder	directory
i was making a bash script for my server which pack some directory with rar and upload it to other ftp server so some folder are big and i have to rar them in parts and have to wait for all parts to be rared before uploading them which consumes lots of time and space

3569224

simply create a java directory under main src main java and right-click - build path - use a source folder

3569226

3569235
int	chars
can somebody give me a example how do i multiple inherit int float from first class and chars string from second class into the third class

3569272
public	protected
in order to access these from within c methods they would have to have been originally declared as public or protected rather than private but that is not good design

3569282
int	chars
do you mean inheriting from a class with int and float field and a second class containing a chars and string field

3569290

i don t know why you re keen to use the bin lib folder -- it makes more sense to have them point at things explicity rather than having parent projects export into children .

3569465
hash	salt
also - one more imporatant point - using a user-specific salt prevents the detection of two users with the same password - their hash would match

3569465
hash	salt
that s why many times the hash is hash salt + username + password

3569513
width	height
let s say you want to give it a width of 500px and you want the height to be static at 300px

3569513
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
without the margin the element s top left corner will be 50 from the top and 50 from the left so we need to use margin to move it back half of it s width and half it s height

inherited	properties
there are inherited read-only properties which you can t apply for new instance manually

you can get around this by moving your code to after the element is created in your html or put it within a dom loaded event listener

inherited	properties
this included changing it to inherited from nsmanagedobject changing my properties to dynamic removing release calls etc

3570451
width	height
the better way to handle that is to have the hover pseudo selector applied to only the a element and make set display block on it with height and width set to 100

3570471
integer	fractions
i understand that gl_repeat parameter will ignore the integer portion of the texture coordinate only the fractions part is used when doing texture mapping

you may first use r to convert keys to a coherent interval of int as.numeric factor ... and then use boolean array in c to obtain unique key number easily and very fast

3570489
mef	prism
both prism and mef were originated by microsoft

3570500
hide	show
you should instead use a popup control that you show and hide when appropriate

3570685
udp	tcp
question i would like to be able to pin my tcp and udp connections to specific local network interfaces

3570688
ienumerable	ienumerator
hence the class can implicitly implement only one and must hide the other or both since one can always cast the result an to the result-type of the other an ienumerator then the most sensible behaviour is generally to implicitly implement the version and explicitly implement the ienumerable one normally by returning the result of the other

3570718
uiview	subviews
in my iphone app i have a uiviewcontroller with two subviews a main uiview let s call it mainview and a secondary uiview let s call it secondview which is usually hidden but is sometimes shown user settings

by binary parsing composing i mean creating a new tree of parsers composers that holds and reads data for these objects and passing this around to have my objects push pull their data

3570924

xslt	xquery
is there a way to set the base uri in xslt so it applies for the whole document like in xquery

3571071

3571362
free	malloc
if the buffer needs a different lifetime to have a size known only at run time or to live and die in response to external events at run time then it should be allocated on the heap with malloc and friends and released eventually with free or possibly the termination of the process

3571364

3571419
awt	swing
from what i know and have been reading converting from awt to swing seems to be quite mechanical

3571419
awt	swing
with the exception of the different threading model most of swing components generally map well with the awt ones

3571442
awt	swing
why a script changing awt to swing component names will not be sufficient

3571442
awt	swing
scrolling is different between an awt textarea built-in swing jtextarea wrapped in a jscrollpane

3571442
awt	swing
override paint graphics in awt paintcomponent graphics in swing

3571539
getter	setter
it seems that setting the right getter setter for your member variable with property is the right way to go more than just declaring it private in the interface

3571547

catransition	subviews
i want add subviews with animation like catransition but with this class we have only several different animation type

3571687
children	parent
the above logic avoids the need for the parent thread to join the child thread yet allows the parent thread to block until all the children are done

3571721
mouseover	mouseout
instead of mouseout and mouseover which fire even when entering a child you can use .hover like this

3571721
mouseleave	mouseenter
.hover maps to the mouseenter and mouseleave events which don t fire when entering leaving children which is what s causing the double animation in your current code

3571729

if you leave your singleton instance accessor as a properties you don t need an objectdataprovider

3572058
qstring	qdir
you can use qdir homepath to get a qstring to the home directory of the current user s profile but i m not sure that there is a standard download directory identified by the os

3572374
memcpy	memmove
memmove can be turned into a memcpy if the two memory regions don t overlap

3572374
memcpy	memmove
memmove doesn t depend on the way the stack grows at all - it merely copies one region of memory to another location - exactly like memcpy except that it handles overlapping regions and memcpy doesn t

3572379
x86	64bit
i believe the reason for the warning is that in x86 builds the __declspec dllexport is exporting the decorated name with a leading underscore but the 64bit compiler does not decorate names with a leading underscore leading to the duplicate

3572383
int	chars
no you re taking an int and are casting it to a chars which is a high-level concept and will internally most likely be done in registers

-p cleaner way to get distinct interpretations of the same memory is to use a union

3572512
put	get
oh and if you are using django s test server i don t know how to get it to recognize these or if it even can but all you need is to run an apache server on your local machine and then put the files in the localhost directory and you can include them through localhost by including their full path in the template also something i do is use amazon s3 to host files since you then get a url for them on there not that you asked about this but its a quick way to host files if you don t have apache running locally

3572533
width	height
width 14 height 346 size 14532

3572568
for-loop	loops
i assume you are talking about the practice of using inside of a for-loop in order to preserve the current value of loops when that inner function later executes.

3572574
int	double
i mean if i want to specify each function and each variable in my code what should it take and what its type int double ...etc .

3572620

3572762
serializable	deserialization
you might want to consider using thrift which includes socket communication libraries and server libraries with the serializable deserialization

3572799
int	chars
if the file is in text format you may be able to fit it in memory just by converting things to int as you read them in since an int stored as chars may take more space than an int stored as an int depending on the size of the int and the type of text file

3572807
min	max
take midpoint of min and max and get count min and max for values either side of the midpoint - by again reading through the file

3572807

repeat for the partition taking into account size of partitions to the left easy to maintain and also watching for min max

3572814
g++	gcc
i++ ++ shouldn t work with either gcc or g++ whether or not they are parsing the file as c or c++ in both languages postfix increment requires an lvalue as an operand and the result is an rvalue

3572829
jqplot	flot
i am sure flot is a very good library but plugins add-ons are not available easily and the examples given on the website are very basic so i decided to use jqplot instead

3572949
children	parent
personally i probably do this by creating a custom control with an item property and some sort of either parent or children property

3572949
children	parent
the control would display details on item and then use a repeater to show each element in parent children where for each item the repeater recursively uses the same control to render the item

3572967
metaphone	soundex
check out double metaphone an improved soundex from 1990

3573019

src	attr
my brainiac thought was to add that snippet of code this attr src

3573236
accessor	properties
with automatic kvo support people could simply declare properties for the operation lifecycle flags isexecuting etc. and trigger the kvo events through the accessor ie

3573247
memcpy	strncpy
also note that i ve used memcpy instead of strncpy to move data to the buffer

3573323
hide	show
this will hide all the images then show it when it loads completely

3573445
inherited	properties
i have a set of nested ant build files and i need to control which properties are inherited by each sub task

3573445
inherited	properties
i m trying to define these as propertysets to keep the code manageable but these are not inherited by subtasks unlike properties

3573445
inherited	properties
if i define each properties to be inherited explicitly like they get inherited by the bottom project too

3573445
inherited	properties
is there any way to get a group of properties to inherited all the way down in the same way individual properties do

3573527
cos	sin
but if you link against it and use cos you don t end up with a copy of the code for sin or tan unless you also called those functions

3573550
memcached	apc
what i did is implement a fast ring-buffer for messages and status information in shared memory sysv back in the day - today i would probably use apc or memcached

3573550
fflush	gets
all operations write and read in the buffer and the buffer itself gets periodicaly fflush into the database to persist it but alot less often than once per second per user

3573583

3573640
getter	setter
you can add logic to the setter to the getter and more

3573668
width	height
i tried with a tablelayout and 3 tablerows but i can t change width height at runtime

3573705
accessor	properties
beside the advantages of encapsulation we prefer using properties with get and set accessor among many other ways because they provide a clear and practical syntax

3573718
junit	testng
junit is famous and best unit test tools i think you and me both know junit is so important so that java developer changes their coding pattern as junit contribution you can learn some junit as basic unit test technology as well as learn testng as second unit test technology

3573731
division	multiplication
a pure regular expression solution is a bit inelegant because it has to repeat captures multiple times to accomodate multiplication and division

3573740
width	height
after all rotations find a block that have highest height width ratio and rotate initial letter to that position

3573753
sdl	clutter	clutter	cairo

3573789
portrait	landscape
when uploaded using bestfit there is a lot of whitespace on the sides of the image depending on portrait or landscape

3573789
width	height
what i d rather it did was resize to fill the entire area no whitespace and crop the longer length height or width ie i d rather lose some image than have whitespace

3573855
submit	submission
turns out the problem was because i d previously had my input fields inside a set of tags and jquery was dutifully submission my content - which doesn t need the projectid explicitly passed since that is part of the query string and is handled by mvc - and then upon seeing the form was actioning a submit call which redirected back to the same page

3573913
getter	setter
i would just say that using getter and setter on private fields give you more control over those fields

3573913
getter	setter
you may want to allow only to read values and not update them then you can have only getter and no setter

3573928
x86	64bit
that is because 64bit windows can run 32 bit x86 by emulating a 32 bit os

3573931

the best you could do is write a custom action that walks your featuretree and disables parent when children and not set to install

3574522
ant	maven
use ant or maven to build the war file and deploy it by hand

3574530
folder	directory

hash	md5
when using oracle forms to generate md5 hash i get result that is different from the result given by tomcat

3574568

mouseup	mousedown
i am looking for an nsbutton raising the click event on mouseup even if the mousedown has been made outside the button

3574611

the variables have all been declared as iboutlet property synthesize and the code sits in an ibaction method which is connected to the segmented control

3574665
post	get
that entirely depends on the kind of request post or get and the available parameters

3574719

i would like an index action to be able to take get and post methods is this possible and if so how

3574814
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
once again ie is proving to be the biggest pain in the world on headset.no we have a small blue search field when you type for example jabra into it it should generate a div that gives you suggestions underneath this works perfectly in google-chrome safari opera and firefox but of course ie has another idea of what to do with it

3575016
children	parent
i found that the other selectors were parent of my #connectionscount element so i needed to check the children

3575132
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
generally speaking when you add a uiviewcontroller to a uinavigationcontroller that viewcontroller is retained and you should release it

3575137
sysv	systemd
assuming you re on a systemd that allows sysv ipc calls you can use ipc sharelite to share a chunk of memory between the two processes

3575152
put	get
what i have done is put a system search on the registry and i get the installed location of program for which i want to ship the plugin

3575157

google-chrome	firefox
maybe loc.lenght is returning 0 in ie 8 and google-chrome but null in firefox which would break the whole calculation

3575296
user-controls	tabcontrol
i have a tabcontrol on a user-controls backed by a viewmodel and the visibility of one of the tab items is bound to a property on the viewmodel

3575312
int	chars
for example it is possible reinterpreting a chars array as an int array could cause the target architecture to throw an interrupt because different types may have different alignment rules

3575321
inherited	properties
so all the inherited methods are synchronized but what about the other methods of properties such as store load etc

3575349
hide	show
some parts of my dropdown menu overlap the div and causes the menu to blink hide under the pdf then show on top as you scroll over it

3575373
udp	mtu
using udp with localhost is at least an order of magnitude faster than over a network connection maybe two orders of magnitude and i believe with localhost there is no mtu ceiling of 1500 as normally exists for network ports

3575373
udp	mtu
with udp i have to hand it a packet at a time limited by the mtu size resulting in a much larger number of os calls

3575455
put	get
any dba worth his salt however will cluster differently but folks who don t pay attention to that clustering and who also use uuids guids in the microsoft world tend to get some nasty slowdowns on insert-heavy databases because the clustered index has to be recomputed every insert and if it s clustered against a uuid which could put the new key in the middle of the clustered sequence a lot of data could potentially need to be rearranged to maintain the clustered index

3575515
lxml	beautifulsoup
but i looked at beautifulsoup and lxml and didn t find something that will help to parse it

3575534
versioning	upgrade
when you upgrade to a new versioning of java or some other library sometimes a method or a class you were using becomes deprecated

3575552

use beautifulsoup or lxml to handle parsing the html page

3575554
freebsd	linux

i assigned two properties named property 1 and property 2 each defined in root with values root prop 1 and root prop 2 respectively

3575683
mockups	balsamiq

since post request is separate i have to do all the stuff i already did in a get request again

3575711
opera	firefox
i m opera user for browsing and firefox user for developing

3575726
groupbox	panel
you will need to write a recursive function to find all of the buttons probably though since a panel or groupbox etc contains a controls property for all of its controls

3575745
jlabel	jeditorpane
it contains one north readonly jeditorpane one center jpanel with a flowlayout whereby jbuttons are added dynamically and one south jlabel all added in that order

3575764
google-chrome	firefox
if you use google-chrome you can use the developer-view or you can install firebug for firefox

3575800
post	get
will post here a link as soon as i get the changes

3575801
versioning	upgrade
it prevents downgrades giving a localised error message and also prevents upgrading an already existing identical versioning only lower versioning are upgrade

3575896
sudo	passwd
if you have administrator privileges you can execute a sudo chmod on the file and set it to read only if you want but you shouldn t make your app ask the user for their passwd

3575945
prepare	execute
when i set out yesterday to change my old mysql code to mysqli the docs steered me down the road of prepare bind_params and execute

3575960
exponent	modulo
you need first to extract the modulo and public exponent from the xml

3575960
exponent	modulo
the php pear crypt_rsa module can construct rsa public keys from modulo and exponent but its tostring method uses a custom format just the base64-encoding of the result of php serialize on the array structure which has nothing to do with the asn.1 der encoding

3575968
width	height
i also do have an rectangle with known width and height

3575978
pop-up	dialog
this will pop-up a dialog allowing you to add a project from elsewhere in source control

you can consider std ostringstream as a replacement for sprintf

3576027
google-chrome	firefox
not surprisingly it works great in firefox and google-chrome but ie mangles the result where a profile pic appears to be set to float over the other fields and i ve got three other divs status-content status-txt msgft containing content from a database that i m not even sure where they are going

3576027
google-chrome	firefox
here is what it a pic of the render issue with ie8 on top and google-chrome firefox on the bottom

3576054

properties supplied to the ant task inherited all the way down as you say so you only need to change top.xml

3576072
google-chrome	firefox
but this event is fired to early google-chrome firefox and ie

3576132
uiview	subviews
i simply add the scroll view as a subviews of the uiview and it appears just fine however when i scroll it it moves outside of the bounds of that uiview effectively covering up any ui elements that are placed above it

3576137
stdout	stderr
since stdout file descriptor 1 and stderr file descriptor 2 are valid for the whole process and you can t make one part of the program have it point to a different file there s only one way to do it use dup 2 to duplicate them and use those file descriptors in your own code

3576147
google-chrome	firefox
also firefox and google-chrome allow to loop through .style property the same way as looping through an array

3576157

3576361
width	height
after looking over the interwebs it looks like for some reason wpf doesnt support this kind of usage with 2d controls like silverlight does however after scouring i managed to find thriple which looked like it was what i wanted however i find trying to create my ui in the xaml editor a nightmare with it as it seems to stretch and skew everything and ignores the width height as if it is automatically scaling everything

3576366
versioning	upgrade
how can i upgrade php to 5.3 versioning at debian lenny from squeeze packages

3576368
put	get
sadly the process wordpad in fact get s injected with this dll but dies of a terminal death - heh a lethal injection to put it another way.

3576372
innodb	myisam
this being mysql you can t use transactions with myisam tables you ll need the tables to use some engine that supports this probably innodb

3576374
serializable	deserialization
it is a bad idea to try to serializable these objects but if you change the inner class so that it is static deserialization may work

3576380
unix	solaris
i use the following sed command in unix solaris

3576381

i thought one could create a class and let it inherited the properties of another using such syntax which is evidently not the case

3576977
sorting	filtering
the user can manipulate the query by filtering or sorting

3577012
int	double
if you are only using int then use varchar not nvarchar nvarchar uses double the storage of varchar...of course if you properly normlized the db you would not have these problems

3577021
tinyint	varchar
why dont you just make country_id a tinyint unsigned and have an iso_code varchar 3 column which is unique

3577052

3577120
inherited	properties
this allowed for inherited of default monster properties

3577140
16-bit	64bit
various types of pointers were common on 16-bit systems though near fear distinctions could reappear in 64bit systems depending upon how they re implemented i wouldn t be surprised if many development systems go to 64bit pointers for everything despite the fact that in many cases that will be very wasteful

3577141
subclass	abstract-class
a completely different abstract-class unrelated to the interface with a subclass which implements our interface

3577151
implements	extends
it all boils down to the fact that extends is a is-a relationship while implements is a has-a relationship

so i wanted a centered constant width three-column layout that was compatible with ie and whose columns would stretch to all be of equal height equal to the height of whichever column had the tallest content

3577515
width	text-align	width	margin	margin	text-align
after combining the techniques i found here on stack overflow with a nifty css hack for fixing width issues and the text-align trick for centering as well as experimenting with different margin padding values i have a nearly perfect layout

3578425
matplotlib	mplot3d
first off i think mplot3d worked a bit differently in matplotlib version 0.99 than it does in the current version of matplotlib

3578433
lisp	scheme
if you want a path of lower resistance and you re doing this to understand concepts rather than something you need for a class or work projects look at an alternative to c such as lisp or scheme that will make it easier to build on small experiments

3578437
installation	upgrade
schema upgrade is potentially part of the installation anyway

3578496
typedef	typename
typename is the answer to at least 50 of all c++-template-related questions - it tells the compiler that what follows is always a type regardless of the template parameters valueit could for example be a int instead of a typedef for an iterator

3578532
submit	submission
if you want to cancel a form s submission you have to return false on the form s submit event

3578574

folder	directory
the parent directory must be a directory or a drive so you can t select multiple drives in the my computer folder for example

3578637
put	get

that is if i want to put a call to autolockspecialitem into a static table or reasonable facsimile such that i can get autolockswitch member variable

3578712
jobs	cron
until now we haven t really needed to implement a queue system in our infrastructure but now we need some features that cannot be done thru cron jobs too slow

3578713
post	get
what happens if you try to use get instead of post

3578727
httphandler	httpmodule
the usual place to implement this is either using a httpmodule httphandler or overriding page.initializeculture

3578764
folder	directory
question is there a way to do this for an entire folder directory w o individually clicking every file in the folder so that that particular folder directory will be ignored in the build

3578771
jar	war
it is packaged as a war file but every example included with the seam download seem to be packaged in an ear with the seam jar and application code both deployed as ejbs

3578777
post	get
in the second i can t seem to get the login page to post to the login post action let alone make it beyond that

3578886

this is a gross way to do it because it will catch an exception anytime button is clicked by something else than the mouse either touchscreen or keyboard s return

3578944
equals	gethashcode
also equals and gethashcode yes they are overridden

3578958
background-repeat	background-position
also it s probably useful to know that ie6 this png fix won t work with background-position or background-repeat

3578994
int	boolean
you could change the boolean foundit to int count and increment where you set foundit to true

3579000
put	get
if it s in prerender then that s before viewstate is initialized so you re not reloading the data on a postback and you re also not able to get from viewstate because it s not put in there

3579000
post	get
the biggest reason this is a way better solution in general aside from fixing your issue is that your viewstate doesn t get bloated unnecessarily with all your items base64-encoded to boot while still being able to track the selected item in the dropdown turning off viewstate for dropdowns makes it so you can t track your selected item without having to resort to viewing the form post value directly

3579010
rss	feed
i need to complete an rss reader for iphones application a relatively simple one which parses the rss feed displays it in a navigation-table view and when you click on an article you are taken to a main page

3579179
wxpython	listctrl
i got a gui application implemented in wxpython on the main window there is a listctrl used to dispaly the names of the files

3579188
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stderr to stdout so exec et al will fetch error messages by appending to your command

3579217
ant	maven
we currently have an ant based project and are contemplating moving to maven

3579219
google-chrome	firefox
i m working on a javascript keyboard that seeks to enable users to type in various african languages.currently this works fine in ie8 and firefox but not google-chrome and i m actually stuck on this one.what i want to accomplish is for example to type on my physical keyboard q keycode 113 and get é keycode 603 as the output but currently my code does nothing in google-chrome

3579224
int	chars
if you mean that you have an array of int and that you want to print the chars representation of these int assuming it is possible you could try something like

3579224
int	chars
by the way it is not a conversion between and but between int and chars

3579238
getter	setter
edit i should mention that adding the getter does make it work but the getter is getting hit whenever the setter does

3579243
int	double
also there seem to be places in the code where there are floats double being compared with may be int

3579253
nsstring	nsxmlparser
edit to parse the xml within an nsstring you can use the nsxmlparser class

3579286
equals	gethashcode
to elaborate the tuple class provides a proper implementation of gethashcode and equals that respects the values you pass in

3579299
stdout	stderr
the best thing i ve come up with at the moment is which pipes both stdout and stderr to dev null

3579366
put	get
so i get the same thing and when i put django admin in the installed_apps it doesn t fail anymore because the admin module comes with the missing templates and handlers that the tests were complaining about

3579375
post	get
using a http post the values could be passed as key value pairs instead of in the url but in most cases where the operation is idempotent you d most likely want to use get in which case there is no other way

3579382
stdout	stderr
if you don t care about the error itself it is just a warning message by all means re-direct the stdout stderr of the command

3579394
int	double
it s easy to insert standard app settings int double string etc

3579394
int	boolean
the most common types are string int and boolean but you can also store values as color object or as a connection string

3579410
opera	firefox
which works well in firefox and opera

3579425
integer	unsigned
next you can use the function bitshift and multiplication by a scale factor to scale the red green and blue values to a range of 0 to 255 then convert them to an unsigned 8-bit integer using the function uint8

3579449
viewdidload	viewwillappear

each private variable has a getter function but not all of them have setter functions

3579509
icriteria	fluent
by the way icriteria vs iqueryable is not related to fluent nhibernate

3579521
folder	directory
as of now i ve added an tag to jboss-log4j.xml and put the logback-classic-0.9.17.jar file in every jar-filled folder in my jboss directory but i m still getting a classnotfoundexception when jboss tries to look for it on startup

3579570
mef	prism
mef and prism are good example of this type of development pattern

3579602
draggable	droppable
using jquery ui give each row in the table an indication of what row it is and use the accept option of droppable to limit where a specific draggable can be dropped

3579602
draggable	droppable
the accept function checks if the droppable td element s row number is the same as the row number the draggable comes from

3579628
uiview	subviews
i think you could iterate through the subviews property in any uiview then to check if it s specifically a uibutton you can use - bool iskindofclass class aclass

3579649
opera	google-chrome
how can i get the url from a running instance of google-chrome or opera using c# .net windows form app

3579663
udp	tcp
http servers use the tcp protocol and broadcast packets can only be sent through the stateless udp protocol

3579690
folder	directory
the view for the error page is in the shared directory of the views folder

3579692
margin	height
i think that it s really important to know how the box-model works and how to make it work for you in all browsers - there are a few really simple fundamental rules which when obeyed help you to ensure that your x-broswer testing is pain-free - knowing how to add padding or margin to something without breaking your layout allows you to be exact with your designs - i used to leave 20 pixels extra horizontal space in my containers as a way of making my columns never dropped off the edge of a page but now that i know how the box-model works i can use the exact widths height padding and margin that are detailed in the mock-ups that i m given

3579705
uiview	calayer
during initialization use cgbitmapcontextcreate to create at least 2 bitmap contexts from pointers to off-screen memory buffers and add a calayer as a sublayer of your uiview

3579710
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve created a website that displays perfectly on google-chrome firefox safari and internet explorer 8 minus the rounded corners on ie8

3579728
google-chrome	firefox
please check out the slideshow at the top of www.ysa.org frontpage on ie preferably 8 or lower and compare to google-chrome firefox

3579728
google-chrome	firefox
in ie 8 which is what i m testing on the background of the slideshow area is white while in google-chrome firefox it is normal

3579736
pop-up	dialog
the client requested that if the user attempted to close the dialog before all the documents are requested then the user is prompted with a confirm option of ok and cancel.i implemented this fine with an actual close button on the form which shows a conform pop-up and if the user clicks ok then the window is closed with a javascript hack

3579738
thin	unicorn
thin and unicorn would be good choices - heroku runs thin and github runs unicorn

3579900
opera	google-chrome
i don t have opera installed but the google-chrome control hierarchy in spy++ looks like this

3579903
versioning	upgrade
as far as altering the core of drupal you wouldn t want to do that anyway or you could run into trouble when a new versioning becomes available and you want to upgrade

3579907
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
you just have to handle the mousedown mousemove and mouseup events of the surfaces you want to be draggable

3579930
google-chrome	firefox
of course this only blows up in ie not firefox or google-chrome

3579969
hide	show
then use css to hide and show description on user link activation take care of crossbrowser issues about active focus and target pseudoclass

3580037
allocator	stl
from various posts i was able to determine that this is not a bug but a feature since it is the way that gnu libraries provide highly efficient allocator to the stl

3580086
pop-up	dialog
i mean well the following process i click on the menu file on the main window as most gui application looks then open then a file directory dialog pop-up then i select a file then i click okay on that dialog then i want that this file s name would appear on the listctrl on this main window displaying which file i had select

3580095
hide	show
i will then via javascript hide the text after the read more and only show it on click

3580103
width	text-align
you wrap your textarea with a div give it width and then you align it with text-align center

3580106
apache	nginx
but in a production environment you ll need a real webserver nginx apache and passenger

3580107
accessor	properties
if you want to use c function pointers you need to pass the object to the function to use it to call the object s properties accessor methods within the function

3580155
disk	ram
membase can support multiple tiers of data offload using an lru approach very seldom used goes to disk somewhat seldom stuff goes to ssd frequent stuff stays in ram

3580158
post	get
my solution was to fill the dropdown both in get and in post and to retrieve the selectedvalue from the form variables in page_load

3580179
portrait	landscape
whenever you switch between portrait and landscape by opening closing the keyboard

3580189
alarmmanager	wakelock
using alarmmanager you can arrange to only hold a wakelock during the actual heartbeat work not 100 of the time

3580220
post	get
is there any way to prevent a user from accessing this page directly eg example.com getpost.php with the appropriate get or post arguments and getting only part of the page since this should be used with ajax as part of a whole not alone

3580222
clang	llvm
it s clear that apple has an opencl implementation based on clang and llvm

3580222
clang	llvm
would like to know if there is an open-source opencl implementation based on clang and llvm before we go off and try to implement our own.

3580223
debian	linux
i am a linux amateur and am trying to build nginx on debian lenny for the first time

3580264
post	get
run it again and if you still are getting exception then please post your stack trace since i ran your code and i did not get any so your exception might be coming from a completely different issue

3580271
int	chars
splitting them to be a chars column and int column in the database would be cumbersome since it is used in several tables and there are a few million total serial numbers

3580284
put	get
also if you just put an else on dying you will get a compile error which forces you to think

3580313
jsf	wicket	lift	wicket

it is a port plus some modifications and extensions to the library used by ddms to communicate with an adb server

3580384
folder	directory
there isn t anyway to automatically download an entire folder or all files contained within a directory s tree with css html or js although it would be possible with js + a server side script

3580392
versioning	upgrade
user upgrade to full versioning but you don t copy over the data per your quoted passage above

3580403
division	modulo
if so it s not too bad - play around with division modulo and adding ascii 0

3580429
addition	multiplication
another instance of the same intermediate precision problem is when the compiler uses the fmadd instruction for what is a multiplication followed by an addition in the source code if the target architecture has itâ for instance powerpc

3580430
uiview	calayer
you best bet may be to pre-render the new pdf images at the new scale factor into another offscreen calayer before the uiview setneedsdisplay give it time to upload to the gpu you may have to profile tune for the bus bandwidth of the worse case device you support and then finish your view animation while quickly flipping between old and new calayers

3580471
radiobuttonlist	onclientclick
i found i could just add a onclientclick attribute to the radiobuttonlist and it would fire the javascript client side as expected

3580478
vmware	virtualbox
if you have the appropriate licenses already you could look into running vmware or virtualbox to build it

3580496

ravendb	db4o
i have so far been looking at db4o nhibernate to sqlce w linq and ravendb

3580535
rss	feed
i m writing a program in ruby that downloads a file from an rss feed to my local hard drive

3580546

3580556
devise	cancan
i have an app that uses devise and cancan

3580589

google-chrome doesn t do this though only firefox

it should also be noted that the above reasoning should probably be used as rationale behind introducing unsigned integer types and not introducing unsigned floating-point types in popular hardware and corresponding hardware-derived standards

3589692
post	get
i am not asking for complete code which obviously i wont get but if you do have any coding to support the approach please be kind enough to post it

3589707
iboutlet	ibaction
i ve been doing some research and i added an ibaction in the uiviewcontroller for uitextfield touchdown event and the iboutlet for the uitexfield

3589767
ubuntu	linux
i would suggest using ubuntu as the linux platform

3589784
queue	fifo
a circular linked list can be effectively used to create a queue fifo or a deque efficient insert and remove from front and back

3589820
ws-addressing	soap
another soap idea is using ws-addressing but it is not really meant for load balancing

3589863
width	height
when i give multiple effects like height 140 and width 200 then the next effects start only after the previous effects finish

3589870
google-chrome	safari
built in developer tools in google-chrome and safari

3589870
profiling	debugging
these are all free tools available to you and work great when profiling debugging javascript

3589874
grizzly	netty
as far as java network frameworks go people seem to have pretty good experiences with netty mina or grizzly but going that low-level will probably cause you grief

3589921
client-side	server-side
i m wanting to deliver some data from the server-side to some client-side javascript which can use said data to construct a database table and then query it using some user-input sql

3589930
ant	maven
maven can be considered as complete project development tool not just build tool like ant

3589961
prepare	execute
i am writing a software that requires me to prepare statements and set the values execute the query and get results within a loop

3589973
versioning	upgrade
the only explanation i can think of is that your firefox versioning is outdated and you need to upgrade

3589974
ant	maven
and to my experience modular maven builds using binary dependencies gives me faster build time than typical monolithic ant builds

3589976
division	modulo
i know what modulo division is

3590007
division	modulo
if you are looking at it as a mathematical operation then it s just a modulo division

3590076
google-chrome	safari
the safari and google-chrome developer tools are excellent

3590095
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
this works fine in safari opera and google-chrome

3590096
width	height
it s a better idea to use some kind of script which will get a few thousand bytes from the given file and get the width height from the jpeg gif etc

3590150
devise	cancan
cancan is an authorization solution that can be used in tandem with devise - check out the railscast this plugin again works great with rails 3

3590207
visualvm	jprofiler
jprofiler visualvm etc

3590210
hash	md5
suppose the password is mypassword then don t just store it hash it first using an algorithm like md5 then store the hash which is deb1536f480475f7d593219aa1afd74c in your database

3590212
hash	md5
normally you would store a hash of the passwords in the database see md5 however this doesn t make it secure between the webpage and server - for this you need to use https

3590228
hbase	hypertable
and unless you already have a tremendous amount of data and hit a wall in regards to processing speeds and resource usage i wouldn t go for a column based db hbase hypertable

3590240
ubuntu	linux
if you want to set your timezone on a server-wide basis you ll probably find plenty of answers on serverfault.com such as setting time zone on linux ubuntu

3590250
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
ie6 is already done and also firefox google-chrome safari opera etc.

3590298
post	get
i am working on a simple jsp page it contain 2 textbox firstname and lastname and a ok button when textbox is filled and button is clicked i need to get values of firstname and lastname and post to url how to do this

3590312
floating-point	integer
i am assuming that by decimal value you really mean floating-point value in which case you can not use the integer arithmetic facilities as you ve done

3590314
int	double
x will be copied to double - make sure it s not bigger than max_value a will be int maximum 2147483647 but the bigdecimal.pow doesn t support int more than a billion anyway and b will be double always less than 1

3590344
apache	nginx
how you do this is rather specific to your current load balancing setup apache squid nginx etc

3590381
post	get
jqgrid has three important parameter mtype which are typically get or post datatype withe the values like xml or json and url parameter

3590381
post	get
so you can implement a servlet in java see how to learn ajax using jquery in a java web app for example which could be the only active component in your solution which bound to the url defined by url and editurl and support http get or post depend of your mtype choice

3590422
post	get
and realised that it is not possible to hide any information through a get post method

3590436
division	modulo
you could use division to make the equivalent of modulo

3590464
integer	unsigned
it is worth noting that 1 000 000 000 can be represented using a java int which will be the same size as a c signed or unsigned 32 bit integer

3590473
tolower	toupper
then add tolower or toupper if you want and use match for joining your data frames

3590479
disk	ram
one reason to want to do this or other techniques such as compressing the document on disk is that the space savings also make for smaller memory usage of cached objects and indexes meaning that you could get better cache hit rates for the same amount of ram

3590550
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
i m very interested in using sun studio to detect memory leaks in c++ applications with dbx debugger but i think this debugger only shows memory leaks produced by malloc realloc and free

3590583
post	get	post	put	put	get
are there good references teaching you how to send put delete post get with ruby

3590622
post	get	post	put	put	get
for update actions you want to use put create post destroying uses delete and anything else is probably a get

3590631
gina	winlogon
on xp server2003 you d probably have done this by writing some gina extension replacement for the winlogon system

3590636
stdout	stderr
the open3 library gives you full access to the standard io streams stdin stdout and stderr

3590660
screens	tablet
you will be creating anew avd config to specify the tablet screens size memory constraints sdcard size etc

3590684
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you can add uinavigationcontroller in place of uiviewcontroller in uitabbarcontroller and put your uiviewcontroller who haveing uisegmentcontrol in uinavigationcontroller who add in uitabbarcontroller

3590710
doc	rtf
you can load word or open office templates merge textual data and save the final document to a number of formats such as doc docx rtf and pdf

without you needing to copy them so it doesn t matter where they are stored by yum rpm

3590726
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if i change my code to test for then firefox is happy but then safari opera and google-chrome fail at the test

3590776
pecl	pear
if you can connect via ssh to that server and if you can install new pecl and pear modules then you might consider using php ssh2

3590795
width	height
once you have the row col count and assuming all the videos are to be the same size you simply divide screen width by cols and height by rows and you have your video dimensions

3590800
google-chrome	firefox
of course that would mean that it s not actually working in firefox or google-chrome or any other browser but it could be that they re just less strident about error reporting so you re not noticing

3590817
trie	tree
given a string s its suffix tree is essentially the patricia trie of all of its suffixes

3590832
integer	fractions
the initial height would be an integer fractions of the total screen height

3590855
tolower	toupper
the question answered here seems to indicate that tolower and toupper are unicode-aware stack overflow

3590880
windows	wow64
is there any way to build a vc++ project so that the dll exe created by it will work as a 32 bit application on a 32 bit windows os and as a 64 bit application on a 64 bit windows os not in wow64

3590891
folder	dir
navigate to the dump dir and you should see a new folder with a file in it named fulldump_something_.dmp

3590903
udp	tcp
i have a local server written in c++ listening to inbound tcp connects using plain socket accept and udp recvfrom

3590903
udp	tcp
will most external firewalls typically by default allow incoming udp and tcp connects on port 80

3590911
executable	upx
after changing those setup.py parameters i also run upx on dlls and executable and repack library.zip with 7-zip works well

3590912
google-chrome	safari
webkit for apple s safari and google s google-chrome web browsers

3590914

3590916
openssl	libcrypto
for example by using libcrypto from openssl

3590935
getter	setter
just replace the synthesize with dynamic and implement getter and setter yourself

3590941
width	height
let s assume i have a div element with static height and width

3590957
apache	nginx
so how about changing your .tac file to just launch a server for a single virtual host starting up a lot of instances manually with a shell script with another simple python script etc and then putting a reverse proxy nginx apache even another twisted web process in front of all of those processes

3590977
post	get
when i try entering a new response for a test post i made original word best first response is rest i get this

3590987
lan	localhost
i ve tried countless ways of binding it to localhost 0.0.0.0 the wifi lan ip address of the device with socketinetaddress and inetaddress.getbyname

3591020
client-side	server-side
the client-side javascript sends the session-id from the cookie to the server when the user submits a request and the server-side currently uses a pair of lists storing instances of a controller class in one and the corresponding session-id s in another creating a new interpreter proxy and sending the input if a non-existant session-id is submitted

3591032
keydown	mousedown
in my delphi application i wrote handlers for the keydown mousedown and mousewheel events but non of them are triggered by this mysterious button

3591071
wan	lan
the network environment you are playing in will dictate which options are actually viable a local lan will have different considerations from something which runs over a wan or the internet

3591071
tunnel	vpn
factors like firewall tunnel vpn traversal etc

3591151
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and ie all have developer extensions

3591151
google-chrome	firefox
this is due to the simple fact that firefox has been in the extension business longer than google-chrome or ie

3591221
rss	feed
i have two separate rss feed and i running each one through simplepie then displaying them in the side bar

3591230

3591253
put	get
i put up a tutorial on how to get 3.1.3 working with xcode 3.2

3591283
throttling	throttle
also the throttling in biztalk seems to be implemented in a way that it first bombs a service then notices that it was bombing then waits a while doing nothing and then lifts the throttle and start bombing again

3591299
simplecursoradapter	autocompletetextview
i have successfully implemented a custom simplecursoradapter for an autocompletetextview which suggests entries from the database according to what has been entered into the box

3591329
subtraction	addition
addition and obviously subtraction error is easy to compute

3591356
fflush	gets
you re probably on the right track though - although i d use a fixed-size array instead of a list and fflush all entries from the array when it gets full

3591373
ssl	https
the way https ssl gets around this is through the use of trusted certificate authorities

3591398
postgresql	mysql
this is equivalent to mysql postgresql in your list

3591410
mvp	presenter
i have a problem with my mvp structure that is built upon generic presenter views etc

3591442
codeigniter	cakephp
if what you really want is clean urls and simple url mapping then you could probably use codeigniter or cakephp

3591447
udp	tcp
tcp udp ip toolbox 2.0.6 from matlab exchange offers a tcp ip implementation

3591450
min	max
this is often due to unavailability of sufficient contiguous free memory in ram or incorrect min and max heap sizes

3591450
min	max
from the screenshot it appears that the problem might not be with the min and max heap sizes so you might want to take a look at the amount of free memory available when starting eclipse although that is no indicator of whether all free memory is contiguous

3591463
ggplot2	lattice
even better is to combine the data sets together then use xyplot from the lattice package or the ggplot2 package to do the multiple plots in one step

3591477
google-chrome	firefox
and now testing it and this simple example seems to work with firefox and with google-chrome

3591489
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
however this only works in firefox and does not work in safari google-chrome or opera

3591491
button	checkbox
i can verify that by unchecking the checkbox it does flip the value because i enable disable the next button depending on the myproperty value - i have more than one checkbox btw

3591501
post	get
clicking a vote link is a get not a post

3591514
automake	autotools
autotools automake autoconf and the likes amd cmake are quite helpful to make sure that you don t have to deal with these problems

3591543
verilog	vhdl
when thinking about simulating things in vhdl or verilog you need to think like if you had the hardware which you want to simulate physically in your hands

3591543
verilog	vhdl
you make the pcb and other things in vhdl or verilog

3591565
google-chrome	firefox
since i didn t managed to sign in on a web site i want to scrape i thought i will use the browser cookie google-chrome or firefox for that specific website with the cookie command www mechanize shell has

3591589
jboss	weblogic
i want to install jboss tomcat weblogic and my be more

3591596
jboss	weblogic
hence you cannot have both jboss and weblogic on port 8080

3591659
hashchange	popstate
update there is now the html5 history api pushstate popstate which deprecates the html4 hashchange functionality

i am using boost serialization on windows and i wanted to test my code on linux ubuntu and unfortunately it does not compile

3591747
ubuntu	linux
we have the following code that runs in linux ubuntu but not on windows xp or windows 7

3591768
hash	md5
i was thinking of making an md5 hash out of the user s data but i m not sure how unique the md5 would be from that swipe so i can store that md5 as how i look up the user in my mysql database

3591784
width	height
i am trying to get the width and height of a button so that i can rotate that button around

3591798
outputstream	inputstream
does closing the outputstream also closes the inputstream in this case

3591808
hash	md5
i was thinking of making an md5 hash out of the user s data but i m not sure how unique the md5 would be

3591808
hash	md5
i did a little experiment a while back and found that even 32-bit fragment of an md5 or sha-1 hash will probably still be unique enough for a few thousand records

3591816
actioncontroller	activeresource
loading a default rails stack will give you actioncontroller actionmailer activerecord and activeresource all together

3591824
hash	md5
md5 is a 128-bit hash so it allows 2 128 340.282.366.920.938.463.463.374.607.431.768.211.456 unique identifiers so if every human beeing on this world about 6.900.000.000 should get a md5 unique identifier built out of this data the chances of a collision are smaller than 1 4 10 28

3591837
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
when you close the fileinputstream two lines before the error wouldn t that also close the bufferedreader since it now has no stream from which to read

3591846
int	double
your arguments are of type int and double and so the compiler can t deduce what type it should actually use for a

3591846
int	double
should a be int or should it be double

3591846
int	double
when you pass a double as an argument to this function the standard conversion is performed on the argument and the function is called with the resulting int

3591864
outputstream	inputstream
it just move the closing of the outputstream to the end where you are closing the inputstream of the socket

3591864
outputstream	inputstream
closing this socket will also close the socket s inputstream and outputstream

3591868
qpushbutton	qvboxlayout
i have some qpushbutton and qlabels in a qvboxlayout

3591912
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
you can t add a uibutton to a uisegmentedcontrol

3591912
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
uibutton isn t a subclass of uiview you can add it to the uisegmentedcontrol

3591912
uicontrol	uibutton
you would have to subclass uicontrol or uibutton if you have need of additional functionalities and draw the whole button manually or in this case just the + sign

3591925
vim	emacs
although i know this to be the case for the emacs and the oldish debugger front end ddd i imagine you have the same thing going on if you are debugging from vim

3591965
hide	show
i am using jquery to hide show a div

3591979
mouseleave	mouseenter
the .hover handler will fire once for mouseenter and once for mouseleave

3592001
mouseleave	mouseenter
u can use mouseenter mouseleave to stop bubbling re-calling hover while mouse moving

3592002
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this worked for me on google-chrome firefox and safari osx

3592003
width	height
while you wont need to explicitly set the img height width in your html you still need to know what they are because div height width is calculated like so div h img h + img borderx2

3592016
firefox	safari
i love how the following animates in safari but hate how it does in firefox click an event name then click previous post or next post at the bottom of the page

3592019
strlen	substr
substr string 1 strlen string

3592174
whirlpool	md5
for creating a unique id u can go with any algorithm be it md5 or sha or whirlpool

3592197
subtract	add
you would just need to add or subtract some constant from each x or y corner coordinate to get all 8 points

3592213
daemons	launchd
see launchd.plist 5 or the overview documentation for launchd unfortunately this overview documentation is primarily concerned with daemons but the principle is the same

3592215
post	get
hi i am trying to create 2 functions for a wordpress site one to extract the src from an image in a post and one to get the post slug

3592215
post	get
how do i get this to target the post it s on

3592224
min	max
there are some concerns about finding max and min value from hash

3592228
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
but then it only works for division not addition subtraction or multiplication

3592254
hash	md5
the first time through comparing a drive s contents utilize a hash such as sha-1 or md5

3592258
content-disposition	content-type
then you need to set at least the http content-type header to application pdf and the http content-disposition header to attachment when you want to pop a save as dialogue or to inline when you want to let the webbrowser handle the display itself

3592258
outputstream	inputstream
you then just write it in the well-known inputstream - outputstream loop the usual java io way

3592319
drawimage	todataurl
for example if you ever call drawimage with an image from a different domain you can no longer use the todataurl or getimagedata functions

3592378
boost	stl
i m programming c++ using the underscore naming style as opposed to camel case which is also used by the stl and boost

3592378
boost	stl
that d be consistent with stl and boost so i might use that

3592416
equals	gethashcode
perhaps what you really need is well thought out equals and gethashcode overrides

3592435
inherited	properties	getter	setter
note this needs refinement to exclude properties getter setter and inherited methods but it s a decent starting place

3592441
nsstring	nsobject
using to compare nsobject instances in this case nsstring instances is a pointer comparison since objective-c instances cannot be created on the stack

3592469
redhat	fedora
on redhat centos or fedora i would suggest using the ius repository

3592570
mouse	keyboard
configuration as in the options you see in the keyboard mouse settings under windows

3592580
width	height
then square s implementation to set the width would also naturally set the height so that the object remains square

3592580
width	height
yet there may well exist code elsewhere in the system that works polymorphically with rectangle objects and would not expect that changing the width would also change the height

3592595
dictionary	map	treemap	linkedhashmap
serious matlab implementations requiring key-value maps dictionary should still use javaâ s map classes java.util.enummap hashmap treemap linkedhashmap or hashtable to gain access to their larger functionality if not performance

3592649
pydev	virtualenv
when configure the interpreter to point to virtualenv s python interpreter pydev doesn t automatically inherit the system python s path therefore it s the user s duty to select appropriate pythonpath

3592655
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i used cgaffinetransformrotate in response to touchesbegan and touchesmoved events within the polygonview class and this basically works too

3592677
postgresql	mysql
note that postgresql is worth considering too - while this has more in common with oracle dbms than the sybase system at the heart of mssql like mysql it is not strongly tied into a vertical integration platform

3592680
mouse	keyboard
if you want to change other keyboard settings than the layout or if you want to change mouse settings you could try googling for the name of the setting + registry key or something similar to find where it s stored or maybe ask on the superuser site

3592692
floating-point	integer
is x an integer or a floating-point variable

3592706
int	double
i have a string such as int double datetime etc

3592708
antialiasing	transparent
antialiasing essence is that the more pixel is closer to the edge boundary of something the more pixel color is blended with background color or we can say that it is more transparent

3592714
email	dkim
dkim uses digital signatures to allow a sending mail server to show that an email came from the domain it says it came from

3592714
email	dkim
both these systems require proper spf dkim records to be set up and also require that the mail server that handles the email for its recipient actually performs the validation

3592724
accessor	properties
that method is always going to return the same instance of the set aside from accessor that get a properties

pull	push
you can take a look here for a good example of how ui can be organized to work with async on backend see richfaces livedemo ajax support push pull examples

3592868
width	height
you can slice 1px height or 1px width gradient image and repeat it in the background horizontally or vertically.

3592872
pyquery	lxml
in pyquery or even python2.6 s libraries like lxml it is very easy but i don t know how to do that with python 2.5

3592912
setinterval	settimeout
you could use settimeout instead of setinterval and make dynamic adjustments each time your function is called

3592917
instances	transient
my co-worker thinks that since all of our domain services are marked transient each page request will get a new instances

3592953
client-side	server-side
supertech i get the impression that you are confusing server-side code php in this case with client-side code

3592956
children	parent
here s one option create a sprite or movieclip object and add all your menu objects as its children and not as children of the parent class

3592966
free	malloc
that s where the memory was allocated with malloc and only you can say where it should have been free

is there a way to sort of pause the dom in either firefox or google-chrome

3592989
put	get
if i put the symbol before plasmalaunch1 in the addobject argument i get an

3593054
unix	solaris
it seems that all the major investment banks use c++ in unix linux solaris for their low latency high frequency server applications

3593075
unix	aix
banks run on aix the stock market itself runs on unix and therefore it is simply easier to find programmers in the financial world that are used to a unix environment rather than a windows one

3593078
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris	unix	solaris
further linux unix has a reputation for crashing less though windows is pretty reliable these days and linux has a much more volatile code base than solaris or freebsd

3593084
subtract	add
you can dynamically add and subtract event handlers with the bind and unbind functions

3593106

3593162
stateless	stateful
stateless and stateful enterprise java beans

3593233
post	get
when you have register_globals on anything passed via get or post or cookie automatically appears to be global variable in code this might have security consequences

3593261
post	get
as i understand it if you have register globals turned on then anything passed in a get or post gets automatically translated into a variable in php

3593261
post	get
with registered globals off data passed in via get or post is not automatically translated into a variable rather you need to request it using the superglobals _get _post and _request etc

3593266
post	get
i have a wp blog i just published my first post and when i try to use the comments i get the following

3593271

getter	setter
and has getter and setter

3593326
post	get
what is the best way to get related post using php and mysql

3593326
post	get
the second question is how would i get the top 5 related post from by comparing tags and categories from each post

3593364
client-side	server-side
if you want to pass any information from the client-side javascript to the server-side sinatra you need to use ajax or something like comet

3593460
cvs	svn
for the future i highly recommend learning a version control system like cvs svn and git etc

3593484
uiview	calayer
every uiview contains a coreanimation object calayer which is used for explicit animations

3593505
width	height
i am trying to get width and height of image returned by simplehtmldom

3593525
width	height
you should know that the height and width attributes won t necessarily be in the html therefore simplehtmldom won t be useful to you

3593526
width	height
check the height width attributes of the tag and only grab images where either s larger than 50

3593526
width	height
for gif jpeg images the height width will be very near the beginning on the file so you d save on file transfer overhead

3593526
width	height
well if there s no height width then you can jump straight to fetching the image or first bit of the image and extracting height width directly

3593526
width	height
checking the height width in the tag is just to save you the trouble of having to fetch the image in the first place

3593526
width	height
as for extracting the height width from the html it s just a matter of using and calls once you ve found an tag with the simplehtmldom

3593533
onresume	onpause
also i had to add code to my activity s onresume and onpause

3593540
addition	multiplication
in this case you have 2 adds and 1 comparision inside the loop mutiplied by 10 gives you 20 or 30 flops plus 1 multiplication and 1 addition outside the loop

3593574
gtk	gio
you could have a look at the gio library â it s part of gtk but can be used separately

3593574
pygtk	gio
the documentation is pretty thorough and if you need to do some quick prototyping you can use the pygtk gio bindings to mess around before going back and writing it in c

3593577
client-side	server-side
php runs server-side not client-side

3593644
for-loop	loops
instead of the usual for-loop gives us the object.each loops like in ruby

3593708
button	checkbox
i need for a user to be able to click a done button and for the application to go through the list of checkbox s and update a database for each checked item

3593708
button	checkbox
the database and the done button were a piece of cake but obtaining a reference to or making a copy how ever you choose to look at it of the checkbox thus far has stumped me for days

3593756
post	get
so what ll be the best way to get the answers on post then compare the answer with the desired answer and get the sum of the weightings across all questions

3593764
int	chars
how come that int can be compared to a chars in the switch statement

3593770
post	get
i am trying to get wordpress post 3 at a time this is the code i m using

3593776
stringbuilder	stringwriter
note that you could also eliminate the stringbuilder use new stringwriter

3593776
stringbuilder	stringwriter
stringwriter uses a stringbuilder as its underlying data structure anyway

3593779
int	chars
no implicit casting from chars to an int is available

3593779
int	chars
on x86 machines both int and chars are 32 bits long so it s safe to explicitly cast

3593786
width	height
the short explanation is that inline-block allow you to style the list-items as if they were block level elements ie give them width height etc while still laying them out inline

3593787
int	chars
several functions return int in c but chars in c++

3593787
int	chars
returning an int when a chars would make more sense is simply an old c cultural decision

3593792
int	chars
conversion between chars and int exists just like it exists between int and long or int and short

3593792
int	chars
a literal of the form h in c++ has type chars but as any other integral type it is comparable to int

3593795
int	chars
and yes there is an implicit cast from chars to int

3593795
int	chars
a chars is just a one-byte int value

3593795
int	chars
so in this case the cast is not happening when assigning to next_option but in the case statement where you have a chars constant being compared to an int

3593795
int	chars
in c++ a chars constant is of type chars but in c it s of type int so if you compile this code as c then there s no type conversion at all

3593807
width	height
ns1 fusionwidgets id myguage width guagewidth height guageheight fccharttype guagetype fcdataxml guagexml y 0 x 0

3593833
int	chars
think of a chars as a 8bit int

3593833
int	chars
you can perform int operations on chars and you can even declare them as unsigned

3593833
int	chars
why should comparing a chars and an int be different

3593842
rss	feed
since it seems that you are trying to parse an atom feed try using something designed for that like magpie rss

3593851
ant	maven
maven advantages over ant are quite a few

3593904
children	parent
not only that but each child calls tostring on its parent which in turn calls tostring on its children which each calling tostring on the parent which in turn calls tostring on its children which.

3593942
children	parent
one for the parent and one for the children

3593943
children	parent
one way to fix it is to print only the name of the parent category skipping it s parent and children

3593957
width	height
pdf is page oriented fixed width and height of the pages

3593958
google-chrome	firefox
when i tried to run an gwt sample application i got a missing-plugins on firefox or google-chrome it seems that i m missingg something just dont know what to do in order to make it works.

this will ensure that the styling you apply to the parent div will only affect the text content outside the children

3594057
ironruby	ironpython
silverlight is .net meaning that you could use any language capable of compiling into msil c# vb.net ironruby ironpython ... which will run inside the client browser using a plugin that needs to be installed

opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works perfectly in firefox 3.6 4b google-chrome 5 6 and safari but does not work as expected in opera tested with most recent version 10.61 no matter how many widgets divs with are present opera only acts on the first one because apparently the nodelist only contains 1 entry length is 1 instead of 2 or 3 or ...

3594088
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
is there a bug in my code which firefox safari and google-chrome ignore

3594091
inherited	properties
now only way i see it is remove inherited and implement implicit operator for anothertype to sometype conversion but the evil in that case i need to duplicate all properties of type sometype within type anothertype and i need to change type anothertype manually every time when sometype getting changed

versioning	upgrade
i want upgrade feature in my iphone app how to say if user tap a upgrade button then the app will access online upgrade versioning server and download newest modules file after that the app can use the newest modules.

3594121
google-chrome	firefox
because firefox and google-chrome handle server push differently firefox get onload events google-chrome uses onprogress broken

3594132
mouseover	mouseleave
the problem is that hover maps to mouseover and mouseleave not the events you re using

3594141
mousemove	mouseenter	mousemove	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter
.hover will never return mousemove it will only return mouseenter mouseleave

3594146
kde	gnome
you need to balance a requirement for absolute portability against the expectations of platform users - there are different basic hci hig guidelines for windows os x kde and gnome and none of the portable gui toolkits will automatically produce the right results in each some allow you to apply different layouts which is a start

3594200
int	chars
int is an array of int and chars output is a buffer that should be long enough to hold the string representation of the int that the function receives

3594232
folder	directory
get the special my documents folder path first then append your additional directory with path.combine

3594278
dictionary	map
although it may be better that your module defines a dictionary or factory to map each value into a renderer

viewdidload	viewdidappear
you can see this by printing out nslog the integer value of self ld long int self in the viewdidload and viewdidappear methods

3594351
equals	tostring
note that you don t need equals because we can rely on object identity now and tostring because this is already implemented for case objects and classes

3594362
superclass	subclassing
if you write a superclass you just create a virtual method and have it implemented in your subclassing the page

3594373
yacc	bison
additionally look for yacc and bison if you want parser generators too

make sure that you set your width and height of the div container for your object or image

3594405
client-side	server-side
the application is typical consists of the client-side interface and server-side that performs all the calculations

3594406
post	put
pages got buffered with a stale authenticity token and all actions using the methods post put delete where recognized as forgery attempts

3594406
post	put
as toobulkeh commented this is not a vulnerability on index show actions but beware using this on put post actions

3594486
int	chars
you cannot in general convert an int into one chars because only ten of all int 0 .

3594512
width	height
or should i start thinking about jquery to manipulate the width and height on the fly

3594524

3594580
portrait	landscape
is it necessary to make my app work in both orientations landscape and portrait so that apple won t reject the app

3594607
width	height
is it same like to omit width height css properties and to specify them as 100

3594617
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
on some elements the width acts like 100 a auto acts very similar to 100 depending on margin padding ....but not height so no it s not the same as omitting them everywhere

3594617
width	height
here s a demonstration with width height not set vs 100

3594620
width	height
the second however yields the correct croparea based on the image width and height

3594621
width	height
see the css specs for example from here onwards for more information on how width and height are calculated when unspecified

3594655
inherited	properties
in your case it is little bit specific because inherited entities don t have any additional properties to store

3594678
sorting	filtering
define your sorting order as a combination of # of views or last seen date or a weighted filtering combination of the two factors

3594684
post	get
scaffold controller s edit action and defult routing support edit as get rather than post request

3594696
post	get
since paypal requires a post not a get you cannot use a redirect either so the only option that s left is returning an html page to the client with a form with all the paypal parameters as hidden input s and a bit of javascript to submit the form immediately

3594699
width	height
of course it does if i also add width and height attributes

3594758
pseudo-class	visited
i have some questions about the visited pseudo-class

3594758
pseudo-class	visited
based on what do browsers decide when the visited pseudo-class should be applied to a hyperlink

3594758
pseudo-class	visited
is it possible for the developer of a web page to control for how long the visited pseudo-class should be applied to hyperlinks

3594760
execl	fork
if you use a fork execl combination individual parameters will never be parsed so don t need to be escaped

trust me i ve seen zend framework and i ve used cmses like joomla and wordpress extensively none of them come close to what i m doing

3595076
realloc	strcpy	realloc	malloc	strcpy	malloc
instead of using malloc and strcpy look at realloc it does everything you want but better but you d most likely want to build your string forward counter 0

3595096
free	malloc
string literals are not allocated with malloc and consequently can not be free ed which is the source of your problem

3595102
ncover	ndepend
in addition to the rythmis answer i provide this blog post that explains in detail how ndepend coupled with ncover or vsts coverage answers the question

currently i am trying to get remote image width height

3595113
width	height
so i tried using php getimagesize to get image width height its very slow

3595113
width	height
so i am thinking of using jquery solution to get remote image width height so that i can filter image width less then 100px

3595134
fast-forward	merge
perhaps you re used to doing only fast-forward merge

3595135
width	height
if you re trying to get the width and height of the image in the client side you can use jquery s .width and height methods

3595135
width	height
doing will ensure that the images are loaded before getting the height width

3595168
post	get
for some calls both get and post are supported with post being used when there is large amounts of data being sent to the service

i was wondering if when using proxy does ssl through https secure the connection from the admins of the proxy so they will not be able to see the content

3595366
mouseup	mousedown
the state of the mouse is tracked in a variable and set in the button s handlers for mousedown and mouseup

3595388

i use the maven plugin for eclipse m2e

3595469
richfaces	openfaces
jsf is a component-based mvc framework and there are plenty of great jsf libraries available for use richfaces openfaces etc

3595469
jsf	seam
seam integrates jsf with ejb and together they make a great enterprise framework

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
while in portrait i push another orientation aware uiviewcontroller onto the uinavigationcontroller

3595473
opencart	magento
ones that looks nice to me so far include wordpress getshopped opencart and magento

3595504
glassfish	weblogic
adopt the webdevelopment stack of a large commercial vendor like sun oracle jsf ejb3 + netbeans jdeveloper + glassfish weblogic + mysql oracle or ibm

3595504
springsource	grails
take a look at jboss seam and springsource grails and roo the latter two are based on the frequently mentioned spring hibernate frameworks

3595535

let s assume that some malicious javascript is running in a web browser attempting to connect to non-http non-websocket servers ftp telnet ssh

3595575
int	chars
depending on which version of ruby you re using cell 3 will either be an int representing the ascii chars or the 2nd chars in the string

3595619
uitableview	nsindexpath
the problem is that when i load the view the method - uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

3595630
getter	setter
have you tried updating your javadoc method checkstyle configuration to not require javadoc on getter and setter by using the allowmissingpropertyjavadoc property

3595630
getter	setter
depending on if you re after just filtering the getter and setter javadoc or something more complicated this may be a better cleaner solution

3595731
superclass	subclassing
is it better to put a default implementation of a method in a superclass and override it when subclassing want to deviate from this or should you just leave the superclass method abstract and have the normal implementation repeated across many subclassing

3595749
width	height
try to make bigger picture with greater width and height in theory to make a plot of a same virtual size it should be

3595753
backgrounding	multitasking
under ios 4.0 there are several ways to register your app with the os for multitasking services so that your app can get some running time in the backgrounding

3595754
superclass	subclassing
one option is to have another abstract subclassing to use as the superclass for all implementations which do want to use the default implementation

3595766
width	height
it seems the scrollview frame width height don t change just the orientation of itself

3595782
put	get
essentially get every pixel and its position in the letter and put that pixel into the image at the position you re currently at plus the position of the pixel in the letter

3595799
for-loop	arrays
the new for-loop added since java 5 to make iteration over the collections and arrays easier

3595801
super	abstract
if you are leaving the super class method abstract you may want to look into utilizing an interface not to be confused with an interface

3595815
punctuation	words
this is a pretty naive definition of words however since it only splits on whitespace so any punctuation will be included as part of the words

3595845
width	height
i would then change the width and height of the loader to make the loaded animations fit well

3595865
hash	salt
the best way of storing passwords is to store them hash with some complex hash like sha1 sha1 password +salt with salt

3595913
wxpython	listctrl
is is possible to place a button inside of a listctrl item with wxpython

3595934
getter	setter
or you could do this if you don t wish to define getter setter

3595955
google-chrome	safari
if google-chrome and safari are both based on webkit does that mean i don t have to test both browsers

3595955
google-chrome	safari
or are there certain situations where i should explicitly test both google-chrome and safari

3595967
django	turbogears
just ported a webapp from turbogears to django and going through the process of getting a proper server running not runserver

3596009
google-chrome	safari
however the javascript engines of google-chrome and safari are completely different vector graphics are rendered by different engines html5 video tag stuff is implemented completely different etc

3596036
daemons	systemd
think of a daemons under linux unix variants - they do not have a graphical display nor interact with the user as such and hence would be headless for want a word for it as there s no interaction whatsoever and furthermore a service would be running under a systemd service account..

3596063
folder	directory
look at the programs in the examples folder in your core plot directory

3596090
ubuntu	linux
most likely firefox js engine retrieves these values from os hence i need to know which file in linux ubuntu stores these values and temporary change it when i need

3596119
superclass	subclassing
i have event observers which all observe the same event so i have an abstract superclass which observes that event and then the subclassing overrides implements the specific functionality

3596121
hide	show
show hide cursor on your choice..

3596127
post	get
say i have a latest_posts method in a blog model which i can pass an integer to to get the latest n post

3596169
superclass	subclassing
either declare the relevant method in the superclass to be abstract or have it call an abstract detail method that each subclassing implements

3596222
terminate	timeout
what happens in this case at least with ie is that it will orphan your connection object and not terminate it correctly until the connection timeout is hit

3596248
glut	sdl
if i just run the hello world it works but otherwise those errors happen every time i try to include glut gl or sdl commands

3596248
glut	sdl
yes apparently the compiler is not able to see the glu gl sdl and glut libraries

3596253
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button are

3596261
inherited	subclassing
what you want is to create a subclassing that inherited from its parent s prototype

3596267
folder	directory
if you look in the program files directory you will note that most companies do not include the version number in their folder name

3596295
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
tested with google-chrome firefox 3.6 and opera not ie

3596300
children	parent
one aproach i would take at this is to take the first and the text it s a textnode for hap save the other children and remove the children inserting them while formating them after the parent node

3596321
portrait	landscape
load a landscape oriented xib when the device is turned into landscape orientation and vice-versa with portrait

3596372
listview	gridview
you should ditch the tablelayout for a listview or gridview

3596395
onresume	onpause
now in the activity that runs the surfaceview you will also need to call the resume and pause methods in the surfaceview from the activity s or fragment s onresume and onpause

3596405
portrait	landscape
after if i change orientation to landscape then back to portrait again the button appears

3596443
polymorphism	specialization
self-typing allows restriction and specialization of oo polymorphism

3596467
firefox	safari
i works nicely in safari but is slightly offset in firefox in the hover state

3596492
int	chars
i have packed an array of 4 byte sized int in a chars buffer

3596503
width	height
this happens because the a tag has a width and height lower than img size

3596512
folder	directory
relative disk file system paths are relative to the current working directory which is dependent on how you started the application in eclipse it would be the project folder in command console it would be the currently opened folder in tomcat manager service it would be the tomacat bin folder etc

3596546
portrait	landscape
do i need to code two layouts for every screen - one for portrait and one for landscape

3596578
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox result is always undefined and google-chrome throws a error code

3596583
post	get
is there some way to detect an ajax get post request was made regardless of whether it was done with a generic object or from xyz framework

3596593
firefox	safari
this still causes safari and firefox to play the audio just in a new window

3596624
width	height
this way the arrows are effectively on another layer and will not affect other elements with their attributes width height

3596626
portrait	landscape
when testing on an ipad the player opens in portrait orientation slightly truncating some of the ui controls though the status bar does flip over to the landscape position

3596676
stdout	stderr
i simply want to disable restlet s logging to stdout stderr in my project and forward all restlet logging through the slf4j facade provided by org.restlet.ext.slf4j

3596682
queue	fifo
i m digging around on google atm and unfortunately have no reason to believe that it can maintain a stack instead of a queue but there are several open source implementations and aside from the fifo vs

3596691
put	get
sure just configure mod_dav so you get put support on the apache side

3596691
put	get
then use a get to pull down the file edit it locally and use put to send it back

3596709
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
the problem is i can t ask every user to change their password and the passwords are already hash with md5 without a salt

3596709
salt	md5
are there any pitfalls or more or less obvious dangers of doing so i mean sha1 md5 password with salt

3596741
trie	tree
a trie is better than a binary search tree for searching elements

3596753
portrait	landscape
the issue after navigating to the secondviewcontroller from the rootviewcontroller while in landscape the secondviewcontroller doesn t switch its ui back to portrait

3596780
bufferedreader	stringtokenizer
first you should read a line from the file use inputstream bufferedreader etc. then use stringtokenizer to split at the commas and you can look for the first part whether you should select it

3596784
bottle	flask
of course it is hard to beat the nice idioms of flask and bottle or the thoroughness and quality of werkzeug beyond map and rule

3596822
google-chrome	safari
this is a google-chrome and safari bug

3596838
trie	tree
test at runtime whether it s actually faster for these strings than your best known data-agnostic structure which might be a trie a hashtable a judy array or a splay tree depending on implementation details and your typical access patterns and if not fall back to that

3596849
hash	salt
add a new field to the user table for storing the new securely hash passwords - for this please do something safe involving per-user salt and multiple rounds

3596855
hash	salt	versioning	upgrade
this will work as you expect but if a person never logs back in or changes their password they will never upgrade to the salt versioning of the hash

3596859
post	get
this triggers the same logic as passing the data as an object since you are specifically an array and will cause a post instead of a get like you want

3596895
nfa	dfa
i don t know if you ve covered this part yet but if you convert that regex to an nfa or a dfa non-determinism isn t required for this one you d basically get this slightly simplified if i remember my conversion algorithm correctly but it s a pretty trivial change from the algorithm to this

3596934
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you use .hover it ll affect the parent as well since that s how the mouseenter and mouseleave events work for example

3596934
children	parent	mouseover	mouseout
you can give it a try here unlike mouseover and mouseout the events don t fire when entering leaving children so the action taken on the parent isn t undone until you actually leave the parent as well which seems to be what you re after

3596952
mouseover	mouseout
you can reach the parent node by using parent method and toggle its class binding the mouseover and mouseout events

3596975
width	height
this will always give the first row 2 3 of the height and the second row 1 3 of the height and the first column 2 3 of the width and the second column 1 3 of the width

3597070
width	height
i see other extensions with width and height set to just fine and i only enter some little text and i get linebreak

3597085
viewdidload	viewwillappear
7 in the .m file of where you are implementing the check you can place this in one of the first methods called init or viewwillappear or viewdidload etc

3597157
django	turbogears	turbogears	cherrypy
django turbogears and cherrypy are a few to check out

3597208
hide	show
another way is to always have 5 sets of fields and just show hide the sets of fields you need

3597222
vim	emacs
although the classic editors which the guru s will recommend vim and emacs have auto-complete as well

3597305
width	height
the 2 other changes that i made were to remove the width 100 rules since the div s are block elements and will default to that and change your height 100 to min-height 100 since this will allow your #content to grow with its content

3597338
set	bag
list vs set vs bag in nhibernate

3597347
getter	setter
for simple getter setter like the one below what s the best way to document it

3597347
public	protected
i m pretty strict about coding standards so my ide warns me about any undocumented public protected methods

3597361
getter	setter
if it s obvious what the getter setter is getting setting i d use some copy-paste documentation that makes it clear that nothing fancy is going on

3597361
getter	setter
i personally consider too many getter and setter to be a code smell as it s a possible sign that you re not providing operations at the correct level of abstraction this is obviously not always true but a rule of thumb

3597400
webclient	webrequest
simply use the webrequest or webclient classes

3597404
gentoo	linux
i m running gentoo linux

3597420

3597633
symfony	kohana	cakephp	kohana

3597640
post	get
whenever an ajax get or post request is made s_ajaxlistener.callback is called and the following properties are available

3597640
post	get
this should be either get or post

3597640
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have tested this in as of this posted date current safari current google-chrome current firefox ie8 ie8 ie7 compatible

3597689
post	get
there are system apis in languages like c++ and python that will return the installed fonts and you can certainly write a backend in a higher level language that communicates with a javascript front end using get post requests and optionally ajax but you re not going to get the installed fonts with only javascript

3597705
scriptaculous	jrails
but you can always jrails if you want something like prototype and scriptaculous helper

3597746
vim	emacs
i would like to know emacs equivalent of vim s n which opens

3597759
google-chrome	firefox
i had originally done what syockit suggested but i found it was doing weird things with the caret size in google-chrome which this method seems to avoid although firefox is still a bit off...

3597759
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
edit after playing around with it the following function seems to work reliably in ie8 firefox google-chrome safari opera for your more advanced test case

3597821
vsto	add-in
i created a simple vsto add-in with a copy and a paste button with the exact code above

3597821
vsto	add-in
is this a vsto add-in that uses the task pane

3597834
post	put

3597939
hex	binary
up in binary mode using you ll get the following shown in ispf editor with hex on

3597948
wtl	atl
for starters it requires some intimate knowledge of component object model com some atl and probably a bit of wtl as well

3597948
wtl	atl
and com atl and wtl are not mainstream topics anymore

3597963
disk	ram
after some time squid will also notice that these objects are unused and it decides to move them to disk so the ram can be used for more busy data

3597963
disk	ram
space on the disk the swap area when that write completes it will read from another place in the paging pool the data it paged out into the now unused ram page fix up the paging tables and retry the instruction which failed

3597963
disk	ram
so now squid has the object in a page in ram and written to the disk two places one copy in the operating system s paging space and one copy in the filesystem

3597965
width	height
i need to get the monitors width and height in pixels

3597990

3598076
put	get
i would get the part before and after what you want to replace and put them either side

3598079
uiview	uiwindow
i don t why you don t want to use the normal method of subclassing a uiview to capture touch events but if you really need to do something weird or sneaky you can capture all events including touch events before they get sent down the view hierarchy by trapping handling the sendevent method at the uiwindow level

3598091
range	max
all my code for getting these date range works except for the method to get the date range covering all time which would be a start value of the earliest possible data java handles to the end value of the max possible date

3598096
csla	.net
one of the most popular business objects frameworks for .net is csla

3598096

3598449
submit	submission
i do not see how it can be done the right way with plain a nchors and form submit as in both cases the user actually leaves the page by following the link or submission a form and there is no way to analyse the response on the client side

3598478
folder	dir
it ll output all the files folder not the subfolder files in the current provided dir

3598603
width	height
if i set the height and width of the scrollview to some specified length it works fine but again when it changes the orientation it doesn t

3599070
addition	modulo
undoing the addition modulo is a slightly different procedure

3599070
int	chars
you can set the modulus as high as you want to include as many chars as you want into your character-set and with some fancy math you can map chars to the int values in any way

however there are times though when stdout is used to communicate status to the user so he or she can tail -f or paginate it and at those times writing to stderr causes them pain they have to redirect stderr back into stdout with and not everyone knows how to do that

i can see no situation where you should worry about a server-side session value being obtained through a client-side exploit

3602693
jdom	dom4j	jdom	xom	dom4j	xom

3603249

3603609
public	protected
to deal with this issue without having to impose such odd conditions on your users the best advice is that for public base classes in c++ the destructor should be either public and virtual or protected and non-virtual guideline #4

3603609
short	base
in short std vector is not designed to be a base class and hence it may not be a very well-behaved base class

3603619
int	chars
all chars values can be stored in an int

3603869
google-chrome	safari

3604107
post	get
this ties to another post i had earlier basically when the user clicks a link a script is loaded into the big div the big div which contains the smaller div later on i need to reload the smaller div but it requires variable available only in the big div and i cannot include them in the small one for other reasons basically the script works when you load everything at once but when you try to dynamically load the small div i get a invalid argument supplied error here is how my code structure

3604137

onkeyup	onkeydown
alright so you re problem here is opera bless it doesn t support the onkeydown command very well - so you have to look at onkeyup or onkeypress instead

3604265

it should be simply a matter of switching onkeydown to onkeyup in your example fragment

3604277
accessor	properties
just tried it out -- the properties accessor are not bypassed regardless of visibility public private etc

memcached	apc
to reduce memory usage each cell is actually held in serialized form in a cache disk file apc memcached whatever while the cellcollection object holds its array of pointers to the cache location

width	height
you don t need to if you make mywidth and myheight bindable and set width mywidth and height myheight in the canvas declaration

3604471
width	height
for width height constraints you need to open a popup window lookup window.open... or use a modal window that can load external content into an iframe

3604485
udp	tcp
also if it s the first case are there any benefits of udp over tcp if you just keep the connection open over a long period of time

3604501
put	get

3604664
x86	64bit
on x86 a major difference between 32 and 64bit modes is presence of segmentation in 32-bits for historical compatibility

3604664
16-bit	64bit	protected-mode	real-mode
usually the os is written with cpu bitness in mind x86-64 being a notable example of decades of backwards compatibility - you can have everything from 16-bit real-mode programs through 32-bits protected-mode programs to 64bit long-mode programs

3604721

it s an issue when providing a default for a boolean or an int and you really do need the is none test

why is this piece of code not working on google-chrome 4.0 but works on firefox 3.5

3604989
google-chrome	firefox
the problem that occurs is the selector li#node- +nodes i .id + .append function is not working in google-chrome but is working fine in firefox

3604998
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you probably need to set it in .htaccess httpd.conf or php.ini depending on your server or hosting company

3605038
width	height
this middle chunk should represent half the height width of the original image so you want

3605038
width	height
if you want the source image to be shrunk proportionally so it has the same ration of height width as the original then you ll have to do some math to adjust the a b and e f parameters

i don t know the specific cause but you may want to check the css and the show hide behavior on the slide

3605164

3605194
jar	war
case in point if you ask eclipse to build a jar war you have to manually tell it what to include and where

3605194

config files from src main config don t go into the jar war kinda defeats the purpose of a config file if it did

3605194
jar	war
test resources from src test resources don t go into the jar war

3605240
client-side	server-side
javascript is a client-side scripting language and php is server-side scripting

maven	pom.xml
that s because the maven project itself is not configured to use 1.6 level the eclipse configuration is derived from the pom.xml which makes sense

3605290

the merge experience would be about the same but with an extra level of indirection push first on the fork then ask for a pull with the risk of evolutions on the original repo making your fast-forward merge not fast-forward anymore

3611349

3613126
udp	tcp
udp performance on localhost is terrible your best bet is to wrap the socket api inside a tcp layer

3613126
udp	tcp
if it s udp broadcast or multicast you will have to look at implementing a broker process to multiplex the messages over tcp

3613177
cvs	svn
i know many can say that cvs is outdated and many alternatives like svn git exists - but in my opinion eclipse has really got great cvs client by default which makes code management really easy

3613423
primes	modulus
notice the almost-perfect distribution when using a primes modulus vs

but unlike html dom not all elements have an upper left hand corner x y coordinate and a width and height for a box surrounding the content

3614586
put	get
i get the following out put in my firefox source code view

3614621

the function fgets is part of the stdio package and as such it must buffer or not the input stream in a way that is consistent with also using fgetc fscanf fread and so forth

3614626
equals	gethashcode
unfortunately it seems that the internals of web.cache don t handle this at all so you would have to call gethashcode on your string to see if it was equals to -2147483648 and if so alter the string slightly

3614664
selecteditem	selectedindex
i tried selectedindex but returns -1 and selecteditem returns null

3614670
bazaar	svn
bazaar is at least as easy to use as svn especially if you already know svn

3614670
bazaar	svn
although i have no experience with it i should also mention that you can use the bazaar tool to access an svn server with bzr-svn and this may give you much of the benefits and merge capabilities of bazaar while still having the advantage of hosting your code on the widely understood svn platform

3614670
bazaar	git
while i just suggested bazaar in the world of open source distributed version control systems dvcss many people appear to be going with git

3614670
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
i didn t suggest this though since it forces a much steeper learning curve on users coming from an svn background and i think many teams in the wild would prefer the better windows support and ease of use of bazaar above the scalability and speed benefits of git

3614670
bazaar	git
if you choose to go with a dvcs like bazaar or git you probably don t need to get too hung up on exactly which dvcs you start using

3615039
public	protected
u s data members would either have to be - implicitly or explicitly - public protected or private

3615039
public	protected
if they re public or protected then they re not encapsulated and we re back in the share the pain scenario mentioned above

3615039
serializable	deserialization
for example a union of int64_t double and char 4 could always be read as an int64_t or char 4 after being set as a double but the other way around might read an invalid double and cause undefined behaviour unless you re re-reading values that came from a double at some earlier time perhaps in a serializable deserialization library

3615042

for what it s worth msil which all .net languages compile to anyhow is more consistent in that a sbyte is called an int8 and a byte is called an unsigned int8 short is called int16 etc

3615217
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
i know i can dynamically generate a gridview repeater listview control but what i d like to understand is which option from stated ones or any other beyond these would be an optimal solution

backslash	dollar-sign
you can prevent variable expansions by using backslash to escape the dollar-sign part of the variable reference

3615330
single-quotes	backslash
you can also use single-quotes to prevent variable expansions but if you need to actually print a single-quote then you need to use backslash to escape the single-quote

dreamweaver	aptana
since you are familiar with aptana already i would say stay with it as it has a lot going for especially over dreamweaver

3615355
folder	directory
otherwise i can t see any such folder directory there named twill-0.9-py2.6.egg - there is only a file with this name the one that i think was downloaded during the installation of mechanize. please tell me if my assumption is wrong - i may well be not seeing something very obvious here as i am just a newbie

hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
if the password is hash with md5 or additional like salt and sha1 then how to retrieve back the password

3615428
sorting	filtering	listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
i think the performance depends a lot on the data provider paging and sorting and filtering the data are easily the most expensive tasks when dealing with databases - so picking a renderer gridview listview repeater is more dependent on your comfort with that particular control

3615444
maven	m2e
in this case i d say yes unless you re using maven which has m2e and the eclipse plugin to generate them for you

3616069
facade	command-pattern
i d suggest that command-pattern is preferable to a facade

3616132

3616409
jar	manifest.mf
the problem was that the jar had a manifest.mf file inside it which defined the classpath

3616437
memcpy	memmove
it s not just checking for null it s ensuring that dest points to enough allocated memory to hold src it s checking the return value of fopen to make sure the file really did open successfully knowing when memcpy is safe and when memmove is required and so on

3616440

3616767
hide	show
u all must have notices in iphone photo gallery wen u open pic the tabbar and navigation bar do some hide and show functionality

3616776
hide	show
however if the problem is about the number of options a good choice would be to group options by category and show hide each group only when the user has to interact with them and you can use test2 that is more clear

3616789
mouse	keyboard
so if you add just the mouse listener you will not get the press event if using keyboard

3616797
hide	show
you can modify further the pdf file and what you wish to show hide adding attributes on the data according the adobe directions

3616822

3616871
rss	feed
as an example considering this rss feed item from the magnificient brother bricks site

3616871
rss	feed
however it s not because they correctly parse the rss feed but rather because beside being able to interpret correctly the rss stream they re able to interpret its content in this case some html fragment representing the entry to render

3616877
gridview	detailsview
my problem is that it s also possible for the user to navigate from a webform - they can click the edit hyperlink of a gridview which takes them to a page containing a detailsview of the selected record

3616942
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
you can load your nib and activityindicator over it immediately and can use nsoperationqueue and nsinvocationoperation with appropriate selector which will perform your background task as this request will be run asynchronously

3617019
implements	extends
you will have to extends an adapter and implements getview to property set the image+text

3617067

mouselistener is a low-level event listener in swing and awt by the way

3617284

i find it impossible to have visualvm s profiler notice any functions defined in single-segment namespaces.

3617455
google-chrome	firefox
the code is properly working on google-chrome and firefox as expected

3617458
aggregate-functions	sum
you seem to have cmfilm.titel in your group by clause but you have no aggregate-functions sum count etc. so as it is now you probably should drop that group by or tell us more about what you actually want to query

however as it required the use of virtualhosts it must be set in the server s httpd.conf file instead of a local .htaccess

use css and some javascript to show and hide the details of each cd

3617563
superclass	subclassing
to address the sub-question about how smalltalk from which mvc originates handles this originally this is smalltalk-80 where trygve reenskaug implemented mvc it was indeed necessary to subclassing the view superclass for your specific view to register it as a subscriber to change events from a concrete model subclassing

3617563
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse to the model

3617569

ws-federation uses ws-trust to perform browser based passive federation and is in many ways similar to saml2 passive - and in many ways not

3617680

however reading the javadocs of concurrenthashmap and weakhashmap makes me wonder when it is useful to use it

3617729
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the grdiview is based off of a data source so originally i tried basing the enabled value of the dropdownlistfor off of the data eval of the checkbox datavalue

3617729
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i think the way it would have to work is and event on the checkbox would have to actually enable the dropdownlistfor i don t think the dropdownlistfor can listen for the checkbox to be checked

3617729
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
but when i click the checkbox the dropdownlistfor does not become enabled

3617738
openssl	gnutls	openssl	crypto++
once you read it you may better understand why everyone relies on cryptographic libraries such as openssl gnutls crypto++ and so forth.

3617742
submit	submission
submit button b - once the form is filled it will use all that data to do another submission

3617743
return-value-optimization	nrvo
the first is that if the compiler supports return-value-optimization and especially when it also supports nrvo chances are high copy will not take place

3617747
inherited	subclassing
if you create a subclassing of car it inherited the class instance variable defaultcolour as a normal object would do as well

3617747
inherited	subclassing
if the defaultcolour class instance variable has a value the subclassing also inherited this value

3617795
terminate	timeout
the timeout period can be adjusted to reduce the amount of unnecessary reconnecting though it cannot typically be infinite because most server frameworks will terminate the server-side process if it appears to have hung for too long

3617809
hide	show
you should use the view.columns somefieldname .visible property to hide show a column

3617829
inherited	properties
you could also mark the owner properties inherited to have it propagate automatically to the menuitems

3617850
client-side	server-side

is there any way in bash to pipe stderr through a filter before unifying it with stdout

3618101
tcplistener	tcpclient
there it s easy tcplistener tcpclient etc

3618118
subtract	add
from that number simply add or subtract 7 to get all other sundays

3618125

you still use the same tcplistener and tcpclient if you want to make it that low level

3618125
wan	lan
the technologies for communicating over a wan are the same for communicating over a lan

3618139
int	chars
like chars each int type comes in three forms â â plainâ â int signed int and unsigned int

3618139
unsigned	short
similarly short is a synonym for short int unsigned for unsigned int and signed for signed int

3618139
integer	unsigned
the unsigned integer types are ideal for uses that treat storage as a bit array

3618139
int	chars
unlike plain chars plain int are always signed

3618139
int	chars
1 sizeof chars sizeof short sizeof int sizeof long

3618139
int	chars
where n can be chars short int int

3618139

different unsigned integer type

3618139
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer type

3618354
google-chrome	firefox
the iexplore hta mode and firefox google-chrome mode launchers will work just fine

3618370
metaclass	subclassing
as you already have a metaclass you might as well use it to put a add a separate _registry attribute to each subclassing automatically

3618487
std	ostream
you didn t use namespace std using namespace std is habit anyway so the compiler doesn t know what on earth an ostream is.in addition to that you didn t actually define operator only declared it so even if it recognizes it it won t know what to do since you didn t tell it

3618492
std	ostream
prefix ostream with std - std ostream

3618496
std	ostream
ostream is a member of the std namespace so either put a using namespace std

3618601
int	chars
since chars is really a small int having signed chars and unsigned chars makes sense

3618609
int	chars	unsigned	short
unsigned chars was never introduced or intended it s just how it is because chars is an integral type identical to int or long or short it s just the size that s different

3618625

since even assignments of primitive types aren t guaranteed to be atomic should i modify every getter and setter in the program in the following way to be thread-safe

3618659
awk	ksh
i suggest you show us your code next time since i believe you are quite familiar with ksh sed awk etc already

3618662
int	chars
signed chars short int int

3618671
nginx	lighttpd
i had similar problems with nginx lighttpd + php-fcgi using spawn-fcgi do you use any opcode cache for php

3618674
int	chars
signed chars short int int

3618693
width	height
but cellmap is very convenient because it implements its own optimized serialization and it exposes width and height properties that are more convenient than writing cellmap.getlength 0

3618824
addclass	removeclass
what you should do is use removeclass and addclass

3618890
post	get
this will auto-add slashes to any post get variable

the is prefix can give a hint about the fact that the properties only has a get accessor and as thomas and rachel said it s a bool

3618978
cvs	svn
there s also a case here for maintaining a master code repository in svn cvs or maybe git

3618996
button	checkbox
very similar for datagridview oncellclick can be raised when the column contains a button checkbox or link

3619049
jax-ws	jax-rs
jaxb is much easier to use with jax-ws and while jaxb is still easier to use with jax-rs sdo is a possible alternative

3619065
hash	salt
you could just produce k sn h x sn y which is the concatenation of an incrementing serial number with a hash where the hash is a secure hash function of the concatenation of the serial number between unique constants x and y that are secret salt you use to prevent the use of rainbow tables

3619081
hide	show
thus far what i ve done is use a maximized topmost mdi container and hide show the child forms as the user navigates through them

3619085
union	distinct
to get a distinct list of coursecodes and coursenames from both tables you can use the union operator

3619134
jquery	scriptaculous
i tried with some major javascript frameworks scriptaculous jquery etc... but i did not find any good way to achieve a similar effect

3619185
width	height
furthermore if the canvas size is width height then the size of the viewport will be width sx height sy because the size of the viewport scales inversely against the scale of the drawn geometry

3619203
jar	war
i ve only seen where you can setup run configurations for jar projects not war projects

3619211
public	protected
the enum can be represented as a protected string property with a public enum wrapper that converts to and from the string value

3619217
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i attempted in safari firefox google-chrome

3619219

unfortunately this won t help with memory you malloc and free

3619327
vb.net	vb6
vb6 and vb.net are quite different you know

3619452

post	get
i was wondering if there is a way or one could be added to support post variables in addition to get variables

3619524
ssl	https
see https ssl

3619557
public	protected
typical usage is that dispose is overloaded with a public non-virtual dispose method and a virtual protected dispose bool

3619557
public	protected
the public dispose method calls dispose true and subclasses can use this protected virtual method to free up their own resorces and call base.dispose true for parent classes

3619557
public	protected
if the class owning the public dispose method also implements a finalizer then the finalizer calls dispose false indicating that the protected dispose bool method was called during garbage collection

3619653
folder	directory
directory subdirectory refers to subdirectory folder inside directory folder inside your home folder

3619653
folder	directory
. directory subdirectory refers to subdirectory folder inside directory folder inside current execution folder

firefox	safari
i have used the following rule to allow our static domain to host fonts but i ve run into a problem font s not being used by the browser firefox safari when the browser cache is enabled

3619820
int	boolean
really though you shouldn t be comparing int to boolean if you can avoid it

3619854
google-chrome	firefox
this code works just fine in ie but not in firefox or google-chrome

3619913
ubuntu	debian
this is an example of getting cron source code in debian ubuntu

3619972
memcpy	memmove	memcpy	memset	memmove	memset
as of alchemy v0.5a when compiling memcpy memmove memset the llvm frontend will sometimes on mac os x emit intermediate code that the alchemy backend linker can t handle

3619972
memcpy	memmove	memcpy	memset	memmove	memset
the workaround is either to compile on a different platform ubuntu windows or to override the implementations of memcpy memmove memset

3619972
memcpy	memmove	memcpy	memset	memmove	memset
ultimately i injected the memcpy memset memmove workarounds by overriding string.h using -i and #include_next but this required hacking the achacks gcc script so that the -i flags are processed in the right order

3619996
toolbar	tabs
i started with the icons demo and was able to add a scroll property vertical to have content be scrollable between the top and bottom tabs that s actually what brought me to sencha touch the ability to have fixed toolbar

3620043
post	get
i want to get via nhibernate the tag list for a post with the count of each tag

3620043

isnull	nullif
since you re using 2008 i d twist the new nullif function with the isnull function and use a subquery

3620189
vbscript	jscript
but it s a heck of a lot better than the batch file language or vbscript jscript

3620248
int	chars
your example of cast convert chars 8 orderdate 112 as int seems fine to me

3620252
portrait	landscape
is it possible to change the layout of the app when the orientation of the screen changes from portrait to landscape

3620252
portrait	landscape
i mean linking the app to two different .xml layout files for each landscape and portrait

3620252
portrait	landscape
i want a button to be below the textview in portrait mode but i want them side by side in landscape mode..

3620286
versioning	upgrade
the software upgrade versioning can be specified per client different versioning can be deployed to different clients as required

3620303

it should center itself based on the width margin style definition

3620305
queue	fifo
the daemon will manage the tasks with a simple fifo queue

3620316
perforce	svn
while perforce is great svn git are more than ok free and widely supported

3620364

with it you can pretty easily pull from a git repo thus converting a git repo into a mercurial repo in the process and if desired you can also push back into the git repo from hg

3620384
g++	gcc
i m using g++ gcc 4.4.2 20090825 prerelease

3620390
put	get
since the question is sort of answered in my comment of frederik gheysels answer i thought i would put it here so it doesn t get buried

3620414
google-chrome	safari
for ie safari and google-chrome you can just set the text-overflow to ellipsis and it ll take care of it for you

3620424
versioning	upgrade
i plan on using a base script for my initial database versioning 1.0.0 but after that i will require change scripts which upgrade the database to newer versioning

3620432
memcached	apc
i have read about memcached and apc

3620441
macports	homebrew
be it from homebrew macports python.org etc

3620457
memcached	apc
memcached is a distributed caching system whereas apc is non-distributed and mainly an opcode cache

3620475
return-value-optimization	nrvo
one common optimization point is the return-value-optimization return-value-optimization and named return-value-optimization nrvo which basically means objects returned by value from functions get constructed directly in the object which is receiving them rather than making a copy

3620479
serializable	deserialization
i would like to control object creation of a type that is not usually serializable during deserialization using a netdatacontractserializer or any serializable i guess

3620515
boost	stl
is there any in-built stl or boost library function i can call that

3620525
versioning	upgrade
you should upgrade cakephp to a newer versioning

3620535
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
the protected modifier provides visibility of that method in the subclassing but if the method is non-static invocation of that method is possible only through the instance of a subclassing the concern you were raising if i inherited from the class superclass as follows i do not get any error

3620587
width	height
i want to make my image grow to 1500px in height and hopefully the width would just automatically re-size itself if not i could easily set it too

3620630
vb.net	vb6
versions of visual studio from 2003 - 2010 will attempt to migrate the vb6 to vb.net but this usually introduces significant errors which are difficult to fix

3620695
client-side	server-side
it would be sensible to do this on the server-side because getting an xml parser on the client-side is slightly tricky and you will need to do it on the server side anyway if you re going to be cleaning non-whitelisted elements and attributes

3620703
superclass	subclassing
you can t define id on subclassing and have an superclass that is an entity that has no id

3620752
portrait	landscape
and everytime the screen goes from landscape to portrait mode all my variables get reset to their default value and the countdown timer gets canceld and reset

3620795
16-bit	64bit
the reason you can t use 16-bit assembly is because the 16-bit subsystem has been removed from all 64bit versions of windows

3620805
width	height
a common way of doing this type of effect is by making use of bitmap draw functions that allow offsets into the images for a downward scroll effect simply do two copies from your source starfield bitmap into the screen buffer first from source 0 0 to width height-yoffset to screen 0 yoffset to width height

3620805
width	height
secondly take from source 0 height-yoffset to width height to screen 0 0 to width yoffset

3620811
fadein	fadeout
if you call calling element.fadein 200 .fadeout 0 the fadeout only happens after the fadein has finished

3620811
fadein	fadeout
also is there a way i can examine element to determine if a fadein or fadeout is running

3620827
google-chrome	firefox
this code works for translating an event in firefox ie and google-chrome on pc

3620841
int	boolean	int	double	int	chars
it will not break the application the attributes will have their default value - objects and strings will be set to null boolean to false int floats double to 0 chars to 0 etc

3620868
fadein	fadeout
afaik fadein and fadeout run synchronously so no i do not think you can interrupt them while they are running

3620868
fadein	fadeout
the reason the fadeout call in your example isn t called until after fadein is because animations are executed in a queue-like fashion

3620876
punctuation	words
yet when i create a pdf using pdflatex or i can t select but blocks of words separated by punctuation signs

3620939
put	get
with rrdtool you don t get back the exact data you put in due to the averaging over time

3620979
n-gram	words
is there a module or perl code that extract n-gram of words from a string besides text n-gram

3621024
min	max
for example in this list of x y coordinates the max value is 10 and the min value is -10

3621037
int	boolean
i am working with some vb.net code that seems to be casting a boolean value to an int using cint myboolean

3621041
width	height
it s pretty simple functionality in the normal browser world -- i want to popup a window of a given width and height and simply have the ability to close it even with something as lame as a close window anchor

3621069
int	boolean
this is because the boolean data type is stored as a 16-bit signed int

3621099
integer	unsigned
in other words an 8-bit integer is not a sign bit followed by a 7-bit unsigned integer

3621101
public	protected
put class b in package a too and make it only package protected skip the public key word

3621113
public	protected
if you omit the visibility modifier no public protected or private the method is visible for all classses in the same package

3621173
google-chrome	firefox
i have it working in ie wow o but not in safair firefox google-chrome s

3621193
matlab	simulink
you can embed c++ code in matlab as well as simulink

3621243
gdi	directdraw
any alternative gdi + or say directdraw will not use the full graphics hardware for accelerating blending and will have to perform it on the cpu greatly reducing performance

3621243
direct3d	direct2d
as mentioned direct2d is an option also--it is functionally a layer on top of direct3d that supports more 2d specific functionality as well as excellent text support

3621283
hash	md5
what is the best solution in c# for computing an on the fly md5 like hash of a stream of unknown length

3621316
hash	md5
md5 like other hash functions does not require two passes

3621318
implements	extends
in this case if you want to do as you describe it probably makes sense to create a class c that implements the common functionality between a and b from which both a and b can extends

3621329
implements	extends
it s ugly but you can use generics and constrain the method parameter to extends the class and implements the interface

3621353
cpython	ironpython
lock.locked is confirmed to be a present method in cpython 2.6.x 3.x ironpython 2.6.1

3621382
post	get
i couldn t find a pure ssrs method to get this so as mentioned in my original post i added a field column to the shared dataset query

3621391
width	height
you must not set the width and height of the groupbox in order to make the inner scrollviewer work

3621415
postgresql	mysql
i have been reading documentation and watching screencasts specific to mongo db over the past few days and i am at a loss for when a solution like this would be better than a typical postgresql or mysql environment

3621436
implements	sealed
it is up to the class to then implements the interface method as it will within the confines of the contract - virtual or non-virtual sealed virtual as it turns out

3621451
firefox	safari
i find this easiest to do by using 2 different types of browsers at the same time like firefox and safari

3621509
width	height
if you imagine your 3d array as a castle wall of height 3 lenght nmax and width nmax and one wall of that castle is weak and prone to being breached then each time you increased nmax you just made all of the walls longer including that one faulty wall so there is more faulty wall in your castle

3621517
chown	sudo
you may need also a sudo in front of the chown

3621522
actionscript	mxml
usually you put separate script code into an actionscript file rather then an mxml file when importing script though

3621528
accessor	properties
gets old is uglier than it needs to be wrap it in an accessor properties at the very least

3621546
width	height
define the map width height and zoom level

3621549
post	get
it accepts both get and post requests and can return data in either json csv or html format based on the http accept header

3621561
vbscript	vba
although vbscript has much common syntax with vba do not tag vbscript questions as vba unless you are specifically asking about both

3621561
vbscript	vba
some differences between vbscript and vba

3621569
post	get
the server receive some parameters which will be appended to the url in case of get requests or send in the http body in case of post requests

3621600
implements	sealed
if base and derived are declared in the same assembly the compiler will make base method virtual and sealed in the cil even though base doesn t implements the interface

3621695
int	double
you are dividing 2 int and casting to a double

3621757
postgresql	mysql
either natively or through third-party libraries it supports most major rdbm products including sql server mysql oracle postgresql and sqlite

3621834
min	max
functions like sort min max all take a key argument

3621904
min	max
for example the min and max functions can take a sequence of any comparable type - integers strings floats classes that have the appropriate comparison methods lists tuples etc

3622034
sip	sdp
in sip the original use case for ice the sdp s carried in a sip invite 200 ack exchange setting up a sip session.

3622066
cos	sin
e to the power of something imaginary can be computed with sin and cos waves

3622087
mp3	m3u
all i got for those radio i a stream url pls asx m3u mp3

3622107
width	height
in hl it used in private function updatedisplaylistvirtual void but there are no such function in layoutbase because layoutbase just a base class as it is but it have another one which called as public function updatedisplaylist width number height number void but its empty

3622127
post	put
be sure to put in your facebook id and the access token you got from the app you created see jens post

3622130
put	get
if i put the commands into methods not a command pattern then i get to reuse all my existing resources config logger database handles etc... but at a cost of all these functions and methods being mixed up in 1 class

3622156
put	get
the areas that get put into list box two are the areas that a person is in

3622173
int	double
for example func double int takes one double as a parameter and returns an int

3622234
post	get
search.aspx and post the selected value of a dropdownmenu and there is no get only post and postback from the server

3622329

3622330
windows	wow64
wow64 windows 32-bit on windows 64-bit

3622350
uiview	uiwindow
however there is a 20px gap at the bottom of the screen because i guess uiwindow accounts for the status bar and normal uiview s do not

3622355
versioning	upgrade
however after i upgrade to the latest versioning of xcode 3.2.3 these options are gone

3622363
int	chars
phone number could be an int if you want to strip all non-numeric chars and format it your own way or a varchar 15 if you do not want to strip the chars

3622370
post	get
it is not a rest protocol in any formal sense as it doesn t use the http verbs other than the usual get and post and is not designed for data

3622388
many-to-many	many-to-one
if you really need to enforce a separation between these two contexts you could model the many-to-many relationship explicitly with an intermediate object as two many-to-one relations

3622393
mouse	keyboard
if this is the case i don t think you ll be able to distinguish them as -pointingdeviceid -tabletid and friends are only valid for mouse events which a keyboard event - faked or real - is not

3622397
hide	show
i have a problem in ie8 only where a link should show hide content when clicked

3622397
webkit	gecko
ie7 and webkit and gecko browsers work fine only ie8 is the problem

3622402
mouse	keyboard
the numeric buttons 0..9 in a netbeans swing jframe use append below to drop the leading zeros but the user may prefer the keyboard to a mouse and non-numeric characters also need to be handled

3622412
pull	push
to share changes you can push to the bare repository from one machine and pull from the other

3622444
hide	show
i use a website which show information i have no use for so i tried to hide some of it with stylish an addon for chrome to insert custom css

3622448
post	get
i should clarify that it s specifically a file i m trying to post but i can t get it working with a string either so i don t think it s too do with that

3622476
goto	break
don t use goto to break deeply nested loops next last and redo all take a loop label as an argument

3622477
int	double
this includes numeric conversions int to long as well as float to double pointer conversions nullable conversions int to int

3622477
int	double
for example if a user-defined implicit conversion exists from int to some type t then it also double as a conversion from short to t

3622477
int	double
similarly t to short double as t to int

3622499
websphere	ibm
we have ibm websphere mq set up that accepts message from outside world and transmits message to another internal queue manager

3622508
pop-up	dialog
select canonical domain name from the premade rules in the dialog box that pop-up

3622519
vaadin	wicket
the major difference between vaadin and wicket is with how ui composition and client side code is written

3622524
post	get	post	put	put	get
put some factory to this class for creating get post methods then in test mock this factory and make it mock get post methods

3622577
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in firefox opera and google-chrome safari you could use pointer-events none in the style attribute

3622577
svg	vml
i m not sure how that will work in ie where it s vml rather than svg you may have to figure out how to adapt forwarding mouse events through layers to svg content

3622582
put	get
when you do get to using your fft routine look to see what coefficients are put outside the sum in whatever mathematical representation is used in your library 1 n and correct for those

3622617
post	get
through post get data

3622637
free	malloc
i could just call malloc and free for each but that will probably be very inefficient

3622637
free	malloc
a better solution probably would be to call malloc and free for larger blocks and handle the allocation within those blocks itself

3622690
uiview	cashapelayer
i ve got a uiview which has it s layer s contents set to the image with a cashapelayer sub-layer who s path is set to the shape

3622704
free	malloc
inorder to track which array locations are in use you could use a simple bitmap and then with a few clever bit operations and pointer subtraction your custom malloc free operations should be pretty easy

3622704
free	malloc
malloc creates pools of free memory blocks of different sizes i would bet that there is a pool for 16 byte memory blocks different implementations may or may not do this but its a pretty common optimization and since all your allocations are the same size fragmentation should not be an issue

3622713
free	malloc
you could try overriding malloc free with an alternative implementation that s suited to lots of small allocations

3622773
maven	pom.xml
i just created a new maven project using the default archetype and added the following dependency to my pom.xml file

3622773
maven	pom.xml
the following maven repo to my pom.xml i know this is bad practice though and that it needs to be added to a settings.xml

3622795
google-chrome	safari
with facelets some components like charts do not work in safari or google-chrome but

3622827
addition	twos-complement
in an unchecked context x + y means treat x and y as a pair of 32-bit twos-complement binary numbers and perform binary addition on them ignoring any overflow on the final bit and return the number

3622827
twos-complement	ones-complement
the technical difference is that if a machine where not twos-complement it would have to fake it to provide the required behaviour in particular the range of int is not that of a 32-bit ones-complement integer

3622881
google-chrome	firefox
edit sorry the above errors are firefox ones not google-chrome ones

3622910
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on firefox and google-chrome but not on a iphone

3622943
bash	zsh
is there a way in zsh or bash to have a status line

3623018
migrate	staging
the initial intention is migrate the source data to staging

3627261
width	height
so unless your views are rendered atleast once they won t be assigned any width or height

3627261
width	height
solution to your problem could be that you set some min height and width of view so that you have atleast something to work with initially and once your views are rendered you will have width and height of the view to play with

the data types chars short int long and long long hold possibly different size int that can take values up to a certain limit

3627431
int	chars
good practice is to avoid chars short int long and long long and use int8_t int16_t int32_t uint8_t etc or even better int_fast8_t int_least8_t etc

3627457
int	chars
broadly speaking a chars is meant to be the smallest unit of sensible data storage on a machine but an int is meant to be the best size for normal computation eg

3627457
int	chars
the size of any data type can be expressed as a number of chars s but not necessarily as a number of int s

3627457
int	chars
for example on microchip s pic16 a chars is eight bits an int is 16 bits and a short long is 24 bits

3627483
margin	height
i would give the footer a specific height and use this height as a negativ margin at the bottom for your scrollview

3627492

you should use putchar instead of puts

3627620
int	chars
chars cant hold what int can

3627620
int	chars
do some experimenting with sizeof to see if there is a difference between chars and int

3627620
int	chars
if you really wish to use chars instead of int you probably should consider instead and store the ascii base 10 chars representation of the number

3627629

3627853
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i mean firefox opera safari google-chrome and basically every browser instead of ie has a single last build version which can be updated-to from the browser itself why does ie need to have ie6 ie7 ie8 coexisting instead of providing an updater so everyone uses the same version ideally ie8 which doesn t have as many problems as for instance ie6

3627859
int	chars
as a chars is nothing but an int you will have several chars keys for one and only one same lastname and this is not what you want

3627883
int	chars
your error is coming from the fact that puts expects an argument of type but you re passing an argument of type chars hence the pointer from int without cast message chars is an integral type

3628037
width	height
after that it shows your image with a square that you can move around and make bigger smaller width height

3628094
union	distinct
it is better to use union all when you know you want all the result rows whether or not you know they ll be distinct or not

3628094
union	distinct
union without all will always perform the distinct check regardless of what the data actually is

3628842
redmine	trac
but i d be curious why they need this feature just because someone has a modified copy of a file doesn t really mean anything in management terms branches can still be protected very effectively using repository security any task tracking system like trac or redmine will tell you who s doing what and integrate with svn perfectly

3628845
svg	vml
populate it with your own svg vml polygons and attach a drag event to this custom polygon object

3628845

when a function returns is the memory allocated via malloc free

3629097
free	malloc
malloc ed memory is only free when you call free on it

3629117
min	max
qprogressdialog s progress bar cannot be used showing busy state because that would require setting qprogressdialog s min and max values to 0 which immediately closes the progress dialog

3629271
firefox	safari
edit i just noticed that it renders properly in safari but not in firefox

3629387
tripledes	aes
tripledes is generally not recommended because aes gives better security more efficiently you might like to see some comparative timings of block ciphers that i took in java to see just how bad it is

3629435
for-loop	loops
some optimizing compilers will be able to do better loops unrolling with a for-loop but odds are that if you re doing something that can be unrolled a compiler smart enough to unroll it is probably also smart enough to interpret loops condition of your while loops as something it can unroll as well

3629538
apache	nginx
the best in my opinion is passenger in conjunction with your choice of apache or nginx whichever you re familiar with

i for one think that testing stuff like getter and setter is a total waste of time but i m sure that there ll be more than one coverage junkie out there who ll be willing to oppose me on this

3630220
versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade just changing versioning number

3630273
serializable	deserialization
i personally did end up several times with the following serializable deserialization class hierarchy

3630295
versioning	upgrade
none of them force you to upgrade to the latest versioning and some people do run older versioning of all the other browsers

3630298
internationalization	localization
actually what you are talking about is internationalization i18n not localization l10n

3630362

3630646
printf	strncpy
the variable names could be better and and it d probably be safer to use printf or perhaps strncpy

3630705
int	chars
there s probably a library for decoding these but you could do it yourself - according to the java language specification an escape sequence is always of the form uxxxx so you could get the 4-digit hex value xxxx for the chars convert it to an int with integer.parseint convert it to a chars and finally replace the whole uxxxx sequence with the chars

3630726

interpreted-language	compiled-language
an interpreted-language is likely to have some speed penalty when compared to a compiled-language but this is often unimportant

3631051
tcpclient	networkstream
once you have extracted the reference to a tcpclient in your onacceptclient callback you will want to get the networkstream via getstream and then call beginread or beginwrite immediately to start the asynchronous operation

3631073
beyondcompare	winmerge
for a task like this i switch to two snapshot views which at least download the file on the local disk and then use any file comparison tools out there winmerge beyondcompare kdiff3

inherited	properties
if you inherited and the properties is not virtual you cannot change it

3631155
inherited	properties
edit actually while the above it true you can overload this behavior by specifying your own attribute and setting the browsableattributes properties of the propertygrid class that you inherited from

submit	submission
i would like to somehow submit a form on that page using ajax i looked at some tutorials questions but they all suggest jquery but is there a way to include that form as a variable or another way of submission it without jquery

3631164
fink	macports
maybe macports fink or directly compiled. those non-apple-provided python won t usually support apple s versioner system

3631168
division	multiplication
assuming those scale linearly we can expect 32-bit versions of the multiplication to take 425-450 clock cycles and the division 510 cycles

3631216
google-chrome	firefox
in this regard i need the utility to read the url from the visible active tab on any of the three browsers firefox ie google-chrome that are currently open and then go off and do something with that url

3631232
rss	feed
well the beauty of rss feed is they always come in some standard structure even though some feed contain non-standard fields like google picasa s rss feed

3631232
rss	feed
the most straightforward approach in my opinion is to use a tool that allows you to unmarshall the rss xml feed into your rss bean

3631232
rss	feed
in my case i use castor to perform the unmarshalling process where i read the google picasa rss feed and gather only the fields i want

3631300
draggable	droppable
if a draggable is dropped outside of any of the inner droppable it should be accepted by the outer droppable

3631300
draggable	droppable
if a draggable is dropped onto any of the inner droppable it should not be accepted by the outer droppable regardless of whether the inner droppable accepts the draggable

3631300
draggable	droppable
so that would be easy if i could guarantee 1+ inner droppable would accept the draggable because the greedy attribute would make sure it would only get triggered once

3631300
draggable	droppable
unfortunately the majority of the time the inner droppable will also reject the draggable meaning the greedy option doesn t really help

3631300
draggable	droppable
summary the basic functionality is a set of valid invalid inner droppable to accept the draggable but when you toss the draggable outside any of the draggable it gets destroyed by the outer droppable

3631323
for-loop	loops
in c++ you use a for-loop to loops through anything but in ruby you ll find you re usually looping through an enumerable object so it s more common to do something like

3631338
implements	modifiers
so in a nutshell developers will complain about protected and private access modifiers simply because it gets in the way of what the developer feels would be the simplest and fastest way to implements a solution ignoring the future cost of relying on such implementation details

3631346
uielement	adorner
take a look at big nick s blog to see some elegant code for applying this usercontrol to another uielement as an adorner exactly what a badge is

3631407
jquery	scriptaculous
i ended up using prototype scriptaculous which are better integrated with cakephp than jquery to manually do ajax using prototype s ajax functionality with cakephp s requesthandler to determine when to return ajax

3631466
put	get
say i have a button and want to change the background button to a gradient is it better faster to draw a gradient using java2d or just get an image with that gradient and put it in the background of the button

3631468
post	get
maybe there are some sense to send something like get post or just variables to your proxy but where from you are calling it its another one question to you

3631476
google-chrome	firefox
looking at those pages with google-chrome s devtools or firebug in firefox will show that the slideshow.css in index.asp has a style in it that is every element to set padding to 0 which makes the padding and margin of your body and everything else zero

3631479
folder	directory
in this case the download starts downloading to a temporary directory i assume and we only know that it failed when it ends and tries to move the file into the folder

3631489
for-loop	arrays
and using i j in your for-loop will take i from the first element of each inner arrays and j from the second element

3631495
public	protected
protected classes are kind of the same - they re adjuncts to your public class that presumably do something but they only do it for certain clients

3631495
public	protected
so even just to subclasses isn t very restrictive - your bad protected interface isn t far from public

3631550
subtract	add
obviously the first one i need to add the timezone difference before showing it to the user using dateadd in sql while the second i need to subtract the timezone difference before store it in the database also using dateadd

3631556
apache	nginx
i have two django sites running on my server both through apache using different virtualhosts on two ports fed by my nginx frontend using for static files

3631560
free	malloc
new delete uses malloc free which are not tuned for allocations of small objects

3631560
free	malloc
malloc free

3631560
free	malloc
boost object_pool helps reduce both these costs at the costs of not being as general as malloc free

3631560
boost	allocator
so instead of allocator node with new i use boost object_pool

3631560
boost	allocator
so if boost object_pool works for you it might help reduce the memory allocator overhead significantly

3631564
hide	show
if all requests have finished then it can call some method in the application delegate and tell it to hide the loading view show the root controller etc

3631581
onfocus	onblur
start the timer in onfocus and stop it onblur

3631585
google-chrome	safari
as of writing google-chrome and safari do not support the filereader object so they cannot break apart binary files and thus not send multipart encoding asynchronously

3631594
public	protected
protected is meaningless or reduces to private without inheritance although not in java but with inheritance it explodes into a slimy public degenerate and more so in java programming scala chapter 5

3631594
public	protected
allen holub writes in holub on patterns which is a java book but great from a general oop perspective that protected is public by another name especially in java where

3631629
addition	multiplication
just like multiplication is iterated addition and exponentiation is iterated multiplication tetration is iterated exponentiation

3631653
width	height
just read off the width and height on submit and use php to do the manipulation

3631661
pop-up	dialog
what i d like to be able to do ideally is have eclipse pop-up a dialog box that lets me specify the name of the resource and the value for it

3631846
public	protected
second protected generally indicates some flaw in class design especially if both protected and public are used

3631846
public	protected
the pattern would expose a public non-virtual driving function and several handles to helpers as protected abstract or virtual methods

3631851
int	chars
in fact where the conversion is probably completely optimized to get the numeric value it s much better to use the instrinsic chars value of the digit string which in every encoding including ebcdic gives the numeric value by means of an int subtraction instead of a str parsing

3631855
qmainwindow	qpainter	qpainter	qgraphicsscene
i have a big qmainwindow that eventually calls a qgraphicsscene and inside of it i need to draw a single point one little pixel that is all i want i want to use a qpainter but im having trouble instantiating one

3631913
qpainter	qgraphicsscene
qgraphicsscene is not iirc a valid canvas for a qpainter to paint on

3631925
getter	setter
considering getter setter i d want a model class somewhere that has a few tests on those methods maybe test the database column type ranges

3631996
int	double	getter	setter
my advice would be to wrap scale in its own little class and name the getter operator int or operator double or whatever you re using for it and the setter

3632042
width	height
i d like the cgrect to use the width and height of the image without me specifying it

3632047
getter	setter
how about having an abstract base class which supports getter but no setter for all the attributes of the class a derived sealed immutable class whose constructor accepts a base-class object and a derived mutable class which includes setter for all the properties

3632084
hide	show
the application supports rotation and hide show the master side of the split as appropriate

3632094
post	get
it s dynamically generated by a django view given the get post context parameters

3632097
google-chrome	firefox
the easiest way to check this is to use the webdeveloper plugin for firefox or google-chrome

3632104
pull	push
when you re copying files if you re physically moving the bits from one disk to another like with cp or drag and dropping then you might consider creating a bare repo on your external drive to push pull from on your other systems

3632120
width	height
i always thought elements that had display none css style returned 0 for height and width

3632136
stateless	stateful
stateless and stateful enterprise java beans

3632154
google-chrome	firefox
perhaps this is a bug in google-chrome firefox too

3632203
floating-point	integer
and also figure out what causes the huge difference between integer and floating-point performance especially when compiling without optimization

3632226
getter	setter
what you re doing is a clever use of getter but unfortunately getter and setter aren t part of the current javascript standard they are in ecmascript 5 which isn t widely supported yet

3632267
jobs	cron
check out whenever and its railscast to easily schedule cron jobs that can run rake tasks or thor or shell scripts or anything else. you can use the rake tasks to update your models and then have some sort of dashboard controller that looks at the various statuses

3632290
hide	show
it s doing this so .height .width works even on elements that are currently hidden as long as their parents are visible...so you can run .height .width without doing the show hide trick it s doing in your code it s handled within .height and .width

3632295
put	get
but when i try and put it on another page with the straight up iframe code i just get

3632304
int	double
this stems from replacing the floats with int bitmaps and then subsequently interpreting them as double

3632310
range	median
if one has examined most but not all of the items that will allow one to guarantee that the median will be within some range if the list contains duplicates the upper and lower bounds may match but examining the majority of the items in a list implies o n item retrievals

3632337
post	get
i am using jpa with hibernate and trying to connect to the a datasource to retrive information but when i run the application i get no error as such but no results are displayed when i run the following code.the question arose from a previous post located here when i was setting up the environment to do some testing of jpa with hibernate on glassfish

3632362
getter	setter
synchronizing the getter and setter would also fix the problem but may look strange to other programmers who don t know why you did it and can also break down in the face of things like binding frameworks and persistence frameworks that use reflection.

3632378
post	get
pagination works fine in my post controller but in my tags controller i get an error on the second tag id

can somebody get me on the right track to sending data with http and the post method correctly

3632481
min	max
the first gets the max value for each group the second gets the min id for each record from each group that has the max value in case 2 records in a group have the same value and then selects the top 10 records

3632489
rtsp	rtmp
while its public open source version is a bit dated now you can have a look at this project which did rtsp and image based camera transcoding into rtmp streams with xuggler and red5

3632503
int	double
so all the double will be denormalised since the reinterpreted bit patterns of the int will have zero for the exponent field

3632503
int	double
as for the last question floating point arithmetic particularly double precision is much more complex than int arithmetic so on a reasonably modern pipelined processor each instruction will take longer to execute

3632514
getter	setter
also the usual argument for getter setter is that the logic may change and you won t have to change everyone that accesses your properties

height and width

3632558
min	max
min and max

3632558
width	height
height and width attributes

3632558
width	height
the height and width attributes specify the height and width of an element

3632558
width	height
note the height and width attributes are only used with

3632558
width	height
tip always specify both the height and width attributes for images

3632558
width	height
if height and width are set the space required for the image is reserved when the page is loaded

3632558
min	max
min and max attributes

3632558
min	max	minimum	max
the min and max attributes specify the minimum and maximum value for an element

3632558
range	min	range	max	min	max
note the min and max attributes works with the following input types number range date datetime datetime-local month time and week

3632558
range	min	range	max	min	max
tip the step attribute can be used together with the max and min attributes to create a range of legal values

3632576
getter	setter
by mandating the use of set get methods one can implement useful side-effects in the getter setter for example when the argument to get set is an object

3632585
getter	setter
there is the advantage that if you implement getter setter you can change their implementation later without having to alter code that uses them

3632586
getter	setter
getter and setter were a concept used in c++ when it was used for development of ui s but truth be told it s an expensive proposition to develop ui s in what is effectively a systems language

3632586
getter	setter
the general problem with getter and setter in c++ was that since they weren t a standard everybody had a different standard

3632590
aptana	radrails
i ve previously tried intype eclipse with aptana radrails plugin gvim and freeride

3632600
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to change the background-image of a div by altering it s css via jquery and i got it to work in firefox but for some reason its not doing anything in google-chrome i tried clearing the cache but still no luck there s no errors in the console either here s my code

3632600
google-chrome	firefox
any ideas on why this would work in firefox but not google-chrome

3632603
stdout	stderr
if i could capture stdout to one variable and stderr to another that would solve my problem because i could just check if the error variable was empty or not

3632608
folder	directory
if in a jsp page i create a new file only giving it s name it s created in the bin directory of tomcat folder rather in the same folder of the .jsp

3632627
folder	directory
it s definitely intuitive as the current directory of the running process is the bin folder

3632635
getter	setter
they have to use that interface and you control what happens when methods in that interface are called - the getter and setter would be part of the interface

3632635
getter	setter
all you do is set breakpoints in your getter and setter and assuming all else is fine you re able to see how your object gets to the weird state

3632636
fiddler	charles
i seem to remember previously using charles fiddler and wire shark for this as well

3632642
try-catch	exception-handling
using an event can be better than calling thread.interrupt since you have more control over of the flow of the program thread.interrupt throws an exception-handling so you would have to strategically place the try-catch blocks to perform any necessary cleanup

3632660
int	chars
you are returning a chars but kind of trying to put an int value in it

3632755
submit	submission
as far as the button not submission the form is concerned it won t submit the form until you submit the form yourself on the click event of button

3632762
int	chars
from a performance perspective int are best because they offer a decent range of values and the number of bytes used is small when you compare to varchar of five or more chars

3632781
expander	grid
you may put your expander in a grid where the column size can change and then set the expanddirection property of your expander to left

3632790
getter	setter
i would argue that c++ needs getter setter more than java

3632790
getter	setter
in java if you start with naked field access and later you changed your mind you want getter setter instead it is extremely easy to find all the usages of the field and refactor them into getter setter

3632795
nunit	mstest
you might also look at - it is a silverlight and wp7 unit test framework runner that also has an add-in dll for nunit mstest so you can write tests and have the same test code run in .net silverlight and wp7

3632803
jboss	glassfish
i don t know if jboss or glassfish have an equivalent i couldn t access the supportwlddincontainers page to find an answer for glassfish

3632807
domcontentloaded	onload
browsers give you two signals the page is ready for scripting domcontentloaded event and onload

3632807
domcontentloaded	onload
if you need to read dimensions from the document or its elements you probably need to wait until all images and css are loaded wait for the onload event if not you can use domcontentloaded

3632835
background-color	transparency
i then tried using background-color transparency but that unfortunately doesn t work

3632835
background-image	background-color	background-color	transparency
so the solution is to either add a solid background-color or a transparency background-image to the 2nd level links in your drop-down menu

3632840
min	max
if you are comparing numerics sqlite db engine used by android supports functions such as min and max

uiview	calayer
what is a calayer as seen in the layer property on a uiview and where would we use such a class

this way you don t need to publish anything the virtual directory points to your project s folder

3633163
capistrano	bundler
if you re using capistrano with bundler s require bundler capistrano the cache directory is at shared bundle ruby 1.8 cache

3633191
mouse	keyboard
however we do not want or have the wherewithal to write keyboard and mouse input method code line services code etc - the solution must support all languages that the standard textbox supports

3633191
mouse	keyboard
therefore the approach we re considering is to use a hidden textbox and to route keyboard and mouse events to it after suitable translation and to use its public accessors to determine how the characters are laid out

3633191
mouse	keyboard
we expect that the display part is doable but the keyboard and mouse input are probably very tricky

3633208
many-to-one	one-to-many

apache	nginx
this question is not nginx vs apache

3633244
apache	nginx
i am more interested in the architectural advantages of nginx over apache

3633244
apache	nginx
nginx is an asynchronous event-driven web-server which outperforms apache by a huge margin

freebsd	linux
allegro is a game programming library for c c++ developers distributed freely supporting the following platforms unix linux freebsd etc. windows os x ios and android

3633381
width	height
for example let s say you want a view s width to increase when you rotate it to landscape you want it to maintain the same margins relative to the top left and right sides of the screen and you want its height to remain the same

3633381
width	margin
this means that out of the six attributes above only the width and bottom margin should be flexible

3633383
uiview	calayer
the calayer of a uiview is just the stuff regarding what to draw the image bits the scale transform animation properties etc

3633383
uiview	calayer
if you want to do something special with what a view draws or displays that isn t provided in the stock uiview class methods it might be possible to do that special something by going directly to the calayer maybe swapping layers between views and or images drawing stuff off-screen custom animations etc

3633390
accessor	properties
see properties accessor docs

3633392
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem	uisearchbar	uinavigationitem
i always use an uinavigationbar and an uinavigationitem to display the uisearchbar

3633401
ncover	ndepend
the magic comes from the fact that ndepend can gather code coverage metric from both ncover and vsts coverage

3633415
hide	show
and hide show the img

3633427
.htaccess	httpd.conf
edit changed rules to reflect how they would be defined in httpd.conf instead of .htaccess

3633469
filtering	grouping
it should be possible to write a module that implemented hook_form_alter to intercept the node form for the food and shoes node and do a lookup based on the node type to filtering the grouping made available to it

3633490
gtk	gdk
in gtk gdk you register for all extension events with gtk_widget_set_extension_events

3633498
width	height
the getpreferred will return you the width and height

3633507
firefox	safari
in firefox it is set to which is alright but in safari and ie it is somehow set to 22 22 so i am unable to login using safari and firefox

3633517
sorting	filtering
it provides observable lists and lets you do all kinds of interesting stuff with them like filtering and sorting

3633563
public	protected
if you absolutely need the class to be b you ll have to reverse engine it with reflector and change public field to private or protected

3633587
width	height
ideally you should be able to work out where you want these bits using x y height width etc

3633598
post	put
the purpose is simply to ensure that when a post put delete is made to a resource it is done so from a form generated by the application and which has been seen in some form by the user

3633671
width	margin
we using the usual margin 0 auto technique with the outside container to center it while the inside div gets a negative left margin equal to the width of the off-center div

3633688
subtract	add

i think what you might want is to simply scale each 8-bit unsigned integer to a 16-bit signed integer

3637442
lsp	principles
at a minimum it violates lsp and open-closed principles

3637449

what s really strange is that in the subclassing there are duplicates of the superclass attributes so if i create a new object

3638021
superclass	subclassing
first prints out x the valued provided to the subclassing constructor but returns xxxx the value provided to the superclass constructor

3638021
superclass	subclassing
basically what i d like to have is that the subclassing does not create its own attributes but rather just passes the parameters to the superclass

3638023
jboss	glassfish
looking at the exception does glassfish base their design on jboss and tomcat

3638025
waitpid	fork
in the parent process fork returns the pid of the child process so you can store that in a variable and then use waitpid to wait for the child process to terminate

3638025
execvp	fork
not really - the new child process created by fork is a duplicate of the parent and execvp then replaces its process image with a new image

3638027
waitpid	fork
you need to store the return value of fork which returns a different value to each executable 0 if you are the child pid if you are the parent and then you need to do a waitpid

equals	gethashcode
so you can either implement on your custom class or override the equals and gethashcode methods to do the comparison by the properties you require

3638114
equals	gethashcode
you could just implement but it s a good idea to override equals if you do so and a very good idea to override gethashcode if you do that

3638133
entity-relationship	diagram
i m trying to develop a system and doing the entity-relationship diagram now i have two questions

3638135
uninstall	upgrade

int	chars
using an auto-incrementing int wont change what your queries looks like much and on a practical side the small sized in chars numbers might make debugging easier

3638240
serializable	deserialization
basically it s about serializable deserialization to keep data live between requests

3638247
superclass	subclassing
you augmented the 2nd constructor parameter when passing it on to the superclass constructor and then you used the superclass getcontent to provide the value returned from the subclassing getcontent

3638258
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade my jquery versioning to 1.4 from 1.3

width	margin
if you know the width of your table you can use margin 0 0 0 auto

3638996
public	protected
ie i have already thought of simply changing the public interface of the pages and nodes into the protected category and then declaring the b-link tree as a friend but that gives the b-link tree access to private methods that i want to stay private

3639002
free	malloc
i would say use the c version of malloc and free from the std.c.stdlib

3639007
cos	sin

children by the same token should not have to know their specific parent but if interaction is required the child must have some way to tell the parent things even if it doesn t know the parent s listening

3639300
int	double
retain release only matters for objects not int bool float double or other built-ins

equals	gethashcode
have you implemented gethashcode correctly to match your equals method

3639367

3639461
children	parent
then add all parent to a collection of parent with their 1 or more children

3639461
children	parent
note on the last one - the parent child last names don t need to match - in this case the children take the father s last name instead of the mother s but we don t list the father

3639461
children	parent
how would i create these type of classes so that i can add children to a parent add a parent to parent and then ensure it is querable with something like linq

3639487
children	parent
the person class slightly changes replaced mother father with parent made the children property readonlyâ

3639488

jboss	glassfish
jboss 6 7 tomcat 7 glassfish 3 etc capability of invoking direct methods with arguments which you then apply on string#concat

3640310
outputstream	inputstream
one problem i found is that the iphone sdk does not include the nsstream method getstreamstohost port inputstream outputstream which is what mac os examples use to open a nstream connection but there are lots of places that show you how to create your own like here

3640331
int	double
one note if you do this you ll probably want to collect it into an int and then convert to a double and divide by 10 number_of_digits_after_decimal_point

3640337
for-loop	loops
what i need to know is is the i inside the for-loop the same as the i that was initialized outside the for-loop because the variable i was first initialized before the for loops i was ever created

3640341
lisp	scheme

client-side	server-side
essentially you wire up client-side event handlers which do ajax http post requests to your server-side handler web service which then return back the response

3640722

tvos	ios
core plot is an open source plotting framework for macos ios and tvos

3640877
git-rebase	git-am
implementation details if you re interested by default git-rebase uses git-format-patch to create the diffs and then applies them with git-am with the --3way option directing it to fall back on 3-way merge if the patch records the identity of blobs it is supposed to apply to and we have those blobs available locally. it s also possible to tell git-rebase to use merge strategies internally in which case it directly calls the merge strategy recursive by default

3640907
verilog	hdl
the hardware design language hdl verilog is not hard for software engineers to pick up and learn you just have to think more in parallel execution than sequential execution

3640907

udp	tcp
udp does not have the guaranteed reliability that tcp has but for streaming that is okay speed is more important than reliability so long as it is good enough

3641030
decoder	encoder
the algorithm trades bandwidth for computation power both on the encoder and decoder

width	height
but the view.frame.size.height is still 1024 which is the height when the device is in portrait surely when the interface rotates the width and height switch values

3641715
portrait	landscape
say you wanted to split the screen into 3 views for an app that is both landscape and portrait and you did view.frame.size.width 3 in landscape that wouldn t be correct as the width value wouldn t actually be the width

3641715

3641781
inherited	properties
note anything assigned to an instance through the function constructor cannot be inherited unless you assign it to the prototype and overwrite it again in the function constructor to make it an owned properties

3641781
inherited	subclassing
because it keeps your objects minute and readable even prototypical references take up memory and when using inherited and subclassing you end up with child instances that have lots of unused method references

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the code works fine in ie 8 but not firefox google-chrome or safari

3641804
outputstream	inputstream
can a stream be implemented as subclass of either inputstream or outputstream but nevertheless be based on byte -arrays

3641817
stdout	stderr
javac writes to stderr not stdout so you don t read its output

3641817

3642050
pwd	chdir
when i use chdir to change the current working directory why doesn t the getenv pwd give the present working directory

if you want to run xuggler inside red5 to consume rtp and then publish to rtmp then you are in luck as this is very ez to do

3643041
google-chrome	firefox
this is successful in firefox however google-chrome encodes the question mark with 3f and the request subsequently fails

3643051
ssl	https
it is extremely odd that an https or rtmps request would be made while seeking unless you were already connected using ssl

3643077
coff	omf
dmd and its linker optlink work with the older omf object file format not coff

3643209
hash	salt
i am having difficulty understanding how a salt which is appended to a hash helps improve the security when a database of passwords or other important information is compromised

3643209
hash	salt
if the salt is for example hello and is appended to the password password then the salt and password are stored together hellopassword and hash to produce

for the most part swing is thread-hostile - it has to be used from the awt edt thread

3643218
folder	directory
remove all existing traces folder in the applications directory

3643234
hash	salt
1 when two or more people use the same password without salt you can see who uses the same password the hash are all the same

3643234
hash	salt
by using a salt value typically you want this to be a random number the hash won t match the dictionary the chance of them pre-calculating all passwords with all possible salt values is exponentially more difficult

3643234
hash	salt
so even if your user uses an easily attacked password say password which is pretty much guaranteed to be any in any password dictionary rainbow table by pre-pending your random salt value you make the hash pretty much guaranteed to be useless to the attacker

3643236
hash	salt
the salt isn t appended to the hash its appended to the password then hash

if i load this view and then change the orientation of my device from portrait to landscape the scrollview responds to the touches only till the pixel 320

3644065
int	chars
i can think of a number of incredibly inelegant ways for instance having virtual functions in the global worldobject class to identify attributes - for instance a getobjecttype function returns int chars s anything that identifies the object as monster box or wall then in classes with more attributes say monster there could be more virtual functions say getspecies

3644073
width	height
a full screen shape on the ipad is 1004 pixels height giving a maximum width of about 1044 pixels for example if you want a large shape in a horizontal scroll view

3644431
namedtuple	dictionary
then you could provide a namedtuple as the dictionary value and use the syntax pos.x pos.y etc

3644455
disk	ram
on most modern oses oom will occur long after the system has become completely unusable since before actually running out the virtual memory system will start paging physical ram out to make room for allocating additional virtual memory and in all likelihood the hard disk will begin to thrash like crazy as pages have to be swapped in and out at higher and higher frequencies

getter	setter
i can avoid it using reflection - find all properties with public getter and setter in class1 and call prop.setvalue child prop.getvalue parent null null

3646568

it s ok to not use getter setter if members are immutable const or simple with no dependencies like a point class with members x and y

3649082
getter	setter
if member is private only it s also ok to skip getter setter

3649082
getter	setter	public	protected
if member is public or protected protected is just as bad as public and non- const non-simple or has dependencies then use getter setter

3649082
getter	setter
as a maintenance guy my main reason for wanting to have getter setter is because then i have a place to put break points logging something else

3649105

can use as much little javascript as appropriate i ve used dwr with ie6 firefox 3 google-chrome

3649668
google-chrome	safari
this happens because when specifying margin auto google-chrome and also safari as they both use webkit sets computed value of margin-left and margin-right to an equal sized used values

3649668
width	margin
so if you have a 1000px wide page and your element takes 50 width 500px and has margin auto then chrome will set element s computed value of margin-left and margin-right to 250px so it fills all the empty space between element s border edge and its parent element s content edge with margins and by so horizontally centers the element

3649668
google-chrome	firefox
you can actually see it happening using firebug in firefox and developer tools in google-chrome

3649669
client-side	server-side
you would have to generate javascript code that mimics the resources you need as asp.net runs server-side and javascript runs client-side

3649675
disk	ram
other than that as long as you have sufficient ram and or disk swap space you can have std strings of huge size

3649739

i would like to extend jquery such that every post get request made on the client side will have an additional parameter sent always the same key value

3649799
post	get
but when i am trying to get value of these post variables in my asp file contact_us.asp then it returns blank

3649809
post	get
and it should work but it not the right way of doing things for several reasons the most anoying one of which is that you won t get a full url on your edit page because you got there with a post request so if you refresh the page your item id param will be gone and will produce an error

3649813

i have used yammer before and it was very good for internal work - it can open up rss feed with specific versions

3650240
x86	64bit

3650247
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
check out avaudioplayer class of the avfoundation

3650261

the issue is one of coupling since protected exposes the attributes methods to an unknown number of classes it s no different than public in that it s impossible to reliably state how many methods will be affected by a change of implementation

3650282
apache	nginx
apache and nginx are now supported via passenger or you can use a proxy with a mongrels cluster all these solutions don t need a dispatch.fcgi

boost	stl
i wasn t able to find an accessor in stl or boost that would just return a private variable

3650623
boost	stl
can you point me to stl or boost code that demonstrates trailing underscores for member variables

ubuntu	debian
if i want to use the new library version of ubuntu in the debian should i compile them in the debian

3650979
punctuation	words
i had thought in splitting the given string in the white spaces or punctuation symbols with a regular expression and the joining them controlling the length of the stringbuilder but i think splitting in all the words and then joining them may not be very efficient

3650989
google-chrome	firefox
i moved the mouse over event handler to the parent div and now firefox google-chrome etc

another answer suggests the use of jquery and .load and .hover which basically make use of the mouseover and mouseout events in javascript hence not bringing anything new to the question nothing can be done in jquery that can t be done in simple javascript right

3651162
mouseover	mousemove
the second post suggests apart from mousemove a function which via css display property makes the image disappear after it s loaded and then reappear at the same spot thus according to the poster making the mouseover event fire

3651206
width	height
c should have the same fixed width as b but otherwise be of a variable height depending on how many components are added in the flow

3651206
width	height
the resulting a should then have the fixed width and a.height + b.height as the height â at least that is what i want

3651211
maven	pom.xml
when i run mvn release prepare maven generates a bunch of new files in my rad eclipse workspace and modifies the pom.xml

3651211
maven	pom.xml
i can t prepare my release on the command line as maven complains that rad doesn t know about the changes to the pom.xml - i don t seem to be able to make rad aware of these changes without firing it up

3651242
ant	maven
i m not sure how you would change the names of the projects as part of the build without the help of a build tool like ant or maven

post	get
for my pennies worth i try and avoid using jquery to event handles such as post and get since normally the page then tries a refresh since no action was declared in the form statement

3651933
qstring	qfile
another advantage is that yourpath can be a qfile or qstring so that you can use it directly with the handle currently you are having

3651941
range	minimum
this alone is not quite enough to get the minimum while it works for normal values that has an unbounded set so the result will definitely lie within set s range and is therefore valid

3651941
range	minimum
we need the minimum within a range defined by the segment

3651984
pascal	delphi
i see that you like delphi so you can take a look at avrco multitasking pascal for avr

3652382
try-catch	exception-handling
class.newinstance may throw various exception-handling which you must handle hence the try-catch block

super	implements
this also works nicely if the class overrides the renderhead response method but in many cases that s just not necessary because a super class already implements the base functionality while the child class only adds some configuration

3652467
inherited	properties
if you set the block.textalignment properties to center on the datagrid it will be inherited by the textblocks and textboxes used in datagridtextcolumns and will center the text

this happens in firefox and google-chrome only and not in ie

3653409

however the way you reject them is by having the nullreferenceexception caused by trying to call gethashcode on null be returned rather than checking and throwing a argumentnullexception

3653418

your best bet is then really to use a plain vanilla element whose width height is set to 100

one thing to remember is that any given class can inherited technically implement many interfaces but only one subclassing be that abstract or not

3653622

this codeproject article might also be useful extend openfiledialog and savefiledialog the easy way

another way to think about it is that by convention put has to be idempotent while post does not

3653940
rtp	rtsp
rtsp or a new combination like rtp over zeromq

3653953
getter	setter
try to name the method in javabean getter and setter notation

3653963
getter	setter
of course this solution doesn t guarantee a strong compile time control because is up to the coder to write a good getter or setter

3653964
post	get
just wondering that the get is working due to the parameters being contained within the url whereas in post they do not

3653976

pop-up	dialog
this part of the code pop-up a dialog box with a message and has two options yes or no

3654191
int	chars
internally write int will just cast its parameter to chars so write i is equivalent to write chars i

3654191
int	chars
now in java internally chars is just an int type with the range 0-65535 16 bit

3654191
int	chars
the cast int - chars is a narrowing primitive conversion java language spec 5.1.3 and int is a signed int hence

3654191
int	chars
now what this means in terms of chars depends on how you want to interpret the int values

3654191
int	chars
so if each of your int values is the number of a 16 bit code point you re fine actually this is only true for chars in the bmp

3654217
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview which has a bunch of subviews

3654298
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome behave as expected

3654321
width	height
the way i am doing it now is by using paint s measuretext to get the width then by trial and error finding a value to get an approximate height

3654357
put	get
if you make your models very thin and expose aspects of the orm to the ui then you get tempted to put a good amount of orm type code into the ui

3654397

i m trying to implement a slidingdrawer that will occupy the full screen width but whose height is determined dynamically by its contents in other words standard fill_parent layout behaviour for the width and wrap_content for the height

3654520

this tool has exactly the same purpose itâ s not integreated with emf though to generate instances of a uml ocl class diagram to see if the model is too much or too little restrictive

3654520

however i think the most flexible way to achieve this is by translating your uml ocl model to a csp constraint satisfaction problem or similars

3654581
ssl	https
ssl and or https is used to provide some level of confidentiality for data in transit between the web users and the web server

3654581
post	get
get post data

3654581
post	get
pierre 303 is correct get data may end up in the logs and post data will not but this is no different than a non-ssl web server

3654581

there is also a performance hit normally when using ssl so some sites will configure their pages to only use https when the user is sending sensitive information for example their password or credit card details etc

just put the call to get items in the callback of the delete items function

3654648

the only way i could make the example above work portable over firefox google-chrome and ie is by registering the onload listener through inlined javascript in the html loaded in the popup window

3658609

inherited	properties
it s like class inherited because now any objects you make using new objmaker will also appear to have inherited the b properties

3658684
int	double
and then at some point in the future somebody notices that getthenumber only ever returns whole numbers so refactors it to return int rather than double

3658684
floating-point	integer
no compiler errors and you start seeing unexpected results because what was previously floating-point arithmetic has now become integer arithmetic without anybody noticing

3659023
mergesort	in-place
even so you re probably better off with a mergesort than a true in-place sort

3659036
width	height
this is a built in behavior of the newly released microsoft ribbon the containing window is stored in the ribbon object and the ribbon collapses when the width of the window is under 300 or the height of the window is under 250 the purpose is of course is that when space is scarce priority is given to the document not the ribbon

3659051
rss	feed
realistically you ll want a client side pull of the rss feed to get the latest data so you aren t dependent on google crawling the website

3659051
rss	feed
the client side software will directly pull the updated rss feed from the blog capturing the posts as they are published to the rss feed

3659073
hide	show
i have myself faced this issue many times as in like if i set toggle visibility handler on ahref click and some other action hide it show it by some other event like ajax load toggle will not keep track of it it will do what it is supposed to do alternate action to previous

3659073
hide	show
so for toggling requirements like such hide show i drilled down a much more obvious and controlled solution

3659073
hide	show
this way i can show hide even by some other event and it will be tracked commonly by a class showing

3659074
mouse	keyboard
this is strange because the documentation says that the change event is dispatched when the slider changes value due to mouse or keyboard interaction - the event is not triggered when you change it programmatically and the listener shouldn t even be called

3659080
flip	slide
so if i could flip the view in or fade it in or slide it from the right or the left or something that would be much better asthetically

getter	setter
it seems odd and rather error-prone if i can only create a cronexpression with a string to parse instead of with getter and setter

3659263
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter
because of how mouseover mouseout mouseenter events work they won t work while you re dragging an element - you ve got your draggable div under the mouse at all times so there s no mouseenter leave events being fired on the rest of the page

3659263
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter
if you enter one of those zones then internally the libraries fire their mouseenter mouseleave mouseover events to simulate an actual mouseenter leave over event having occured

3659263
width	height
resizing is somewhat similar except you re adjusting height and width instead of top and left

3659283
intrinsics	inlining
also compilers might have an easier time optimizing inlining memset because it can have intrinsics support for it

memcpy	memset
for instance visual c++ will often generate inline versions of memcpy memset that are as small as a call to the library function thus avoiding push call ret overhead

3659283
memcpy	memset
but it all depends - and for normal stuff please stick to memset memcpy

client-side	server-side
server-side authentication server-side authorization client-side encryption

3659699
client-side	server-side
server-side authentication server-side authorization client-side encryption using server credentials

3659699

uiview	subviews
called the subviews from uiviewcontroller instead of the the uiview

3660278
portrait	landscape
i think your view controller s shouldautorotatetoorientation method is not returning yes to landscape but to portrait orientations

3660288
put	get
however in order to get it completely random i have to put the thread to sleep for at least 300 counts between the random shuffling of the two columns anything lower than 300 returns both columns sorted in the same order as if it is using the same seed for randomness

3660336
post	get
have the link submit an ajax request to the controller action using an http get unless clicking the link changes server-side state in which case a post should be used

3660547
ant	maven
ok i could embed the aspectj ant tasks using the maven antrun plugin but i d hate to resort to that

3660558
integer	unsigned
sometimes i think it would be useful to have a 31-bit integer type which would support widening casts to both signed and unsigned int but i ve never heard of a language supporting such

3660617
hex	binary
ok so i ve got an array with integers converted from intel hex file and need to output it as binary

3660627
margin	height
then set the height of the footer make sure its the same as the margin in #content

if you want the range of an unsigned integer for x amount of bytes you should use this calculation

3660714
width	height
height and width

3660750
inherited	properties
this is partly done to allow inherited of properties but also allows you to specify a lot of properties on an object without using a lot of memory per instance

put	get
but whatever value i put in there seems to get ignored

3660821

3660914
implements	extends
public class threadprocessing extends midlet implements commandlistener

3660938
vaadin	wicket
guice can be integrated in vaadin and wicket

3660938
vaadin	wicket
testing the ui should be easy with vaadin although i didn t found unit testing stuff and is very easy with wicket

3660938
vaadin	wicket
last but not least creating lists tables is very easy in vaadin compared to wicket

3660941
google-chrome	safari
webkit-based browsers like safari and google-chrome hide xml markup from the rendered text

3660957
haskell	ocaml
haskell ocaml - do these have similar facilities either via byte code or parse tree

3660969
converter	multibinding
attempted to make use of multibinding however that is firing on instantiation and therefore the converter then fires accordingly

put	get
features like that get cut immediately and put on the never do this list

3661198
post	get
this is why you get a warning when you refresh a page that was generated in response to a post

3661198
post	get
use get or post but capture the parameters and store them the redirect the user back to another clean url that displays those stored value

3661211
getter	setter
if you look up the pattern for a singleton and store your variable in that singleton add a setter and a getter you are on your way

3661211
getter	setter
in the long run setter and getter and singletons are all bad code smells but no where near as bad as a settable public variable

3661228
width	height
you need to wrap your width and height values in quotes

3661236
nunit	mstest
if you really wanted to get crazy you could transform nunit test results into .trx files and import them directly using the mstest command line options

3661247
firefox	safari
another thing that makes my brain even more confused is that it does not occur in safari internet explorer 6 7 8 but only in firefox

3661249
yacc	bison
so at the first look they me be faster than lalr parser contructed by the tools yacc or bison

3661282
getter	setter
given that circumstances do i need to synchronize the getter setter

3661406
public	protected
the protected modifier is necessary on methods that override protected methods from a base class without exposing those members to the public

3661416
ssl	https
in this mode the ssl tls versions have to run on a different port from their plain counterparts for example https on port 443 ldaps on port 636 imaps on port 993 instead of 80 389 143 respectively

3661416
ssl	https
this is completely different from the way https works rfc 2818 which initiates tls ssl first

3661441
nullpointerexception	classcastexception
beware it can throw a classcastexception if your object isn t an integer and a nullpointerexception if your object is null

3661441
casting	autoboxing
java what s the difference between autoboxing and casting

3661485
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
is there any way i can make associated listitems bold to highlight them on dropdown selected index changed event so that user will know he has to select the highlighted checkbox for the selected value in dropdownlistfor

3661515
junit	testng
it will allow you to define tests using simple sentences group them in hierarchies and then put simple implementations junit testng etc. behind each statement

3661530
profiler	yourkit
i ve gotten comfortable using the yourkit profiler

3661532
draggable	droppable
jquery ui s draggable and droppable functionality would be the standard but it will require some javascript programming

3661558
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i assigned the code above to the viewwillappear to the root uiviewcontroller of my uinavigationcontroller and it worked

3661636

the problem ended up being the dictionary class i got it to vaguely work by throwing in a bunch of try catch blocks but that wasn t what i wanted so i replaced it with a map and it works fine

3661793
folder	directory
the solution folder is typically one above the project directory so give this a shot

3661833
equals	gethashcode
btw the ide is probably already giving you a warning that gethashcode and equals should always be treated together.

3661858
webclient	httpwebrequest
it would take more work but rather than using webclient use httpwebrequest and set the allowautoredirect property to false

3661941
int	chars
use the select int int method first to select the last chars

3661975
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it in firefox 3.6 ie8 and google-chrome 5

3661980
.htaccess	httpd.conf
for settings in httpd.conf eg that pertain to apache itself rather than php you ll need to use .htaccess files

3662011
button	checkbox
you need to use radio button and group them rather than doing it by checkbox

3662024
.htaccess	httpd.conf
for apache use .htaccess which will grant you control over much of what would httpd.conf would have given you

3662159
put	get
i ve put logging in all the functions which get registered with register_shutdown_function and it s not happening in any of those

3662160
single-quotes	double-quotes
in mysql by default single-quotes and double-quotes are literal string delimiters while backticks are identifier quotes

3662164
spweb	spsite
i m still a little fuzzy on when to dispose of sp objects so i always dispose of my spweb and spsite objects.

maven	pom.xml
is there a way to have maven output a list of all the pom.xml files that provided references to projects that are part of the reactor build for a given project

3662303
width	height
i am persisting the positions of these boxes using core data into a sqlite database by holding the height width x and y of the top-left corner

3662303
uiview	subviews
however once the uiview for the subviews is on screen it is positioned at a different location clearly visible and confirmed by checking the values in the frame of the view

3662329
int	boolean	int	double
the object types of primitive types in java double int boolean etc are if i remember correctly immutable

3662347
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
and i do not wish to parse the body content into an object model created by xsd.exe or svcutil.exe whether or not those tools could even produce an object model that could successfully serialize deserialize this particular xml is a matter of vigorous debate

3662355
ilist	icollection
icollection and ilist provide a set of similar functionality to accomplish an operation on a collection without worrying about the specifics

3662366
superclass	subclassing
in your subclassing constructor super has been called implicitly the constructor of the superclass is finished the final fields in the superclass should not be modified

3662377
folder	directory
first you can make your script search every folder under it s starting directory

3662383
width	height
the static method basically just looks at the number of characters and determines a scaling factor to apply to the textview s text size and then incrementally increases the text size until the overall height an estimated height -- using the width of the text the text height and the width of the textview is just below that of the textview

3662399
superclass	subclassing
every constructor of a subclassing must invoke a constructor of the superclass as its first operation

3662399
superclass	subclassing
given those rules it is impossible for a subclassing constructor to directly assign a value to a final superclass member

3662429
width	height
and then used .getscreensize but i am sure you could use it to get the width and height of your parent application with something like this

3662431
parent-child	one-to-many
only way i know to do this is with foreign generator but for one-to-many relation with parent-child i can t have parent-key as primary key in child table

3662452
awt	swing
finally it is not possible to use swing component with blackberry j2me.mobiles doesnt support swing awt

3662497
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine for me in firefox 3.6.8 ie 8 and google-chrome 5

3662509
yacc	bison
some useful tools are yacc and bison and lexx

3662515
subtract	add
in the second cte allmissingtests we subtract the tests that have been taken using the except operator and add a 0 to represent their not-done status when we insert them you can replace that with no - when i ran this test i used a bit column

3662531
google-chrome	firefox
the site runs fine under both google-chrome and firefox

3662568
converter	multibinding
one of the ways to force the converter to be called again is to add a binding to the multibinding that is bound to a property that will change every time the text of the richtextbox changes

3662637
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it in firefox 3.6.8 google-chrome 6.0.472.53 beta and ie 8.0.7600.16385

3662654
int	chars
in function int main int chars chars expected unqualified-id before token

3662705
folder	directory
i created two directory in my webapp folder named 1 and 2 and i am able to navigate to both packages using the urls above

3662734
spaces	delimiter
delimiter should be spaces semicolon or comma just like in stackoverflow

3662746
strstr	substr
since what we re looking for is a constant we can use strstr which finds the first instance of a substr in a string case insensitively instead of a regular expression

3662746
content-disposition	content-type
there are four mime headers that can appear here content-type as we saw before content-id content-disposition and content-transfer-encoding

3662772
actionscript	mxml
i guess you have to use actionscript or mxml states to achieve a similar behaviour

3662776
serializable	deserialization
if you want to avoid serializable and deserialization to objects it is way to go but in that case any xml can arrive

3662792
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and i think google-chrome can be configured by their users not by your code to allow focus requests but by default they won t

3662807
stdout	fflush	stdout	stderr	stderr	fflush
because only fortran 2003 standard includes fflush statement and the ability to determine numbers that corresponds to stdout stderr units

3662807
stdout	fflush	stdout	stderr	stderr	fflush
however in gfortran for example you can use fflush intrinsic procedure with the equivalents of unix file descriptors unit 5 for stdin unit 6 for stdout and unit 0 for stderr

3662843
nexus	artifactory
ivy is great for managing small repos however i d recommend considering a full blown repository manager like nexus artifactory or archiva

3662876
prepare	execute
you must use dynamic sql to prepare and execute an sql string to achieve what you describe

3662899
int	chars
int sprintf chars str const chars format .

3662909
post	put
i put together a blog post a while ago on how to interrogate groovy closures for values

3662924
min	max
select id rid min modified max active did from foo group by rid did order by id

3662926
serializable	deserialization
seems that there really is a problem with serializable deserialization

3662930
put	get
as you can see i have put uiapplication sharedapplication statusbarorientation to try and get this but it still only save the photos in portrait

3662985
width	height
i have tried setting explicit pixel values for the width and height as well as using the border_width definition and fill_parent options

3663004
min	max
if i provided the cube s min and max would that make it faster

3663012
rsa	dsa
adding to erickson s answer if your certificate does not use a rsa key-pair and instead turns out to use a dsa key-pair then no amount of rsa cipher suite stuffing will aid in resolving this issue

3663012
rsa	dsa
the reason this edge case might turn out to be your problem is due to the default behavior of the keytool utility when generating secret keypairs - dsa and not rsa is the default algorithm

3663027
getter	setter
i have an object field that contains a field called value which is a string with getter and setter

3663042
multicastdelegate	delegation
maybe someone with a bit more esoteric knowledge of delegation and multicastdelegate can shed some light on this

3663044
portrait	landscape
when i receive a uideviceorientationdidchangenotification how do i tell if it s a portrait landscape change or a face up face down change

3663044
portrait	landscape
i also receive notifications in between landscape portrait changes such as when the device goes 45 degrees between landscape portrait

3663044
portrait	landscape
i only care about changes from full 90 landscape portrait changes and would like to discard all other changes without doing anything

3663066
cpu	affinity
try using windows task manager to set the affinity on your matlab.exe process to a single cpu

3663066
cpu	affinity
on the processes tab right-click matlab.exe set affinity... un-check all but cpu 0. if the crazy timing goes away while affinity is set looks like you found the cause

3663066
cpu	affinity
you don t want to have to muck around with cpu affinity

3663090
folder	directory
alternately you can place a completion template in your resources directory in the perl folder

3663105
actualheight	actualwidth
you can use actualheight and actualwidth to get the size and you can work out the bottom and right by adding those to the location

3663107
post	get
in this post you see how you get the position

3663121
uiswitch	uibutton
i ve done this successfully with a uiswitch in each row but can t use the same method for the uibutton

3663173
getter	setter
you can t use a basic lock command to control access to a resource outside the scope of the object and that means that the traditional getter setter designs don t work

3663173
getter	setter
another possible method is to expose getter and setter but implement your own access control by using a checkout model

3663173
getter	setter
until that thread calls the setter aborts etc. all other threads attempting to access the getter are kept in a yield loop

3663174
width	height
jframe.setresizable true lets the user resize both the width and height of a window

3663189
width	height
you will have to play with padding and width height of the elements to get it to float where you want it

3663234
portrait	landscape
how can i make the transition from portrait to landscape animate smoothly

3663239
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
also this is happening in firefox google-chrome safari have not tested in ie

3663336
mouseover	mousemove
every time you mouseover the elements you attach a new mousemove event

3663336
hide	show
much better to have it in the dom to start with just hide and show it

3663367
implements	extends
probably you need to extends org.apache.shindig.gadgets.render.proxyrenderer implements org.netmera.portal.shindig.requestpipeline org.apache.shindig.gadgets.templates.templatemodule and more and more.

3663370
google-chrome	firefox
i can get the right result from firefox and google-chrome

3663419
children	parent
this doesn t make any sense for a one-to-many relation you can t use the pk of the parent as the pk of a child if you can have many children

3663419
parent-child	one-to-many
only way i know to do this is with foreign generator but for one-to-many relation with parent-child i can t have parent-key as primary key in child table

3663435
jobs	cron
1 - may not look production quality but i m using this and others like it on some cron jobs and php sites and it s working well

3663456
width	height
alright i have a div which is 50px height and the width does not matter that has a title displayed

3663474
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
as for sequential programming the minimum is one imperative language and one functional language ideally both lisp scheme and haskell but f# is a good start

3663547
maple	maxima
macsyma maxima maple mathematica or any other cas would also help you if you need answers and not solutions

3663584
for-loop	loops
when you add the layer to the root layer inside the for-loop set the animations media timing s property begintime with a cgfloat that increments every time loops fires

3663588
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
i ve created a static archive library that uses the avaudioplayer class and links against the avfoundation

3663616
scheme	racket
you might check out the typed variant of racket previously known as plt scheme

3663616
scheme	racket
since racket is a scheme metaprogramming is par for the course and the runtime can emit native code by way of a jit

3663633
comparator	comparable
i would imagine that in the general case this saves a fair amount of code being developed to implement comparator since the key is likely a type that is already comparable

3663641
children	parent
one way to do this would be to keep track of how many items are in the left and right branches of each node on an insert or delete change the node count of parent nodes when changing the count of the children

3663655
width	height
i want the imagesz to be displayed at 80-90 of the original width and height

3663665
portrait	landscape	oncreate	recreate
i just want to set some flags when my orientation is in landscape so that when the activity is recreate in oncreate i can toggle between what to load in portrait vs

3663674

post	get
i ve been working on an app that uses both get and post requests to web services

3663701
post	get
the get requests are no problems but the post requests are killing me

3663711
cos	sin
so i tried to multiply these by the sin and cos os the y rotation but it did not work

3663722
post	put
i know this doesn t directly answer your question - i was going to post this as a comment but with the amount of content i wanted to put it in my only choice was to provide an answer.

3663725
vmware	virtualbox
i suspect it s not that common to have multiple network cards in a machine running winxp but it is common to have vmware or virtualbox virtual interfaces that expose this issue with msmq binding

3663798
comparator	comparable
for instance maybe you require classes to be comparable to one another comparator and you also want to make sure the user of your template class remembers to override tostring so the data can be displayed iformattable

3663801
uiview	subviews
but i want the two subviews -- the scrollview containing the image and the uiview containing the buttons -- to autorotate when the user switches orientations

3663812
bash	tcsh
open your terminal and run bash if you use tcsh and do

3663868
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
you duplicate the source tree for that project to your machine and put the duplicate under a version control system svn hg git bazaar -- whatever -- there s a bazillion good free ones quite independendently from any vcs it might have been in originally -- the point is being able to save your edits all the time and revert them easily if and when you make mistakes

3663889
min	max
there are also min and max attributes and a required attribute

3663894
switching	screens
the full-screen mode potentially changes the screens resolution and switching to windowed mode changes it back to what it was previously

3663894
switching	screens
is this the result of improper screens resolution switching code or is there some way i can assure the os that the resolution is at the default and therefore doesn t need to change it

3663930
draggable	droppable
as it turned out writing my own calendar based on jquery s draggable droppable ui component is not that hard and is way more flexible and extensible

3663966
range	minimum
realize one thing school is there to teach you a wide range of things - to a minimum level

3663996
put	get
as with most secrets if you don t want others to get them don t put them on the page

3664077
public	protected
the constructor is fine with the default or private modifier but gives me a compiler error if given the public or protected modifiers

3664096
public	protected
thus you cannot have a public or protected constructor because that would allow more instances to be created

3664168
opera	google-chrome
tested with success in ie 8.0 opera google-chrome

3664171
dictionary	map
if you decide to implement the map as a list you would keep the elements sorted by key so that lookup is o lg n giving you another sorted dictionary -- in the form of a sorted list

3664171
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
of course the name sorteddictionary was already taken but sortedlist wasn t

3664183
put	get
extract one class will open the file and get all the data in chunks you know how to work with usually you take a single row from the file and parse its data into a poco object containing fields that hold pertinent data and put those into a queue that other work processes can take from

3664200
ready	each
then you will perform the two recv calls only on those which are ready -- say for a very busy system half a dozen of them each time around for example

3664200
ready	each
in addition with approach 1 you can block until at least one connection is ready no overhead in that case which won t be rare in systems that aren t all that busy -- with the other approaches you ll need to be polling churning continuously burning huge amounds of cpu to no good purpose or if you sleep a while after each loop of checks then you ll have a delay in responding despite the system not being at all busy -- eep

3664256
post	get
rest is pretty simple to use from any client that you can access libraries that do http get post

3664259
rar	zip
each fontfile is supposedly i didnt check all there are really many inside a rar archive which together with a readme is in a zip archive which together with another readme is in each its own folder

3664286
pull	push
rollback is a one-level undo of the last pull or received push or commit

3664307
google-chrome	firefox
they don t appear in other browsers ie7 ie8 google-chrome firefox

3664310
hide	show
if you have a headertemplate or a footertemplate defined you could add any htmlcontrol or servercontrol inside of either of them and then programatically show hide it in the codebehind

3664316
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i need it to work under ie7+ firefox safari google-chrome

failing that put up a please wait whenever they select a tab statistics show that users don t feel the performance is bad if they get a please wait message

3664413
google-chrome	firefox
reading over the w3 specification i m led to believe that google-chrome and firefox are correct

3664413
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i also decided to test safari 5 opera google-chrome and firefox 3.6.8 all on a mac

3664464
width	height
it seems to me that all of denominators of the division operations are constants width height max... and these will not change throughout the course of the image

3664464
division	multiplication
as far as i can remember the multiplication operation takes about 10 clock cycles where as the division takes around 70

3664488

i ve got a problem sometimes not regularly recv returns -1 and while using epoll in edge-triggered mode

3664556
apache	nginx
use a similar strategy as #1 but do it via web server configuration apache or nginx avoiding the rails app entirely

3664578
width	height
instead of giving the anchor elements specific width and height which is useless anyway because they are given display block already you can give them a padding

3664685
versioning	upgrade
-u tells pip to upgrade packages to the latest versioning and -r tells it to install all packages in requirements.txt

3664692
clang	llvm
for example you could read in c with clang use llvm to do some optimization and then write out code in another language like java or maybe fortran

3664693
button	checkbox
for example when i hit do not refactor checkbox the affirmative action button says preview .

3664714

is there any performance penalty for using dbcc shrinkfile to reduce the database log file size ldf

3664721
inherited	properties
the difference with the first method is that the in operator checks also for inherited properties for example

3664757
fastcgi	scgi
patches welcome that would be an async server instad and scgi fastcgi and ajp protocols for connection an external web server like apache to your application

3664788

3664800
move	drag
i am using in one parentview to findout hit when the user touches the view.it works fine.it returns childview correctly.i move those views in the parent view.but i added uigesturerecogniser to the subview for dragging inside subview .but when i drag inside the subview it takes hittest method and it moves...the dragging event is not fired...any help please

3664840
width	height
do you mean you want to maintain the original aspect ratio you re changing the width and you want to know the height

3664840
division	multiplication
performing multiplication then division will avoid some rounding errors but may fail if the image is huge if it overflows

3664881
primes	palindrome
you wouldn t want to use regex to detect palindrome for the same reasons you wouldn t want to use regex to find primes

3664957
hypersql	hsqldb
hypersql more commonly known as hsqldb is pure java rdbms which is specialized around running it as part of your application meaning that you can embed it to your software and it just works

3664965
mpmediaitem	avfoundation
from an mpmediaitem you can get an avasset see avfoundation

3664966
jsf	wicket
if you choose java as i am from java so easier to answer you can pick jsp-servlet jsf wicket spring mvc gwt etc

my greasemonkey scripts all work in firefox 3.6 but in google-chrome 6 nothing special happens when i load a page that is supposed to trigger them

3665098
csla	devforce
b return the object directly from a service operation as is done in a framework like csla and i think devforce follows a similar approach for returning business classes via a wcf service

3665108
google-chrome	firefox
the issue is not happening in google-chrome but is in ie6 7 8 and firefox

how to use printf to find out the hex and octal values of 255

3665223
post	get
when i just try to do where andthe post date time i get an error because of the space and if i quote it i think it takes it as a string

3665247
hash	md5
i assume md5 is fairly slow on 100 000+ requests so i wanted to know what would be the best method to hash the phrases maybe rolling out my own hash function or using hash md4 ... would be faster in the end

3665305
int	double
it s very unlikely that long is neither the same as or double the size of int so this is practical if not theoretically perfect

3665331
hash	md5
but you should be aware that crc32 will have more collisions than md5 or even sha-1 hash simply because of the reduced length 32 bits compared to 128 bits respectively 160 bits

3665362
webkit	gecko
i m set on supporting at least gecko and webkit but if i can manage opera and ie that would be a bonus

implements	extends
how does it find execute method or populate method in our action class if we dont extends any other predefined action class or implements action interface methods

3665444
richfaces	icefaces
however this library is compatible with others libraries like richfaces or icefaces

3665450
comparator	comparable
comparator comparable and comparator are typically used for sorting and only take the place of using the equals method for object equivalance in some cases - examples are implementers of sortedset such as treeset

3665487
filtering	grouping
using the same approach with the memberof 1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941 filtering but using the domain root instead of the user as a search base is not feasible as the query takes too long probably it computes all the grouping memberships recursively for all users in the domain and checks if they are member of the given grouping

3665493
jobs	cron
for one-shot jobs the at command is better suited than cron

3665593
post	get
i realise this is a special case in my application where the form field is not atomic but a list however its really confusing me that the data binds in the get request but not on the post

3665655
action-filter	onactionexecuting
it seems to me that either a base controller override of onactionexecuting or a custom action-filter is the most likely way of doing this

3665659
prototypejs	mootools
i don t know if you are familiar with the concepts of jquery or some other javascript helper framework like prototypejs or mootools but it s a vital idea to use one of them

3665662
width	height
i have not set the width or height of the usercontrol not even the viewboxes

3665662
width	height
because it does not have a height or width

3665662
width	height
so what will i have to to such that when any one view box has an image all the view box have the same height and width

3665712
put	get
when i put an iframe in the page i get the background image repeated in the iframe how can i avoid this

3665755
uiview	subviews
typically the parent view the one acting as a tab bar controller contains a header which never changes and a uiview below which displays the 3 child views as subviews

3665755
portrait	landscape
but when the current view is small enough to fit in the window without scrolling so scrolling isn t possible and i change orientation to landscape the scrollview doesn t resize its height and i become able to scroll to the extent of the scrollview in portrait mode

3665755
portrait	landscape
the second one is a bit more convoluted say i am in the first view in portrait mode i switch to the second view go to landscape mode and the switch back to the first view still in landscape mode the part of the view corresponding to the child view isn t resized.

3665757
int	chars
what is the proper way to convert a chars to int

3665769
put	get
the instructions ask you to put a script block and script link into the head of the page to get it all working

3665818
ant	maven
i have resorted to compiling aspectj via ant using the maven antrun plugin

3665818
folder	directory
i compile java classes first and let apt do it s stuff use the compiled classes as binary input for aspectj compile aspectj into a new folder and move the resulting woven classes to the original compile directory overwriting the non-aspectj classes

3665818
ant	maven
in the next step i have now created a maven plugin that does all this ant calling internally

3665818
ant	maven
using ant gmaven integration it was easy to assembly the parameters combining the powers of maven groovy and ant

3665843
post	get
i am currently trying to develop a web server that can service basic get and post http requests from a browser

3665853
int	chars
a chars is basically an int but with a pointer in the ascii table

3665853
int	chars
all chars have a corresponding int value as you can clearly see when trying to parse it

3665857
post	get
can we able to upload a file using http get or post requet in html form tag

3665875
post	get
make your form post method not get

3665875
post	get
get is for requestig data and post for storing

3665880
post	get
get is limited to a few kilobytes in maximum length and multipart form-data will work only with the post method

3665913
google-chrome	firefox
firefox with firebug is good you can also try google-chrome which includes a suite of develop tools

3665924
getter	setter
i use project lombok to automatically generate getter and setter methods for all fields of a java class

3665924
getter	setter
when a field is annotated with xmltransient the annotation is not propagated to the generated getter setter methods thus in the resulting code it does not show any effect

3665924
getter	setter
is there a way to use automatic getter setter generation in conjunction with further annotations

3665971
width	height
see if there s a height or width difference

3665971
width	height
if so calculate the height or width having figured out the difference between a browser that supports it and one that doesn t

3665978
int	chars
c# convert chars to int

3666023
int	chars
and convert.toint32 chars returns the code point of that chars as an int

3666029
implements	extends
you can implements your own focustraversalpolicy or extends containerorderfocustraversalpolicy with an accept method that just doesn t like your button

3666052
getter	setter
this is product getter and setter hidden for readability

3666175
getter	setter
i don t think propagating annotations to getter setter methods would work in the general case

3666186
post	get
you can either make sure that you re only reloading resources fetched via get requests or - alternatively - submit a hidden via the post method and thus simulating a reload guaranteed not to be cached

3666186
post	get
get amongst others are should be at least considered idempotent whereas post requests allow for changes on the server

3666218
lisp	scheme
alternatively you can pick something more classic like lisp or scheme

3666241
children	parent
in real cases i ve seen this optimized so that addnode for example would take a ref trienode so that the node can be newed on demand and automatically placed into the parent trienode s children in the correct place

3666241
trie	tree
you could also use a ternary search tree instead as the memory overhead for a trie can be pretty crazy especially if you intend to support all 32k of unicode characters

3666243
vb6	vba
i ve been given a vba spreadsheet which calls functions that are written in vb6 and com exposed

3666246
min	max
there can be between min and max elements foo bar

3666262
int	chars
it treats 1 as chars and int form of any chars is its ascii equivalent so it return its ascii equivalent

3666330
submit	submission
if it is for submission the post information again i suggest you manually submit the data through ajax or a hidden form submission using javascript

3666343
rss	feed
alternatively you could try a news site s rss feed or a flickr feed

3666389
post	get
the form action is get so that the users can navigate back to the search results without having to ok the post data request message

3666475
getter	setter
when using synthesize the getter -propertyname and setter -setpropertyname id newpropertyname methods are automatically implemented when using dynamic you have to do so yourself

3666494
post	get
the problem is that if i access to the api throught webbrowser get or post it does session and saves the cookie of php session but if i use jquery.ajax method it doesn t save it .

3666658
google-chrome	firefox
try this in google-chrome firefox ie works ok

3666670
implements	extends
akin to what stealthcopter wrote you will need to extends simplecursoradapter and override bindview to implements your icon-selection algorithm

3666687
int	chars
in order to get those int values i wanted to separate the chars sequence and the number sequence an do something like integer.parseint number_sequence

3666755
vsto	add-in
we have an outlook add-in developed in vs2008 using vsto

3666795
typedef	typename
here is the reason why adding typename either directly in the constructor argument or in an additional typedef works

3666845
pop-up	dialog
i would tend towards self-made modal boxes for a number of reasons input elements can be styled can be made more convenient and prompt dialog tend to get eaten by ie s pop-up blocker

3666850
content-disposition	content-type
i would create a plain old http output stream and change the content-type to text plain which means that you don t need to physically create the file on the web server and if you add the content-disposition header to the output and specify that it has an attachment called something like report.txt the user will be prompted to open or save the content rather than just viewing it in the browser like a normal web page

3666868
hide	show
if you don t want to change the navigation phtml files to add ids to them you can use the existing classes to target which nav items to show and which to hide

3666887
websphere	ibm
ibm has rational application developer also known as websphere studio application developer which is essentially extends eclipse specific for ibm bear in mind that in 2001 ibm donated eclipse to the open source community

3666921
post	get
using php i managed to get the values from input fields and jump menus from the post but of course the form refreshes upon submit

3666921
post	get
but this would keep giving an answer of 0 after clicking the button because it could not get values from post as the form had not been submitted

3666935
inherited	properties
i ve managed to solve this first by using inherited for the class and then using a formula properties on the relationship

3666957

queue	fifo
we want to update the oldest matching row i.e the lowest id the head of the fifo queue

3667267
getter	setter
a few things to consider do you have both a getter and a setter method for your boolean

3667272
implements	extends
sometimes it s also advisable to implements your own say baseaction which frequently extends actionsupport to factor out the common functionality of your webapp and make all or nearly all your actions extends it

3667304
folder	directory
i have imported it into my assets folder in the project directory

3667330
disk	ram
be they files from a cd-rom from a linux or windows filesystem on a hard disk or usb stick or ram disk or from a network server

the method getelementsbytagname works but not getelementbyid

3667392
udp	tcp
you cannot ping a port but you can try to connect to a specific port using either tcp ip or udp

3667392
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
the port concept belongs to the transport layer of the protocol stack either tcp or udp while the ping is at the lower network layer the icmp protocol

3667396
post	get
or hide the jsp file away in web-inf folder use a single servlet on register_and_login for both get and post and let the servlet execute the desired action depending on the button pressed

3667397
udp	tcp
if you want to see if a port is open on a server you must attempt to connect to it using tcp or udp depending on the protocol expected for that server

3667448
multiplying	subtraction	multiplying	add	subtraction	add
to get the shift start time multiplying the shift number by eight hours add that to the date part of the subtraction you did above and then add five additional hours to line it back up with your shift schedule

3667452
post	get
of course you still have to do whatever you do to get from the block of #s to the comment in your post

3667475
sudo	passwd
if the user is already authenticated to sudo sudo won t request the passwd again and it will be forwarded to apt-get with could lead to strange results for example if the postinstall script asks a question

3667527
sudo	passwd	passwd	visudo
do a sudo visudo and add following to enable your admin group to run apt-get w o passwd

3667562
mouseover	mouseleave
in jquery 1.3.2 the .desc span will show when you mouseover the .body span but will not disappear when the mouseleave it

3667562
hide	show	mouseover	mouseout
in jquery 1.4.2 apparently there s been an update that makes the .desc show up on mouseover but hide immediately on mouseout

3667568
hide	show
so this will make it so that just hovering hide show as before but if you click it will stick open

3667568
hide	show
in this case you d probably want the show handler to also hide other open .desc s so that you wont end up tons of open ones all over

3667609
actualheight	actualwidth
i use a universal solution which works not only with actualwidth and actualheight but also with any data you can bind to at least in reading mode

free	malloc
that said simply changing the malloc to and free to does not make much difference with the simple implementation of pixel that you have

onresume	onpause
to piggyback on what commonsware and key have said you could perhaps extend the application class and have all of your activities call that on their onpause onresume methods

3667794
onkeyup	onblur
once i had used a combination of onkeyup onblur onkeypress to handle all the circumstances while making a textbox to allow only numeric values

selecteditem	selectedindex
alternatively i could use something like viewwillappear only switching tabs doesn t call viewwillappear - if i can access selecteditem or selectedindex reliably from there

3667819
post	get
if you use http post mtype post and not default get you can set postdata parameter with the same information as described above instead of appending the information to the url parameter

3667820
put	get	folder	directory
i m looking for a way to get directory listing for files that are outside the webserver s tree for example i want to list all files and folder under home directory and put them in an array just as scandir does

so i guess this is not going to help you as both objectoutputstream and gzipoutputstream are simple write-appenders

3668009
serializable	deserialization
there isn t a built-in property that automatically handles the serializable deserialization but the pickleproperty in aetycoon will do this for you

3668040
post	get
you didn t post the code for your hashhelper method but since it should be small and fast yes it is quite likely that it will get inlined

the next part is where i m getting confuzzled i m pretty sure that i need to get these points within the ranges of either -1 and 1 or 0 and 1 and in the case of having the first set of values i would then multiplying the points by the screen width and height for the screen coordinates x and y value respectivly or multiplying the values by the screen height 2 and width 2 and add the same values to the respective points

3670370
floating-point	integer
it s because under the x86_64 c calling conventions on your platform the first two floating-point arguments are passed in xmm0 and xmm1 and the first two integer arguments are passed in gprs rsi and rdx if you re on linux or os x regardless of the order in which they appear

3670382
int	double
the first number should be a high value since you re passing in a double as an int

3670382

if the number of different column arrangements is going to be large or cannot be known at compile-time it may be worth the overhead to pull or push the data into a datatable

3670557
jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius	ironruby	rubinius	mri	rubinius
one obvious tradeoff is that mri c extensions only work on mri whereas ffi extensions work on mri yarv rubinius and jruby at the moment and will in the future probably also work on ironruby maglev macruby smallruby tinyrb and rubygolightly

3670575
pop-up	dialog

one way you might get messages via the hook would be to have your post-commit hook post messages to rabbitmq or some other queue which your application could then consume and do its own processing

3670726
superclass	subclassing
from my understanding polymorphism stretches the fact that you could exchange an instance of a class by an instance of a subclassing and late binding means that when you call a method of an instance the type decides which method subclassing superclass gets called

3670841
hash	md5
attempts per second against the md5 hash

3670841
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
crypt sha512 on the other hand is a very different beast that like its bcrypt counterpart performs key stretching producing a very different hash with a random salt built-in and will take anything between 500 and 999999 times as much to compute stretching is tunable

3670841
crypt	md5
or at least crypt md5 phk

3670858
folder	directory
from the command-line in my working space i could svn cp the working space directory to the branch folder selecting only the modules particular to a project

you could also experiment with writing a custom allocator for the stl containers although it seems that that sort of work is generally advised against

3670875
allocator	stl
for this particular thing you can either mess at the c++ layer by overriding new and supplying custom allocator to the stl

3670911
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this behavior is unique to firefox this doesn t happen on ie safari or google-chrome

getter	setter
another option would be to actually store the bar field as a string and to do some conversion from and to an enum in the getter setter

3671528
np-hard	np-complete
formally a problem is in np-hard iff there is an np-complete problem that is polynomial time turing-reducible to it

3671592

i have a square canvas with a width of 100 and a height of 100

3671635
int	chars
no files will ever have eof neither chars nor int in them

3671653

3671808
portrait	landscape
when i add the first view it is in landscape that s fine but when adding the second it is automatically in portrait mode

3671812
satisfiability	np-complete
as you might guess finding a way to restate every possible problem as one particular one wasn t easy and i ll just say that the problem with logical statements above the satisfiability problem was the first proved np-complete

3671812
np-hard	np-complete
therefore the tsp is np-hard since it s at least as hard as an np-complete problem

3671819
free	malloc
the most important thing you should learn in writing this program is that anything you malloc needs to be free d

3671819
free	malloc
if you change your structure member to be a pointer you will need to malloc it and then free it whenever appropriate

3671877
google-chrome	firefox
i thought the best solution for this may be http streaming however i can only get it working in firefox not google-chrome or ie8.

3671879
oncreate	setcontentview
so for one time initialization code like setcontentview or initializing variables the oncreate event is a better place

the following will enumerate all of the files and folder in a directory

3672143
jobs	cron
i forgot to do the cron jobs

3672145

3672180
hide	show
i am using hide and show

3672180

3672264
vsto	add-in
they need to sign not only the msi package but also the vsto add-in inside of that msi

3672264
vsto	add-in
worst case my current thinking is that i split the setup project into it s own solution and i ll build the vsto add-in pass them to the customer and then upon receiving those back use the second solution to create the msi and then give him that to sign as well

3672296
put	get
the formdetails action would get all the data including the url to your image only and put it all together

3672315
serializable	deserialization
maybe someone knows some trick to make such kind of serializable and of course proper deserialization

3672347
serializable	deserialization
then you can have special cases for the actual type of element being deserialized but note that each element type serializable deserialization has to be phisically written as static c++ code

3672360
google-chrome	safari
this works splendidly in google-chrome however in safari and safmob there is noticeable latency

3672367
postgresql	mysql
so i m left wondering whether i should stick to mysql which i m fairly familiar with or should i switch to something like postgresql

3672426
client-side	server-side
comparing primarily client-side and server-side languages is comparing apples and oranges

3672438
stretchblt	bitblt
so far i have found a couple of ways of doing this one below which i modified to use stretchblt and another which i create another larger bitmap and then bitblt it onto this new enlarged bitmap which has a higher dpi with this like bicubic scaling set to high

my question is is there a good way to intercept an ldap request and pull it apart or have either opends apacheds push notifications of requests coming into ldap

3672577
int	chars
because is c x is actually an int while in c++ it s a chars

3672584

but in general to copy a directory tree excluding certain files or folder i d recommend using rsync instead of cp

3672613
min	max
min and max are your friends

3672617
int	chars
change type of chars literal is changed from int to chars

3672636
min	max
using sorted the min max builtins or the second solution above seems overkill in this case

3672636
range	min	range	max	min	max
and remember that range min max will iterate from min to max - 1

3672673
inherited	properties
the current directory is a properties of a running program process that gets inherited by processes created by that process

3672701
firefox	safari
in firefox 3.5 and safari 4 a cross-site xmlhttprequest will not successfully obtain the resource if the server doesnâ t provide the appropriate cors headers notably the access-control-allow-origin header back with the resource although the request will go through

3672760
decimal	ieee
ieee floats only have 24 effective bits of mantissa roughly between 7 and 8 decimal digits

they help avoid naming collisions between types that different developers and different organization create and share

3672853
width	height
wpf is ridiculous in that not manually specifying properties such as width and height in this case causes them to have the values doulbe.nan

3672853
width	height
i m not going to manually set a width and height in the xaml because that stops it from resizing

3672853
width	height
given the above piece of xaml this object is a simple subclass of the border control how can i get the values of the width and height properties at run-time

3672853
actualheight	actualwidth
i read about actualwidth and actualheight but they were consistently returning 0 and 0 for me

3672865
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
you can use elements actualwidth and actualheight properties to get the values of the width and height when they were drawn

3672890
google-chrome	firefox
the npapi is being gradually deprecated by google-chrome and mozilla firefox

3672890
google-chrome	firefox
the firefox team has indicated that they will be eventually supporting native messaging like google-chrome does

3672897
width	height
the wpf frameworkelement class provides two dependencyproperties for that purpose frameworkelement.actualwidth and frameworkelement.actualheight will get the rendered width and height at run-time

3672913
activemq	rabbitmq
and if you do need them you can add them to tomcat with openejb and rabbitmq or activemq

3672918
getter	setter
i know that property doesn t support c arrays but how to manually add the getter and setter for the c array and where should i alloc and release it

3672940
super	self
when you say super cls self .helloworld python

3672944
getter	setter
you could have a getter and setter for a pointer though that raises a whole host of memory management questions you ll have to answer

3672959
post	get
i m trying to have a select form with a list of months but i can t seem to get it to post correctly

3672963
post	get
i am using post method for get method we can use hash but i am looking for post method

3672964
free	malloc
the trick is that you have to use malloc and free instead of retain and release

3672964
accessor	properties
as for the properties you can declare them you ll just have to write your own accessor and mutators

3673006
getter	setter
if you want getter or setter for the int elements of the array you will have to declare and write them manually the old fashioned way before properties

3673015
post	get
i get everything working except that my created comment doesn t know the post_id in mysql the comment is persisted yet it doesn t know the post it belongs_to

3673080
jms	jta
and if you are not going to use jta ejbs jms jmx etc there is no real advantage at using jboss especially during development tomcat is lighter and starts faster this is often appreciated by development teams

3673091
getter	setter
is it better to have monolithic classes containing all the getter setter for the tables and select the information as needed or is it better to have many different class maps that only loads the information needed for that page load

3673137
led	electronics
bullshit- all digital electronics control light output from led s by flashing on and off many many times a second

3673197
ati	nvidia
in non-solr geek terms this means the ati cards 34 nvidia 23 intel 5 style of navigation links that you can use to drill-down through product catalogs on sites like zappos amazon newegg and lowe s.

jms	jta	jndi	jta
jboss is j2ee specification compliant it supports j2ee specification very well such as ejb jta jms jndi and etc

3673217
rank	max
edit it appears the best way to do this is to find the get the max for a member s existing rank and add one.

3673244
move	drag
therefore if you d be having an interface that allows users to drag and move tracks around to rank them in order simply assign them a sequential rank number and when they hit save send this information to the database

3673252
qstandarditem	qtreeview	qtreeview	qstandarditemmodel
1 c++ only attach your qtreeview to a qstandarditemmodel and when you add items as qstandarditem objects you can call qstandarditem setbackground with either qt blue or qt red depending of whether the item is a room or a user

3673252
qtreeview	qstyleditemdelegate
2 c++ and css define a qstyleditemdelegate that you attach to your qtreeview

3673278
rank	max
if so you could simply cheat and keep a max rank field in the users table for each userid

3673278
rank	max
alternatively you could use a select max rank from rankings where memberid

3673299
for-loop	arrays
will give you an arrays like object which you can treat as an arrays for-loop of ids

3673314
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup use keyeventargs which exposes the keys enum via the keydata property

3673330
min	max
connection to db spring connection pooling min 50 max 350

3673332
hash	md5
since there are only 1000 options and their md5 hash are known it should take an attacker just a 1000 trials to verify the account without it really belonging to them

3673334
vpn	lan
their needs are varied from rfid or gps asset people tracking to simple stock control systems displays communications sometime satellite sometimes vpn or lan wifi or rj45

3673342
post	get
using xmlhttprequests you can send http get or post commands

3673358
typedef	struct
it is interesting to note that the same thing can be used for templates by defining typedef and the like in the struct i usually always use class in my code since there is basically no difference between struct and class in c++ instead of normal members

3673387
identifier	ambiguous
there s no way to resolve to the unnamed namespace otherwise since it has no identifier you can give it to solve the ambiguous resolution problem

3673430
httphandler	httpmodule
perhaps you are referring to httphandler and httpmodule

3673430
httphandler	httpcontext
in other words you would intercept a request using an httphandler referencing the httpcontext to get information about that request like the query string etc.

3673460
agile	greenhopper
also jira has a nice little agile component to it it s called greenhopper such as burndown charts etc

3673460
mef	prism
there are also frameworks like prism mvvm light and mef to provide architecture level patterns

3673461
versioning	upgrade
also this puts you at risk at forgetting to update the versioning string and the users will be prompted to upgrade from versioning 1.0 to versioning 1.0

3673482
google-chrome	safari
it doesn t work well in google-chrome or safari --

3673500
versioning	upgrade
there are plenty of people out there using versioning of mysql that are many years old who have never bothered to upgrade to the current versioning

3673525
width	height
from the css to make sure that your div is positioned where you want it to not overlapped by another div or not off to the wrong side or perhaps at 0 width or 0 height

3673529
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	show	hide	fadeout
use some css to hide it then use the jquery fadein method to show it when you want it visible and the fadeout method to hide it when you need to

3673616
int	chars
for a i think this is would be correct int chars foo

3673626
width	height
and if i m using then should i defined height and width for in html code

3673665
width	height
using percentages also helps you somehow to remember that a piece of text can never have an exact width and height and force you to adapt your design

3673665
width	height
if i have a with some text inside and a pretty 200ã 100px background the most obvious thing is to set the width and the height of this to 200 and 100 pixels

3673665
width	height
if i m using then should i defined height and width for in html code

3673683
post	get

if any thing wrong please post any link related to how to get image from local folder through xml file

3673911
consistency	acid
see also acid atomicity consistency isolation durability

3673915
post	get
the issue here is that the html helpers assume if you are rendering a view after a post there mustve been an error otherwise you wouldve redirected back to the view with a get method - hence the post redirect get issue

3673932
rdf	owl
perhaps they mean any source of semantic data using open standards like rdf and owl

3673937
postgresql	mysql
for some databases may need to replace with mysql postgresql

3673968
post	get
since any pair of users could possibly be posting at the same moment then every users post must be on the same shard to get the same effect

3673972
superclass	subclassing
if you have a subclassing that needs to call the superclass s constructor you can call it with

3673972
super	implements
an example would be if the super class has some arguments in it s constructor and it s implements classes needs to call that

3673987
gridsplitter	visualstatemanager
i ve found a solution that works for silverlight 4 but i need this to work for standard wpf in .net 3.5 which means that the gridsplitter doesn t implement the visualstatemanager stuff that is used in shemesh s solution

3674002
vim	textmate
vi 1 is the lightest-weight and fastest plain editor around and yet vim 1 can now colorize every language under the sun and textmate is classified as lightweight so all of the categories have really begun to merge a bit

3674069
x86	64bit
keep in mind that you ll be injecting code and making fixups to an in-memory image that may be a different bitness than yours your app is 64bit but it s starting a 32-bit process so you ll have to have both x86 and amd64 versions of your shim code to inject

3674082
boost	allocator
incidentally i recommend you use boost s shared_ptr or scoped_ptr which is also functionally equivalent when allocator on the heap with the additional usefulness of scoped_ptr constraining you from copying non-copyable pointers

3674083
post	get
i will post code with my question but to keep it readable i ll get rid of some of the crap let me know if you want more code posted

3674103
caliburn.micro	mef	mef	caliburn
the viewlocator in caliburn.micro caliburn uses di reflection but can be swoped out for mef

you need a pdf to tiff or jpeg or bmp conversion

3674177
unix	bsd
it will work on any unix operating system linux bsd mac os x but is relatively low level

3674235
int	chars
2 - alternatively use setenv const chars envname const chars envval int overwrite which is easier to use than putenv allocates memory and copies the string and does not require you to concatenate strings like you are doing right now

3674309

3674489
put	get
when the call aa.get_dummy is not assigned to a variable its return value is only put on the stack so it would be silly and erroneous to get the address of a stack item

3674530
inherited	properties
properties value inherited by properties value inherited we mean that value of a dependency properties can be overridden in the hierarchy in such a way that the value with highest precedence will be set ultimately

3674530
inherited	properties
animation styles templates properties value inherited etc could only be participated using dependency properties

3674536
uitextfield	accessoryview
what you might want to do instead is set the accessoryview on your uitableviewcell to a uitextfield

3674544

3674639
post	get
you ve defined the two collection routes as post requests however you re making a get request

3674680
put	get
the closeablequeue class differs a bit from glenn s suggestion in that closing the queue will prevent future put s but not prevent future get s until the queue is emptied

3674680
put	get
subsequent calls to put and subsequent calls to get once the queue is emptied as well as outstanding blocked calls matching those descriptions will raise the closed exception

3674681
keydown	keyup
but i want to check that my application actually got my previous keydown and keyup before i do next set of keydown and keyup for synchrnization is there any api that will let me know that the my application has actually recieved processed the event

3674810
keydown	keyup
i can catch keydown event but what about keyup

3674814
getter	setter
one fix would be for the unsafe code to do all reads and writes through getter and setter function pointers avoiding all the pointer arithmetic and ensuring that all access to c_node instances is done through c_node pointers

3674814
getter	setter
even better - the interface becomes a class with getter setter methods etc

3674826

3675112
jar	manifest.mf
jar files can only be executed if they contain a meta-inf manifest.mf that specifies the main class entry point into your application

jar	manifest.mf
java 6 also implements a parameter on the jar tool which will create modify the entry point in an existing jar s manifest.mf if you prefer

3675125
hide	show
but looking at your code maybe the opposite approach makes most sense hide the by default and show it in the onload event of the image

3675212

disk	ram
the tmpfs ram disk

3675444
disk	ram
if that is the case then python allocates its own buffers to hold all the data anyway and the tmpfs filesystem only buys you a performance gain if you reload the data from the ram disk many many times

3675444
disk	ram
reading the data into python unicode objects all at once will require either 2x or 4x as much ram as it occupies on disk assuming the data is utf-8

you just need place it before your get post method

3676356

int	double
my goal is to achieve fast perfomance thanks to int + byte int vs double + double int

3676567
int	double
filter size 9 0.031 double 0.027 int

3676567
int	double
filter size 13 0.042 double 0.038 int

3676567
int	double
filter size 25 0.078 double 0.070 int

3676568
getter	setter
to my knowledge it s almost common practice aside from the .designer.cs files it seems to place all global variables at the beginning of a class definition followed by the rest of the code in any order i prefer getter and setter then constructors then events then misc functions

3676586
int	double
at least it is not fair to compare int dword 4 bytes and double qword 8 bytes on 32-bit system

3676586
int	double
compare int to float or long to double to get fair results

3676586
int	double
it is not correct to compare long to double but still comparing int and double on 32 cpu is not correct even if they have both intrinsic instructions

3676611
disk	ram
that may be an explanation why with a hot cache data already in memory the reads recorded are very low....and then when the data is no longer in ram the reads would increase as it has to read it off disk again

3676675
int	chars
i would simply do a string.padleft int totalwidth chars paddingchar on the user input to ensure the length of the string is 4 chars minimum

3676676
nsmutablestring	nsstring
so if you have an array of nsstring objects you can change those to nsmutablestring objects

3676734
put	get
i know that if i put the response.redirect before the .end i will get redirected but the file is never generated and if i put the response.redirect after the .end i get the file but no redirection

3676744
put	get
if i put the ajax call s url in a normal ie window i get the expected content - well formed html - back

3676764
macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew	fink	macports
i would recommend using macports fink or homebrew to install python 2.7

3676764
matplotlib	scipy
following that you should be able to use setuptools to install matplotlib scipy and then vpython

3676776
cpu	processors
parallelize your algorithm and run it on every cpu available from your processors

3676776
fortran	ada
don t run it on the clr use native c++ or ada or fortran or something

3676828
post	get
if i get it right you are doing a post to a php file and then want to check if it was executed succesfully

3676836

opera	firefox
i m using firefox 3.6.9 chromium 6.0.472.53 and opera 10.61 on the linux platform

3676860
opera	firefox
i find that my example works as expected on chromium and opera but i get a very annoying flickering behavior of jquery fadein happening twice on firefox

3676947
postgresql	mysql
though my client s php server will have mysql anyhow as it will be hosting the php based simple machines forum my django server will be using postgresql throughout

3676955
floating-point	integer
on my machine i find that floating-point multiplication is about the same speed as integer multiplication

3676955
multiplying	add
each time you re doing one multiplying one add and 3 array indices

3676955
floating-point	integer	addition	multiplication
as you see integer multiplication floating-point multiplication and floating-point addition all took about the same time

3677071
hash	salt
consider hash ing and salt ing them

3677096
hash	md5
is the password database hash md5 sha1 or verbatim

3677118
post	get
so that i have to embed the variable inside the http post string to the server backend then get it back from the http response

3677146
multiplying	add
for example if you implement such a multiplying and an add and use it like this

3677156
vim	emacs	vim	notepad++
they can be edited with any text editor padre kokomo vim emacs notepad++ etc.

3677158
gtk	motif
there are look and feels for gtk motif and windows as well as cross platform themes like metal nimbus

3677158
gtk	motif
or it may be that it can t detect gtk correctly in root and is defaulting to motif

3677193
submit	submission
this would imply that two users could write over a given row with different data in any such column and the conflicts would not be detected...meaning the last user to submit the row would overwrite the values of the previous users submission

3677221
range	max
since this max function needs to be able to handle the entire range of integers a sentinel solution is not viable

3677301
hide	show
if they pass then show the main app form and hide the login

3677304
navigationcontroller	modalviewcontroller
also that modalviewcontroller s sit ontop of the topviewcontroller in the stack on the navigationcontroller and do not require them to have their navbar s redrawn when the modalviewcontroller is dismissed.

3677355
folder	directory
i have see a project where i right click and go to properties and then i go to debug tab it shows me working directory where author of the code has specified folder in local machine

3677432
fadein	fadeout
these two lines queue up two functions - fadeout and then fadein

3677433
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this on ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox 3 and google-chrome and the simple way to have a vertical scroll bar always visible is simply

3677483
textarea	textbox
now i have to select all the textarea textbox which does not have the class thisissparta how do i do it

3677494
put	get
there s no way to get these to appear above the #sublist because the #sublist is a child of them you can t put a child of an element behind its parent

3677536
yacc	bison
actually it s like yacc bison

3677566
google-chrome	safari
in webkit based browsers safari and google-chrome there is sometimes problems calculating dimensions if the css is included below the js

3677569
lisp	smalltalk
it borrows all the best features from perl 6 clos lisp smalltalk java beta ocaml ruby and more while still keeping true to its perl 5 roots

3677663
int	double
using int should make this slightly faster because int are 32 bits while double are 64 bits meaning cache will be used slightly more efficiently

3677717
google-chrome	firefox
is all it takes to display my custom font in ie firefox and google-chrome

3677739
filesystems	fat
did you check what happens to the fat filesystems consistency in case of a power failure or reset of your device

3677748
google-chrome	firefox
my code works fine in firefox google-chrome everything except ie failed in both 7 8 didn t bother going furthur down

3677748
mousemove	mousedown
basically i am adding a element ontop of a pre-placed element and then registering mousedown mousemove events to that div

3677751
post	get
i ve tried adding a .html extension allowing post get in iis manager through adding a managed handler however this doesn t seem to work

3677760
folder	directory
in one of my python projects i assume that all unit tests are run in a special directory that contains the folder data input files and output output files

3677760
folder	directory
i m using a test script that first checks whether those folder exists if the current working directory is correct and then runs the tests

3677777
rdf	owl
since the following rdf is valid a corresponding owl should be achievable

3677793
actionmailer	railtie
for rails 3 railtie takes the place of engines and is officially supported and actually used - actionmailer is a railtie plugin

3677842
folder	directory
note this installs the entire directory structure within your resources folder so you ll need to change your code to load the files from the appropriate subdirectory

3677846
serializable	deserialization
won t you be better off using some kind of serializable deserialization library such as xstream or something

3677855
ubuntu	linux
and in my real-world experience i just checked my code 2 seconds ago that seems to be the case on windows and ubuntu linux

3677859
moq	typemock	moq	nmock	typemock	nmock
you can either hand code the mock or use a mocking framework such as moq rhino typemock or nmock

3677914
base-class	subclassing
what you d end up with is a classmap for your base-class then a subclassmap for each of your subclassing

3677926
textmate	notepad++
as a mac user i ve used such ides as notepad++ coda textmate textedit netbeans and of course dreamweaver

3677953
min	max
it s better to avoid iterating over the annotations list and instead compute the min max boundaries of your placemark using your objects directly

3677982
textmate	notepad++
by the way notepad++ coda textmate and textedit are just editors not ides because they don t integrate build automation or debugging tools out of the box

3677999
pop-up	dialog
in my application i have a component which opens a pop-up window save dialog

3678048
folder	directory
if vanilla html pages are working from the directory but .cfm pages are not then you probably need an cfide mapping i think one quick workaround is simply to copy your cfide folder and drop it into web root

3678068
folder	directory
you can also make the directory structure you want then copy at the file level straight into your fresh folder

3678085
client-side	server-side
additionally i have no access to server-side languages - just client-side javascript

3678100
hide	show
my preference has been to keep toggle methods rather than separate methods for hide show

3678108
apache-poi	jxls
npoi is a .net port of the java apache-poi apache-poi is used by jxls internally

3678114
put	get
appending to gc.garbage is not such a good idea because it s where unfreeable cycles get put and you might want to check for those.

3678115
google-chrome	firefox
if you compare it to firefox or google-chrome or even ie8 it works ok

3678124
hide	show
you would have to work with the cell index though to show hide cells within the column

3678205
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason this very basic page shows up fine in google-chrome but not firefox or ie

3678208
bash	zsh
if you re using bash ksh or zsh you don t need tr and bc

3678221
hide	show
how can i show hide that file browser anyhow

3678235
for-loop	arrays
is the correct way is to go over the entire arrays with a for-loop and write

3678254
apache	nginx	thin	unicorn
a typical small application deployment will have nginx or apache and a handful of thin or mongrel unicorn etc servers running all on one machine

3678254
apache	nginx
the benefit of nginx thin over something like apache mongrel is that nginx thin can communicate directly via a unix socket removing the overhead of communicating via the tcp ip stack

3678259
content-disposition	content-type
set both the content-type header and the content-disposition header

3678288
gmail	hotmail
everything works fine until a user specifies a gmail or hotmail address as their address

3678288
gmail	hotmail
is a gmail or hotmail address the mail never gets delivered

3678299
int	chars
via format file i map output column data types to avoid further conversions from chars to int for example

3678372
post	get
i ve read some post about it but i can t get a clear answer explaining why it seems not possible to accept the prompt using autohotkey

3678378
width	height
i d like to have an image to have either a height of 725 or a width of 500 and maintain it s aspect ratio

3678378
width	height
when i have images with a height of over 725 and thinner than 500 they get stretched out to fit a width of 500

3678378
width	height
if i specify just the height it will maintain the aspect ratio but it exceeds the max width of 500px that i want

3678423
gmail	hotmail
if it doesn t get delivered gmail hotmail spam filters might be filtering out your email

3678427
width	height
if you only specify either the height or the width but not both most browsers will honor the aspect ratio

3678427
width	height
because you are working with an asp.net server control you may consider executing logic on the server side prior to rendering to decide which height or width attribute you want to specify

3678427
width	height
that is if you want a fixed height under one condition or a fixed width under another

3678431
public	protected
basically for each of your classes you need to take out the functions and leave only the data members inside the class struct you will rename class to struct and remove public private protected specifiers

3678437
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
replace constructors and destructors with functions that use malloc calloc and free and return take pointers to your typedef d structures

3678438
try-catch	exception-handling
the method returns nil if an error has occurred and a try-catch block could help me catch exception-handling

3678446
put	get
note if you put the textbox in a placeholder or some containers you can t get it by form1.controls because container.controls returns the 1st level child controls only

3678489
post	get
i will post once i get it but it is friday and i m doing this in between work

3678524
hash	salt
now when the frontend connects to the service the user can provide the username password and the service can authenticate against salt and hash passwords stored in the database

3678532
charindex	substr
you could do this any number of ways use the replace function to strip out either side use substr if you are guaranteed to know index numbers or mix a substr with a charindex

3678549
onclick	onsubmit
if this script happened on an onclick or onsubmit event then no return or returning true will indicate that the browser should take the default action for the link form

3678554
charindex	substr
something like this should work substr val 30 charindex val 30 -30

3678612
put	get
i have to use 3rd party software put in by the tablet maker to get the camera to work

3678616
width	height
this should set the height to 725px but prevent the width from exceeding 500px

3678620
mouse	keyboard
the problem is just with mouse selecting if i select text with the keyboard it works just fine

3678691
ubuntu	linux
i know how to accomplish this on windows but how would i go about doing this in linux i am using ubuntu if that matters

3678709
int	chars
i figured out how to convert what is originally a chars into an int so that i can use the findmax function on it without error but the sorting loop seems to have a problem of its own and when cout values endl mval

3678762
int	chars
sql_variant is a meta type that stores in the value the actual type of the data int chars float date etc

3678766

my local platform is gentoo linux

3678783
mbunit	nunit
i read that mbunit is nunit on steroids but i don t see why

3678783
mbunit	nunit
from what i have read on here i here that nunit is more popular over mbunit

3678783
mbunit	nunit
why should i prefer mbunit over nunit or vice-versa

3678788
put	get
i ve tried putting messagebox.show in various locations in the code and it s the same no matter where i put it as long as it s called after the call to settimer - the callback function doesn t get triggered until the messagebox is displayed

3678857
width	margin
i would guess that the uitextfield you re looking at has at least three subviews one displaying the left cap of the field s border one displaying the right cap and one displaying the middle with autoresizing masks of flexible right margin flexible left margin and flexible width respectively

3678858
int	double
key may be money string double int etc

3678873
hide	show
it also show you how to hide the field using content permissions

3678908
ubuntu	linux
after floundering around for awhile and failing to figure out how to acquire bzrlib and tell hg to use it i used linux which i have via an ubuntu vmware appliance

3678920
ilist	icollection
the reason that you can cast from a list to ilist to icollection is the following

3678976
clang	llvm
even an empty project will not compile under llvm clang 1.5 for me

3678976
clang	llvm
it does seem only to be a simulator problem with clang llvm

3679074
actualheight	actualwidth
this method only tries to hit test frameworkelements since it needs to know the actualwidth and actualheight to calculate the hit region

3679078
mbunit	nunit
nunit probably also has some better tool support resharper s test runner works with nunit out of the box but requires plugins for mbunit

3679085
getter	setter
this is where you should use getter and setter

3679123
integer	unsigned
a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type

3679123
integer	unsigned
unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer

3679129
integer	unsigned
the resulting unsigned integer type is

3679136
serializable	deserialization	getter	setter
and in the getter and setter call your common serializable and deserialization code

3679149
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
this option generates traps for signed overflow on addition subtraction multiplication operations

3679149
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	twos-complement	addition	multiplication	addition	twos-complement	multiplication	twos-complement
this option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic overflow of addition subtraction and multiplication wraps around using twos-complement representation

3679195
ivar	subclassing
it d be a regular old ivar if i was subclassing

3679208
hide	show
i d like to have the same behavior as the iphone photo app nav bar at the top tool bar at the bottom which will hide or show based upon a tap

3679209
profiling	debugging
fyi i ran this on both debugging and release changing debug.assert to if .. throw profiling in two separate environments

3679233

google-chrome safari ie8 firefox

3679246
integer	unsigned
corresponding unsigned integer type and the representation of the same value in each

3679246
integer	unsigned
because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is

3679314
udp	tcp
i don t know but i d hope that if this is the type of solution you are pitching that you already have a good handle on how to read gps and rfid devices how to establish a tcp or udp connection with wifi how to send and decode packets

3679324
draggable	droppable
i am trying to make a really basic game that you can drop the name of the color onto the color box to help learn about droppable and draggable

3679341
children	parent
means all the rows that have my id in child_id and really it s the parent that have my id in their child.id not the children

3679363

for https see ivan ristic s how to render ssl useless particularly points 8 mixed page content 10 using ssl for â œimportantâ bits and 3 mixing ssl and plain-text

3679369
google-chrome	safari
i think you might be looking for something like the carousel component in sencha touch view on ipad iphone or google-chrome safari

3679383
x86	64bit
however if the program is compiled for x86 and uses a 64bit integer data type then the operation would not be atomic

3679385
post	get
anyway if i get any answers in my post you might find them useful

3679398
uilabel	uibutton
1 use standard uibutton of custom type add the elements you want to show uilabel and hook up actions for touch down and touch up and react accordingly change the views trigger actions etc.

3679398
uiview	subviews
2 use a custom uiview implement drawrect to draw how you like it or use custom views as subviews as in 1

3679398
touchesbegan	touchesended
then use the touchesbegan touchesended etc

3679422
int	double	int	chars
all primitive types int double chars etc. are value types with the exception of string which is a reference type though like value types it s immutable

3679433

you may have to watch out for instances of nsmutablestring however which is a subclass of nsstring

3679552
bash	zsh
here s a solution that doesn t shell out to bc and uses only portable standard syntax nothing bash zsh or ksh specific

3679552
bash	zsh
in bash and likely ksh zsh you could just use ...

3679615
children	parent
i am getting only the two level of the graph parent and its children but not the children of children etc

3679633
children	parent
what i m trying to achieve is that i want my parent class to have references to direct children

3679639
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
also in google-chrome and firefox my buses move as expected but in safari and iphone android browsers nothing moves

3679664
int	double
memoryrecord a class that will contain basically an array of objects string int double datetime etc... that are the data from a table record and all methods to get those data in out from this array

3679702
getter	setter
i understand that auto-properties get compiled with backing fields but if the property is by definition a vanilla getter setter what advantage is garnered by going to the backing field directly versus using the setter using the fnh defaults

3679726
mef	prism
i have an app based on prism v4 ctp and mef

3679726
mef	prism
the problem is how to tell mef to do export in somemodule after initialize was called by prism

3679726
mef	prism
the thing is that prism initializes modules after mef s composition completes

3679750
put	get
i wanted to implemant the reply button so it takes a value through get function and put that in the update textbox just like twitter

3679761

uiview	cagradientlayer
i ve implemented it by adding a cagradientlayer as a sub-layer of uiview s layer

3679858
uiview	cagradientlayer
what is the easiest way to autoresize that cagradientlayer to match its parent layer s bounds so that the animation is smooth like for uiview autoresizing

3679896
addclass	removeclass
better to use addclass on hover and removeclass on mouse out

3679915
int	chars
someone pointed out on irc that this code would call isspace using a chars - but isspace takes int and requires the value given to be in the range of unsigned chars values or eof

3679916
ubuntu	debian
the debian and ubuntu projects use a script checkbashisms that looks for particular patterns that might indicate that someone is relying on bin sh being bash

3679921
disk	ram
which may not be a problem for disk like media but if you wanted to run execute an embedded processor out of nand flash well you cant you boot and with using minimal loops copy a small program to ram branch to ram have that small program function have a loop that copies the rest of the program to ram and you run out of ram

3679926
awt	swing
don t mix awt components in a swing application

3680022
versioning	upgrade
questions any reason not to upgrade to the latest versioning

3680049
google-chrome	safari
we have same behaviour in safari ie and google-chrome so i guess it s not to do with something browser-related

3680063
ubuntu	debian
i tested it with twisted 10.1 on ubuntu and 8.1 on my trusty debian

3680075
post	put
i ve put up a blog post with a detailed example of how to achieve this in zf using a custom route class see

3680128

this apparently works in safari but i need something that will work in ie firefox and google-chrome

3680221
width	height
how can one get the screen resolution width x height in pixels

3680315
width	height
after this transformation you can do your viewport transformation multiply points by screen width height etc

3680364
uiview	subviews
add second uiview to the window s subviews and set it to hidden yes initially

3680375
google-chrome	firefox
i have seen this problem in firefox and google-chrome

3680381
client-side	server-side
namely you can set the menu s clientidmode property to static to ensure that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the server-side id property and the client-side id attribute but you must be careful using this approach

3680390
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome both are based on webkit that features a 100 acid3 test result

3680390
google-chrome	firefox
it works with ie but not with google-chrome and not with firefox

3680427
post	get
using the technique described in that post if i ctrl+shift+rightclick in the javascript editor i get the following dialog

3680441
int	double
reinterpreting double s as int s is platform dependent think endianness and sizeof issues and will also fall foul of strict aliasing rules

3680446
width	height
the width and the height

3680456
inherited	properties
inherited all page and custom control classes from a common ancestor that processes all properties on a suitable page-life-cycle event evaluate visibility conditions and alter the control s visibility and or other properties

3680485
versioning	upgrade
in the meantime i have upgrade my database structure additional fields is best example and my latest versioning of the application makes use of that new fields

3680503
put	get
i get the data from the database put it a table and then select the data from the table for usage in the javascript

3680510
int	double
what you are saying to do is to take the address of p a double treat it as an java int address and then add one to it

3680523
punctuation	words
words that start with a leading hyphen - end up sorted as if the hyphen wasn t there rather than being sorted in front of actual letters which is what happens with other punctuation

int	chars
otherwise it is of type int â 4.2.1 . section 4.2.2 refers to the numerical operators which result in a value of type int or long . so the result of the addition should in my understanding be an int which cannot be assigned to the chars variable c

3680637
range	min	range	max	min	max
and with a random generator i need to create a double value between the range of min and max

3680639
hide	show
if you don t want to reload the current page you will need a javascript based system to show and hide a logged in state

3680655
jar	war
i was wondering if there was any way to while doing something like mvn clean test in the rest jar to have a local version of the war set up and then run the unit tests

3680655
jar	war
right now we re going to take the tests out into a separate jar but that s still not ideal as if something happens to go wrong during a release that d mean the rest jar and war were already released

3680692
int	chars
in you are adding a chars to an int an int can be much bigger than a chars so it chooses the bigger data type int to be the result a.k.a

3680692
int	chars
so the result of the addition is an int which cannot fit into the chars c

width	height
i have a control on my form and i want to be able to control the width and have the height of the control change to maintain its original aspect ratio

3680710
width	height
what do i do in the resize event to set the height to the correct aspect for the new width

3680730
centos	linux
the file system could differ nfs local reiser etc however it would always be on a centos linux system

3680731
width	height
aspect ratio is width height

3680731
width	height
on form load you can persist the aspect ratio of your controls by dividing width by height and persisting to a variable and then on form resize reset the height of each control to match what the saved aspect ratio is by doing

3680741
tarfile	zipfile
to solve my problem i have since used tarfile to first tar all of my files and then used zipfile to compress my tarfile

3680784
width	height
the aspect ratio is simply the ratio of one axis to the other width height

3680784
width	height
to retain the aspect ratio given a target newwidth newheight you simply have to make sure that newwidth newheight width height

3680784
width	height
to achieve this you have to decide whether the width or the height is the most important axis

3680784
width	height
if you fix width then you can calculate the height from the width to retain the aspect ratio

3680847
apache	nginx
and that s for good reason you ve got all your plugs running apache config .htaccess config rewrites the kitchen sink - you might be able to switch to a lighter weight http server - nginx lighttp - and realise some serious performance increase strictly speaking it won t help much with bandwidth - but one wonders if that s what the host is really complaining about or that your service consumes serious server resources

3680944
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
if that s too much to ask - you could generate a md5 hash based on the combination and some salt then add that hash to the url

3680960
mouse	keyboard
the caret must move in order for the user to make selections with the mouse or keyboard

3680991

mbunit	nunit
even though nunit now includes the most popular mbunit advanced features mbunit is still more feature-rich for example

3681067
mbunit	nunit
nunit is more popular because it was there first therefore more articles about it on the web and better tooling and because most programmers don t care about or need the advanced features that mbunit offers

3681075
fgets	fread
you should be using fread instead of fgets

3681075
fgets	fread
also when calling send you need to specify only the number of bytes that fgets fread actually return do not send the entire buffer unless the entire buffer was actually filled in

3681168
getter	setter
i have to use setter and getter but also instead of using regular fields have to use an enum

3681252
int	boolean
for that many boolean in a single model you might consider using a single int and bitwise operations to represent store and retrieve values

3681276
getter	setter
you need to put all components in a and bind their value attribute to a bean property via an el expression like backed by a getter setter pair

3681308

i d suggest refactoring those only when you need to add non-trivial getter or setter with validation

3681411
versioning	upgrade
this vendoring approach used to have another use that is making sure that you are using the specific versioning of a gem and your application would keep working even if the system gems were upgrade to a higher versioning that would break your app

apache-poi	docx4j
why would you use docx4j to do this i hear you ask rather than apache-poi which focuses on xlsx and binary xls

3681472
docx	xlsx
probably because you like jaxb as opposed to xml beans or you are already using docx4j for docx or pptx and need to be able to do some stuff with xlsx as well

3681472
apache-poi	docx4j
in contrast the whole of docx4j pptx4j xlsx4j weighs in at about the same as apache-poi s lite subset

of course this isn t always practical your site might require that the action only be completed through a pop-up dialog

3681843
free	malloc
a common case for these is using memory that has been free d so logging your malloc free pairs might help

3681849
getter	setter
for example a class named articles with a few datamembers name title date and getter setter

3681850

both nelly and speex can be converted to mp3 or a plethora of other codecs with ffmpeg should you need to

folder	directory
or are they always for the user to do a bundle install --local and they all contain only text files so they will generate the appropriate binary files if any on the gem directory so whether adding this folder to the project is optional although if we run bundle package to generate this folder the intention is probably so that everybody create the gems using this folder instead of pulling it from rubygems.org

3682755

so i find myself having to cast c to double and then since that makes the expression a double also casting the entire expression to int

google-chrome	firefox
i don t have any problem in google-chrome nor in firefox and ie

3683134

you should be able to create a folder called libs in your main project directory and add any jar that you want to use to this folder

3683154
thin	webrick
neither webrick nor thin support streaming that way

3683172
int	double
but the basic concept is to create a type that can be used for arithmetic expressions internally using a double for every term in the expression only to be evaluated as the desired type in this case int at the end

3683172
int	double
then you d define implicit conversions to from double and the type s you want to support again int

3683185
stdout	stderr	cout	cin
if you redirect stdout stderr and stdin to the console you can then call std ios sync_with_stdio to make sure std cout std cerr and std cin all work

int	chars
in c++ the type of a chars literal is chars but note that in c the type of a chars literal is int that is sizeof a is 4 in an architecture where int are 32bit and char_bit is 8 while sizeof chars is 1 everywhere

3683615

3683822
hash	md5
a rainbow table takes a wide range of possible passwords eg a range of passwords like a rainbow has a range of colours and calculates their md5 hash up-front

3683822
hash	salt
hardware is now fast enough that rainbow tables are unnecessary you can compute hash really quickly it s fast enough to just brute force the password from scratch every time especially if you know the salt

3683823

ria services is a server-side technology that automatically generates client-side silverlight objects that take care of the communication with the server for you and provide client-side validation

3684739
width	height
as others have said here you cannot use php to read the height width of a div already rendered

3684739
width	height
however aside from the javascript options already presented keep in mind that you can use php to set the height width of a div before it is sent to the browser

3684779
post	get
i m using http method post to to get data from my mvc2 project and i saw that you can add a parameter using get doing like this

to do that you create an interface that extends remoteservice and an implementation on the server that implements that interface and extends remoteserviceservlet

3684858
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
you will realize on google-chrome 6 and safari the server never gets contacted while on firefox ie google-chrome 5 the server gets contacted

3684859
wordpress	joomla
maybe you re looking for a full-blown cms platform like drupal joomla or wordpress

3684877
post	get
for both get and post you can set postdata

3684880
width	height
keep in mind that if you used the postscript function in r you have to specify the width and height of your picture as well

3684880
width	height
if you saved from the graphics window it normally should take the current width and height of the graphics window

3684880
width	height
check ps.options and see if width and height have value 0

3684880
width	height
it allows you to specify the width and height of the picture and reproduces correctly in latex

3685043
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
so basically i have a navigation-based app that uses navigationcontroller s pushviewcontroller method to show views a and b

3685065
for-loop	loops
declaring a variable within a for-loop might lead to the wrong assumption that this variable can only be accessed within loops body which is totally wrong

3685093
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox safari google-chrome works like a charm but internet explorer all versions and opera doesn t want to execute it properly

3685113
maven	pom.xml
update2 set up maven plugin for openjpa in my pom.xml

3685127
onmouseover	onclick
the script i have been working on for a star rating system saves the filled in stars with an onclick event and changes the onmouseover onmouseout values to null so moving the mouse off them afterwards won t mess that up and the form has multiple ratings and a clear button at the bottom which i need to have reset the onmouseover onmouseout events through the function below but within those ratings y and x are taken to be literal rather than what they contain and makes the onmouse events fail because the parameters are incorrect

3685135
rss	feed
just get the rss feed and display them on a page

3685135
rss	feed
some sources don t provide rss feed

3685157
hex	binary
if you re reading binary data i would personally write that out in hex

3685171
mouseover	mouseout
you could even use event bubbling since mouseover and mouseout bubble to hook the events on the overall container rather than each element since you re getting the data from the element

3685196
codeigniter	kohana	codeigniter	yii	kohana	yii
what s yii s way of implementing modular functionality to use from controllers as there are helpers and libraries on kohana and codeigniter

3685248
children	parent
hard code the version in the project parent version element of children

3685248
maven	pom.xml
you ll find an infinite number of threads on this topic on the maven user list see for example pom.xml parent version properties and i ll just say that any attempt to workaround the above rules is wrong and doesn t work

3685319
rss	feed
see at the right there is an rss feed of this query

3685320
hash	salt
in mysql connector j and jdbc i believe that one of my applications allowed multiple preparedstatement s to be executed while another one is open like i could perform a query that returns a resultset and while that resultset is still open i could open another preparedstatement and get another resultset or i could just execute an update based on the data i got from my first resultset insert a salt value and update the password column with a sha512 hash when i realize that the row has a plaintext password in the password column

3685360
vbscript	vba
you ll need to reference microsoft vbscript regular expressions 5.5 in your vba project then.

int	boolean
when i break at the entry to create createmodel is there but has all default values null for the strings false for the boolean 0 for the int

3685427
width	height
you do not need to use fixed values for width and height - you should rather specify a minimum width height for your controls using the minwidth and minheight properties

3685462
width	height
width and height canvas attributes always parse to pixels so writing width 100 just means 100 pixels as far as the canvas tag is concerned

3685490
bids	ssis
i know that in order to edit ssis packages you need the same version of bids or visual studio

3685543
min	max
since b is sorted this can be done in o b time start with two pointers one at the max and one at the min

3685578

3685578
stdout	stderr
windows reditect stdout and stderr

3685578

getter	setter
for readability i think there are some advantages to this approach over getter setter

3685614
post	get
when a form gets submitted all of its elements with their names and values become a part of a get post - query

3685632
vsto	add-in
i ve set up my vsto excel add-in to use log4net for logging

3685679
stdout	stderr
in order to catch both stdout and stderr you should use

3685697
submit	submission
i assume that your both forms will submit at the same time. because the whole purpose of captcha is to avoid the automatic form submission

3685699
postgresql	mysql
newer databases are mysql and postgresql

there seems to be an option show binary contents as hex that s checked by default

3685835
interpolation	splines
have a look at some equations on how to interpolation splines

3685845
quicksort	mergesort
use quicksort or mergesort or the like

3685863
floating-point	fractions
however if you really feel you want to do it all without floating-point operation i would suggest creating some kind of fractions class which is far more complex and less efficient but you can keep track of all dividend and divisor and then calculate it all at once

3685874
debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos
this can all get complicated because of the large number of linux distros out there but a debian ubuntu compatible .dpkg and a red hat centos fedora-compatible .rpm should cover a good percentage of end users

3685885
instances	transient
instances - save the transient instances

3685900
sorting	filtering
we are developing some new gui screens to display tabular data which require sorting filtering paging

3685900
sorting	filtering
sorting paging filtering can be done entirely by grid add-on

3685900
sorting	filtering
sorting paging filtering functions are super fast as they run on the client

3685900
sorting	filtering
to do sorting paging filtering on the client using the grid you need to download the entire data set to the client

3685952
tapestry	appfuse
we re running appfuse and tapestry

3685953
opera	google-chrome
v8 google-chrome and carakan opera are probably the two fastest production-quality engines

3685953
firefox	safari
tracemonkey firefox and squirrelfish safari are far behind with kjs bringing up the rear

3685956
actualheight	actualwidth
ended up using a converter to bind to the actualwidth actualheight divided by 2

3685979
trie	tree
in a ternary search trie the edges children are stored in a binary tree so the characters are in sorted order and can be searched in log a time

3685995
java.util.date	simpledateformat
use jsp usebean to construct a java.util.date instance and use jstl fmt formatdate to format it into a human readable string using a simpledateformat pattern

3686097
post	get
when submitting post forms and get parameters in the url only the keys and the values should be url encoded

3686156
udp	tcp
try this instead allow every tcp udp traffic to destination port 53

3686172
post	get
you can see that this example is a work in progress and not fully functional post get etc

3686228
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox google-chrome and safari have issues with spacing on the windows platform

3686232
min	max
not pkid but you can use max or min to return that since you ll only have one record per group in the results set.

3686258
button	checkbox
so some button s click event some checkbox s check event everything on a basic control event list

3686277
hash	salt
since it s on the intranet most likely i guess you could get away with using hash of the username + salt as a session identifier

3686301
post	put
another way is to put the area where you want your mouse to be allowed where the slide to remain triggered in a transparent div and call the mouseleave function from the first paragraph of my post in the mouseleave event of this transparent div

3686302
put	get
i ve conceived of this as middleware but i m not sure a where to put it in the middleware stack without interfering with other aspects of the middleware b how to get at various bits of the wsgi environment and so on.

3686306
subtract	add
when a book s category changes which i assume is rare you ll need to subtract book.viewcount from the old category and add it to the new category

3686379
nsmutablestring	nsstring
unfortunately invoking copy on an nsmutablestring does not result in an nsmutablestring it results in an nsstring which cannot be mutated using something like appendstring

3686387
getter	setter
in that case you would want to make the getter setter method synchronized or better yet make the variable volatile which will ensure that the variable s value is the same for every thread

3686399
oncreate	ondestroy
and onaddringtone is used in oncreate and oncancelringtone is used in ondestroy as well as where you can see if in the code above

3686402
implements	extends
it s to extends the standard interface with extra methods that you can implements for that specific implementation so that the compiler knows about them

3686416
pylons	turbogears
google around for some of the other tools you use i don t think there s one for pylons specifically nor turbogears

3686497
sorting	grouping
you can discard your order by from the query because the access report will use whatever settings you give it for sorting and grouping instead

3686497
sorting	grouping
in access 2003 with your report in design view choose view - sorting and grouping from the access main menu

3686498
jobs	cron
cron jobs don t get the same environment settings that you get at a shell prompt - those are generally set up by your shell on login - so you want to use absolute rather than relative paths throughout

3686504
post	get
another idea i thought about would be sort of making the js operate even more in order so i do get the issue and try to optimize my code so even with my additional code it won t post the script notification error

3686529
portrait	landscape
now if you select your portrait-only tab and rotate to landscape the application will stay in portrait

3686559
comm	grep
by using ps -e -o comm you avoid having to do the silly grep -v grep thing because only the actual process name appears in the ps output not the arguments

3686559
jobs	cron
final piece of advice when writing scripts that will execute without user supervision such as cron jobs it s a good idea to put set -e at the beginning

3686630
google-chrome	firefox
it also works perfect on google-chrome 5 6 7 and the canary build and on firefox 3.6

3686663
typedef	struct
your struct s name needs to match the typedef

3686675

postgresql	mysql
if you have more complex needs you may want to consider an sql database like mysql postgresql oracle sybase or so forth

3686743
dependency-injection	singleton
if you have an ejb annotated with singleton then that s fine other dependency-injection providers may also support this pattern

3686753
post	get
when use click on one of the portfolio post they go to a page where they get some pictures of the project and explenation

3686773
button	checkbox
i m trying to build a simple webpage with multiple checkbox a textbox and a submit button

3686862
uitableview	reloaddata
uitableview s reloaddata method is the quick and inefficient way to do it

3686875
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure what you ve got going on with osx but i see the issue in a bunch of browsers on windows ie firefox google-chrome

3686881
for-loop	loops
the outer for-loop is bound by o |b| the while loops by o |b| 2 the inner for loops by o |b| because b has only distinct values

3686923
margin	height
you should be using block level elements with margin or padding or inline block elements with a proper line height to generate the spacing you want

3686935
children	parent
so the first table has just the items themselves and the other table has relationships in terms of which parent id has which children

3686936
post	get
i usually see this when there is a action for a get and post both without and parameters

3686944
free	malloc
someone raised that one reason to use malloc was if you were going to use free

3686944
free	malloc
please merge if this is a duplicate i searched but didn t see a question along this lines exactly about malloc delete new free asked

3686965
free	malloc
there is no guarantee that new will use malloc or delete will use free

3686970
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
malloc calloc realloc - free

3686976
free	malloc
malloc and other c allocation functions must be matched with free new must be matched with delete and must be matched with

3686976
free	malloc
malloc and free just treat it as raw untyped memory

3686977
many-to-one	one-to-many
just as complementary task i have done the same scenario but with one-to-many many-to-one by using a non-primary key as joined column such as reference

3687028
fflush	gets
as an example you can think of a hibernate transaction and a class which begins one for a thread commits and rollbacks or a class which gets a session closes it and fflush it both examples are with the threadlocal pattern in mind

3687051
int	double
for an array the compiler knows a the address of the start of the array and b what type of elements int float double etc. the array holds and hence how long each element is

3687094
pop-up	dialog
on the dialog pop-up select +s server limits the number of revisions stored at the bottom of the screen which will restrict the number of files stored

3687098
viewdidload	didreceivememorywarning
the reason this matters is that i ve been releasing some cached data in didreceivememorywarning on the assumption that viewdidload will be called when the view is reloaded

3687169
inherited	subclassing
inherited classes may have subclassing and attributes and behavior which inherited the characteristics of the super classes

3687183
srp	principles
my suggestion is to keep to the single responsibility principles srp

3687183
try-catch	exception-handling
that way i don t need any callbacks in the model since i can handle exception-handling with simple try-catch blocks in the presenter

3687202
getter	setter
if you don t use them default serialization will be used - all properties with public getter and setter will be serialized also class has to have public parameterless constructor

3687265
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox google-chrome and ie 8 only breaks in ie 7

3687293
ubuntu	linux

3687356
ant	maven
although we build everything with maven i suppose you can use ant as well

3687383
feof	fseek
i also tried with feof and fseek

3687384
getter	setter
hopping that log4j would call the setter in my appender and the getter from my frame to set the text area but it does not work

3687385
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
this value will be a different pixel dimension for each screens density ldpi mdpi hdpi

3687388
portrait	landscape
i ve return yes in shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation but i have bad frame for landscape if show mpmediapickercontroller in portrait first and conversely

3687388
portrait	landscape
for example if you have good frame in portrait when you rotate to landscape - you have bad frame from portatait but if you rotate to other landscape to 180 degreess then frame set to landscape..

3687429
subnet	packets
if the ip addresses used in the spoofed call are internal on your subnet then internal workstations would receive tcp ack packets for uninitiated tcp syn packets and reject them or ignore them

3687448
getter	setter
i mean im using the attr_accessor for the getter and setter for gauge but still it says that i have not declared it

3687460

3687529
direct3d	gdi
i m wondering if it s possible to draw over an opengl direct3d surface with gdi

3687529
direct3d	gdi
i know the best way is to hook in and use whatever the renderer game is using natively be it opengl or direct3d but i m looking at gdi as afaik both opengl and direct3d sit on device contexts which i m hoping can be draw to with gdi

3687538
folder	directory
i would create a windows service to watch a secure folder and use a directory watcher to look for new files

3687539
int	chars
int fail const chars str

3687615
directx	gdi
in theory you can intermix gdi with opengl or directx if and only if the opengl directx is set up to use single buffering not double buffering

3687623
gif	png
don t be misled by the emphasis on generating pdfs the library also can create just png or gif images

3687640
gridview	radiobuttonlist
i am having a gridview named gridviewgender with a radiobuttonlist with it

3687649
subtract	add
all you need to do is add n to all the lengths where the value is 0 and subtract n when the value is 1 being a little bit careful when there are less than n ones in a row

3687705
ienumerable	iqueryable
i have chosen in my mvc 2 applications to use the linq to sql interfaces to select sql directly into my business objects rather than use iqueryable or ienumerable as anonymous classes

3687730
filesystems	ntfs
i would suspect that ntfs filesystems rights are inconsistent

3687743
apache	nginx
the fastest option will be to have your load balancing server nginx or apache serve the static files

3687743
apache	nginx
nginx and apache basically do this out of the box

3687743
post	get
you can get a list of your post by globbing with the dir class

3687960
filtering	grouping
i was originally convinced it was simply a filtering issue with their locked-down network but from talking with their it grouping the requests it s making are not being blocked by them

3688025
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i recently discovered that uiview s should only have uiviewcontroller s when they fill the entire window or are managed by another uiviewcontroller such as a uinavigationcontroller or uisplitviewcontroller

3688041
width	margin
give them a width and use margin 0px auto

3688100
fadein	fadeout
i tried using fadeout because fadein worked fine but the fadeout simply wouldn t work - the elements just vanished

3688120
int	chars
in this case you start with the value 1 and on each iteration multiply the value by the int value of each chars

3688128
move	drag
this would allow you to easily move portions of a site or the entire site itself with a simple drag and drop operation

3688144
width	height
1 we have it s height and width varies different resolutions

3688144
width	height
3 width and height are equal for each block

3688144
hide	show
1024x768 can accommodate only 20 so we show them and hide others

3688169
versioning	upgrade
we would like to learn to use sl however and this is an opportunity to do so -- but not at the expense of sl munging our future maintenance efforts by making it problematic to upgrade framework versioning

3688321
google-chrome	firefox
added info ideally i would like to keep track of the mouse even outside the browser window - the way google maps does - try clicking down the mouse button and move outside the browser - this works in google-chrome and with some quirks in firefox

3688331
websphere	ibm
there s more on the ibm implementation of this in the websphere mq using java manual under manipulating subcontexts

3688335
typemock	moles
note sadly this is a compact framework project so tools like moles and typemock isolator cannot be used

3688411

3689059
cos	sin
so store sin and cos from 0 to pi 4

3689139
cos	sine	cos	sin
so if you decide to use a truncated taylor series then you can improve accuracy or use fewer terms for similar accuracy by mapping to either the sine or cosine to get the angle in the range 0 pi 4 using identities like sin x cos pi 2-x and cos x sin pi 2-x in addition to the ones above for example if x pi 4 once you ve mapped to the first quadrant.

i would use getter setter

3690860
getter	setter
getter setter will allow you to perform appropriate conversions

see generating a md2 md4 md5 sha or sha1 hash by using hashbytes

3691596
put	get

3692168
udp	tcp
udp send buffer size is different from tcp - it just limits the size of the datagram

3692168
udp	tcp
because tcp breaks the application data into mss-sized chunks something that has no counterpart in udp

3692203
nsstring	nsdata

memcached	apc
although using apc memcached or xcache would be a better alternative if you consider performance

3692255

it then has to to â sniffâ the contents of the file to see whether it looks like a jpeg a gif a png or some other kind of image it knows about so it knows how to display it

3692309
filesystems	ntfs
since the definition of true case on ntfs or vfat filesystems is truly bizarre it seems the best way would be to walk the path and match against os.listdir

3692366
onchange	onkeyup
then you can set a handler on your form inputs onchange onkeyup etc. that checks the data in your form and if it checks out then use the method which will enable the button and your user can now upload files

converting a string to a big int usually requires the intermediate step of applying a chars encoding to convert the string of chars to a string of bytes

3692413
ssl	https
is there a good reason why a site that has an ssl certificate wouldn t use https for their entire site rather than http

3692420
serializable	deserialization
if all you want to do is write that one and only structure then you should hand-code serializable and deserialization

3692420
int	chars
i d recommend writing a count then the string chars then the dimensions of the array and then all the int

3692420
int	chars
you will have to worry about byte order for yourself taking two bytes for each chars and four for each int

3692488
memcached	apc
i ve seen mention of memcached apc and xcache here cache results of a mysql query manually to a txt file but don t know the pros cons and differences between each

3692489
folder	directory
i am trying to get current directory but its giving me path of debug folder how i can get the path of current directory

3692500
hash	salt
never ever include the password as part of the hash even as the salt

3692500
hash	salt
each site to use this hash should have their own 32 or 64 byte guid to be used as a unique salt

3692516
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome both work as i would expect whilst ie is having a problem

3692546
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
of safari google-chrome and opera all do

3692547
post	get
if you get stream_publish extended permissions from the user you might be able to like post on their behalf by doing a post to post_id likes

3692552
for-loop	arrays
then create a for-loop on each case arrays to add up for total

3692555
int	chars
if you think about it kind of makes sense because if you want to cast a long int to a short one or even a chars the starting address remains the same you just look at less bytes

3692580
spaces	delimiter
the second string seems a little more difficult because the spaces between the characters differ but always seem to be delimiter by at minimum a single spaces

3692596
width	margin
i know i can increase the width and add margin to compensate but i need to understand why this happening

3692604
nsstring	nsdata
this works with several foundation classes including nsstring nsdata nsarray and nsdictionary among others

3692606
maven	pom.xml
if you are using maven just include the commons-lang dependency in the section of your pom.xml

3692696
width	height
for instance if you had a rectangle class with width and height properties and an area read-only property that returns width height you could put changed width area

3692738
integer	radix
fixed point type stores numbers with 2 words one representing the integer part another representing the part past the radix in negative exponents 2 -1 2 -2 2 -3 etc

3692738
integer	radix
float are better because they have wider range in an exponent sense but not if one wants to store number with more precision for a certain range for example only using integer from -16 to 16 thus using more bits to hold digits past the radix

3692756
google-chrome	firefox
only firefox and google-chrome were showing an empty ajax response so it seemed to be a cross domain problem yet everything was on the same domain

3692756
google-chrome	firefox
i had my test site open at that particular moment as with no www. so firefox and google-chrome treated it as a different domain

3692766
int	double
and what s the typ of int | double | biginteger .+

3692768
firefox	safari
it doesn t matter what browser i use safari firefox ie8 ie6 they all exhibit the same problem so it doesn t seem to be an ie8 issue that i saw on other similar issues

3692781
nunit	mstest
i nead some open source projects written in c# with unit tests nunit or mstest for my experiments

3692789
integer	fractions
64 bit mantissa scaled by 2 -33 now the integer and fractions parts cannot be separated by an octet boundary

3692790
multiplying	add
compilers are also smart to use special adress calculation instructions to optimize add multiplying in a single instruction

3692868
floating-point	fixed-point
when vectorization is used the efficiency of vectorization matters a lot more such that the performance differences between fixed-point and floating-point is moot

3692868
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
some architectures provide hardware implementations for certain math functions such as sin cos atan sqrt for floating-point types only

3692877
jquery	scriptaculous
sure jquery can probably handle this but cannot simple replace magentos use of prototype and scriptaculous with jquery

3692900
ssl	https
i have an ssl certificate set up and when i use the https prefix google chrome puts a skull next to it and crosses out the https

3692902
128bit	64bit
if you are willing to use gcc or clang on 64bit platforms they have a builtin 128bit types that come for free __uint128_t and __int128_t

3692928
matplotlib	scipy
i installed matplotlib by cloning astraw s matplotlib github repository and then loosely following hyperjeff s installation instructions for numpy scipy matplotlib

3692928
powerpc	i386
i installed python 2.7 using python.org s python 2.7 powerpc i386 x86-64 mac os x installer disk image for mac os x 10.5

3692987
width	height
and the buttons height was the only thing adjusted it still retained the default width it was given

3692988
vim	emacs
a friend of mine is using r and emacs ess which seems to work perfect however i d rather like to keep using vim

3692988
vim	emacs
i know that unlike emacs vim is designed to be a simple text editor

3692992
division	multiplication
i understand how they work but i can t think of any scenarios where i might want to use them unless i want to do some really quick multiplication or division

3693004
width	height
width and height should definitely be grouped together.

3693037
public	protected
generally order the members by their nature constants fields constructors methods and then by their visibility private protected public

3693044
division	multiplication
historically multiplication and division were significantly slower as they are more complex operations and some cpus didn t have those at all

3693093
src	attr
additionally attr is used to get and set the src attribute of the images

3693109
firefox	safari
after creating a div and applying the properties everything looks fine in firefox safari and internet explorer 8 compatability mode

3693128
post	get
as was suggested in other similar post though i still get the same output

3693138
int	double
is there a way to put an int and a double in the same array

3693138
int	double
i want to have an array where the first is an int and all the rest of the elements are double

3693144
int	double
you can have an array of object s in which case you can put int and double objects in it

3693171
int	double
you can do this by having an array of objects that are superclasses of int double as pointed out elsewhere

3693171
int	double
however i would perhaps enforce type safety by implementing an object that has an int component plus an array of double s and store an array of these

3693171
int	double
the upside despite the additional complexity is that you ll have type safety and not have to cast the first element to an int whilst casting the remainder to double s

3693187
folder	directory
folder 2770 owner and group have read write list access everyone else has no access setgit bit set to preserve group ownership of files created in directory

3693221
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
hash them with md5 with some random sort of salt

3693246
vp8	ogg
you could also stream in ogg vorbis theora or vp8 to an icecast server see the olpc gstreamer wiki for examples

3693257
lisp	smalltalk
in particular incremental background compilation is a standard feature of all smalltalk ides since at least 1978 or thereabouts and even longer than that in lisp ides

3693257
ecj	jikes
and this compiler called jikes was open-sourced together with eclipse and became the ecj eclipse compiler for java that powers all of the incremental on-the-fly compilation syntax highlighting code completion type inference and refactoring capabilities of eclipse jdt

3693263
min	max
the group by must include all the columns that are not referenced inside of aggregate functions ie max min avg count etc

3693295
ati	nvidia
in the meantime there are still some issues with opengl interop at least with the most important nvidia ati implementations

3693306
ssl	https
this does not apply to https anyway since https uses ssl tls from the beginning of the connection.

3693309
awt	swing
in their media tools examples they offer a simple player example using awt swing

3693314
portrait	landscape
it works perfectly in portrait mode but when i try to have it display in a landscape orientation it still slides in from the bottom

3693319
int	chars
the first is to convert each chars into a small int and then convert the resulting sequence of small int into a large int

3693354
getter	setter
normally accessors have setter and getter

3693354
getter	setter
when you set something using the setter you get the same thing back from the getter

3693367
vim	notepad++
i ditched notepad++ for vim and it s been great

3693384
ftp	telnet
libcurl currently supports the http https ftp gopher telnet dict file and ldap protocols

3693384
post	put
libcurl also supports https certificates http post http put ftp uploading this can also be done with php s ftp extension http form based upload proxies cookies and user+password authentication

3693387
std	ostream
so now you should be able to do anything to iostream_object in the above example that you would normally do with any other std ostream like stdout

3693464
groupbox	panel
i don t know the underlying reason why the groupbox behaves differently from textbox or panel but it might have to do with the fact that groupbox is used as a container control but doesn t actually inherit from any container types

3693539
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview with a bunch of subviews all positioned using layoutsubviews

3693548
folder	directory
put your images in a spearate folder not in your virtual directory for the application

3693595
implements	extends
this will force other developers to implements their own calculatetax method and extends your base class

3693634
width	height
boxlayout s implementation of layoutcomponent involves a call to a method that creates sizerequirements objects for the width and height of each of the components you add to the jpanel based on their getminimum preferred maximumsize methods

3693634
width	height
later it calls sizerequirements.calculatealignedpositions for determining the correct width values for each component because your orientation is boxlayout.y_axis the height are calculated using a different method

3693637
min	max
float min max

3693650
caanimation	calayer
there are more complicated things you can do with calayer caanimation directly but i haven t investigated this much

3693652
subclass	abstract-class
for instance a movegenerator abstract-class had two subclasses suicidemovegenerator and normalmovegenerator and depending on the type of game chosen by user a factory would instantiate the right subclass

3693652
polymorphism	specialization
c++ template specialization provides exactly this - static polymorphism

3693710
slideup	slidedown
android animation slidedown slideup

3693712
client-side	server-side
- server-side javascript choices and as a consequence the possibility of the development or porting -- a framework like dojo could already offer a lot to a js server-side app only parts of it are actually client-side of powerful simple and therefore eventually popular framework

3693742
getter	setter
instead of using setter getter are also queryable

3693749
rvm	bundler
this is closer to freezing gems or using bundler in rails rather than rvm

3693839
superclass	subclassing
you can prevent the subclassing from calling a public method from the superclass

3693853
filtering	grouping
it sounds like you want to do something like this in pseudo-linq data.groupby .select count .where -- you grouping consolidate by some criteria count the number in each grouping and then filtering by the results

3693866
free	malloc
malloc free

3693866
free	calloc
calloc free

3693881
pop-up	dialog
the problem i have is that when the user clicks the button associated with the ibaction it will pop-up the login dialog but then the window disappears without ever pulling up the publish story to wall dialog

3693892
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but i get an error in firefox and google-chrome and safari

3693912
submit	submission
if you use return false inside submit the form will not be submitted through the html and you ll have to handle the submission with jquery javascript ajax

3693921
prepare	execute
prepare and execute a single

3693954
width	height
if that doesn t work then also use self.innerheight and self.innerwidth via javascript for the div height and width

3693991
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox google-chrome

3694005
jar	war
deploy the webapplication war project and make sure the ejb jar is in libraries which netbeans automatically does and needs no worry

3694007
int	double
be mindful of data types image data loaded into matlab is typically in the form of an unsigned 8-bit int but sometimes it can be an unsigned 16-bit int or a double precision type

3694007
int	double
when dealing with int types conversion to double precision is usually desired before performing certain operations in order to avoid certain aspects of int arithmetic such as round-off and saturation

3694024
width	height
i have concluded that this is because the new google maps api v3 is a bit querky in how it interprets css inheiritence and more or less demands that the map be rendered to a block element with 100 values for both width and height

3694024
width	height
by rendering the iframe window into the div i can control the size i want through the div s css while at the same time giving the google maps api the 100 width and height values through the iframe document

3694024
hide	show
so now i have a workaround where the div is not initially hidden the iframe show the maps builds perfectly and then a settimeout event written into the iframe page then closes the div to hide the map on the parent page

3694026
int	double
you can store the int easily but the double needs more work

3694051
folder	directory
how can i traverse through the directory structure and remove the folder

3694058
rss	feed
i am trying to parse rss feed from a news website but i am unable to fetch the images from the rss feed

3694058
rss	feed
can someone suggest me some easy implementation for parsing rss feed with images in android

3694060
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
works like a charm in google-chrome firefox safari

3694081
implements	modifiers
if you want to use interfaces for constant definitions in order to spare the bunch of modifiers that an interface assumes but you don t want to use the anti-pattern of implements a constants-only interface

3694089
strtol	atoi
if you are planning multi-digit id values you d need to use atoi or strtol et al

3694091
ienumerator	idisposable
note that disposing of the iterator at the end is important - but you can t use a using statement as ienumerator itself doesn t implement idisposable unlike

3694127
children	parent
use a parent container with overflow auto and white-space nowrap and children with display inline or inline-block

3694131
int	chars
naturally using chars would result in more operations than int

3694146
doc	rtf
also as far as i know document.saveas api can convert any document docx doc rtf which it can open in word to html or any other format

3694160
next	except
i think that using performselector withobject afterdelay without a delay would be appropriate for your situation because that does perform the selector on the main thread except that it s performed in the next iteration of the current run loop

3694170
quicksort	shellsort
null shellsort is used rather than quicksort

3694178
put	get
there are many approaches that can be employed in this case and it depends on the cost you re willing to put in order to get the value

3694186
integer	unsigned
i would guess that the types size_t for an unsigned type and ptrdiff_t for a signed type will usually correspond to quite efficient integer types on any given platform

3694186
int	chars
there are 5 different possible ranks for standard int types chars short int long long long

3694242
google-chrome	safari
it does not work in safari and google-chrome

3694242
google-chrome	safari
also on you can see youtube videos inside the info window working in google-chrome and safari by clicking more... on the top right of the map and then checking videos

3694243
serializable	deserialization
right now i m just trying to set up the deserialization and i was going to add in serializable after

3694246
google-chrome	firefox
i want to check which web sites is open in browsers ie firefox google-chrome to write a program in c# which can block web site which is in list of forbidden web site

3694265
flask	web.py
web.py flask celery twisted etc look interesting - so far only the latter seems like a candidate for something i could properly contribute to but even though im a decent ish python programmer i think the whole event driven thing is probably too steep a learning curve for me to be able to contribute meaningfully for a while.

3694283
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the format used by objectinputstream objectoutputstream is not something you can type out

3694304
setlocale	strftime
this may be by design setlocale does not automatically change the output of the format of dates output using date and strftime

3694338
stdout	stderr
but all the stderr and stdout output of ghostscript s processing the input.pdf will still appear in your console

3694367
debian	linux
debian gnu linux 5.0.6

3694371
superclass	subclassing
how do i initialize the superclass __init__ in the subclassing

3694388
width	height
since your current callbacks look very similar you can make them generic and run them through a delay function it needs to be per type though since they affect different things height width depth

3694400
int	chars
represent your wide chars strings in tpl as arrays of 16-bit int

3694418
nsurlconnection	nsurlprotocol
alternatively implementing an nsurlprotocol subclass isn t very hard for this because your protocol can internally fire up another nsurlconnection using the correct http url and map its delegate methods to the protocol client s

3694450
hide	show
how can i show hide component with jsf

3694462
hide	show
in this if we select others then the text box will show otherwise text box will hide

3694482
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter
a few things i d use mouseenter instead of mouseover since mouseout will fire when entering a child and also make sure it s running inside a document.ready handler like this

3694495
hide	show
the purpose of the dropdownpanel is to be able to hide and show another component on it

3694495
hide	show
the only thing that forces the proper behaviour is to hide and show the jtable via the dropdownpanel

3694535
free	malloc
about once every three times i run my program malloc reports a double free error

versioning	upgrade
i wish to use the foreign keys facility and thus upgrade my versioning of sqlite to the latest stable versioning 3.7.2

3694746
versioning	upgrade
how do i upgrade the sqlite3 versioning used by both firefox and xcode also

3694775
post	get
please post some alternatives and help me to get out of this juncture

3694778
inherited	properties
in prototype-based languages the prototype of an object is a set of properties which is inherited by all objects which are based on this object

3694810
getter	setter
make a private collection anothercollection with setter and getter in your class

3694814
int	double	ostringstream	std
additionally there were some runtime c++ changes in gcc 4.2 which meant a gcc 4.2 app running on os 2.2.1 crashed when casting unsigned int long to float double or using std ostringstream

3694830
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
therefore what size in pixel should my three images be to be able to fill the screens of the device in ldpi mdpi and hdpi

3694847
setinterval	settimeout
the two fundamental ways to do ui loops in javascript on browsers are settimeout and setinterval

3694847
setinterval	settimeout
note that the intervals in setinterval are counted from when the callback was called whereas if you schedule a new settimeout at the end of your callback processing it ll obviously be scheduled from that point instead

3694874
versioning	upgrade
the problem is that it works fine in the debugger but when i publish it to the market and upgrade my app i ve purchased a versioning of my app with my personal gmail-accout so i am a legitimate user i get the error that the my app is not licensed

3694877
folder	directory
if you want to ignore all folder files in the current directory use a leading slash for directory or for files

3694935
backgrounding	multitasking
i know with multitasking on the iphone 4 a user could open the app and run it in the backgrounding

3694943
keydown	keyup
you can call it on keydown keyup check the state of the keyboard and act appropriately

3695038
hide	show
when you click on a link some jquery code hide the div container and show another div

3695038
hide	show
how is it possible to synchronize touch screen and jquery hide show functions

3695047
content-length	content-type
specifically the content-length and content-type headers will be of interest

3695079
inherited	properties
now the problem here is redunduncy because there s already a properties companycode to the company class is there any way that user will be able to just use company s companycode properties without inheriting the company class problem here is c# doesnt allow multiple inherited of classes or using an icompany interface but interface is a pain in value objects

3695082
google-chrome	firefox
however when i opened up ie firefox and google-chrome and i asked for index.html at different times about 2 seconds apart it looked like each browser was receiving the page simultaneously in other words at one point there were 12 different images being served 4 to each browser

3695093
width	height
the bad thing is when an app is maximized this code stores the width height left and top of maximized window not the normal size position before maximization

3695124
subtraction	addition
the assignment is the classic addition and subtraction of big integers using linked lists

3695160
getter	setter
getter and setter would be the easy way to go

3695194
opera	firefox
file upload fine in ie and not work on firefox opera

3695213
hide	show
to not clutter the menubar unnecessarily i want to hide and show the menubar icon depending on whether safari is open or not

3695214
awt	swing
when you use awt or swing there is a special thread running in the background called the eventqueue

3695218
super	self
i can fix this by calling super b self .__init__ a

3695218
superclass	subclassing
if yes how can i check b is an attribute of which class - the subclassing or the superclass

3695221
public	protected
the difference is that on objects properties allow controlled access to private and protected members whereas on interfaces all members are public so there s no need for the properties

3695224
put	get
i have data with latitude and longitude stored in my sqlite database and i want to get the nearest locations to the parameters i put in ex

3695224
cos	sin
it s suggesting to make 4 new columns for cos and sin values of lat and lng but is there any other not so redundant way

3695261
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
there s firebug a firefox add-in google-chrome s and safari s development tools built into the browsers microsoft visual studio or script debugger for debugging with ie etc

3695275
int	double
it is not so bad when primitive types int double etc. are passed by value but when a class instance is passed by value temporary objects are created which requires constructors and later on destructor s to be called on the class and on all of the member variable in the class

3695283
fancybox	jcarousel
on one of my content pages i m using the jcarousel and fancybox jquery plugins

3695283
fancybox	jcarousel
is there a conflict between the jquery document .ready function of the jcarousel script and the document .ready function of the fancybox script

3695295
int	boolean
the fact that string 0 int 0 boolean false is one example

3695307
strcpy	malloc	strlen	strcpy
and if you are using strcpy it actually copy the whole string including the terminating null so you will allocate one byte less if you use strlen in malloc

3695324
sudo	chgrp
sudo chgrp _www library webserver documents db

3695374
calloc	malloc
the return value of calls to malloc and calloc and friends should always be tested to ensure the operation worked as expected

3695402
width	height
basically i have a 8x8 grid in which each cell should have the same width and height

3695402
width	height
the colored cells are the ones i added to the actual grid gray which has cells with the same height and width x

3695402
width	height
so the grid s height and width is

3695402
width	height
i now want the additional cells to have the necessary width height minimumsize plus the rest of the available width height from the full size

3695408
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
you just have to be mindful nsdatecomponents won t contain valid information for any fields you ask for unless you generated them with that valid information request nscalendar to provide that information with nscalendarunit s

3695408
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
if you want to also get an era for instance out of nsdatecomponents you ll have to feed the generator method from nscalendar with the nscalendarunitera flag

3695440
versioning	upgrade
you should also consider persuading your company to upgrade to a versioning of linux where the inotify mechanism is available

3695502
sorting	grouping
the grouping by is performed before the sorting so the order by useremail.emailid has nothing to do

3695527
subclass	abstract-class
let s say scala had finally unified parameter list and tuples and that all tuples were subclass to an abstract-class tuple

3695599
folder	directory
it has a dependency on vspmsg.dll from that same directory you ll have to copy it by hand into your bin debug folder

3695602
rss	feed
there is a problem when trying to read some rss feed that express their date differently

3695614
apache	nginx
nginx + apache wsgi + django 1.1.2

3695638
multiplying	multiplication
so you re calling the function and multiplying the result by cd_dir_entry and promptly ignoring the result of the multiplication

3695644
x86	64bit
on register-rich cpu architecures like arm powerpc 64bit x86 680x0 - but not 32-bit x86 - pointers and references which are secretly pointers wearing fancy syntatical clothing are commonly be passed or returned in a register which is really freaking fast compared to the memory access involved in a stack operation

3695644
webkit	gecko
and he should look at the internals of large c c++ systems like the webkit or gecko html rendering engines or any of the mozilla browsers or the gtk+ or qt gui toolkits

3695686
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
edit firefox 4 already implement this very useful property but it is not available in ie11 last i checked and only available in google-chrome 29 and safari 8

punctuation	words
what s the best way to produce only english words output that would be needed in a text search excluding punctuation and special characters

3695732
int	double
im sure you know your data-types such as booleons strings int double floats but im not sure you understand how logical operators work within php ill give you shour example

hash	salt
store the user s login the salt hash of their password and the salt in a database

3695739
testdriven.net	ndepend	ncover	testdriven.net	ncover	ndepend
it is worth mentionning that best alternative to a wide range of tfs features are not necessarily oss but low-budget commercial like ndepend for code quality and architecture exploration ncover for code coverage testdriven.net for testing nested in ide .

3695781
super	self
super scrape self .__init__ none

3695787
maya	blender
the easiest is probably to draw a model of a rounded cube in one of the many 3d modeling programs around maya blender and load 27 instances of the model in your code

3695833
cvs	svn
cvs vss svn

3695862
range	min	range	max	min	max
on the other hand balanced binary search trees red-black and avl support o log n operations which is indeed slower but have the added advantage of keeping the elements sorted - thus enabling a lot more operations min max k-th element upper-bound lower-bound range queries etc. that are simply not possible in an unordered structure such as a hash table

3695876
int	double	int	chars	multiplying	add
with c you can add chars to double you can multiplying chars and int .

opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but it stopped working today in firefox safari google-chrome and opera - although it still works correctly in internet explorer

3695896
opera	firefox
opera and firefox show no error at all

3695964
post	get
this blog post shows you how to get started with a nibless iphone project

3695974
aggregate-functions	sum
it is easy to get the sum or max of all the descendants but the way the aggregate-functions are combined complicates the matter greatly

3695986
post	put
i put post id into url and it solves problem

3695992
subtraction	addition
the assignment itself is to make a program that performs addition and subtraction of big integers using linked lists and i m slowly starting to hate linked lists outside of lisp

3695992
subtraction	addition
everything seems to be working now save for the actual addition and subtraction

3696061
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
java.util.date and java.util.calendar

3696143
boost	allocator
personally i would go for the one parse scheme trying to keep the allocator down using boost variant and the strategy pattern as much i could

3696152
xul	xbl
in this case the main namespace xbl and xul

3696164
elf	coff
gcc on the other hand works with elf linux most unixes coff on windows or mach-o mac

3696180
subtract	add
it is not easy to add to a structure like this because a naive approach of adding something to the end would not work when subtract when q is negative you will go to all the trouble of subtract q from p and then discover that you should have added instead

3696196
button	checkbox
mind the radio button and checkbox with their white appearance

3696228
vaadin	smartgwt
flex looks very oriented to content display while gwt and its heirs smartgwt vaadin .. seems to preval for business-like applications

3696265
lxml	html5lib
i m trying to work with html5lib and lxml but i can t seem to figure out how to use the find and findall operators

3696280
getter	setter
for example setter and getter are seldom needed

3696282
qlineedit	qlabel
is it multiple qlabel s and qlineedit s

3696359
qlineedit	qlabel
i have done something similar with several qqueue containers full of qlabel and qlineedit items

3696376
struts	wicket
i d recommend spring mvc or wicket over struts

3696403
x86	mips
architectures x86 arm mips

3696414
lxml	html5lib
it appears that using the lxml html5lib treebuilder causes html5lib to build the tree in the xhtml namespace -- which makes sense as lxml is an xml library and xhtml is how one represents html as xml

3696422
google-chrome	safari
anyway the error message on safari google-chrome are cryptic

3696458
int	chars
to support all unicode chars including supplementary chars use the touppercase int method

3696475
qtableview	qtablewidget
if the ui contains a lots of these items you could consider using qtableview or qtablewidget

3696558
ssl	https
how do i set up and configure https ssl for sinatra apps

3696565
mouseover	mouseout
the only standard events it applies to are mouseout and mouseover

3696573
postgresql	mysql
stores it s content in a database mysql sqlite postgresql - your choice

3696607
fancybox	jcarousel
it appears your problem is in the fact that jcarousel moves images in and out of view - causing a problem with fancybox

3696616
width	height
you may be wondering why there is a width and height argument for the processing function but if the image is not exactly divisible by 64 then there will be smaller chunks at the edge of the image right-hand side and the bottom

3696616
width	height
see this image for a better understanding what i mean red chunks are the chunks that will have 64 width or height arguments

3696670
width	height
i would also check width height for accuracy and basically you don t really need them you can easily calculate them inside the function

3696747
range	infinity
generate these interpolated points summing them together while halving the amplitudes see perling noise as the number of sums approaches infinity the limit of the range now approaches twice the previous values or -4.5 4.5 and is now even less uniform

3696766
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works in firefox google-chrome safari and opera but in internet explorer 8 it returns the error object required for this line

3696817
children	parent
the recursive option is simple if you don t have to track the previous enabled state of all the children and restore them when you want to re-enable the parent container

3696857
hash	hmac
what is the difference then between this and message authentication codes mac and hash macs hmac

3696858
fgets	strstr	fgets	strcmp	strstr	strcmp
depending on how much complexity you actually need you might get away with just using fgets in a loop and parsing each line manually with strstr strchr strcmp etc

3696913
multiplying	subtract
once you ve divided by 100 000 000 and taken the integer value you can then multiplying this integer value back by 100 000 000 and subtract it from the isbn

3696914
many-to-many	one-to-many
if you want relations between instances works in many-to-many or one-to-many manner maybe you could study nsnotification class reference or notification programming guide

3696919
stdout	stderr
child s stdout and stderr which

3696919
stdout	stderr
i had a similar problem with my program not disappearing from task mgr when i was consuming the stdout stderr

3696919
stdout	fflush	stdout	stderr	stderr	fflush
of course you could always fflush and then redirect back to stdout and stderr before exit

3696924
int	double
in php a whole number that is too large or too small to represent as an int type will automatically be represented as a float or a double if necessary

3696929
disk	ram
floats may gain importance when you have large arrays of floating-point numbers to manage scientific calculations or stuff like that so having a smaller data type may be convenient both to use less memory and to be faster to read them from ram disk

3696929
int	double
on pcs imo you can just use double in normal contexts just try to avoid mixing datatypes double floats int ... in the same expression to avoid unnecessary costly conversions

3696931
width	height
if you can figure out width height stride and color depth it should be doable to skip to the 7fe0 0010 data element value and just grab the succeeding bytes

3696947
hash	hmac
a hmac algorithm is simply a specific type of mac algorithm that uses a hash algorithm internally rather than for example an encryption algorithm to generate the mac

3697004
folder	directory
i used environment.currentdirectory to get the applicationfolder at the start of my prog though when i passed commandlinearguments from an other folder to my app the current directory changed so my app chrashed due to the lack of correct errorhandling i didnt passed the exception anywhere i didn t notice that this was the problem

3697063
awt	swing	swt	swing
in java awt swing swt you name it... but android is a really tough beast

3697066
put	get
please put in mind that the eventclass will be implemented so many times sometimes to get data from an oracle databases and sometimes mysql databases

3697072
put	get
i use an nsxmlparser to parse youtube s api and i get all the content i want and put it into a class called video

3697072
for-loop	arrays
however when i use parserdidenddocument i use a for-loop to read through the arrays and all of the entries have the same title value of the last object added

3697084
content-length	content-type
this would explain why content-length and content-type are missing in the output

3697105
put	get
of course you can t redefine your addressid in order to put your custom logic in its setter as you ll get compiler error

3697122
disk	ram
or rather how does remote ram compare against local disk access

3697145
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
i have a qgraphicsview with a qgraphicsscene

3697172
google-chrome	firefox
this is doing nothing in ie but works fine in firefox and google-chrome

3697178
squash	merge	squash	branch
in git is there a way to merge all changes from one branch into another but squash to a single commit at the same time

3697191
accessor	properties
another reason is that debuggers commonly provide watches or other user interfaces that cause additional code such as properties accessor to be executed which can in turn change the state of the program

3697194
awt	swing
- replace remove all dependencies on java awt swing

3697266
bash	zsh
bin xxxxx where xxxxx could be bash csh korn zsh ash..

3697292
folder	directory
but as i said the .dll is copied to the bin folder sub20dnc.dll is in the same directory as the executable

3697309
width	height
i would expect that would cause the width to be calculated if i only specify a height

3697316
config	ini
to your config ini

3697336
symfony	kohana	codeigniter	kohana
+1 for symfony and another i d like to recommend is kohana built on codeigniter

3697358
width	height
with liquid layouts like this i tend to set up a really basic table not as evil as some would say because they do these kind of auto calculations where you need to figure the browser height width and minus a certain value for you

3697383
mouseover	mouseout
i have dynamically created divs with mouseover and mouseout live events where i simply change the div s opacity using the animate method with a stop to prevent the queue to build up

3697384
free	memcpy	free	malloc	memcpy	malloc
if you want to use a byte array you re going to have to malloc memcpy and free the memory appropriately every time you want to reassign it

3697387
portrait	landscape
i am trying to rotate my mpmovieplayercontroller to landscape view but it always stays in portrait mode

3697392
rss	feed
i m fetching data from different rss atom feed and sometimes the html data i receive contains html tags but they dont have close tags or some other issues and it screws up the page layout styling

3697394
filtering	grouping
even then its only worth it if you expect a lot of filtering based on these values as the cost of building these tables is high and for most queries the standard sql grouping by .

3697406
mouseleave	mouseenter
what this does is first uses the mouseenter and mouseleave events like .hover maps to which don t fire when entering leaving children

3697445
hash	md5
i want to implement a caching system whereby i generate an md5 hash of the sql query and then return a cached dataset for the query if it exists in the collection

3697449
maven	pom.xml
what is the simplest way to retrieve version number from maven s pom.xml in code programatically

3697461
jquery	jqmodal
you can use jqmodal or jquery ui dialog

3697482
put	get
you can also get to other standard properties like project.name project.description or even arbitrary properties you put in your pom etc

3697497
versioning	upgrade
the cocoa world changes quite quickly and the documentation tends to describe only the latest versioning so i would recommend you to upgrade to 10.6 if it s possible

3697510
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade from crystal report 2008 basic to crystal reports 2008 dev versioning 12.3.1.164 and used embebed reports in my application since that the dll size grew may be ten times

3697543
width	height
you donâ t know the page width and height could a5

3697552
hash	md5
hash all that with md5

3697552
rss	feed
additionally you will find that html tag escaping is weird with rss feed

3697552
rss	feed
creating an rss feed from html is quite nasty and i can only point you to services such as spinn3r which are fantastic at de-duplication and content extraction

3697555
google-chrome	firefox
this function executes during the forms onsubmit and works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

3697560
vim	emacs
it s an emacs mode that makes emacs feel more like vim while giving you full access to the wonderful mind-boggling complexity of emacs if you ever want it

3697593
post	get
i have the basics working but have spent the weekend trying to get maruku to work eg a post body saved from a text area with markdown extra markup to the db and then back again to the browser

3697593
post	get
i used the following code in my post model but i get an error when i try to load post - undefined local variable or method maruku for #

3697600
width	height
correct you must specify both height and width

3697600
width	height
however if you want to make sure it s always a certain height set the master_dim config option to height then you can set width to anything and it will always make the resize image that height while maintaining aspect ratio with the width

3697607
skip-lists	tree
since it s extremely unlikely that you will want to enumerate your cache in order or at all a skip-lists and likewise a binary tree is unnecessary

3697619
mp3	ogg	mp3	wav	mp3	speex	wav	ogg	wav	speex	speex	ogg
anyways as far as encoding on the server side i rolled my own python cgi script that converts in my case speex to wav using speexdec and then wav to mp3 using lame and wav to ogg using oggenc

3697649
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade to using versioning 4.1 of the flex sdk and flashbuilder

3697704
folder	directory
my templates directory is within my project folder

3697715
altera	xilinx
xilinx tools suck but their raw silicon is better than altera

3697748
apache	nginx
must work in a shared hosting environment where the user has no control of the web server apache nginx etc

3697764
width	height
would you have 3 separate images each saved with a different width height

3697764
width	height
smiley.png that is saved in high resolution large width height and then scaled with interface builder

3697832
integer	unsigned
but there are simple tests for overflow that do not involve invoking overflow or unsigned integer wrapping and they re even simpler than doing the addition then checking for overflow which is of course undefined behavior for signed integers

3697847
width	height
the use your columns and rows attributes to define the width and height

3697850
hide	show
here is a basic tutorial for using show hide on events with jquery

3697914
punctuation	words
use words boundaries instead of splitting on or using just indexof the spaces on either side which would not find the. and other instances next to punctuation

3697918
awt	swing
you would also have to be familiar with either awt or swing development to build the gui in jython

3697930
int	boolean
1 boolean boolean boolean boolean boolean boolean boolean int int

3697994
rtp	rtcp
... a participant must not assume that the source port of the incoming rtp or rtcp packet can be used as the destination port for outgoing rtp or rtcp packets

3697994
rtp	rtcp
when rtp data packets are being sent in both directions each participant s rtcp sr packets must be sent to the port that the other participant has specified for reception of rtcp

3697994
rtp	sdp
rtp does not have any mechanism to inform of these addresses and ports that s up to sdp or some other setup protocol which would lead me to understand this paragraph as if you re receiving data from an unknown source just discard it

3697994
rtp	rtcp
but in section 6.3.3 it basically says that when an rtp or non-bye rtcp packet is received with an unknown ssrc a new participant should be added to the table

3697994
rtp	sdp
sdp doesn t define the ssrc that will be used by each of the rtp participants

3698009
codeigniter	pyrocms
i recommend you codeigniter mvc framework and for cms pyrocms which is built upon codeigniter is cool

3698028
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
in touchesbegan and touchesmoved

3698050
content-length	content-type
do remember that unlike a submit action which internally creates a request you re trying to create the request yourself so you might need to deal with stuff like request headers content-type content-length etc. content etc

3698053
boost	stl
their biggest usage is in stl and boost libraries

3698062
getter	setter
you can also interface the getter and setter if you want separation of layers wrt your data objects but that might make gxt type binding harder

3698073
post	get
you first need to add a control that get the data from javascript and post them back

3698073
post	get
and then on post back you get them

3698076
voip	sip
are there any good java cross platform sip voip dev kits that you have personally used

3698134
post	get
if you could post the logic of page_load it might get clarified

3698160
hide	show
i m trying to align the height of a sidebar div by the height of another div accessed show hide by clicking on a link

3698168
invokerequired	begininvoke
as its name suggests invokerequired means you need to call invoke or begininvoke when accessing the control

3698175
post	get
then you could call it like dictone.transpose enumerable.first to get the above behavior dictone.transpose enumerable.single to get an exception when there s a duplicate key the behavior of other post dictone.transpose enumerable.min to pick the first one lexicographically or pass in your own function do whatever you need

3698180
move	drag
one of the things i ll need to do is have a drawing layer where i can have a circle in the middle and be able to drag other circles near it to attach them and then be able to move them around changing their position around the initial circle

3698183
g++	gcc
if i run make then how can i tell if gcc or g++ is being used

3698209
getter	setter
it s usually a bad idea to not use the javabeans convention getter and setter

3698215
google-chrome	firefox
the message however doesn t show up in google-chrome or firefox

3698218
fast-forward	merge
if z is the last commit on master a simple git merge sha1 a will fast-forward master head to a

3698223
opera	firefox
window.onload is the built-in javascript event but as its implementation had subtle quirks across browsers firefox internet explorer 6 internet explorer 8 and opera jquery provides document.ready which abstracts those away and fires as soon as the page s dom is ready doesn t wait for images etc.

3698248
folder	directory
be aware that if you put it in a separate module this module needs to be in the same folder as the templates directory or you ll end up with the wrong directory again

3698250
hide	show
you ll also want to define some methods things like -show and -hide to show the view and hide it

3698305
cout	cin
there are some minor differences between the two with the biggest difference being that iostream puts the included contents in namespace std so you have to qualify cin cout endl istream etc

3698317
versioning	upgrade
but after upgrade to mysql 5.x versioning this php source can t send form data info to other page

3698342
width	height
before i do .fadein on i find the width and height of the window and set the offset of the div to try place to div in the centre of the screen

3698348
linefeed	delimiter
you can read until a known delimiter often linefeed using fgets to read a line

3698399
folder	directory
i am doing something with my document directory folder but there __macosx folder create problem

3698402
google-chrome	firefox
now i m quite sure that the requests are correctly formed since they are sent by major web browsers like firefox google-chrome or perl c# which have http modules dll s

3698408
accessor	properties
additionally accessor should always return a copy of the properties s value not the value itself

3698408
accessor	properties
combining an accessor and a mutator gives you a javabean properties

3698464
free	strdup
if you can find where the writeable strings are actually being used another possibility would be to use strdup and free on the subset of literal strings that the code is actually editing

3698488
versioning	upgrade
every time i increase my database versioning and push the upgrade app to

3698617
jsf	seam
seam itself was brought to make easier integration of jsf with another technologies

3698630
post	get
why do i get the same category 3 times if there are 3 post where gender is equal to 1

3698661
struts	wicket	vaadin	wicket
these echo gwt vaadin differ from traditional frameworks like spring mvc struts wicket in the fact that you don t write html css and javascript

3698709
mouse	keyboard
i want to do it with the mouse as well but i imagine it will be a very similar process and i think but i might be wildly mistaken that starting with the keyboard will be easier

3698711
rvm	bundler
in short if you run bundle install before you have the bundler gem getting the standard gem not found error then do gem install bundler followed by another bundle install the bundler gem has been install to your system not rvm

3698711
rvm	bundler
then i would open a new term do rvm ree proj and gem install bundler prior to bundle install

3698777
range	max
however this form can t handle empty tables correctly since max id is null and neither can you setval 0 because it would be out of range of the sequence

3698787
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in google-chrome 6.0.472 as well as firefox 3.6.8

3698788
mouse	keyboard
if it wasn t for the usb i d connect the two via lan and have a client server c# program that emulates a keyboard mouse via directinput

3698791
puts	gets
it s just a thin layer over the apache parser that puts it into error-correcting mode which is a great architecture as every time apache gets better so does neko

3698832
ubuntu	linux
i m a bit of a linux noob trying to get ruby rails mysql and sqlite all playing nicely on ubuntu 10

3698851
getter	setter
i think not but you might simulate it using virtual getter and setter perhaps

3698855
sorting	grouping
in order to fully construct a sorting of a list of things which this problem equates to as the list is completely reordered by the grouping you always have to know the entire set

3698886
google-chrome	firefox
however everything seems to work perfect in firefox and google-chrome but ie throws an error

3698904
post	get
that target page takes in the parameters passed via post or get and performs actions with them eg add database record and prints out any response required

3698945
disk	ram
all resources that may need serialization ram disk etc. are a possible bottleneck

3698991
getter	setter
it s best to just use the x.classname getter setter property which avoids needing to call attribute functions and works on all browsers just the same

3698996
singleton	facade
in my industry banking i see a lot of the following gof patterns factory method singleton adapter and facade

3699004
versioning	upgrade
our product is installed in windows machines all over the world with our latest versioning we need to ensure that internet explorer is upgrade to versioning 8

3699012
getter	setter
yes accessor methods are an overhead although the syntax for using setter getter is just as clean as direct access of public properties.

3699012
accessor	properties
biggest benefit of accessor methods is that you can use your set method to validate values and reject inappropriate values trying to set a properties that should always be an integer to a string or an array .

3699019
apache	nginx
i would advise setting up a development preview on shared hosting or something or even locally with a proper web server such as apache or nginx

3699032
uilabel	uibutton
all the uilabel and uibutton are required as mentioned above as they re showing data coming from a web service request so they re all required if we re using interface builder to design our gui s

3699033
getter	setter
getter setter arose in java

3699033
getter	setter
it allows you to validate types in a central location you don t have duplicated code in multiple setter getter

3699033
getter	setter
it s a code smell to implement hollow getter setter to have enterprisey-looking code

3699033
getter	setter
and it s also inadvisable to have getter setter with side-effects

3699035
uploadify	swfupload
the other alternative is using a flash-based uploader like swfupload or uploadify

3699046
getter	setter
setter and getter are always the best option because they provide more stability for validation sanitization

3699048
uilabel	uibutton
the uilabel s and uibutton s in particular seem like strange things to have outlets for.

3699072
post	get
i wish to execute an exe as a part of my post msbuild tasks once all the projects in my solution are build the exe should get executed only after the complete build of my solution and not the individual projects

3699079
width	height
if the first video is 4 3 width height then all subsequent video players get resized 4 3 even if the video is supposed to be 16 9 or something else

3699099
mouse	keyboard
i found it was quite fast with a single keyboard monitor and mouse and a kvm switch going between pc and mac

3699154
post	get
post and get query string data if any

3699156
queue	fifo
so if you can use locks maybe use something like this concurrent fifo queue with boost

3699169
websphere	ibm
i have a certain library ibm s websphere mq which i m using with an api that is suppose to return a remote servers character set

3699171
versioning	upgrade
while they may be required by your deployment scenario eg for customers who want to upgrade in-place they duplicate information from the versioning history of the database and per murphy s law duplication means desynchronization sooner or later

3699256
subtraction	addition
this allows easy addition subtraction

3699290
int	chars
constants in c you asked about that are numerical constants 0 1 0x0 0.1 1.e-10 ... integral chars constants a n l a ... and enumeration constants that are of type int

3699352
backtracking	greedy
it looks like the problem is triggered by the attempt to backtracking a greedy repetition when there s a reference to a capturing group inside a lookahead the out of bounds index is the difference in length between the first and the second a+ aabaaaaab gets -3

3699352
backtracking	greedy
