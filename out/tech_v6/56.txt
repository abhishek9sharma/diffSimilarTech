it s also very dangerous and can incur a number of undefined behaviors if you simply tried to use c-library functions like memcpy to copy c++ objects into heap memory allocated with malloc

7509367
free	malloc
if you are going to work with just malloc and free a nice rule of thumb to avoid undefined behavior pitfalls is to keep the objects you allocate and deallocate with malloc and free to pod-types

that seems to be more like a role based access control or rbac than an access control list acl because you are granting permissions to the user on object depends on what role have if they are in the group collaborative list or is the owner but you are not storing as a role so cannot be a rbac but you are not storing permissions because you are assuming it so it cannot be an acl

7517114
bash	zsh
i tested this under bash and zsh both worked

int	double
i did something similar and what helped me was to add properties to my textbox instead of creating 2 different types for int and double basically allowing a decimal for my requirements

7518021
int	double
by creating a property you can actually choose whether you want the textbox as int or double in the properties view at design-time

7518160
switching	screens
i had this brilliant idea of using generic nib files on a prefs screens so i had a switching nib a text field nib and a text nib

hash	salt
in this case a device should know its own serial number and be able to add or append some secret usually called salt to the serial and then hash or encrypt it

7518235
for-loop	arrays
you must use the vararraylowbound and vararrayhighbound functions to get the bounds of the variant arrays returned by the enumerateobjects function and then you can use a for-loop to iterate over the elements of the arrays

pop-up	dialog
when i do a git svn rebase and the dialog window pop-up to pick squash etc. the upstream dropdown box always defaults to fetch_head now

7518564
quicksort	mergesort
edit an additional related question would be if it s faster to use insertionsort in a pipeline manner to process the generated xpath results right when they are received or to wait until the whole result has been generated and use quicksort or mergesort

7518564
cpu	processors
in general i hope sorting and then computing the intersection of two lists is faster than o n 2 for the search of each item in the xpath result list even if the list is divided by the number of cpu processors available

7518572
temp	tmp
so you might want to check permissions on your temp dirs tmp var tmp usr tmp usr lib python2.6

it seems to me that all which remains for ejb to do is provide stateless stateful and local remote

7519145
width	height
as daniel pointed out the best approach as i m sure you re trying to avoid having to add even more divs is by creating a picture 1px in height and 700px in width

7519470
int	double
given that int is 4 bytes and double is 8 bytes which is not guaranteed by the language sizeof values is at least 8 bytes

7519470
int	double
most commonly it will be exactly 8 bytes more generally sizeof int or sizeof double whichever is larger but compilers are permitted to add unnamed padding to structs and unions

7519472
gson	jackson

7520691
nsstring	nsdata
while it may not be the most efficient way to do it if you re doing this for debugging sscrypto has a category on nsdata which contains two methods to do this one for creating an nsstring of the raw byte values and one which shows a prettier representation of it

7520723
nsstring	nsdata
the easiest solution is to loop thru the bytes of the nsdata and construct the nsstring from it

since you are using 4 chars 4 x 8 byte memory you can instead use a 32bit int which will only require one memory address

7527541

in theory to switch from ppl to tbb you just need to replace a path from where you take ppl.h with tbb the header comes in and of course link with the tbb dll

7527541

to use the extra tbb api that does not exist in ppl such as parallel_pipeline parallel_reduce concurrent_priority_queue and other you need to work with tbb from the very beginning

7534575
fold	combinators
these are just map fold operations in most cases and by making that a combinators rather than built-in syntax you can do things such as take two existing loops and directly combine them in multiple ways--nest one inside the other do one after the other and so on--by just applying a combinators rather than juggling a whole bunch of code around

7534575
getter	setter
so probably the best answer here is that instead of combinator-like things they use classes with lots of getter and setter methods or public fields and logic that mostly consists of doing some opaque predefined action

7536514
getter	setter
a defines that any implementing type must have a public property x with a public getter and a public setter

7536521
getter	setter
remember code which is using an instance of class c must be able to treat it as an interface a which means that the contract is a public getter and setter for property x

7536634
google-chrome	firefox
what you re most likely seeing is firefox google-chrome returning text nodes as lastchild

7536658
google-chrome	firefox
you can figure this all out with a real webbrowser like firefox or google-chrome

for-loop	arrays
if i was using a for-loop i would just start it at the end of the arrays and print out the arrays starting with the last element and ending with the first

7536808
width	height
i think you need to set the width and height of the wrapper uicomponent instance

7536808
width	height
uicomponents don t automatically resize to their content so it s showing up with a width and height of 0

7536841
width	height
the width of the image is fixed at 150px but i want the image to have height equal to content s height

7536851

7536950
switching	screens
if that s the case using the left and right buttons are okay as they are to switching between categories and not the previous screens

7536971

your swf should just be a client that displays that and allows players to select choices - do not put any game play logic inside it unless you want it to get hacked with cheat engine in 3 seconds

7536985
direct3d	directx
i believe its a software rending fallback although newer ones might be directx wrappers and it s a fairly old opengl version 1.1 since it predates their own attempt to dominate the market via direct3d

7536985
ati	nvidia
most modern desktop linux implementations will have some opengl support possibly via the proprietary official ati nvidia intel drivers

7536988

7537021
for-loop	arrays
i m not sure what but for whatever reason when i initialize the number of rows and columns and do a nested for-loop on the arrays i created to implement this structure i get what appears to be more than a hundred rows and 30+ columns when i should just be getting a five by five board

7537021
min	max
i m also trying to specify a max and min value for my rand function but it appears that there isn t a way to do this

7537036
jar	war
i knew mvn package can be used to generate jar or war is there any difference between mvn assembly

7537038
comparator	comparable
you do however have to write your own sort method and i d do this and have it use the comparator helper class or comparable interface to help with the sorting

7537085
svg	vml
ironically the vml format you mentioned is now deprecated in favor of svg

7537093
uitableview	uipickerview
the best way is to let the user pick from a uipickerview or uitableview with the state names you want the user to pick from

7537098
post	get
of course if you re not adverse to cookies you can set your own and just use that to propogate the user identifier rather that the get post methods outlined there

7537110
sprockets	jammit
this sort of thing depends on your platform but in the rails world you want to look at jammit or sprockets which is now part of rails

7537162
width	height
i ve got elements with different height but fixed width in a container element

7537165

7537267
jar	war
package is a simple command used for simple single projects where you only have to create a jar war

7537312
getter	setter
i want to persist those lists from one class to another in our android app with the help of serializable interface and setter and getter methods

7537328
getter	setter
my question is is it necessary to declare the private variable for the same and the getter setter

7537350
getter	setter
if later on you find the need to access the backing field you can explicitly declare it and reimplement the getter and setter using that field without breaking your interface

7537352
getter	setter
is it necessary to declare the private variable for the same and the getter setter

7537352
getter	setter
if you are not notifying or doing anything else then the automatic getter setter method is the quicker to develop that is not claiming it is the fastest or slowest to execute though

7537422
jar	war
if you want to customize this war you need the war respectivelly jar plugin

7537445
post	put	post	get	put	get
when you post the form to somethingscontroller and yes you should post it will fire the create action and there you ll get the value from params which is a hash--you access its values with and put it in session

7537481
hide	show
another option to disabling each control is to create a new div that is transparent but sits on top of the part you want to disable then just show hide that div from the code behind

7537512
post	get
i can t seem to find a way to combine fb s selector with my form so that upon submission i get post info that combines the user id s selected with the choices from my form

7537551
hide	show
so basically you would load the whole form at once then hide parts of it when someone clicks next to move on to the next steps in the processes it would show you could even animate a slide the hidden part and hide what they just completed

7537619
free	malloc
first the way you allocated your nodes in blocks you always have to free the whole block with exactly the same start address as you got from malloc

7537619
free	malloc
modern run-times have quite efficient garbage collection behind malloc free for its buffers not for user allocations and it will be hard for you to achieve something better better meaning more efficient but still guaranteeing the consistency of your data

7537642
ant	maven
only maven plugin and ant task support project structures with modules

7537655
width	height
you have to resize the image based to screen width and height to fit to the screen you are are running

7537660
google-chrome	firefox
tested with internet explorer 9 firefox 6 google-chrome 14

7537694
calloc	malloc
even at that times there were methods to obtain large pages from the system that where zeroed out by default so efficiency was not so much a problem with calloc than for malloc

7537741
getter	setter
that s why i mentioned here error and setter and getter methods for explaining the problem and how i retrive it.i don t know why and don t know how it will be removed

7537744
mongohq	mongolab
mongohq mongolab are some of the dedicated managed mongo hosting services available

7537750
box-shadow	background-size
it s not the animation - the animation ran just fine when i had the external css disabled but it s the browser struggling to render the css3 properties namely border-radius background-size and box-shadow in this case over such a short period of time

7537760
sorting	filtering
and we can provide facility like sorting just like a explorer filtering column re-ordering etc

7537764

is there a way to use either redcarpet or bluecloth such that when it interpolates the markdown it won t make any headers

7537765
range	max
the first textfield max range is 7

7537771
width	height
i fixed camera width and height

7537785
superclass	subclassing
to say that another way this idiom allows a superclass such as an abstract factory to define methods whose argument types and return types are in terms of the subclassing type not the superclass type

7537802
range	max
the first textfield max range is 7

7537853
fadein	fadeout	src	attr
at first we set the display property to none via javascript so customers without would just see the image after the fadein we fadeout our image and change the image src with the attr function

7537865
width	height
you had fixed the height and width of the imageview

7537883
put	get
you should put it in an input type value and then in the server - use request id to get the val

7537918
keydown	keyup
how can i keydown keep turn left walking when keyup stop walking like a character

7537959
outputstream	inputstream
now given that unless there is some way to somehow coerce an inputstream into a file suggests that there is not and i have tried looking around the java documentation as well this approach won t work if the reader on the other end of the outputstream receives that avro container file i m not sure why they allowed one to output avro binary container files to an arbitrary outputstream without providing a way to read them from the corresponding inputstream on the other end but that s beside the point

7538000
cruisecontrol	jenkins
you can use cruisecontrol similiar to jenkins

7538000
jobs	cron
but if you are running just a script you can have it executed with periodically with windows schedular or cron jobs

7538144
width	height
other thing i noticed is that you gave the textview the width and height as wrap content which will only take the size of the text

7538185
google-chrome	firefox
if it s a high traffic or commercial site i d definitely consider a commercial server certificate from an acknowledged ca since using a self-signed certificate will generate those ugly red errors you might see in google-chrome or firefox sometimes

7538191
accessor	properties
if you specify nonatomic a synthesized accessor for an object properties simply returns the value directly

7538207
int	chars
the original number length is about 10 chars which seem to be bigger then php s limits for int

7538222
rss	feed
i have a drupal site and i want to add to the rss feed a view count

7538270
children	parent
with clipping enabled children of a node should be clipped when leaving the area of the parent s bounding box

7538270

now my question is how to change default folder so i can pull repo and commit push directly from my wamp

7538434
pull	push
i have web application that have to access local resources files folders to be able to do git clone pull push

7538448
int	chars
if there are added two unsigned chars variables there should be overflow result should be 3 and then it should convert from unsigned chars 3 to int 3

7538482
rss	feed
the trick is to treat the loading of the rss feed like what they are asynchronous events

7538513
width	margin
the w3c specification says that the width of a box is margin + border + padding + width

7538530
qpainter	qimage	qtcore	qtgui
although qimage is in qtcore qpainter and the text drawing routines are in qtgui

7538547
width	height
i have a price start point of â 15 this would relate to the minimum width and height 100 x 50

7538547
width	height
the records already exist for each width and height permitation

7538550
spaces	delimiter
this dynamic column c would obviously have to be a read-only field because there is no way to determine if a spaces is a delimiter or a regular character

7538579
int	chars
for example for types smaller than int if two types chars and short int are added they are promoted to int before any arithmetic operation and result is an int type

7538579
unsigned	short
â 4.5 1 - an rvalue of type char signed char unsigned char short

7538579

7538676
vim	emacs
write a filter or do it with emacs vim or your favorite editor to substitute the call report var1 to a statement that pushes the hash into an array something like push all_hashes

7538686
vim	emacs
emacs and vim can do what you want

7538692
stdout	fflush
stdout is normally line-buffered that means that the buffer is fflush to the device when it sees a n

7538692
stdout	fflush
you could as well call fflush stdout but it is cumbersome

7538692
put	get
the morale of the story is when you printf for debugging purposes always put a n at the end of every line or you can get partial mixed contents

7538701
super	extends
i always don t call super when i extends sprite

7538701
super	extends
till now i don t have any problem and i have never seen code which call super in constructor which class extends sprite

7538703
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
i can retrieve the qgraphicsscene size perfectly fine namely 2100x2970 like i set however the geometry of the qgraphicsview widget is incorrect

7538703
width	height
but the widget showing the scrollbars and the scene through the viewport just doesn t provide me with the correct widget width and height

7538703
qgraphicsview	qwidget
in the qtdesigner the qgraphicsview widget shows to have qwidget geometry of 1126x643

7538834
centos	linux
basically its only for linux centos 5 platforms

7538840
post	get
therefore there are no cookies get variables post variables or anything of the sort

7538863
vim	emacs
on unix emacs and vim are really the only games in town when it comes to sophisticated command-line editors so a good java mode for one of those is what you want

7538879
udp	tcp
i m used in deploying console base application that acts as a stand alone application a mixed of tcp and udp servers with custom protocol

7538879
udp	tcp
now my application will not just support a custom tcp udp server inside but also web functionality for management

7538919
versioning	upgrade
i recently 5 or 6 months ago had to upgrade to versioning 5.x and did so without any problems

7538988
pull	push
one of many clients who have random pull addresses push a request to a server at 5555

7538988
pull	push
i assume that the push pull architecture is suited for this

7538988
pull	push
so how do i setup something like a timeout in the push pull model

7539040
int	boolean
int and decimal numbers boolean values should be managed

7539047
innodb	myisam
all previous benchmarks had a fatal flaw that one the char 1 table was myisam and all other were innodb

7539053
int	chars
int are much faster than doing string comparison but i think your better of using chars m or f

7539067
kryo	avro
one piece of advice - make sure you use a really good binary serialization library avro protocol buffers kryo etc. couple with a decent communications framework netty

7539149
cvs	svn
the idea of a revision like you d have with svn or cvs doesn t map all that well in git

7539199
fadein	fadeout
i want the welcome message to fadeout slowly and then the other div to fadein its place and then fadeout - obviously when the welcome box no longer exists

7539202
puts	gets
instead of worrying about the newline at the end of the file it puts the newline before the line to be printed except for the first line which gets handled outside the for-loop

7539208
vim	emacs
both vim and emacs will read â œeditor hintsâ in the file text usually embedded in a comment that contains commands or settings for the editor to obey when opening the file

7539208
vim	emacs
for hints that will work with both emacs and vim place a comment block at the end of the file

7539218
versioning	upgrade
after a lot of trial and error and pulling of hair i upgrade to the latest versioning 3-8-7-rc1 and tried again this does work but isn t ideal for all instances occasions

7539234
fadein	fadeout
you need to call the additional fadein and fadeout inside of a callback function to the first one

7539276
rss	feed
to actually read the channel i think you can use either the rss feed for your channel or the youtube data api and parse this than let the user choose the sperate videos

7539294
screens	tablet	screens	mdpi	tablet	mdpi
the reason those two really high resolutions exist in mdpi is because they are only used on tablet which have a larger screens size...so the dpi rating works out to still be in the midrange

7539337
inherited	properties
for example if i have the customers table the wizard will create â œcustomersrowâ class that inherited from global.system.data.datarow with the corresponding fields as properties

7539362
namenode	hdfs
hdfs-site.xml has configuration settings for hdfs daemons the namenode the secondary namenode and the datanodes.

7539366
bmp	png
at first i thought it might be a file name collision as earlier releases had p as a bmp and release where this started i changed it to a png but i made sure to delete pl.bmp before build and subsequently renamed it to pl so there is no way even if the old p files both .bmp and .png were somehow on the device it would not possibly collide but this doesn t seem to be the problem

7539369
portrait	landscape
i can successfully start my device on landscape mode but my framebuffer stays on portrait mode no matter how i rotate it or force its rotation

7539386
implements	extends
i had to work around this problem as well my solution was to implements an adapterview by myself to emulate the gridview behevior without extends scrollview

7539414
post	get
i was planning on using ajax post to info to ci but so far unable to get it to work

7539626
min	max
tell me if i m wrong but you re not look at the case max a i min

7539626
min	max
in decreasing order or increasing order it might works but it s pretty useless since for a sorted list you can find min and max with this espression

7539658
google-chrome	firefox
i ve researched around this subject for quite some time but i can t find out which method or code is causing me problems with ie7 and ie8 - it works fine in ie9 google-chrome and firefox

min	max
i need reflections on my implementations of the c++11 variadic versions of std min std max

7539857
min	max
here are my two alternatives for std min where std max is implemented analogously by just replacing std min with std max

stateless	stateful
when we need to use the ejb services in a managed bean we just add a stateless stateful or singleton annotation

7539892
jboss	glassfish
glassfish or jboss if you only need cdi services you need a servlet container e.g tomcat plus cdi libraries

django-tinymce	django-filebrowser
i am trying to integrate django-tinymce with django-filebrowser for my

7540173
ssl	https
you should be using off-the-shelf tools like ssl https whatever to solve this problem rather than doing it wrong yourself

7540194
ati	nvidia
i could also imagine that it depends on whether the two gpus are controlled by the same driver or not or even worse let the machine have an ati as well as an nvidia card both supporting different gl versions

7540201
rss	feed
to show the latest articles from the blog you could fetch the rss feed of the wordpress installation and display it in your rails application

7540433
try-catch	exception-handling
i figured that the try-catch block around the external plugin loading procedure would suffice but obviously it doesn t since after catching the first exception-handling the finalizer is still invoked on the gc thread which finally crashes the application

margin	text-align
use text-align padding margin float clear and positioning rules to get your html elements to appear where you want them to on the page

7540477
put	get
for state objects so that all created states get put in the

7540496
getter	setter
idrawntext would only expose getter but not setter but its documentation would explicitly state that objects implementing idrawntext may or may not be mutable via other means

7540498
put	get
one option is to create an httpmodule and put your code in there since it would get to the page requests before the actual page starts processing

7540509
textmate	aptana	komodo	aptana	webstorm	aptana
note that you can accomplish the same things as aptana generally-spekaing using webstorm komodo netbeans textmate or any old text editor -- just depends on what ide-specific features you find helpful or not

7540710
int	double
for example how many times hasn t algorithms such std sort applied on been instantiated and optimized and compiled in different programs using the same type t typically int float and double

7540756
int	double
the problem is most probably that globals- var is a float or double convert it to an int or some other integer-type and it should work

7540781
folder	directory
anyway the question is when i publish my asp.net website it creates the publish folder and publishes files such as web.config and the images directory

int	chars
what i want is a simple program which reads in 3 chars or uint8_t s stores them into one big int and then reads it out later again

7540973

7541266
rss	feed
my requirement is to populate the calendar with events from different websites which publish an rss feed of their events

7541266
rss	feed
the problem lies in the fact that the rss feed from different websites are not consistent with each other

7541272
button	checkbox
as a solution i thought to use adorner for that user control mypopup the problem is my user control mypopup contains button and checkbox after applying adorner these controls are not accessible

7541300
uiview	uiwindow
uiwindow inherits from uiview

7541300
uiview	subviews
uiview has the subviews property

7541324
cpython	pypy
as you suggest in your update your problem was that you were using py.py which is for running pypy s interpreter on top of cpython

7541324
cpython	pypy
pypy has a higher recursion limit than cpython normally

7541373
range	min	range	max	min	max
the usual approach i use for this generate n unique random numbers is to fill a vector with the total range of numbers for you here min - max random_shuffle that and then just pull as many values as i need from the front that

7541377
put	get
however if i put it on highscoreviewcontroller.h i must put the implementation in choosecharacter.m or i get

7541378
implements	modifiers
however in c++ i could implements a better encapsulation when passing objects to methods with const modifiers

7541382
bmp	png
in example i send only formula from server and client creates image based on it which i can use as jpg png bmp background and do repeating etc

7541386
glfw	freeglut
the two cross-platform libraries that do the least other than creating opengl windows are freeglut and glfw

7541386
glfw	freeglut
freeglut has about a 5.2mb distribution after unzipping while glfw has a 2.6mb distro

7541415
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to create an array of type int of length 10 6 in c++ dev c++ which i used to create comfortably on my last laptop 32 bit windows 7 ultimate ubuntu linux 2gb ram and every other environment i have programmed on it should take around 3.5 mb of ram

7541423
inherited	subclassing
in you can actually auto-register the subclassing with an inherited callback

7541429
int	chars
you can convert your chars to its int equivalent by subtracting 0 from it

7541440
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
you generalize the wrong way from the specific debian ubuntu to the generic all linux distros

7541465
onclick	onfocus	onclick	onscroll
you need to check all event handling attributes - not just onclick but everything onfocus onload even onerror and onscroll can be hacked

7541470
mouseup	mousedown
for a click event to occur it must always follow this series of events in the order of occurrence mousedown event then mouseup

7541470
mouseup	mousedown
any number of other mouse events can occur at any time between the mousedown or mouseup events

7541502

loops	if-statement
besides the two reads inside your loops i assume you want to have a block after your if-statement

7541628
getter	setter
i want my facade to have url getter and setter

7541660
puts	gets
my problem is that when the snakes body gets put up in the gui it puts it directly on top of the head instead of 12 spaces behind it

7541722
getter	setter
the are essentially methods a getter and a setter that pass through the value

7541737
width	height
so in order for the size of the views to be determined in a way that is completely proportional to the size of their parent and thus to each other as well you must also set their height or width for a horizontal linearlayout to 0

7541737
width	height
in this case the left-over space is in fact the entire height width of the linearlayout which is then divvied up proportionally among the children based on their relative weights

7541768
fink	homebrew
maybe homebrew or fink also have gcc and the like included

7541844
shadowing	named
i believe the reasoning behind it is that it allows the parameters to be named nicer by preventing shadowing of member variables

7541851
jlist	jtable
currently i have a jtable jlist and a jbutton

7541851
awt	swing
after reading up on swing a bit i assumed it was due to my editing the table model from a thread that was not the awt dispatch thread and promptly put the lines that edit the table model in a swingutilities.invokelater runnable block

7541882
wtl	atl
i ve seen many wrappers for the windows api mfc atl wtl etc. but none of them seem to use exception-handling -- you still have to check the error codes for most functions which is easy to forget or to omit due to laziness

7541938
post	get
i wish to rewrite a mysql query which use month and year functions to display all the post from a certain month which goes to my function as a y-m-d parameter format but i don t know how can i get the last day of the given month date

7541943
folder	directory
i guess this is a beginner s problem but i was trying to check if a directory exists in my documents folder on the iphone

7542007
mvp	presenter
if you re using winforms take a look at the mvp model view presenter pattern which helps separate code related to data business logic and user interface

7542042
for-loop	loops
to prevent it facebook adds the for-loop code to the front of the string so that if you try to eval it you just get an infinite loops and a hung browser

7542044
domxpath	domdocument
you should highly consider using domdocument and domxpath to parse your document instead of regular expressions

7542044
domxpath	domdocument
domdocument domxpath example

7542051
srp	principles
i am trying to learn the single responsibility principles srp but it is being quite difficult as i am having a huge difficult to figure out when and what i should remove from one class and where i should put organize it

7542073
accessor	properties
you should then always use accessor for all properties whether they are public or private except in init and dealloc

7542110
background-image	box-shadow
you could do something sneaky like making a gradient the background-image of an element that s behind the one you re setting this box-shadow on which you could use make it appear like the shadow is darker on one side

7542124

octal	decimal
600 octal eqals 384 decimal

7542218
button	checkbox
i was thinking of trying to change the text on one button group to strings like one two etc but that introduces a bigger problem with how i have created the checkbox in the first place

7542233
octal	decimal
open expects you to give it a value for the mode in octal not decimal this is why you basically always see an extra leading zero when dealing with modes in c code since in c you write an octal literal with a leading zero

7542233
octal	decimal
600 in decimal is 1130 in octal

7542235
tcpclient	networkstream
i am sure it is not too complicated to write one myself but presence of the timeout properties on both tcpclient and networkstream kinda suggests it should be already working that way

7542251
serializable	deserialization
it is generally slow to do a serializable deserialization

7542255
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
use jradiobutton for this rather than jcheckbox since i think it is gui standard to have a set of jradiobutton that only allow one selection rather than a set of jcheckbox

7542293
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately this screws up the padding of my width 100 div in the latests versions of safari firefox and google-chrome probably all browsers too

7542317
box-sizing	border-box
add box-sizing border-box

7542326
superclass	subclassing
but class clusters are different than factory method in that the superclass knows about all the subclassing and it is the superclass that callers interact with

7542333
margin	height
the padding and negative margin seem to cancel each other out rendering the proper height as long as the data content inside the divs doesn t spill over the 500px limit pretty nifty but it obviously has a huge limitation as is

7542410
unsigned	short
see also convert a vector unsigned char to vector unsigned short

7542438
hash	md5
i keep an array of md5 hash of intermediate expression

7542438
yacc	bison
for other languages our old friends lex yacc or the newer bison might be of help

however i have a specific page on my site that i want to render in a standards compliant way in firefox google-chrome opera and safari but due to a very annoying issue involving zoom levels in the microsoft ssrs report viewer 10.0.0.0 control see here for a more complete description i need to render the page in compatibility view mode in ie9

7542500
width	height
follwing post explains what you can do to fit text in a div with certain width and height

7542525

7542788
oncreate	onstart
once the user has exited your application and re-enters or presses the icon on the homescreen oncreate followed by onstart and onresume will be called for your first activity so you do not need any logic in onrestart your code in oncreate will do the setting up for you as it did the first time

7542788
onstart	ondestroy
onrestart is only called when the application goes from the stopped state onstop has been called but not ondestroy to the started state onstart is called but onresume has not yet

i m trying to combine about 45 png files to make a gif or to make a video or some type of movie or animated image

7542838
calloc	malloc
what you can do is declare the variable as a pointer instead of an array the use malloc or calloc to allocate space for the array and store the result in your variable

7542838
calloc	malloc
i used calloc instead of malloc here because a static array would be filled with 0s by default and this would ensure that the code was consistent

7542920
octal	decimal	octal	binary
i m making a table with decimal binary octal and hexadecimal columns

7542922
hide	show
or maybe is there any other way to do what i need show element 1 wait hide element1 wait show element 2 wait hide element 2 wait restart

7542969

you want to use visibility not display to hide and show because visibility maintains the allocated space of the cell

7542972
jython	pypy
other implementation of python such as jython or pypy may behave differently i m less clear on their details

7543021

7543024
gson	jackson
for parsing json like this twitter api users show response i ve been using jackson and gson java libraries as candidates to do this work

7543024
gson	jackson
i m only interested in a small subset of properties of the json so gson was nice because of its very concise syntax but i m losing an internal battle to continue to use gson as jackson is already used elsewhere in our application and it has documented better performance which i concede are both good reasons to lose gson

7543027
implements	extends
public class ringtones extends activity implements onclicklistener

7543036
uiview	uiwindow
every video tutorial and book i have read displays the following code to add a uiview to the uiwindow

7543036
uiview	uiwindow
my understanding of the above code is that a view which is an instance of a uiview is added to the window which is an instance of uiwindow

7543036
uiview	uiwindow
however somebody kindly pointed out to me that uiwindow inherits addsubview method from uiview

7543036
uiview	uiwindow
if uiwindow inherits the addsubview method of uiview then how can it go back up the inheritance tree

7543082

7543164
hash	md5
i always just hash the file using md5 or sha1 and use that as a filename

7543178
int	chars	int	double	int	boolean
an important thing to understand is that java does not explicitly specify pointers - rather whenever a non-primitive not chars byte int double float long boolean short is passed to a function it is passed as a reference

7543178
for-loop	loops
you can t just loops through with a for-loop for all of them because then the last one s next would throw an indexoutofboundsexception

7543194
capitalize	capitalization	punctuation	words
so effectively what this does is capitalize each words in the string and each blank string and lonely bit of punctuation too but again that s not important -- capitalization doesn t change characters that have no concept of case

7543205
uiview	uiwindow
just remember a uiwindow is simply a uiview with additional behaviors and data

7543207
post	get
i will post my upstart script below which is basically the same as from the website above with some path changes but when i run start jobname i just get an error start unknown job jobname

7543212
put	get
i believe you are supposed to just use the get and put methods where the get methods parameters would be the key for what you re trying to get and the put method s parameter would just be the entity you created s object

7543224
teamcity	dotcover
jetbrains teamcity has a free version that includes their dotcover technology as well as an mspec runner

7543630
free	malloc
when i run valgrind i see that the memory i malloc ed for my ini strings is not free

7543640

16-bit	64bit
in the book i ve learned that a nibble 4 bits 8 bits 1 byte next is a word - which is usually in groups 8 bits 16-bit 32 bits or 64bit so on and all this makes perfect sense to me

7543783
freebsd	opensolaris	freebsd	linux
the linux wacom project s source code has also been ported to other open-source operating systems such as opensolaris and freebsd

7543832
children	parent
if you don t reset the pointer to the constructor the all the children will report that the parent object is their constructor

7543900
post	get
you can handle it by server-side scripting when javascript is disabled you must do works by post get requests so you have to recode your web application

7544011
implements	extends
i first tried extends defaultdirectededge but then getedgetarget stopped working - probably because i need to implements start end vertices

7544045
rss	feed
i am making an app that will load stories from rss feed and store them locally in documents folder so they would be available offline

7544060

as it returns a character meaning if i use malloc a free would have to be used within another function

7544417
gwt	dwr
now gwt is not a straight out replacement for dwr

7544417
gwt	dwr
however if it s not and you d like to use gwt in a fashion more similar to dwr you can have your javascript code functions and your gwt java classes and you can call js functions from java via gwt s jsni api

7544425
mef	prism
so mef is not the same thing as prism

7544425
mef	prism

we have customized ribbon js scripts that loads properly in ie and firefox but in google-chrome which is a requirement to use it due to its high response time it does not load the ribbon at the first instance

7544621
try-catch	exception-handling
your idea about how the try-catch works is correct when an exception-handling is thrown inside the try-block all the remaining code in it is skipped and it jumps directly into the catch-block

7544646
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
then objectinputstream or objectoutputstream to readobject or writeobject

7544759
google-chrome	firefox
i tried in firefox and google-chrome same results -- but it could be the browser acting up of course

7544768

7544902
inherited	properties
when deriving from a base class the derived class inherited all except private methods properties and fields of the base class

7544902
inherited	properties
nested classes don t inherited anything but have access to everything in the containing class - even private fields properties and methods

7544913
public	protected
inheriting from a parent class does not allow a nested class to see its parent s private members and methods only protected and public ones

7544921
width	height
i could scale it down but that would be quite unprecise since width and height need different scaling which is hardly possible

7544962
couchbase	couchdb
so far the unql participants include sqlite couchdb and probably also couchbase but i think as time will go on and the specification will take it s form more vendors would join the effort to participate and support this unified querying language

is there an easy way to do this so my index.html will send from local and all other get post put delete request go to xyz.net apiendpoint

7545345

7545345
fadein	fadeout
all you need to do is change the two functions to use jquery fadein and fadeout like so

7545345

the proper way would be to rework the code and use mouseenter and mouseleave on the thubmnail elements

7545379

google-chrome	firefox
its working in firefox latest version + google-chrome but not working in ie 9

7545642
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
what backbone.js does so do several other javascriptmvc implementations is that it provides a means of organizing the code into a modular pattern known as mvc pattern which is all about separating your code into three loosely coupled layers

7546062
hash	md5
so the migration will be spread over time some passwords will be hash with md5 other with sha-256

7546062
hash	md5
if it matches then the password is good and since the password is known by the app at that time the app also hash the password with sha-256 and replaces the md5 hash with the sha-256 hash in the database

7546062
hash	md5
you need to be able to distinguish a md5 hash from a sha-256 hash which is easy since they have distinct sizes 16 bytes for md5 32 bytes for sha-256

7546062
hash	md5
please note that hashing passwords with a raw single application of a hash function is a pretty lousy way of doing it security-wise and replacing md5 with sha-256 will not really improve things

7546062
hash	salt
to really prevent the attacker from guessing the passwords you also need salt per-password random data stored alongside the hash password and a suitably slow hash function thousands possibly millions of nested hash function invocations

7546102
getter	setter
but if our ui components swing is in another package and beans are in another package we have to instantiate those beans in our components jframe or jpanel with getter and setter

7546269
x86	64bit
if you have problems getting the application to start due to unsatisfiedlinkerror and you are using a msvc2008 build then try installing the microsoft visual c++ 2008 sp1 redistributable package x86 note there is also a 64bit version of this as well this link is for the 32bit version which is relevant to using 32bit qtjambi on a 32bit jvm if you also want the 64bit version search for the same page with x64 in the title instead of x86 on the microsoft website

7546709
int	double
or more likely as lindydancer points out the float bits may be passed in the right place for an int but because they are first promoted to a double representation by extending with zeros there are 0s where printf expects the first int to be.

7546846
stdout	stderr
there are some pitfalls sigpipe will be sent to the parent if it reads on a pipe with no active writers and using up an fd other than stdin stdout stderr in a child process may confuse some badly-written child processes though close-on-exec can help fix that

7546858
codeigniter	cakephp

7547054
google-chrome	firefox
i tweaked the headers so google-chrome knew to only allow the proper domains but firefox disallows cross-domain on xhr regardless

7547054
google-chrome	firefox
this was fixed by simply switching to gm_xmlhttprequest instead which allows cross-domain in firefox and thankfully which google-chrome also supports

7547078

google-chrome	safari
no such problem exists in any ie7 ff3.6 google-chrome 16 or safari

cut doesn t seem to treat consecutive spaces as one delimiter

7547519

7547545
width	height
make sure that your wrapper doesn t have a height or width set and put the clearfix on container_12 or container_16 and it should expand all the way down

7547550
rubygems	rvm
if you re using rvm you can change the version of rubygems with the following command

7547738
portrait	landscape
this is a warning to anyone trying to implement landscape and portrait with two views in a single xib ios 4 with xcode 4

7547738
portrait	landscape
so for example if you have a xib with a view for landscape and a view for portrait and both views contain the same interface objects in different positions such as a uilabel in landscape and a uilabel in portrait

7547738
portrait	landscape
it is not possible to link the uilabel in your portrait view and the uilabel object in the landscape view to a single uilabel object in the view controller at the same time

7547738
portrait	landscape	switching	screens
i find this a disappointment as the ios uiviewcontroller documentation ios 4.3 suggested that i could implement custom landscape and portrait views by switching between two views programmatically as the screens rotates

7547738
portrait	landscape
in my code every time i update the landscape outlet i also update the portrait landscape

7547780

cvs	svn
i have never used cvs in my life only git svn - can anyone tell me how in the world i can get the source jar of this bundle to my local ubuntu box

7547843
min	max
just wanted to hone in on the fact that an index full scan min max is simply not the same as an index full scan

7547843
range	min	range	max	min	max
however an index full scan min max or index range scan min max only gets the smallest or largest leaf block from the range but can only be employed as long as the column is not null which is a bit silly and really a bug since a null value is by definition neither the smallest nor largest value

7547843
min	max
the min max optimization is an implicit first_rows action and doesn t need the where .

7547843
min	max
interestingly the min max optimization is normally not considered by the cbo for function-based indexes that s another little bug

7547886
post	get
so you are setting up your post params with an arraylist and you can get the responce from the server if you logged in via httpresponse .and another thing i m setting up the username and password in the code because it is just to how you the idea.if you have any questions feel free to ask

php works at server-side and you have to use post get requests

7547982
for-loop	arrays
then you can easily use rows as an arrays and can step in a for-loop until count rows -1

7547987
width	height
it depends on your situation and isn t always possible but if you could manage to get the links to be display block display inline-block or position absolute you would be able to explicitly set their width and height

7547991
width	height
i have a container rectangle and element rectangle both are specified only in height and width

7548035
put	get
however when the function is called again to put the cell back in its original position which is the else part i get no animation

7548127
post	get
this is what i did for get it should work for post too

7548183
move	drag
i would keep the nodes in a table you can assign a default position in the 2d grid from there based on the level they have but from there it will need some human input possibly drag drop system which move the nodes to different positions in the grid do crud actions

7548196
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

i have just made a phonegap application that parses an external rss feed using jfeed

7548368

7548370
folder	directory
download the source code and book.h will be under the common directory folder

7548372
innodb	myisam
insurance if myisam fails you you can move directly to innodb tables

7548407
width	font-size
i was initially hoping that a value of -0.25 would be sufficient -- ie a quarter of a character on each side would reduce the width of each character by half which would be what we want because the first letter is font-size 2em so it s twice as big

7548428
paypal	recurly
people tend to mention amazon s google s and paypal s payment service but recently i came across services like chargify and recurly

7548441
folder	directory

7548442
disk	ram
so especially if you have lots of writes or limited disk space and or ram your best bet is to just use one multi-column index on a b

7548451
folder	directory
if you mean that you want code in package foo.bar without having a matching directory folder of foo bar under some source root - no i don t think eclipse supports that

7548458

ram is much faster then disk io

7548499
jar	manifest.mf
ex jar cmf manifest.mf archery.jar system library java extensions objectdraw.jar

7548503
queue	fifo
treat the memory buffer as a fifo queue and use a mutex to protect the queue pointers

7548506
post	get
what you can do to get around this is use an executorservice and post futuretasks on it

7548561
soundpool	audiotrack
or since api level 9 you can assign a session id to audiotrack which should allow you to play audio tracks with soundpool if i understand correctly and then you would ideally want to create static audiotracks

7548564
printf	strtod	printf	atof	atof	strtod
is there any alternative to atof strtod lexical_cast stringstream or printf

7548564
atof	strtod
atof and strtod is c function and they are not returning nan upon failure i prefer working on std string so i just asking if anyone already writing some wrapper to std string that i can use if you don t mind

7548568
getter	setter
in java when writing a getter setter would it be better to refer to the instance variable with this or access it directly

this works on the mac using safari and firefox and on windows using firefox but does not work with windows on ie8

7548579
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
win7 all works fine on several browsers google-chrome firefox ie safari

7548751
children	parent
now your tables contain the distinct parent and children as well as their old ids

7548751
children	parent
you have to write an update query now that assigns the new parent ids into the children table

7548789
mouseover	mouseout
you can use the mousechildren property - set it to false to prevent children generating yes generating mouse related events which in your case will rid you from unwanted mouseout events as there would be no correspoding mouseover event generated when your cursor enters a childs area

7548825

i downloaded the plugin and tested in firefox ie and google-chrome and it was working fine for me

7549074
width	height
issue 2 float the to the left since it s a block element and give it a height and width

it s good practice to give anything that is floating an height and a width so the browser knows what it s working with

7549108
folder	directory
note that on windows applications don t write settings files directly in the home directory there is the appdata user specific folder where these files typically go

7549135
fflush	gets
the reason for this is i want to archive the rdb files my data gets fflush out every day

7549325
google-chrome	firefox
on ie9 firefox and google-chrome my dropdown lists look great

7549345
soundpool	audiotrack
as of api level 9 gingerbread i can apply a session id to an audiotrack which i believe would let me play it with soundpool which should make the playing of multiple audiotracks at once much smoother

7549375
width	height
if you do it the other way around then the only rectangle getting cleared is the square from 0 0 to width of ball height of ball

7549380
width	height
i tried making anchor-image width 100 height 100 and playing with its z-index i still have to interact with the images on the page for other reasons

7549392
superclass	subclassing
we map the subclassing to the superclass using p_id by creating a column in the subclassing

7549392
superclass	subclassing
instead of p_id as the mapping attribute in subclassing can we use something else belonging to the superclass which is unique but not pk

width	height
i have a fullscreen 100 width and height div that has a 60 opacity for the android browser on a z index

slider	supersized
i m using mouseover to change the slider number on the jquery supersized plugin depending on which button you rollover

7549477
slider	hoverintent	slider	supersized
i found out i could disable supersized from stopping the slider changing during the animation and i can use hoverintent to ensure that it waits enough time before changing the slider so the animations don t stack up

7549477
mouseover	mouseout
also there only seems to be a delayed timer for the mouseout and not an interval option like the mouseover

7549477
slider	hoverintent
the only way i can think of would be to create an invisible link the entire size of the browser window and run a second hoverintent function to change the slider when it rolls over this but i don t think that would be the best way

7549498
portrait	landscape
so if we re going from portrait to landscape the current orientation may still be reported as portrait it may not it depends

7549559
integer	fractions
times are also stored in a similar manner with the integer part being the date and the fractions part being the portion of the day that has passed

express	node.js
i m playing around with my first node.js express application and as every programmer knows the first thing you should build when testing out a new framework is a blog

7549644
min	max
knowing the data only covers a few years i might even use a block of memory with one int per day between min t and max t wrapping all that in a class

7549669
post	get
some of them come from get post methods which can cause potential security holes in my site service

7549752
inherited	properties
and this one will do the same except that the merged object will include copies of inherited properties

7549772
children	parent
one good thing - you have ensured that the original file descriptors from pipe are closed in all three processes parent and both children

7549789

7549914
fgets	fread
can i still use fread to load an text file or do i read it line by line with fgets

7549943
fgets	fread
finally you can of course use fread instead of fgets

7549951
hide	show
you can also show instead of hide and you can pass a number to the function hide 200 to animate the action

7549951
hide	show
there is also the toggle effect that hide or show the element alternatively

7549951
hide	show
in my opinion using jquery show hide is a better solution at this point in time

7549960
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested on firefox 6.0.2 safari google-chrome

7550054
post	get
if i have post how do i get all unique user comments of this post

move the hide show bits into a function and call the function both in the click handler and in an initialize function

post	get
i want to pick 3 or 4 important keywords from the post title and get a relevant image from google images

7550428
children	parent
can causes double deletion if you don t respectively delete declare them in the right order children then parent for deletion or parent then children for declaration

7550435

approach 1 the idea is to initially hide the contents of the tab then show the corresponding one when a tab is clicked

7550455
button	checkbox
i have got this group of checkbox that behave like radio button

7550482
consistency	acid
for which kind of applications it is ok to have eventual consistency instead of acid and for which ones it isn t

7550483
int	double
since you give a double as the argument the compiler does not have an exact fit so it tries to convert the double to a type that abs accepts but it does not know if it should try to convert it to int long or long long hence it s ambiguous

given that i don t know the width or height of your image file or it s target masking you ll have to do some substantial edits to this code

7554943
division	multiplication
note that the speed of multiplication and division is not really relevant here

7554943
division	multiplication
moreover since these are exact powers of two there are direct ways to produce the result without doing either multiplication or division using the fact that floating-point uses a binary encoding

7554996
int	chars
please read following expalination for signed chars then we will talk about signed unsigned int

7554996

7555393
getter	setter
if you just want to share a single setting across all instances you can have a static field that is accessed by a non-static setter and getter

see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all key comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two keys that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the set equals

7558496
equals	compareto
objects with correct equals hashcode implementations were being added and never seen again as the compareto implementation was inconsistent with equals

junit	mockito	junit	easymock	mockito	easymock
easymock and mockito work well with junit to provide mocking functionality so you can test components in isolation

7558513
junit	jmock
i would use junit and possibly a mocking library like jmock

7558525
rss	feed
i m looking for a feedburner plugin for wordpress that redirects feed to feedburner but also changes the rss links that are embedded on the wordpress pages to point to feedburner

7558525
rss	feed
the plugins i ve tried will redirect the rss feed but none of them change the embedded rss tags

7558525
rss	feed
so in safari for instance when you click the rss button it pulls from the wordpress feed instead of feedburner

7558537
width	height
scroll to canvas settings then set canvas width and canvas height as you wish

7558545
junit	mockito
as junit and mockito was already mentioned you can look into infinitest or junit max for autotesting

7558547
post	get
post get

7558548
junit	testng
there are 2 most popular frameworks for unit tests junit and testng

7558548
junit	cactus
junit is older and have more extensions dbunit cactus etc

7558584
junit	easymock
in addition to what has already been said junit easymock ... you may also have a look at fitnesse it may be a good tool for full integration and acceptance tests

7558595
width	height
than at first time when i want to set pixel by mouse i get window s width and height then copy window s content to memory hdc and hbitmap in store window hbitmap size equal to width height

7558597
innodb	myisam
if there are many modifications of the data it s said that innodb works faster because it uses row locking instead of table locking like myisam

7558597
innodb	myisam
if you need foreign key constraints or transactions you can only use innodb wheras if you need fulltext indexes you can only use myisam tables at the moment

7558597
innodb	myisam
for example the master could store a table as innodb which makes it fast for inserts updates and deletes while the slave s could store the same table as myisam and offer the best performance for selects

7558614
int	chars
if you want to display the ascii value of each chars you have to cast them in int just before giving them to cout

7558620
int	chars
calling int chars is returning that chars s decimal ascii value

7558637
xlwt	xlutils
the xlrd xlwt and xlutils packages mentioned above can only read and write .xls files which have size limitations of 65 000 rows and 256 columns

7558691
post	put
if you want to handle a post or put method you need to specify it by adding or as a parameter like

7558744
rubygems	bundler
as far as issues with bundler for a clean version of ruby and rubygems you ll need to gem install bundler in order to be able to bundle install

7558745
innodb	myisam
myisam uses less memory than innodb and the actual data files are often quite a bit larger for innodb

7558745
innodb	myisam
performance u can read this blog about innodb s performance against myisam and falcon

7558745
consistency	acid
innodb is a largely acid atomicity consistency isolation durability engine it supports transactions

7559066
ready	each
but it needs to process each line individually which i don t have any idea how to do currently and i don t see any way to ask the parser whether it has data ready or whatever would be the equivalent of

7559127
rss	feed
handle the matching in the controller that outputs the rss feed

7559138
pull	push
i hope i can install a shared repository on that server and every one can do push pull etc

7559138
pull	push
1 since we use a shared environment does it mean that i need to install mercurial on only the server and that is enough for everyone to do commit push pull etc

7559152
jar	manifest.mf
a real executable jar should have at least a class with a main method and have it referenced in manifest.mf

7559167
ddms	adb
so to fix this i went to the eclipse windows - preferences - android - ddms then i set the adb connection time out to 500000 and checked thread updates enabled and checked heap updates enabled

7559168
width	height
if js is disabled i would like to show a semi-transparent white css layer displayed on top of my webpage with a width of 100 and a height of 100 with some kind words to describe the issue to my user and possibly instructions to enable js

7559234
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
for example in html element names are case-insensitive but in xml they are case-sensitive

7559272
pull	push
1 since we use a shared environment does it mean that i just need to install the mercurial on the server and it is enough for everyone to do commit push pull ..etc commands

7559273
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
you can use aspect-oriented programming aop tool like aspectj to add code to count open closed files to fileinputstream and fileoutputstream

7559288
ssl	https
the first problem about why it would work if i opened it was not because of a cookie being set per say but that accessing it that way over https made me accept the ssl security policy for amazon

7559315
superclass	subclassing
you would only need to call object.__setattr__ ... inside a class definition and then only if directly subclassing object -- if you were subclassing something else spam for example then you should either use super to get the next item in the heirarchy or call spam.__setattr__ ... -- this way you don t risk missing behavior that superclass have defined by skipping over them directly to object

7559368
fullscreen	minimized
essentially it maximizes minimized my iframe to be fullscreen

7559384
jsf	seam
the difficulty is when i deploy the app to the jboss server jboss 5.1 the deployment only gets as far as jsf and never starts the seam section

7559561
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari google-chrome ie load the https ok however firefox keeps give me an error

7559566
inherited	properties
the correct result is false because the message properties of error is inherited i think from the prototype

7559589
mouseup	mousedown
of course it didn t worked then i ve tried several variations like using mousedown mouseup using clickat location element with css css embed - but still no luck

7559597
for-loop	loops
check that your for-loop really loops over what you think you loops

7559601
range	min	range	max	min	max
now each property will have a default value a range with a min and a max a name suitable for the gui

7559617
google-chrome	firefox
the web developer plugin for firefox and google-chrome has a view javascript feature that shows all of the js that a page is referencing on a single page

7559619
accessor	properties
once you have a pointer to the actual delegate you are not using the accessor properly to set the vauleofedit properties

7559622
onclick	onsubmit
everything appears to function correctly except that the value for the submit button disappears onclick or onsubmit

7559634
post	put	post	get	put	get
that way you can be sure the clients will count on your methods such as get post delete head put etc

7559662
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
three arguments the jqxhr in jquery 1.4.x xmlhttprequest object a

7559673
mouseover	mouseenter
but when a mouseenter event occurs the selected menu item s style becomes that of mouseover visualstate

7559687
m2e	pom.xml
your best approach is to use m2e and import your pom.xml into eclipse

7559697
width	height
another option would be to just use animate on height and width to maximize and minimize your iframe

7559722
put	get
i m just trying to get a number from a hidden form input and plus 1 to that number and then put that value to the incremented number

7559746
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have tried using firefox google-chrome and safari and all three experience the problem

additionally on safari and google-chrome i also get the same error when i try to login with the registration plugin

7559810
hide	show
i have some chunks of text that i should show hide when user touches appropriate button

7559831
fadein	fadeout
fadein and fadeout needs a duration set like fadein slow

7559844
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter
maybe you could try to set the mouseover visualsatate of your button on the eventhandler if it event is mouseenter and reset it if it is a mouseleave event

7559868
integer	unsigned
let s say you have the ip a.b.c.d and want to match it to e.f.g.h i then you can throw the ip into one unsigned integer and do the same with

7559897
uiview	calayer
if the target is the screen on ios those vector elements will be hosted in a calayer either directly or through the backing layer of a uiview

7559904
public	protected
in that case i always strongly argue for just testing it as if the protected method would be inline in the public method

7559935
equals	gethashcode
if a custom entity at your disposal what i ve done is override the equals and gethashcode to return an identifier of the object

7559945
stdout	fflush
to fflush the standard output simply do fflush stdout

7559978
post	get
now i can just read the db and get the same data which was initially in the post array

7559996
post	get
just can t make up my mind on whether to use post or get method at my search form

7559996
post	get
my idea was to use post method where the form would be redirected to the same page so i would get a list of users filtered by search string

7559996
post	get
the post method would be a little bit more hassle but on the other hand there are advanced options within the search form about 5 checkboxes and i don t like the idea of having meesed up url bar with way too many values and i expect users not to use pagination after search session so often so the values wouldn t get to the address bar so often if post method used

7560085
children	parent
when you reach the bottom of the tree the last grandgrandgrand child finds out it s got no children left so it just returns itself normal array to its parent

7560091
union	distinct
i want to make sure that the order of the result from subquery are preserved while using union distinct

7560091
union	distinct
please note that union distinct is required to filter on duplicates while doing the union

7560091
union	distinct
i am assuming that i cannot add another dummy column because that would make union distinct to not work

7560095
post	get
when i post a https request to experian i get an http 200 ok response but nothing more

7560124
fadein	fadeout
since your site is already using jquery look into using jquery fadein and fadeout functions

7560139
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the thing is that frame of uiviewcontroller s view changes when is beeing displayed for the first time in uitabbarcontroller

7560139
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
inside this class i create 3 uiviewcontroller a b c and than put them to viewcontrollers array of uitabbarcontroller

7560139
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i nslog the frames of uiviewcontroller a b c before adding them to the viewcontrollers array of uitabbarcontroller and the result is 0 20 320 460

googletest	gmock
i m using googletest and gmock for my c++ qt application

7560215
typedef	struct
if it helps vertexrow is a typedef for a and vertex is a struct with a valid empty constructor

7560223
nsurl	nsstring
nsurl urlforresourcepath nsstring resourcepath queryparams nsdictionary queryparams

7560225
int	chars
so to get the most efficient representation of this problem we have to encode a given int in base 94 so to speak and add 32 to any generated chars

7560225
division	modulo
in its simplest form that s basically a loop with one division and modulo

7560257
subtraction	addition
each additive expression is 1 or more multiplicative expressions joined by addition and subtraction operators

7560257
division	multiplication
each multiplicative expression is 1 or more exponential expressions joined by multiplication division and remainder operators

7560257
integer	unsigned
each atomic expression is either an arbitrary arithmetic expression enclosed in parentheses or an unsigned integer token

7560261
daemon	cron
cron is implemented via a daemon so it s always running

7560261
jobs	cron
depending on your system s shutdown order cron may actually be sent the shutdown signal fairly late in the shutdown process so jobs scheduled for the moment the shutdown started may still run

7560303
google-chrome	firefox
it works on google-chrome and firefox just as you expected

7560384
ibatis	mybatis
i have been rediscovering mybatis after a long absence myself i was familiar with ibatis at one time

7560398
adplus	cdb
in general adplus is merely a vb script that wraps cdb which is a console debugger

7560414
post	get
oops i m too new to post an image but i m sure you get the picture

7560431
width	height
inflater does not extract layout_width and layout_height attributes when you don t assign its parent as an argument in inflate method so try to set layoutparams with specified width and height and then call measure

7560459
hash	md5
take the username and password and validate that or its md5 hash with an sql query returning a row only when the values are found in the database

7560502
filesystems	fat	chown	chmod
warnings may be generated if the destination filesystems doesn t permit chown or chmod system calls to be made on files â for example if the destination filesystems is a fat filesystems

7560502
chown	chmod
not that it matters anyway as www-data should not be able to chown chmod a file owned by root anyway

7560505
for-loop	loops
as all paths have to return a value i have to return a value outside loops which overwrites the for-loop return how do i keep this without overwriting it after loops

7560558
maven	pom.xml
add this project as dependency in the checkstyle pmd plugin configuration in your pom.xml and it will work in maven and in jenkins hudson if you simple call the maven checkstyle pmd goal

7560567
for-loop	loops
the return in your for-loop isn t overwritten -- the method will return the value in loops if your conditions are met

7560594
equals	gethashcode
i assume that article is a reference type and is implemented with suitable equals and gethashcode methods respectively - otherwise the above would only work for equals references same object in both lists .

7560599
for-loop	loops
exceptions are a more idiomatic way of handling errors and the foreach loops is preferred to a for-loop when you re just iterating over collections

7560602
bottle	flask
i ask about the longevity of microframeworks like flask bottle and expressjs

7560605
liferay	web-inf
c glassfish3 glassfish domains liferay applications liferay-portal-6.0-ee-sp2-20110727 web-inf classes

7560672
multiplying	subtract
then when you get it just subtract divide and multiplying by 100 and you ll have the percent you re looking for

7560676
post	get
if you store something into tempdata in your get action and then render a view an ajax request for example from this view would kill the tempdata and you won t get the values back on your post request

7560698
submit	submission
just submit the new binary but remember it will replace the original submission it will go to the end of the queue and it will wait for review as before

7560715
post	get
in controller imagescontroller i have crop action get and post

7560735
converter	multibinding
as noted earlier consider converter or multibinding for various values instead

7560745
post	get
the http get post mechanic creates obvious composition roots at which to invoke the di container

7560754
sorting	filtering
my idea is that the cafes table will contain a comma separated list of the attribute names like human legible for easy display with minimal db calls and then also have the option table for filtering and sorting queries

7560759
post	get
as far as post is concerned forget about it using the location property tat works only with get requests

7560768
width	height
you can manually calculate visible width and height of the image by using its drawable s getintrinsicheight and getintrinsicwidth and then set image s scaletype to fit_xy this saves image s ratio and also makes its size correct while fit_center does not

7560778
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to work in google-chrome but not in firefox

7560803
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest non-beta versioning of xcode 4.1 as i type this

7560852
int	chars
the problem occurs when you try to convert back to chars from int

7560859
next	except
to get the full effect of the median of three it s also important to sort those three items not just use the median as the pivot -- this doesn t affect what s chosen as the pivot in the current iteration but can will affect what s used as the pivot in the next recursive call which helps to limit the bad behavior for a few initial orderings one that turns out to be particularly bad in many cases is an array that s sorted except for having the smallest element at the high end of the array or largest element at the low end

7560859
prng	random
in a case like this you could use a truly random seed or you could include your own prng instead of using rand -- or you use use median of three which also has the other advantages mentioned

7560887
width	height
if the original poster wants vertical and center alignment its quite easy for fixed width and height of the button try the following

7560888
width	height
update if op is looking for horizontal and vertical centre this answer will do it for a fixed width height element

7560898
int	double
but this is not guaranteed to make the conversions function correctly because a double can easily represent the entire 32-bit int range without loss of precision but the same is not true for a 64-bit int

7560907
google-chrome	firefox
i am curious as to why my ajax-call is failing in google-chrome it works perfectly fine in firefox

7560907
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox but in google-chrome it doesn t even alert anything so it doesn t even get into readystate 1 which is when you send it -- that seems rather odd

7560917
nhibernate	automapper
i m having trouble getting the fluent nhibernate automapper to create what i want

7560925
objectdatasource	formview
i m trying to do so using a formview and an objectdatasource with a specified type

7560959
post	get
is it via post or get

7560959
post	get
my best guess is that you re sending a get request and the api requires a post

7560975
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome safari and firefox all do what s expected which is repost the request to the new location and then process the response

7560975
post	put
i find it hard to believe that put and delete would work but post wouldn t

7560983
int	double
converting a pointer to an int is one thing as long as the int is large enough you can get away with it but a double is a floating point number - what you are doing simply doesn t make any sense because a double is not necessarily capable of representing any random number

7560993
int	double
conversions from 64-bit int to double can be lossy

7560993
int	double
a double has 53-bits of actual precision so int above 2 52 give or take an extra 2 will not necessarily be represented precisely

7560999
flip	slide
what i would really like is for the status bar to curl-up with the initialization screen if i am using curl-up or flip if i am using flip to reveal the full screen but i will settle for the status bar to slide up during the 1.0 second interval that the initialization screen is curling up

7561011
int	double
but you re converting from a pointer to an int which is permitted but implementation-defined and then from an int to a double which is permitted and meaningful for meaningful numeric values -- but converted pointer values are not numerically meaningful

7561032
hide	show
you can generalize this further of course but the idea is that whenever you switch tabs you just toggle a method to hide everything that s visible and then the deferred makes sure this happens in the right order show the one thing that s not

7561047
int	chars
dos int 08h reads a chars from stdin and does not echo it

7561047
int	chars
if you want to echo the chars call int 01h

7561048
octal	hex
be careful with user input due to the 0x hex and 0 octal prefix options

7561207
post	get
solr supports searching through post http requests instead of get requests which will allow you to have a much bigger query

7561213
atoi	strtod	atoi	atof	atof	strtod	strtol	strtod	strtol	atoi	strtol	atof
atoi atof strtol strtod

7561406
google-chrome	firefox
if you open the error console in your browser google for a howto or use a tool like firebug firefox addon or the google-chrome web inspector you ll see that there is an error when your script executes

7561410
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i can get this to work once but i m trying to set up a for-loop based on the length of my basic string storage arrays - this arrays holds in this example 6 instance name strings - each time my for-loop loops i need to run a search in my multdimensional arrays for the next consecutive instance name

7561410
for-loop	arrays
which works great if i m only searching for one elements in my arrays - but soon as i need to find multiple elements in a for-loop using their code it falls apart

7561417
pop-up	dialog
i am opening a pop-up dialog like-

7561427
ant	maven
maven and ant are very different build tools

7561427
ant	maven
in ant you write all the logic yourself whereas a standard build process is baked in with maven

7561427
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
if you understand well how maven works it is theoretically possible to take a pom.xml and generate an ant build that emulates the behaviour of the maven build

7561427
ant	maven
i m not aware of any solution which can easily convert in the other direction mainly because ant is missing maven functionality such as dependency management

7561427
ant	maven
instead of trying to convert an ant build into maven i d recommend that you keep your existing build logic and delegate the management of your classpath to the ivy or maven ant tasks

7561452
firefox	safari
we have gotten reports that the submit button sometimes doesn t do anything in firefox ie 8 and safari

7561503
mp3	wav
i am trying to decode an mp3 file to a wav file by using the processbuilder class under linux

7561517
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
use one loops for the searching in the arrays that s loops code you already have and wrap it in another for-loop which executes that searchloop

7561542
opera	firefox
well this took far longer than i care to admit and is only reliable in from my own limited testing chromium 12+ and firefox 5+ on ubuntu 11.04 it does not work in opera 11

7561542
opera	firefox
that being the case i ll show only the excerpts to cover firefox and chromium though the linked js fiddle has vendor prefixes to at least try with opera even if it fails

7561606
textview	imageview
i am curious why would i ever use button or imagebutton when textview imageview and everything else all can have onclicklisteners all can have src s and background attributes states and everything else that a button or imagebutton offers

7561622
many-to-many	one-to-many
i tend to find that pure many-to-many relationships are quite rare and there is usually a good case for introducing an intermediate entity and using two one-to-many relationships

7561636
post	get
but you still have to send some data to the server via post get ajax calls to actually track the session on the server-side

7561657
onchange	onblur
onchange is a better choice than onblur or focusout because blur and focusout also fire when the contents of the text field hasn t changed

7561675
serializable	deserialization
this is needed for serializable deserialization of the data to java objects

7561686
uitableview	uipickerview
but then a simple start to solving this would be to use a uiimageview for the picture and a uitableview uipickerview below for the options

7561686
uitableview	uipickerview
read those class references on apple s documention uitableview here and uipickerview here

7561695
sitecore	n2cms
the one feature that i m looking for is the ability to create custom types with custom fields as i can do with both sitecore and n2cms on .net and both drupal and joomla on php

7561718
uitableview	uipickerview
i would use a uiimageview as the picture and use either a uitableview uipickerview or uibuttons for the answer choices

7561797
post	get
take a look at this blog post to get the basic idea

7561834
.htaccess	httpd.conf
although defining on a per page basis is not feasible as you stated although not idea if using apache you can set the value in a .htaccess or the httpd.conf file

7561909
setinterval	settimeout

7563635
ant	maven
if you still need a classpath set up in ant use the maven ant tasks to let maven build the classpath for your ant script

7563635
ant	maven
leave any custom stuff in ant build files and invoke it using the antrun plugin from maven until and unless you convert to using a maven plugin for it

in this case i would make a wrapper class with those two attributes implement equals and maybe implement comparable and comparator delegating onto the two elements of the composite key

7570831
width	height
hello i need to get the height and width on the fly of an uploaded image

7570831
width	height
this is the php function i am using but it does not return anything for the width and height

7570839
pop-up	dialog
if that doesn t do it i think it will simply set the visible property of the label to false in code behind when you trigger the event that pop-up the dialog

7570862
srp	principles
violates single responsibility principles srp

7570885
oncreate	ondestroy
during debugging i saw that the service s ondestroy method is called directly after returning from oncreate

7570891
udp	tcp
means that every packet tcp udp etc that you send from your intern lan to internet will use as source ip the private lan ip probably 192.178.x.x instead of the public ip

7570897
libxml2	libxslt
it sounds like you might have overly old versions of libxml2 and or libxslt

7570897
libxml2	libxslt
i encountered identical problems with libxml2 2.6.26 and libxslt 1.1.17

7570902

7570917
google-chrome	safari
i have a issue specific to webkit browsers safari google-chrome on mac pc

the svgs are set to 100 width height using jquery

7570917
opera	firefox
if you open the link in firefox or opera you ll see the layout as it should work the green here is caused by margins i have deliberately set

7570964
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that in firefox the box-shadow is overlaid on top of the border in google-chrome it hides underneath

7570970
implements	extends
as you asked you want to know if it s possible to have more than one run method in a class that implements the runnable interface or extends the thread class

7570970
implements	extends
now if you read the runnable or thread api you can see that the class that extends thread class or implements the runnable class overrides in case you are extends thread class the run method or implements the abstract method run in case you are implements the runnable class

7571046
super	self
i m not sure whether it s the complete answer but one major flaw is that you re using instance variables self super in a class method + id bpmanager

7571046
superclass	subclassing
and writing that just made me realize that the problem looks like accessing a subclassing method on an object instantiated as the superclass but that should have been overwritten in the dispatch

7571095
post	get
you should be able to get the code from the website itself but if you need the code i can post it here

7571103
post	get
the answer you found with tagging all the urls using a get token or a post field is not going to work very well

7571134
int	chars
some of the bytes have their high bits set so when interpreted as signed chars and then converted to int for display they appear as negative values on account of their two s-complement representation

7571227
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it also works perfectly fine when it s sitting on the development server using google-chrome firefox safari mac and two cellphone browsers

7571247
profiling	debugging
for debugging i can say which port the jvm must listen etc since the machine i m trying to access is behind an ssh gateway so i manually create an ssh tunnel but i ve been googling about the same thing but when profiling and i couldn t seem to find

7571260
jboss	glassfish
other servers like tomcat glassfish jboss etc are open source

7571326
int	double
how come int int double doesn t work

7571363
int	double
c is a double variable but the value being assigned to it is an int value because it results from the division of two int s which gives you int division dropping the remainder

7571378
int	double
in order to use the double version which returns a double at least one of the int s must be explicitly casted to a double

7571385
int	double
when you divide two int the result will be an int irrespective of the fact that you store it in a double

7571390
pull	push
basically we used a hybrid method determining when to push or pull based on user statistics

7571394
bash	zsh
it was working fine on bash but when i installed zsh shell and oh-my-zsh then it started raising following dependency error

7571398
int	double
you re giving it two int operands so it s doing int division and then the result is being stored in a double

7571418
squash	merge
i would like to rebase so that my working tree looks like the following example by squash the last commit to the merge preserving the rest of the tree exactly the way it is

7571418
squash	merge	squash	branch
even by using the -p option when i managed to successfully squash the last commit the tree line that showed the merge of mclongnumber to the master branch was lost from the log

7571428
maven	pom.xml
here is described clearly but it seems that there is only one pom.xml file and the sample shown at there is not an multi-module maven project

7571430
division	modulo
the modulo remainder of division by n 0 is always in the range 0 n

7571431
division	modulo
since the modulo returns the remainder of division of one number by another a number divided by n will always return a number lesser than n

7571452
profiling	debugging
after several weeks of profiling and debugging traces it turned out the villain was the jit-compiling of the queries at runtime

7571477
int	double
when dividing two numbers of the same type int double etc. the result will always be of the same type so int int will always result in int

7571477
int	double
which casts the int result to a double after the calculation in which case the fractions data is already lost

7571477
int	double
division between an int and a double will result in casting the int to the double note that when doing maths the compiler will often upcast to the most specific data type this is to prevent data loss

7571481
post	get
for the object here s what i get when i click get code i m changing header links since i can t post more than 2 links on my account

7571490
google-chrome	firefox
ie8 google-chrome and firefox appear just fine

7571515
rss	feed
every time a user inputs an rss feed in a text input it will display the results in the same page since i m using an ajax on fetching the data

7571522
int	double
if you want to keep a and b as int s yet divide them fully you must cast at least one of them to double double a b or a double b or double a double b

7571522
int	double
b c is a double so it can accept an int value on assignement the int is automatically converted to double and assigned to c

7571552
versioning	upgrade
please upgrade to versioning 1.10

7571564
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox and safari it works as i expected creating the model and displaying the alert

7571640
for-loop	arrays
don t use implode here you should use a for-loop to get each value of the arrays

7571701
inherited	properties
i would recommend creating classes for each tier year month and day and having them all inherited from something like a treenodebase class which contains properties for isselected isexpanded and

7571701
children	parent
don t forget to hook up a propertychange notification for your children so that when treenodebase.isexpanded gets changed the parent object s isexpanded value changes too

7571739
gtk	gdk
you can do it with the old gdk drawing api but it disappeared in gtk 3

7571739
gtk	cairo
what works in both gtk 2 and 3 is to use the cairo api for that

7571749

7571921
min	max
you will want to use the max datetime and min datetime from your main table as inputs into whatever method you use and 10 seconds for the span obviously

7571925
stdout	fflush
note that if you need to inspect this output while app_a runs then you need to change app_a so that it fflush stdout after printing or else change stdout to be unbuffered

7571942
union	distinct
i got it working by using an approach similar to remou s above but you probably wanted union all otherwise two identical rows will not be inserted as union has an implicit distinct and i seemed to need an outer select that was aliased otherwise it didn t work

7571944
post	get
what happens is you re clearing the built in params controller action etc... but the method always returns get and post variables

7571975
getter	setter
in fact though even if your xml serialization is customized using explicit getter and setter s you can still see some significant gain with protobuf-net

7571988
post	get
i want to construct a query where i can get all the post tagged with a given id and the other tags associated with those post

7572080
oncreate	ondestroy	oncreate	onstart	onstart	ondestroy
what you do need to define are the oncreate onstart onpause onstop ondestroy methods

7572087
post	get
dotnetopenauth already upgrades long urls from get to post and does so at the 2048 character length threshold

7572096
post	get
suppose your programming id is 1 and u want to get all post with tag id 1

7572108
post	get
in this mapping i have confirmdelete as a get and delete as post

7572138
put	get
you can as others have suggested put the variables on the querystring but you suggest that might get too long

7572147
windows	wow64
64bits windows can run 32bits applications that is what wow64 layer provides windows on windows

7572170
width	height
rather than feeding in maximum height and width i want to feed in maximum area so that long or narrow images will appear visually to be roughly the same size

7572177
google-chrome	firefox
i have so far seen an api that works with firefox only and another on github that works with google-chrome only

7572206
post	get
i m developing a forum app for facebook and i m trying to get the page to scroll to the latest post on a page if the user wishes

7572207
ggplot2	gridextra
this can be easily done in ggplot2 with the help of the gridextra package

7572346
next	except
this also works great except if you were in fullscreen when the next video starts to play you are taken out of it and back to the app

7572424
pull	push
my plan is to not allow developers to commit or ftp directly to the server instead we would push our work to either the live or proof hub which would then in turn cause the live proof workspaces to pull the changes from their respective hub

7572450
setinterval	settimeout
use setinterval instead of settimeout

7572482
post	get
what is the correct way to get the rest template to post auth credentials

7572506

it implements a datamapper pattern instead of an activerecord pattern

7572559
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
did you set up https port in the amazon-web-services beanstalk application configuration

7572573
superclass	subclassing
for one thing it allows you to create subclassing without the pita of explicitly calling the superclass constructor

7572590
width	height
i have one image url online url now i want this image height and width how can i get this it s greatly appreciate if anyone answer this

7572590
width	height
i want to preview the image with 150px height and 150px width so i set it up in aspx page height-150 and width-150 for img tag

7572590
width	height
if i assign the above url to img src it will throw the 150px width and 150px height but i need the original height and width of the above url image

7572590

7572661
spaces	delimiter
my delimiter is three spaces followed by three numbers which is actually the id that i need for the row

7572662
division	multiplication
in the previous standard for multiplication and division in standard arithmetic the default mode of rounding for inexact results was truncation to 32 significant digits

7572676
ssl	https
also you mention an ssl cert but it is an http url not https

7572691
command-pattern	presenter
a simple implementation of command-pattern would be to let iview have a that is supplied by the presenter and let a specific implementation of a view decide how to fire these actions by doing

7572739
inherited	properties
you have access to your route values in request.requestcontext.routedata so you can make base controller and public properties siteidentity in such case you can access it from all actions in all inherited controllers

7572751
uiview	subviews
the uiview property autoresizingmask allows you to specify how your subviews should behave when their superview in this case the uitableviewcell s contentview gets resized

7572774
int	double
where 1.0 are of type double and 2 3 5 are of type int

7572780
move	drag
my problem is that being a canvas the object to drag and the obstacle at the same time makes it not to move at all

7572789
put	get
if you put this in the foreach loop you ll get a timer for every serial port that will dispose its given serial port after 3 seconds

7572798
flexmojos	swc
however it s main artifact type is not a tar.gz it s a swc i m using flexmojos

7572846
versioning	upgrade
versioning of flash player versioning 9 upgrade 3 is not installed in the

7572862
width	height
since i believe it s all setting the part you can see to the specified coordinates width height

7572873
children	parent
the other option would be to make the app lion only and use the parent child nsmanagedobjectcontext design and then your children will be more aware of each other

7572895
google-chrome	firefox
i m having a problem loading images cross-domain in firefox for webgl and it works fine in google-chrome

7572895
google-chrome	firefox
the access-control-allow-origin response made google-chrome satisfied with cross-domain images but firefox is not

7572903
implements	extends
it extends defaultlistmodel implements tablemodel while you should do extends abstracttablemodel implements listmodel

7572907
min	max
the simplistic code i currently have sets the y-axis min value to 100 and the y-axis max value to 930

7572907
range	min	range	max	min	max
always take the ceiling floor of a data point -- it is not very clear when a data point shares the same value as max min range plotted

7572907
range	max
excel plots 1200 as the max range when graphing 0 100 1 500 2 930 3 1030

7572979
hide	show
i d like a method that uses only css transitions to effectively and attractively hide show content on hover

7573016
width	height
the issue responds to webkit not firing the load event on cached images so if the width height attrs are no explicitly set in the img tag the only reliable way to get the images is to wait for the window.load event to be fired

7573016
width	height
the window.load event will fire always so it s safe to access the width height of and img after that without any trick

7573024
post	get
i figured out how to form the post data packet but what i don t get is how to avoid the authenticity-token problem

7573043
google-chrome	firefox
it is already implemented in webkit google-chrome etc. as well as firefox but your mileage may vary

7573060
rss	feed
before i dive into writing a validator to check if a url is actually pointing to an rss feed i did a bit of searching for some validators that may exist out there but had little luck with any reliable ones

7573096
getter	setter
in this example i use autoload to create the getter and setter and then have those instance variables available in my object during the while loop

7573119
ssl	https
my web host provides a shared server for ssl https - its free as part of my package - your package may include similar

7573131
getter	setter
another reason is although you don t have to specify the setter and getter you still can

7573131
getter	setter
however there is a good reason for setter and getter for encapsulation

7573144
factors	mean
i need add a column called wt to this dataframe that contains the weighting factors needed to calculate the weighted mean

7573152
inherited	properties
for javascript properties functions to be inherited you need to add them to the prototype and not to the object itself

7573177
post	get
so whenever i create or update a post through whichever controllers i always get redirected back to post 4 post 123 post id whatever

7573177
post	get
i want to get redirected to the particular controller the post being edited or created lives under

7573177
post	get
when trying to access a new post form i get the following error

7573188
post	get
i ve read this post and this one but they do not specify how to get ahold of the output which is generated within the launch method in the first place

7573204
width	height
to convert your 640x480 image to a standard 10 000-ish pixel size you need a new image size of 86-87 height and 114-116 width

7573295
google-chrome	firefox
the map works correctly in ie9 and firefox still working on google-chrome

7573303
opera	firefox
works in opera ie and firefox for me

7573323
client-side	server-side
your server-side code files are no place for the client-side code

7573392
rss	feed
is the top-level element either rss or feed

7573395
post	put	post	get	put	get
or is there some magic method that only expects a url and the jax-b object and maybe if i want to put delete post or get it

7573398
int	boolean
the return value for select charindex is an int not a boolean type

7573422
post	put	post	get	put	get
below is an example of a restful service that supports put delete post and get

7573443
getter	setter
the getter and setter would then modify the wrapper s property

7573487
ocean	petrel
the wizard that comes with the ocean sdk for petrel 2011.1 actually works with visual studio 2010 as well as visual studio 2008

7573491

it seems like phpbb mybb and vbulletin and others i come across all use md5

7573491
crypt	salt
i d like to do integration with my main site s authentication with something more secure sha or just the builtin crypt password salt but don t want to hack up a dependency to pieces so it becomes difficult to upgrade

7573605
width	height
so i would like pass width and height as arguments to the image class

7573628
width	height
but to maintain design space i have made the block size 200px in width and 300px in height

7573628

but i want to set maximum width and height

7573670
mouse	keyboard
is there an easy way for a tooltip to be shown when an item gets keyboard focus not just mouse over

7573694
getter	setter
when i m trying doctrine orm generate-entities it creates php files with getter and setter in camel case

7573696
uninstall	upgrade
you don t have to uninstall vs2010 pro to upgrade to ultimate

7573696
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
just run the ultimate installer without doing anything to your existing vs2010 pro installation and your versioning will be upgrade

7573710
class-method	eigenclass
class-method are on really methods of the eigenclass of an instance of class think about what is self in def self.method

7573715
width	height
max width and height are just that

7573715
width	height
i just made a text html page and the smaller images worked fine with the max height and width set

7573718
width	height
the only way i can imagine achieving a fluid width + height box with the borders that you have in the way that you want is to use a second image for the west and east containing divs

7573766
division	multiplication
those operations are o 1 because of the multiplication division

7573778
inherited	properties
it inherited the properties but i can t get access to it

7573800
setinterval	settimeout
i would not suggest using a setinterval when dealing with animations due to the way newer browsers are making changes to the way setinterval and settimeout work when the tab is not the active tab

7573881
concave	convex
polygons are either of concave convex or complex

7573953
google-chrome	firefox
another great way to see exactly what s happening is to use firebug in firefox or the google-chrome inspector see exactly what styles your table rows are picking up inheriting or being overridden

7573961
post	get
i either want the jsessionid to arrive embedded into a get method url name value pairs or to be part of a post request name value pairs

7573994
portrait	landscape
some pages portrait and some landscape

7574040
hash	md5
you can t decrypt a md5 hash function and you chose a bad algorithm if you want to transmit information and the receiver can t read it

7574040
hash	md5
md5 is a cryptographic hash function because it s very difficult to produce a block of information that has a specific given hash value

7574074
put	get
we parse files and put the data into a database if i parse the exact same file with the same code it was never changed i get different results

7574092
packets	pcap
on the other side of the network link will be a receiving application that simply writes every packets it sees to its own pcap log

7574092
dpkt	scapy
while looking for something with scapy s capabilities i ran into dpkt but i didn t find a lot of documentation for it

7574097
skype	webex
skype webex and team viewer works in windows but i find them to be flaky in linux

7574138
google-chrome	firefox
both of these methods are extremely fast in google-chrome firefox but terribly slow in ie 7 8 9

7574145
fflush	gets
bufferedwriter uses a fixed-size buffer and will fflush automatically when the buffer gets full

7574180
google-chrome	firefox
everything works great in firefox and google-chrome but not ie 7 and ie 8

7574190
pull	push
using git remote add is connecting another remote repository to the current repository so you can pull and push with the remote repository

7574197
istream	getline
error no matching function for call to getline std istream char |

7574246
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
it can be more or sometimes less 0 or 1 when defaults are implied naturally like zero for addition subtraction one for multiplication division

7574269
portrait	landscape
ios 5 portrait 768x1004px landscape 1024x748px source

7574269
portrait	landscape
ios 5 portrait 768x1024px landscape 1024x768px source image

7574282
pull	push
usually these are remote repositories of the same repo s clones on peers and servers with which you push and pull

7574300
try-catch	exception-handling
it s generally considered bad practice to suppress ignore errors instead why not use a try-catch block to capture the exception-handling and do something with it

7574300
try-catch	exception-handling
if you really don t need to do anything about the exception-handling at least put a comment to that effect in your try-catch block it ll make your code more readable when you come back to it later

7574330
width	height	portrait	landscape
landscape is fully stretched width ways and portrait height ways

7574438
direct3d	gdi
it s a feature rich cross-platform gui toolkit and it supports a variety of graphics driver gdi x11 opengl direct3d

7574440
width	height
this should decrease the height and width by the totals of the margins then offset the top and left with the margins needed for those

7574447
implements	extends
my action class does not extends from actionsupport instead it implements preparable

7574460
oncreate	findviewbyid
you cannot use findviewbyid before oncreate and this is what you are doing if you try to initialise with a value like that

7574466
google-chrome	safari
here s a simple example that works find in google-chrome and safari

7574466
width	height
the #foo div has its height and width as a percentage of the body

7574468
fullcalendar	cluetip
i m using the cluetip plugin together with the jquery fullcalendar to show event details which works quite good

7574468
hide	show	mouseover	mouseout
is there any option i can use to show the cluetip on mouseover hide it on mouseout but make it sticky on click

7574529
setcontentview	findviewbyid
this is probably because you are setting setcontentview after findviewbyid so the view hasn t been inflated yet

7574529
setcontentview	findviewbyid
change the order around making sure setcontentview has been called before you call findviewbyid

7574540
setcontentview	findviewbyid
is not directly about your question but you have to put this lines after setcontentview cause the findviewbyid method

7574581
int	chars
i don t know if you can get away with a 64-bit int the max length of an email address is 254 chars and in this case where you need to preserve the uniqueness of each hashing will not do it

7574696
for-loop	loops
i am using a for-loop that assigns each comment div in loops a unique id like

7574725
for-loop	loops
i think this is because the article variable is stored outside of the scope of the for-loop in coffeescript and the click doesn t execute until after loops has already completed

7574770
filtering	grouping
my problem now is that using a channel field grouping on the root channel obviously filtering through all categories and entries associated

7574789
pull	push
the problem comes in how to convert calling execute which dumps a ton of data into the idatawriter object push to a pull method so that the ienumerator s movenext and current can be used

7574835
subtraction	addition
obviously any addition or subtraction needs to be currency aware so

7574875
int	double
the formatprovider is to handle the culture dependent . or separator in decimals or int and double

uitableview	reloaddata
when the user wishes to go back to the view you will simply need to check for saved values and load them on to the uitableview with tableview reloaddata

7575181
children	parent
it looks like you are creating a data structure here where children have pointers to their parent

7575215
post	get
you have to stop using cookies altogether and maintain session state using only values passed by get post

7575228
postgresql	mysql
however mysql and sqlite allow you to do a select distinct id from test order by whatever while postgresql does not

7575263
post	get
is there any way to use a post request with the gdata api or otherwise get around the 414

7575263
post	get
edit just tried using a post request and get 403 target feed is read-only

7575336
int	chars
addendum another option is uuid_short for a 64-bit unsigned int rather than a chars field

7575344
margin	height
to be honest if you re trying to get equal height floated columns and you re using javascript for the solution anyway don t depend on padding margin

7575354
subtraction	add
if you don t want to nest queries and you want to have only one select you must add another column to your column list note that it is actually copy paste of grosssales and credits columns with subtraction sign between them

7575356
stdout	stderr
i m not 100 sure whether this will intersperse stdout and stderr the way you want

7575396
min	max
here is an extended seekbar which allows you to set a min max in floats rather than integers

7575396
min	max
this is just to add min max value as floats

7575437
memcpy	memset
my mediaitemmanager is a c++ class it does call new delete and memset memcpy

7575437
memcpy	memset
cplaylist makes no calls to memset memcpy functions

7575482

7575829
post	get
what i want to do is disable the submit button when the form is submitted then re-enable it after 5 seconds or so so i don t get multiple post

7575871
uilabel	uitextview
i did something similar by simply having uilabel s and uitextview s lined up vertically

7575878
vbscript	vba
this would be easier i think in vba than vbscript but afaik it is possible in vbscript

7575894
width	margin
need to research if further but if you know the original width of .content then you can add the same negative margin to it â so it would compensate the original width

7575894
width	margin
and if you ll need to animate the accordion you ll just need to animate the margin alongside the width

7575913
pull	push
basically that means the servers can never push anything but can always pull

7575959
rjava	jri
the message indicates that it the path e r r-2.13.1 library rjava jri jri.dll is invalid

7576014
quad	uniform
however if you re talking about quad rendering where each quad has a different color then the uniform update overhead and multiple draw calls is going to kill your performance

7576023
printf	fgets
but when i use fgets with a popen stream with various shell commands and then print the resulting array with printf the newlines are retained and the output looks the same way as though i had gone through a terminal

7576024
uiview	calayer
is there any way to fade out a calayer or more generally a uiview s opacity

7576053
children	parent
in our existing win32 tree when we add the truck 2 node we manually cycle through the child nodes and add the dummy nodes as required and children to create the tree based on the type of nodes in the children list and potentially a property on the child node - the personnode has a flag on it to indicate if its a passenger or crew so we know which parent node to add it should belong to

7576066
pop-up	dialog
for example when i click on a button a non-opaque dialog it pop-up correctly but after a couple of opening and closing of the dialog it does open

7576086
post	get
we call newsession just after a login to mark the session-id to be renewed on the next get request post requests don t work well due to the restore of the view state but the post redirect get with seam will issue gets quite often

7576086
put	get
you might want put it into your filter -- or you just mark your session to be refreshed in the next get request

7576102
inotifycollectionchanged	imultivalueconverter	inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged	inotifypropertychanged	imultivalueconverter
therefore i think all binding related implementations of ivalueconverter imultivalueconverter inotifypropertychanged inotifycollectionchanged should be always public in order to work with xaml

7576104
membase	couchbase
membase and the soon-to-be-released couchbase server will easily handle your needs and provide dynamic scalability on-the-fly add or remove nodes replication with failover

7576116
post	get
try either switching to a post method or appending a timestamp to the get request querystring and see if that prevents the caching

7576129
width	height
however i do not explicitly specify the width and the height of the rectangle which means it adapts to the size of the grid which contains it the size of the grid depends on the screen resolution amongst other things and is not known before hand

7576129
width	height
i d like the radiusx and radiusy properties to be percentages of the rectangle s width and height respectively

7576181
inherited	properties
the two key properties used are background-image inherited and visibility hidden

7576181
inherited	properties
background-image inherited will make the element inherited properties from its direct parent if no image is specified this means no properties will be inherited

7576181
inherited	properties
due to this we need to make the ul for the sublinks menu inherited the properties from its parent too.

7576263
width	height
a height and width of the screen and aspect ratio

7576295
thin	webrick
rack handler thin rack handler fastcgi even rack handler webrick which is the handler rack selects above in default mode

7576301
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu

7576308
background-position	background-size
i don t think you need html5 so do something similar the first step is placing an image as a background of a div and using css3 background-position and background-size take care of moving and scaling the image

7576312
width	margin
in your case you might just be able to drop the width and margin styles in that class

7576330
pop-up	dialog
instead emit client side javascript to pop-up an alert dialog or add a div that a user can click to make it go away

7576336
min	max
when doing a gradient fill on an area chart the gradient ratios are used only between the min and max of the chart

7576336
min	max
to make sure that it was using the ratios only between the min and max i inserted a zero 0 into the chart and the gradient expanded to the full height

7576336
min	max
how do i get the ratios to be effective through the entire fill not just between the min and max

7576386
cumsum	reshape

7576386
cumsum	reshape
v 1 size max reshape cumsum ones max size size max 1

7576395
multiplying	modulo
since you asked for a trick you could use a common auto_incremented id and fake it by multiplying with a big prime and then modulo 2 32

7576406
client-side	server-side
in addition since i m planning to handle all form elements using client-side scripts i don t really need any special server-side functionality so i m having a hard time figuring out what advantages do i get from using editorfor textboxfor

7576438
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
when this code is executed in google-chrome firefox ie5 ie6 or safari the literal is not parsed and simply assigned to the array correctly

7576457
spaces	delimiter
if you set applescript s text item delimiter to spaces then this would actually be better than the previous script.

7576460
rss	feed
i can see how rss feed are automatically created with jekyll but how does one consume them on another site - so that it looks like those posts are from that second site

7576461
put	get
firstly i would change the query here to ask for all values in the table and perhaps put some condition to constrain what you get back to make sure your cursor then contains all your values

7576508
versioning	upgrade
i m using an action filter that checks what browser versioning is being used on my site if it s an older browser i put up a div at the top asking them to upgrade

using the spread operator here causes groovy to attempt to calls a method with a signature like getstaticmetamethod string int string boolean

7576637
getter	setter
i am creating a gem and wanted to be able to modify an activerecord object by creating attribute getter and setter dynamically to a serialized attribute

7576637
getter	setter
i realize that i will need to extend activerecord with a module containing the method has_serialized and that i will need to use define_method to add the custom getter and setter however i can t figure out how to combine the two using the block syntax i want for definition

7576644
children	parent
i have a parent view model that contains a collection of other view models of same type children

7576644
children	parent
in the parent i am using a itemscontrol to show the children views

alternative #3 nginx is pretty easy to install locally and you could just point it at your django server no need for gunicorn uwsgi whatever

7576667
post	get
this code will work for both post and get

7576677
post	put
so if i put it into a post it works fine in the preview but when i publish that post there s only a note that my browser requires javascript please help

7576679
portrait	landscape
when the view is loaded in either landscape or portrait the picker is sized the same as the appropriate keyboard

7576679
width	height
however when you rotate the device once inside the view the picker doesn t resize it s height properly like it does with it s width

7576707
free	realloc
on subsequent operations free realloc it would subtract a few bytes to get to the bookkeeping area

7576731
libxml2	libxslt
i had the exact same problem and it s due an old libxml2 libxslt

7576733
onchange	onblur
can i do this by myself using events like onblur onchange etc i don t know which

7576819
spaces	delimiter
use string.split using a spaces as the delimiter

7576824
width	margin
left margin + right margin + report width page width

uiview	subviews
using - uiview subviews allows me to avoid outlets for every single item

7577030
children	parent
this is not tested code but i would scan recursively children of the parent element and build xhtml like this

7577064
memcpy	memcmp
but if you want to look at the bitwise representation of an object useful for things like memcpy and memcmp you ll need to cast their addresses to s or if you like and work with them byte-by-byte

7577070
free	malloc
if you allocate mostly large arrays and performance ends up being a problem you may want to switch a few of these to the c heap you have access to c s malloc and free in d or if it has a scoped lifetime some other allocator like regionallocator

7577071
junit	testng
i think for java i would go with either with junit or testng frameworks if you have persistence data base involved in the application i would add dbunit to the mix

7577071
ant	maven
if you have build scripts like maven or ant or gradle i would also suggest you look into jenkins and similar tools to automate builds

7577071
ant	maven
i am suggesting maven because it has life cycle events for testing you can add targets with ant i have not used gradle but if i was given choice i would choose gradle

7577072
put	get
some browsers provides a kind of preview image that represents the element while i m dragging it and when i let the element in the container with the drop event i need to get the position where the user wants to put him

7577077
joptionpane	jdialog
and display that jlabel in a dialog such as a joptionpane super easy to do or a modal jdialog a little more complicated but not much

7577184
profiling	benchmarking
rails includes built-in options for detailed profiling and benchmarking beyond basic logging

7577204
listview	gridview
both gridview and listview can do paging if you put a datapager in them

7577204
listview	gridview	gridview	objectdatasource
i don t believe the value for the sortparametername parameter is filled in by the listview when using an objectdatasource - it might or might not be when using a gridview

7577214
.htaccess	httpd.conf
as pat mentioned while i was looking for the appropriate syntax you can use .htaccess or modify httpd.conf itself if you are using apache and have access

7577215
width	height
solved it by adding width and height to #slider

7577218
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in firefox and google-chrome but crashes in a really puzzling way in ie v8

7577271
put	get
don t override put - as you observe it s fragile and doesn t get invoked if you call db.put instead of the model s put function

7577275
google-chrome	firefox
it is running on the same machine as the browser google-chrome right now but as far as i can tell the behavior is the same with firefox 7 and ie 9

7577275
post	get
of course a difference here is that this is a get not a post but i ve tried that in my script and it makes no difference

7577296
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s working pretty well so far runs pretty well on ios devices and also in safari firefox and google-chrome

7577296
google-chrome	safari
the output on ios google-chrome and safari shows the parts of the texture corresponding to 0 2 and 3 in a vertical line with the 2 animating up and right

7577301
hash	hmac
it s fairly trivial to demonstrate that an hmac is going to be faster however signing a message requires first hashing it then computing the signature over the hash whilst computing an hmac requries first hashing it then computing the hmac which is merely two additional one-block hash computations

7577303
hide	show
i have looked for tutorials online but they only show how to show hide with a button

7577324
stdout	fflush
and as mentioned you need to end your printf s with n or call fflush stdout or it will get buffered and not print

7577377
button	checkbox
looked and found solutions with broken links or that did not work for me that said i am using the multiselect found here i need to get the selected checkbox when i hit a button to use them in c# i am totally stuck on this one and the example used in the demo that does it is in php -

on windows the directories c temp c tmp temp and tmp in that order

7577517
integer	unsigned
the binary literals have to be only unsigned integer numbers

7577519
hex	binary
if there is no way to do it mathematically i feel like i am going to have to convert the hex into binary and then perform twos complements on it but again i dont know where to start

7577524
getter	setter
this is because the object returned by the getter method may not be the same one you passed to the setter

7577524
getter	setter
the setter may have made a copy for example or may have failed validation and set a nil instead. this would mean you were leaking the original object and over-releasing the one the getter gave back to you

7577524
getter	setter
in the case where the property is a retain type and both the getter and setter are just the synthesized versions all of the above examples will work

7577538
filtering	grouping
if you fill out your directory settings with the correct but set the grouping object filtering to an ldap filtering that will match nothing you will not import any grouping

7577542
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this only happens in ie9 but i have only tested against safari google-chrome latest firefox ver 5 6 ie8 and ie9

7577552
sorting	filtering
all the functionality sorting paging filtering is taken care of

7577554
uiview	subviews
or create a custom uiview class as you had listen for touch events and slowly adjust two subviews positions to follow the drag action

7577613
qcombobox	qstyle
apart from that i think the only option you have is to create your own widget - but even using painting functions from qstyle mostly drawcontrol i guess and scraps of code implementing separate qspingbox and qcombobox this will mean lots and lots of work

7577620
ubuntu	linux
linux rhat ubuntu

7577635
int	chars
is there a correct data type for printing the value at a certain offset i ve tried long and chars and int but it still yields 22. or am i printing them wrong

7577635
hex	binary
i ve searched on google but couldnt find any help in this regard however i did note that opening the file in binary is recommended for editing with hex

7577647
fflush	gets
if the system is suitably underloaded then going to sleep will mean the os gets control and lets the i o queue fflush so it would have that effect

7577650
apache	nginx
in production environment your webserver apache nginx iis takes care of gzipping static so doesn t matter whether gzip works in dev or not

7577673

7577894
multiplying	transpose
for a class a question that was posed by my teacher was the algorithmic cost of multiplying a matrix times its transpose

7577894
multiplying	transpose
i understand that when you multiplying a matrix by its transpose you have to calculate less of the matrix because its symmetrical but i can t think of how to manipulate an algorithm that could take less than o n 3

7578154
opera	safari
i have seen in some posts that opera and safari can have trouble with these

7578156
int	chars	int	double

postgresql	mysql
this problem has cropped up while migrating to postgresql from mysql due to mysql being a bit forgiving in what it will accept

7588047
jbox2d	velocity

if you pass jquery a number for a width or height it assumes the value is in pixels but if you pass it a string it demands a valid css unit

packets	multicast
m - the packets wasn t broadcast but was multicast

7589124
packets	multicast
the way the linux networking stack determines the difference between in b m and p is i think by looking at the destination address of the packets and seeing whether it s a broadcast address ff ff ff ff ff ff on networks using ieee mac-48 addresses a multicast address has the group bit set on networks using ieee mac-48 addresses or the address of the adapter on which it s received

7589142

uiview	subviews
you need to modify initwithcoder of your custom uiview class to programmatically load the nib that defines its subviews layout

hash	salt
with salting and sha1 you hash the password to be sha1 password + salt but i m not sure how to verify it

7590499
hash	salt
so you store the salt along with the hash salt + hash

7590499
hash	salt
to verify check that hash salt + password equals the stored hash

7590499
hash	salt
the main purpose of using a salt is to ensure that two equal passwords don t hash to the same thing and also to make an attack on the hash password more difficult

7590499
hash	salt
without salt you d just have to break a given hash once and for all to identify all passwords that hash to it

7590499
hash	salt
with salt you d essentially have to attack each hash anew

7590499
hash	salt
note that in these modern days of cheap parallel computing hardware gpus and cloud a single salt hash is not all that secure anymore as it can possibly be discovered by brute force in feasible amounts of time

7590512
for-loop	arrays
arrays don t implement which is the normal interface used by the enhanced for-loop other than for arrays

7590522
hash	salt
with salting the attacker has to operate on each password independently starting with an entire dictionary of words salting them hashing them and then comparing them each to the salt hash password

7590522
hash	salt
one common method of storing the salt is to just append or prepend it to the hash and store it in the database

7590522
hash	salt
since the salt and hash are of known length it s pretty easy to pull them out independently

7590526
post	get

7592076
accessor	properties	getter	setter
since properties normally just need basic accessor a getter that just returns the current value and a setter that just sets the current value using synthesize is a shortcut to let the compiler create the variable to store the value the getter method and the setter method for you automatically

7592095
put	get
for reference if you have visual studio 2005 installed you can run one of the special command prompts they put in the start menu to get access to the command line compiler and tools

7601786
integer	unsigned
it does not rely on any undefined behavior related to signed integer overflow note that the behavior of unsigned integer overflow is well-defined - although that should not happen here either

7601786

specifically the gif is going to be smaller but is going to take some time to compress unless the images are already in the format relative to using a bmp

7602595
single-quotes	double-quotes
i prefer using single-quotes instead of double-quotes unless quoting something with a single-quote inside it s a bit more javascript-y

7602949
width	height
so if you have other images in your page layout those need to get loaded first or have their width and height attributes specified in the markup

7602971
int	chars
its value does not fit into a chars variable you will need an int to hold it and according to this post

if a singleton is stateless it s a degenerate case of being stateful and thread-safe is trivially true

7602991

7603206
mouse	keyboard
i believe ce sets this same event from mouse and keyboard activity

7603240

change post - get data

7603260

i ve put above to get rid of the red mark in the editor

7603502
fflush	gets
readmode 3 turns stdin into cbreak mode meaning stdin kind of gets fflush after every keypress

7603502
put	get
strictly speaking the readmode 2 isn t needed but i put it there so the screen doesn t get cluttered up with text when the user bangs on the keyboard

7603534
mouse	keyboard
as such the scrollbar it generates is more of a dummy in that there s no way to make it work with a mouse or keyboard

7603568
put	get
if i understand the sample code comment right when you put your bot s class name into awt.properties as the example code says it should get loaded automatically as puzzle pirates or any other java application starts

7603612

you start with a max value and a min value

7603612
min	max
than for each element if it s larger than max update max if it s lower than min update min

7603612
min	max
at the end you just do the difference between computed max and min

7603628

if the problem is with calling hide during your show event i can t confirm that it s explicitly disallowed but it doesn t sound like a good idea in general and calling hide from your show event is where you really need to have this code then you could use a single shot timer

7603771
jsf	seam
also if you re trying to manage state across a series of pages and want the effective of conversation management for struts or jsf or spring mvc spring web flow provides just what you need complete with flow-scoped beans that live for the duration of a flow more or less equivalent to a conversation in seam cdi

to use this technique you must perform navigator.useragent check for gecko or webkit engine

7604291
fast-forward	merge
you can merge branches and leave the branches visible or you can heavily rebase and fast-forward merge so your history never shows a single parallel line

7604309
mouse	keyboard
i m curious if it would be better to pass a parameter to the click event or use a global to detect if it issued by the keyboard or mouse or if it is better to just do what the plugin did and have the code inside the keydown function

7604329
portrait	landscape
currently i have a dual pane layout for both landscape and portrait on a tablet

7604329
portrait	landscape
now i can see that for some tablets it would make sense to have a single pane for portrait and a dual one for landscape

7604329
portrait	landscape
a if in landscape a fragment stack of depth n say is in the right pane then on an orientation change to portrait i would still want fragment n to be displayed and the stack to be maintained

floating-point	fractions
see the floating-point guide for a detailed explanation of how binary fractions work

7604377

7604489
geocoding	geocode
rather than geocoding through google each an every time that i would like to display it on a google map it seems better to simply geocode each address upon entry and store the coordinates for later

you shouldn t be using std ostringstream that way

7604853
min	max
the query contained only aggregate functions min max that were

7604859

typedef struct data_struct

7605141
free	malloc
always good to free anything you malloc

7605143

so you can improvise using states binding a tabbar to the names of the states and hide show panels based on state

7605318
min	max
may i restrict zoom levels of mkmapview set max and min zoom levels of mkmapview

i am making a caesar cipher and am trying to convert the chars value of each letter into an int so the shift value can change it

7605405
int	chars
it says it cannot convert int into chars

7605420
int	chars
cannot implicitly convert type int to chars

7605421
postgresql	mysql
also if you are planning on providing a web interface and service at the server level my guess is you are going to be storing a fair amount of data i would look into a more robust and scalable database such as mysql or postgresql

7605439
emacs	gedit
is there a way to embed emacs inside of gedit

7605442
comparator	comparable
this is the exact situation faced by the comparable interface its comparator method wants to take an argument the same type as the object it is called on

7605462
google-chrome	firefox
i am testing with firefox and google-chrome

7605523
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
using objectdatasource means you have to perform your own select update insert and delete method that usually found in sqldatasource

7605523
listview	gridview
and you ll lose other feature too because a simple ienumerable alone can t be bound in two ways to other list control such as listview and gridview

7605534
post	get
the orderid will get passed by post get or a class call

7605542
emacs	gedit
you d be better off identifying what gedit does that makes you want to use it instead of emacs and extending emacs to make it do that too

7605583
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie7

7605624
implements	extends
mybookshelf extends activity and implements an interface called by asynchronous download and unzip processes

7605708
cout	cin
you seem to be intending to read and write one character at a time - cin and cout are both capable of working with integral values and this would be ideal here

7605820
apache	nginx
defaults to true but in the production environment is turned off as the server software nginx or apache used to run the application should serve static assets instead

7605823
pop-up	dialog
how can i prevent this pop-up dialog box from appearing

7605871
rss	feed
most browsers or email programs already have an rss reader build in and you can also set them to poll the feed either daily or on demand

7605884
put	get
what i need to know is what is the best way to put each id into a variable and pass it to a database query and get the results i need

7605963
datediff	difference
datediff month date1 date2 will only compare the difference between the month parts and does not take days into account

7605992
spaces	delimiter
for instance if spaces can also be part of the split delimiter such as

7605999
getter	setter
this is a public field so groovy creates a public getter and setter for it and makes the field private

7605999
getter	setter
the getter isn t used but spring sees the setter and since beans are configured to be wired by name as opposed to by type the bean is injected since there s a match between the setter name setspringsecurityservice and the bean name

7605999
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing	public	protected
but like any public or protected properties the dependency injection is inherited so just remove it from all of your subclassing and leave it in the base class

7606005
post	get
it s http get post requests

7606054
emacs	gedit
it d probably be easier to coax emacs to emulate gedit than the other way around

7606075
post	get
this class supports post as well as get

7606083
listview	gridview	portrait	landscape
i am using the same code for both tablets as well as device here is my problem while coming to mobile in both orientation it should load listview coming to tablet in portrait it need to load listview and then coming to landscape it should load gridview

7606304
bmp	png
my program works very well in both png and bmp files

7606313
xlib	cairo
cairo uses xlib and in some cases cairo-gl think customized opengl to work with on linux and other platforms

7606313
gtk	cairo
there is also the fact that gtk uses a lot of other libraries like glib pango and of course cairo

7606313
gtk	cairo
to optimise gtk you may try changing the backend of cairo difficult unreccomended and requires another ton of glue code or stop using libwimp this will make gtk look less native

7606345
google-chrome	firefox
when i run my website on firefox mozila and google-chrome then all these three frame is displaying

7606363
retaincount	dealloc
then i am printing retaincount in dealloc method

7606392
pop-up	dialog
i have a text box where the user can enter details up to 140 characters after that a dialog box pop-up which showing maximum limit reached .my problem is that after the message box is shown the cursor is blinking at the beginning of the text.and also further typing is possible.i have to do two things one is the cursor should blinking at the end of text after message box shown.and next is when the user hit characters more than 140 it should not be entered in the text box

7606416
wxpython	pyqt	wxpython	pygtk
my suggestion though would be picking up one gui toolkit pyqt pyside for qt pygtk for gtk+ or wxpython for wxwidgets

7606508
rss	feed
but however this is dependent on the structure of the rss feed itself if the structure is different it won t work so i was wondering if theres a more broader and less specific way to grab all the titles from a rss feed

7606525
postgresql	mysql
similarly to postgresql there s another function in mysql too that returns the actual timestamp the one that corresponds to the time of the evaluation the statement s particular part that contains the function and that function is sysdate

7606532
folder	directory
bow the problem is how can i link each of the different web.config file with its corrosponding virtual directory for each the website because both of the virtual directory will target the same folder of code base

7606543

my application require timeout of 10 min if there is no activity on the application from last 10 min then either the application is terminate or login login credential in sqlite db is shown

7606569
width	height
this will mean you can assign it a width height

7606629
screens	tablet
well as per my understanding android-sdk supports tablet from the beginning but since 1.6 onwards multiple screens support was enhanced and made developer friendly

7606633
ienumerable	iqueryable
i m not sure whether i read it somewhere or maybe just got used to this assumption - i always thought that when the ef api returns an ienumerable and not iqueryable then this means that the results have been materialized

7606637
serializable	deserialization
the problem you are experiencing is that the c# version of jsonpath does not include a json parser so you have to use it with another json framework that handles serializable and deserialization

7606637
idictionary	ilist
jsonpath comes with a built-in basicvaluesystem that uses the idictionary interface to represent json objects and the ilist interface to represent json arrays

7606637
idictionary	ilist
so if only you could take a json string and parse it into a nested structure of idictionary objects ilist arrays and primitive values you could then use jsonpath to filter it

7606637
serializable	deserialization
as luck would have it we can use json.net which has good serializable and deserialization capabilities to do that part of the job

7606651
int	chars
on x86 architecture normally the net effect is just that you will get some strange value if the function is returning a true native type a chars or an int that fits in a register and you may instead get memory corruption or a crash if the function is for example returning a class instance std string

7606661
getter	setter
the purpose of property declaration in the .h file it can also be don in .m file is to tell the compiler how to handle the getter and setter for this property when you use dot syntax

7606672
vsto	add-in
from within an outlook vsto add-in i want to clear the current selection

7606705
versioning	upgrade
i guess it is time to upgrade to the next versioning

implements	extends
long story short if you haven t already you should try implements your own iworkflowprovider that extends sitecore.workflows.simple.workflowprovider and configure it in your web.config

7606783
jar	war
and in the application assembly segment it is sufficient if you specify just the war file and add the model jar file as a dependency to the war file

7606801
getter	setter
the getter setter of the list are in superbean and i should use this superbean in my backingbean to get the value of the itemlist

7606822
stdout	stderr
-u force stdin stdout and stderr to be totally unbuffered

7606822
stdout	stderr
on systems where it matters also put stdin stdout and stderr in binary mode

7606861

may be it s not your case but check also your source doesn t have c extension this may fool the compiler and use g++ not gcc as a command the library you ll link are different

7607056

i am not surprised that they are running slower than when the queries were against iqueryable but now that they are running against ienumerable there is a big difference between the two

7607066
rss	feed
extract all feed rss atom etc. that is associated with this page

7607097

7607344
serializable	deserialization
edit yes this question is a duplicate of are there any tool mapping of javabeans to actionscript class through xml serializable and deserialization

7607377
x86	64bit
for some reason the webbrowser control in c# defaults to using a 64bit ie backend if available and that version wouldn t work with the x86 dll we built because the wmp object only looked into registry entries for 64bit versions of filters

7607377
x86	64bit
by setting your build configuration in visual studio to target an x86 cpu rather than any cpu for the application that runs the webbrowser control you can ensure that even on a 64bit version of windows that the webbrowser control uses the 32-bit back end

7607402
many-to-many	one-to-many
recently i mapped many-to-many with composite primary key you can easily change it to one-to-many

7607407
yslow	pagespeed

button	checkbox
we can see the play list on the left a jtable with a filter text field and random checkbox above it and the enqueue history button below

7607486
width	height

7611396
portrait	landscape
the main difference in the portrait and landscape layout is that portrait uses a linearlayout with vertical orientation and have an gallery widget that uses that imageview while the problematic landscape uses horizontal orientation and listview instead of gallery

7611410
innodb	myisam
i d suggest that you just convert the innodb tables to myisam

7611613
udp	tcp
to import things like ip udp and tcp i m now using the following

7611632
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have noticed that when instantiating a uitabbarcontroller it loads all it s dependencies and is really stubborn when trying to release an entire uiviewcontroller

7611632
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve done a few things to combat this when i ve had high memory uiviewcontroller attached to a uitabbarcontroller

7611656
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox + internet explorer but i just noticed that it adds a 1px border margin padding in webkit browsers safari google-chrome which moves the box a bit.

7611701
put	get
you can either edit that background image get a new one and point to that or put in some nifty webkit code or something head tag of index.html

7611714
ssl	https
apparently it is possible to leak data in an ssl connection based on the size of the https request and response

7611715
stdout	stderr
you should also read the stdout and stderr streams and waitfor for the process to finish

7611728
folder	directory
i want to retrieve all folder in a directory folder and change all the subfolder that in it

7611739
equals	gethashcode
for types with value semantics you override both equals and gethashcode consistently to use the fields which determine equality

7611742
hide	show
i have a question actually i need one if else for hide or show one div i had wrote the following function but it didnâ t work

7611753
free	malloc
malloc and free do not call object constructors and destructors since there is no objects in c

7611761
put	get	folder	directory
if i create a directory called folder and put an .htaccess file in it i can get the redirect working but other urls which refer to that folder no longer work

7611761
folder	directory
using identical syntax but omitting the folder from the 2nd line works if the .htaccess is in the folder directory so i know the above can t be too far off - but as i said i cannot do that

7611791
mouse	keyboard
doing this makes me take my hands off the keyboard and use a mouse something i generally try to avoid.

7611803
versioning	upgrade
precaution at this point i will stop my attempt to upgrade my cxf client to 2.4.2 and fall back to the oldest versioning that works 2.2 series

7611827

client-side	server-side
there s a way to compress your viewstate in server-side and descompress it on client-side transfering data between them easly

7612081
spaces	delimiter
it may be usefull to note that a cobol picture strings are delimiter only by the separator spaces separator comma separator semicolon or separator period

7612114
mouseover	mouseout
you also have a problem with using .hover -- that actually encapsulates two actions mouseover and mouseout

7612114
mouseover	mouseout
when you assign two functions to it the first is mouseover and the second is mouseout but when you assign only one function to it that one function is used for both mouseover and mouseout

7612114
fadein	fadeout
so in effect your code is causing the element to fadein and fadeout on mouseout

7612126
fadein	fadeout
try adding .stop before each fadein and fadeout

7612137
equals	gethashcode
every object implements the gethashcode function and equals function

7612177
iprincipal	iidentity
you need to create your own classes that implement iidentity and iprincipal

7612202
equals	gethashcode
if a reference type does not override equals gethashcode a dictionary using the default comparator won t care about any of the key objects fields or properties and thus won t notice or care if they change

7612202
equals	gethashcode
it s simplest to think of the default gethashcode method as returning a number related to an object id and the default equals method as comparing object id s

7612202
equals	gethashcode
if the only part of an object that is examined by equals or gethashcode is the object id then for purposes of those functions all objects are immutable

7612222
hide	show
you can use that utility function as pseudo at the top of each page and the same function also be used to hide or show sections in your page

7612231
onclicklistener	onitemlongclicklistener
i think you want to be using onitemlongclicklistener instead of onclicklistener

7612235
disk	ram
it has been claimed that the os usually resides on the hard disk and is loaded to ram on every boot

7612237
integer	unsigned

tablet	galaxy
edit for anyone finding this in the future - got this to work for a samsung galaxy android tablet with the following code

7612267
children	parent
you re hiding all of the children of the parent list element which will hide the parent element since it has nothing to display

7612267
google-chrome	firefox
use google-chrome console or firebug in firefox to view the html tab for that element after it s hidden and you ll notice each of the li s for the ul#home are display none

7612334
disk	ram
for other applications such as embedded systems or some but not most virtual machines where the disk has been created in ram this will be different and storage mechanisms such as eeprom compact flash card or punch-card could be used

7612350
ggplot2	lattice
things like r ggplot2 lattice etc

7612402
ready	each
we re considering a development workflow where each individual feature is developed on a separate branch then merged into trunk master when it s ready for release

7612435
free	malloc
there is overhead associated with calling malloc and free

7612435
free	malloc
since you are doing a lot of mallocs and frees you could wind up severly fragmenting your heap where you may not have enough contiguous free memory to do a malloc elsewhere

7612472
x86	64bit
on some 64bit architectures for example many linux and solaris x86 systems i work with int is 32 bits and long is 64bit

7612504
int	chars
since chars can be assigned to int you can use string.charat to create an int array with the chars values in reverse order

7612518
children	parent
after form is submitted in edit httppost method i give my parent object a new children collection of two child elements with their isselected properties set to false and true respectively that is opposite from httpget method and call view method to render my model

7612524
stdio	fflush
i do not know enough c++ to actually find out why but they seem to have tempered with how stdio writes to that stream how it s buffered or do it in such a special way that the streamreader on the c# side is not fflush until the default 4096 byte buffer is full

7612524
stderr	fflush
so in conclusion all i had to do was to manually fflush stderr in sox.c after each fprintf stderr ... call in display_status ...

7612549
free	malloc
calling multiple malloc free can actually increase the memory used by your process without any leaks involved if the size passed to malloc is variable as proven by this question

7612572
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
i have found that malloc realloc and free are pretty expensive

7612585
int	chars
because you can use an int you can assign an int a chars value

7612585
int	chars
you will have to convert from the int back to the chars to assign it to astring.charat 2

7612595
ssl	https
if you application uses encryption including ssl and https possible other public domain encryption then you need to get at least get an ern before submitting your app to apple for approval

7612690
flying-saucer	itext
if you want to convert html into pdf you could for example use the the flying-saucer library which is based on itext

7612719
int	double
okay i found the answer finally and it might help those creating sprites the width when divided into the amount frames has to be a whole number since the measurements are in int not float or double so it moves because when the frame gets divided it came out to a fraction instead which caused it to moves i guess whatever that float extra measurement was

7612724
dlsym	dlopen
load libc.so from an ld_preload with dlopen get the address of the libc s __connect with dlsym and then patch the function asm wise to get the hook working

finally you will likely want to set the height and width properties of the images to match the dimensions of the images and

7612899
spaces	delimiter
in excel 2003 i have a positional file and i want to spaces fill with a delimiter of for 15 total characters

7612910
equals	gethashcode
if gethashcode is removed the iequatable implementation of equals is never hit i understand you should generally implement equals and gethashcode together is this why

7612915
equals	gethashcode
since you want to use custom equality you need to either apply the attribute to your type and override equals and gethashcode or roll your own key generating function that uses your concept of equality

7612942
sqldependency	sqlcachedependency
sqlcachedependency is based on sqldependency which uses sqlnotificationrequest which is the .net side of a query notification

7612943
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
when i say the file api isn t widely supported yet actually that depends on your point of view firefox google-chrome and opera do support it in recent versions firefox for a long time it was their idea

7612956
versioning	upgrade
first of all i can t upgrade to a newer versioning of the player because i need the displayclick fullscreen option to work and it doesn t with versioning 5

7612959
width	height
i m making a liquid website so everything resizes so far so good...my page has a couple of iframes they will resize just great in i.e using for height and width but when it comes to firefox only the width will resize and not the height the frame ends up pushing over my tables and making the whole thing look wrong

7612968
width	height
using firebug on a local demo at the stage they go out of line you can see the inline element styles for left top and width height are different

7612972
width	height
just change the height width of the outside border and you use this block of xaml like a textbox

7613029
equals	gethashcode
interface and provide your own gethashcode and equals methods for the

7613093
versioning	upgrade
first install telerik_05.06.03 manually to get the correct versioning of telerik.web.ui.dll and then reinstall it with the extension installer in order to avoid the same upgrade errors in the future

post	get
using my custom ajax library in the aforementioned browsers i can make as many ajax requests as i want in any order using get and or post methods and they all work flawlessly

7613196
post	get
so for example either of the following ajax post requests will pass post data if they are the absolute first ajax request whether get or post

7613224
folder	directory
to have spotlight re-index the entire developer folder in my user directory which is maybe a bit of overkill

7613241
width	height
the only time they get updated is when you actually create the rectangle object passing the height width and x-y points or setting x y height and or width of a rectangle properties

7613241
width	height
since in my program i am only trying to define the boundary or the area for drawing the shape of a rectangle i set the x y width or height

7613241
width	height
as far as figuring out the width and height of a rectangle you don t have to once you set its width and height once

7613241
width	height
every time you reset the x and or y value of a rectangle it maintains its width and height

7613302
gif	png
there is a decompress_bitmap call that will read in png jpg gif and many other formats

7613311
width	height
but what about rectangular textures where both width and height are powers of two

7613316
jar	war
consider a maven project with multiple interdependent modules let s say three jar modules a b and c which are dependencies for a war module z

7613316
jar	war
this means my jar modules are constantly building only rarely leaving a gap for my war module s to build

7613316
jar	war
also the constant running of builds means that if i commit a change that touches jars a and b the war file z may be built once for jar a which builds quickly and then again for jar b which takes longer

7613334
telerik	radcombobox
i m not sure whether this is an option for you but the radcombobox from telerik is extremely flexible

it looks like mouse events will add listeners to canvas elements fine but keyboard events don t seem to be working for canvas elements

7613460
min	max
how would i determine not only the max and min price over a rolling window of data but also the exact timestamp of those highs and lows

7613460
min	max
ideally any approach i take must cater for the fact of duplicate prices which is common and in this case i would order my window to take the first of the max values and the last of the min values

7613461
google-chrome	safari
recent-ish google-chrome safari i don t keep track of version numbers but why would someone not use up to date google-chrome anyway

i wrote my own table cell editor that extends an abstractcelleditor and implements a tablecelleditor an itemlistener and a mouselistener

7613586
exponent	modulo
one side of an rsa key will consist of the modulo and an exponent

7613586
exponent	modulo
the modulo will be a large number not representable with the normal integer types and the exponent is typically a large number for one side and a relatively small one for the other

7613586
exponent	modulo
avoiding certain vulnerabilities requires additional steps such as adding random padding into each piece of data and ensuring that the padded data raised to the exponent from the key would exceed the modulo if it weren t done as modular exponentiation

7613629
put	get
simply use get and put to check-in check-out files

7613647
unsigned	short
i m trying to create an unsigned short data type in sql server but so far all i ve managed is to get it to not allow any negative values which wastes half of my storage space

7613647
unsigned	short
so when i store my unsigned short value to the database i just need to cast it as a signed short

7613647
unsigned	short
this will properly display my incorrectly cast unsigned short

7613660
portrait	landscape
but i needed to repeat each a4 page landscape twice in the a3 sheet portrait to later cut then in half

7613677
width	height
there has never been the constraint for that width must equal height

width	height
but what will work is setting its width and height to 100

7614795
width	height
so starting from there we simply wrap the iframe in an element which we can reliably style to make less than the window 100 the size which elements default to when none of their parents have a static height width

7614795
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
after we make the iframe 100 high and wide we cannot put any margin padding or border on it because that will be added to the already 100 height width

7614795
width	height
in fact to make it be only the 100 height and width you have to make sure you removed the iframes default border

getter	setter
properties should only ever be accessed through their getter and setter methods with the exception of initializing and deinitializing them in the object s init and dealloc methods when the object is not in a fully consistent state -- accessing them any other way defeats their purpose and does not respect their attributes retain copy etc.

7616429
accessor	properties
the reason why it doesn t compile is because properties accessor are syntactic sugar for method calls and you can t take the address of the return value of a method

7616458
factors	mean
partitioning having your db be easily distributed besides those cool 8 products in japan also allows for an easy data replication so those 42 products will be replicated with a factors of 3 for example which would mean you db would have 3 copies for every product

postgresql	mysql
granted you can shard partition and cluster oracle mysql postgresql etc

7616458

int	double
that means that one is responsible to deal with int another with double another with int array list etc

7616566
google-chrome	firefox
firefox is more technically correct in this case as it outputs the state of the object at each point in the loop whereas google-chrome is apparently waiting until the end of the loop to output each console.log but i m not aware of a standards specification that covers the console host object

7616573

google-chrome	firefox
it occurs on google-chrome as well as firefox various versions including latest

7617079
uilabel	nsstring	nsmutablestring	nsstring
now the problem lies in the fact that display is a uilabel and its text property requires an nsstring not a nsmutablestring right

7617098
post	get
myserver.com your proxy reads querystring forwardurl and any post or get request included

7617098
post	get
myserver.com requests to and passes along get or post data sent from the client

7617121
nsmutablestring	nsstring
an nsmutablestring is an nsstring

7617127

so correct me if i m wrong but this says that if one calls close on the tcpclient that the networkstream will also be closed

7617139
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsmutablestring and nsstring are mostly interchangeable

7617139
nsmutablestring	nsstring
if a method requires an nsstring you can pass it an nsmutablestring

7617139
uilabel	nsstring	nsmutablestring	nsstring
even if you pass an nsmutablestring to uilabel s text property it will always return an nsstring back

i am aware of the rounded corners don t show up if the radius is greater than half the image height or width issue and that s not what is going on here

7617191
getter	setter
the second option might be ever so slightly faster because it doesn t use the getter setter methods

7617244
hex	binary
if i ve got this right you re trying to pull in some text with hex strings written convert them to binary format and output them

7617244
hex	binary
it basically converts the raw hex string to an int then packs it in binary form as a byte into a string

filesystems	hfs+
the filesystems on the device is case sensitive but the default hfs+ filesystems on mac os x is not

accessor	properties
essentially if you want to make sure a class will have a phonenumber method accessor to the phonenumber properties you would do something like this

7617664

google-chrome	firefox
it working fine in google-chrome and firefox but the link not working in ie

7617894
int	chars	int	double
the same applies to chars and short values which are always promoted to int first. considering that in your case the float value was obtained by reinterpreting memory occupied by a pointer object and then promoted to double it is not surprising that the results you observe make no sense whatsoever

7617919
min	max
i know how to find the max depth of a tree using a stack and inorder traversal but i cannot figure out how to find the min depth of a tree not necessarily a bst using a stack or queue instead of recursive calls

7618071
width	height
are you changing the width or height of the window

7618100
integer	unsigned
on most systems casting a signed integer to an unsigned integer of the same size does nothing to the representation

7618100
integer	unsigned
if you printed it as an unsigned integer you ll probably get 4294967286

7618110
maya	blender
obviously all 3d packages blender maya max rhino all include built in software and tools to solve this problem

7618116

when you are in firefox the images at the left all the mockup is loaded after a few refresh in google-chrome and safari it never show

7618220
multiplying	multiplication
next you can multiplying the random by 7 and it will always be a multiple of 7 however if this multiplication causes an overflow of the int which with randoms is likely you can always take a mask of the first few bits and multiplying them

7618230
children	parent
either of these techniques will cause the parent div to be as big as its children

7618304
min	max
password should contain only alphanumeric characters and should be of length min 6 and max 8

7618306
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

the following works on google-chrome but not firefox .

7618381
single-quotes	double-quotes
i tend to use double-quotes just out of habit from other languages but i don t have a strong preference i m willing to change if i hear of a compelling reason why single-quotes are better but to date i ve not even heard a good reason let alone a compelling reason

7618381
single-quotes	double-quotes
for consistency single-quotes are preferred to double-quotes

7618381
single-quotes	double-quotes
obviously json is not javascript but still that s a reason why a some might prefer double-quotes in their javascript so that object literals look like json and b some might prefer single-quotes so that they can manually encode json without having to escape the double-quotes

7618386
strtol	atoi
if you wish to use the c programming language concepts then consider using strtol intead of atoi

getter	setter
it has become more popular the past few years for better or worse to use anemic data models where a class is nothing but a bunch of fields and corresponding getter and setter

7622870
getter	setter
i would argue that in this design you would be better off with public fields since the getter and setter provide no real encapsulation but just fool you into thinking you are doing real oo

7622888
stdout	stderr
maybe service --status-all writes to stderr not stdout

7622906
width	height
you should be able to just grab those and combine them with the location that the user clicked within the parent container as well as the width and height of each cell to determine which cell was clicked on

outputstream	inputstream
i have tried trimming the byte array down and sending it i ve manually written out -1 to the outputstream multiple times but the inputstream never reads -1

so the local ssh stdout will be from the remote commands stdout and the local ssh stderr will be a mixture of the remote s stderr and any of the ssh command s own error messages and other output such as the debugging information you d see from adding the -v --verbose options to your ssh invocation

7622993
stdout	stderr
and any results you get from its stdout or stderr cannot be conflated with possible output from any intermediary processes such as the ssh binary .

7623016
put	get
ultimately i decided to put this answer out because clearly you are already editing the templates for control and perhaps if you apply it to your own work you won t get this anomoly

7623035
width	height
you will then also be able to store other properties such as width and height

7623055

put	get
pretty much i don t want to put these tasks in the users script because i m scared they would get run a lot more than is necessary and i d prefer to keep it separate

uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
because normally when action handlers are called they pass the object that initiated the call to the method like a uibutton or uisegmentedcontrol

7623159
width	height
for example you seem to be creating the same texture with the same width and height given the same pixel data

7623188
ddms	hprof
hprof file analyzed using mat same data is generated by eclipse ddms

7623192
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream

7623584
division	modulo
in math division by 30 gives a remainder between 0 and 29 -- that s what modulo 30 is

7623584
subtract	add
so you need to take the day subtract 1 to get a day between 0 and 29 instead of 1 and 30 add 24 then do the modulo 30 then add 1 to get back a day between 1 and 30

7623588
free	malloc
and then remember that it needs to be free at some point by the caller unless the malloc fails and this function therefore returns null

when i setopaque false on the parent the children still have opacity

7623885
int	double	16-bit	64bit
hell some of them had 60-bit words so it would get weirder yet. further assume that on that machine sizeof double is 64bit while sizeof int is 16-bit

7623903
children	parent
another case - a parent element scales its children and then you add the canvas to that parent so the width is modified by the parent

7623922
hash	md5
do a md5 hash of the file contents put it in a database or something and check against it before downloading anything

put	get
one way to get around this is to manually put a call to _typeface_js.initialize just before your closing tag

7623995
clang	llvm	llvm	clang++
apple also installs the wonderfully named clang and clang++ front-ends for llvm

7624008
versioning	upgrade
but for upgrade testing you would have to leave them the same or use a temporary id and name for both the previous and upgrade app versioning

7624027
clang	llvm
beside the already mentioned llvm-gcc and clang there is also an apple-supplied gcc-4.2 without llvm backend at usr bin gcc-4.2 in xcode 4.1

accessor	properties
prefix so that you are not invoking the automatic retain that is performed by the properties accessor

7624096
accessor	properties
there is some debate on the matter but in general i think it is best to avoid calling your properties accessor unless you have a very good reason to do so

7624104
google-chrome	firefox
with such bugs it seems firefox usually ignores them and displays the page anyway and google-chrome just closes the socket without giving any error message

however in some cases you might want to use the 32 bit x86 executable even in a 64bit x86-64 environment in the case you mentioned where you have older plug-ins which are 32-bit only and can not be used with a 64bit executable

7635276
mousemove	mouseenter
now everything is working fine with my plugin but when you mouseenter from the top it screws up from time to time move your mouse in and out fast and it will happen for sure i think this is because i am getting different values from my mouseenter event and my mousemove event which are both used to calculate how to scroll the inner elements

7635289

min	max
however when i re-enter a new value within the min max the error remains

7636556
mongodb	bson
however the node-mongodb-native driver gives you clean duplication of almost the entire mongodb api and since bson is translated to json and javascript is a flexible dynamic language there s really no need for an orm

7636556
mongoskin	node-mongodb-native
mongoskin is built atop node-mongodb-native but gives you the ability to have additional javascript method bindings and deal with connections and cursors easier

serializable	deserialization
the serializable runtime associates with each serializable class a version number called a serialversionuid which is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serializable object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serializable

7636566
serializable	deserialization
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

in these cases you should strongly adhere to the serializable contracts - and this not done by just setting serialversionuid - usually you must also overwrite the methods for serializable and deserialization to cope with different versions

7636656
client-side	server-side
you re mixing javascript a client-side language with php a server-side language

portrait	landscape
all of the screens in my app are portrait only with the exception of one screen which can be rotated between landscape and portrait by the user

7637481
hash	salt
so a salt hash alone generally doesn t buy you much time before they ve cracked a large percentage of you re user s passwords

7637481
hash	salt
this adds a large volume of complexity to the hash so that each test of each password takes thousands of times longer than a simple salt hash

7637481
hash	salt
see a working example by reading another example of how to store a salt password hash

7637488

7637548
postgresql	mysql	interbase	firebird
mysql is fine for read-only or read-mostly scenarios it is no accident that mysql is frequently used for web but more advanced multi-version concurrency control capabilities of oracle ms sql server postgresql or even firebird interbase can often handle read-write workloads not just with better performance but with better correctness as well they are better at avoiding various concurrency artifacts that may endanger data consistency

the reason i m searching for said function is for the same purpose i would use php s md5 function to store a one-way hash of a user s password in a database rather than the actual text of the user s password in case the database s data is ever compromised the user s passwords would still be relatively secret

7656219
openssl	crypto++
all the code i ve found either was for getting an md5 of file data instead of just a string wouldn t compile was for another programming language or required an entire library such as crypto++ openssl hashlib++ to be added to my project some of which are very large is that really necessary when all i want is just one one-way string hashing function

7656229

realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
perhaps your function is relying on the memory being allocated by malloc for example by attempting to realloc or free it

7656432
pthreads	fork
the pthreads api is fairly easy to use for simple things where not a lot of inter-thread communication needs to occur and creating a thread is faster than fork + exec

7656435

you could start by using a profiler like visualvm free or yourkit not free to inspect java.io.file objects in memory

7656534
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
your next step might be to set breakpoints in both fileinputstream and fileoutputstream unless you know whether the file is being read or written to attach a debugger and watch for your file to be opened by one of those

addeventlistener	onload
attach it with the ancient onload or addeventlistener attachevent depending on your browser support requirements

7656592
sudo	passwd
unlike su sudo authenticates users against their own passwd rather than that of the target user to allow the delegation of specific commands to specific users on specific hosts without sharing passwd among them and while mitigating the risk of any unattended terminals

7656621
implements	extends
a class can implements multiple interfaces but it can extends only one class

7656643
for-loop	arrays
you can however use a for-loop to save an int with an increasing name and have it call it back the same way when you need it and store it into another arrays

7656650
free	alloca
it looks like newarray allocates the array on the heap using mallocarray which will need to be free d explicitly but witharray allocates the array on the stack using allocaarray assuming alloca behaves the way it does in c which will be reclaimed when the calling function returns

7656653
post	put	post	get	put	get
i worked around this issue by overriding the get post put and delete methods that are provided making it so they always pass use_route as a parameter

7656715
stateless	stateful
i understand your confusion between stateless service and a stateful host and how the two can interact

7656717
equals	gethashcode
imo since equals is always the final arbiter on the equality of objects gethashcode is only ever a shortcut for non-equal values

7656717
equals	gethashcode
in the case of identical values returned from gethashcode regardless of whether the objects are actually equals equals will then always be called to compare

7656743

7656799
memcpy	malloc
i fixed this by simply using malloc and then memcpy instead

7656802
children	parent
as long as everything is in the same domain you could work out a method for communication between the children frames via the parent

7656823
int	chars
if you specify the type as int you can t use that function to check if a string contains a certain chars for example

7656844
free	realloc
there s a good chance that by calling realloc within a method inside the program you re actually loading it into a local variable which is then thrown away and your program continues to use the older pointer which has now been free

7656859
shim	polyfills
if you want to use it now and make sure older versions of firefox support it although they will disappear in few months you can put this insertadjacenthtml polyfills shim in your site and the method will work everywhere

7656874
int	double

the trick to get a where condition to work with a left outer join is to put the criteria in the join clause

7657034
submit	submission
looking at the scaffolded grails architecture and extending that to building forms for an end-user web app the pattern seems to be to devote two actions to a page that collects form data the first to display the page including any errors from previous submit and the second to act on the data on submission producing errors and a returning to the first action as need be or b going on to a successor action controller if no errors

7657063

if you want you can prepare your gray button checkbox from this image katzer pictures spice_checkbox.png

7661593
inherited	properties
if however you do wish to perform vector comparisons perhaps your data is constrained in a manner that makes this more viable the simplest may be to first normalise both svgs convert all shapes to paths eliminate all metadata apply inherited of all properties and normalise their values normalise path data to always use the same form etc. and use this for two purposes first to look at the diffs in the normalised tree structure

7661623
post	get
then that is what you need to get from the post

7661680
button	checkbox
add an onclick attribute to every checkbox if you don t want a submit button

7661686
submit	submission
you would need to hijack the form submit process and turn it into another ajax call to get the resulting html into your content panel - you might even need to hand-crank the form submission because i don t think you can trigger form submission as an ajax operation

so i think you will either have to resort to a handcrafted sql which will be fast or use rails and get the post sorted on author-name first and then retrieve the list of tagged users per post second which will be slower but pure ruby

7661882
int	chars
store the largest and smallest in int types not chars types

7661911

postgresql	mysql
this query work well on postgresql and mysql but it doesn t work in mssql how can rewrite the query and let it work also in microsoft sql

7662477
factors	matrix
i have a rather big matrix and want to simplify the components of it factors out and cancel out

7662575
hide	show
the key here is the getelementbyid function to grab the specific element you want to manipulate and then you simply set the element.style.display property to none when you want to hide it and block or inline when you want to show it depending on the context

7662585
range	max
you need serialiable to lock the range above max

7662621
keydown	keyup
in the keydown and keyup events all major browsers support the keycode property of the corresponding event so there s no need for the which property

post	get
using this method will allow you to stay inside the doinbackground and post an update to the ui when you get a layout and continue inside the doinbackground

7662681

children	parent
it seems the parent stops forking new children until all previous children have ended disconnected

looks like location does not have public protected no-arg constructor

7662830
public	protected
of the supertype s public protected and if accessible package

7662830
serializable	deserialization
that would explain why you have problems only in deserialization because naturally constructor is not called during serializable

7662832
equals	gethashcode
two options override gethashcode and equals if you control the source of infocontact and your overrides will be true for any particular use of the class

7662832
equals	gethashcode
otherwise define a class implementing which also allows you to define proper equals and gethashcode methods and then pass an instance of this into a constructor or into a listofcontacts.distinct method call using linq

7662837
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox

pop-up	dialog
the biggest change here is that the ctrl+p dialog has been reworked into a more general goto anything pop-up

7662869
hide	show
if you only want to hide show particular elements -- say div elements -- you ll want to do a jquery selector to filter the elements down

7662896

now if i want another backend process say a daemon or cron job to process the or react the the publishing of the event in redis do i need a persistant connection

7663005

i m seeing strange behavior with media query in firefox lately and i was wondering who s doing it right compared to google-chrome and ie9

7663032
mxmlc	compc
when i call mxmlc or compc russian symbols are outputed so it s impossible to work in command line

7663077

each type int long float double has a machine dependent max value

7663125
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
these are two different things - hdpi mdpi ldpi are screens densities how many pixels per square centimeter while xlarge large normal small are screens sizes the physical dimensions of the screens

hdpi mdpi and ldpi refer to the screens density in dots-per-inch

7663164
rss	feed
rss feed for all pages - added a main one need more

7663176
daemon	cron
instead of using pub sub it simply adds an item to a list in redis and then whatever daemon or cron job you have can use the lpop command to get the first one

7663180
uiview	subviews
the corresponding release will be sent to pointdisplay automatically when it is removed from its superview or when self is deallocated uiview releases it s subviews automatically in its dealloc

7663192
int	double
either int or double float for final storage how would you go about having the correct 2-way binding to say

7663231
screens	hdpi
xlarge screens does not mean it has hdpi density

7663231
screens	mdpi
for example tab like galaxy 10.1 pr motorola xoom has xlarge screens but mdpi density so for them you make a separate folder drawable-xlarge

7663231
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
devices with small screens like galaxy pop are mostly have ldpi density normal screens like galaxy ace are mostly mdpi devices and devices with large screens like galaxy s2 are mostly hdpi devices and some devices like tab p1000 have large screens but mdpi density and for them you have to make folder drawable-large-mdpi

7663308
put	get
if i put there k index it works but if string value is string i get an error

7663332
tabcontrol	tabitem
the tabcontrol with its tabitem seems to be a better control to realise this behavoir but the standard tabitem is a pretty basic thing without such abilities

7663351
int	double
you also need change to since slices is an int and the result of area pizzaslice is a double

7663366
svg	vml
dom manipulations are slow in comparison to gpu-accelerated canvas operations so i would stay away from svg and vml

7663430
google-chrome	safari
to repeat it is specifically google-chrome ie and safari that this doesn t work in.

7663507
post	put	post	get	put	get
the only times i have serialized data to put in my database is for logging full sets of post of get variables for later debugging or for caching an array of data

7663590
superclass	subclassing
if the subclassing has access to the state of the superclass it can implement writeobject and readobject to save and restore that state

7663590
superclass	subclassing
so if the subclassing has access to the fields of its non-serializable superclass es it can use the writeobject and readobject protocol to implement serialization

7663649
post	get
i think you want to do a get instead of a post

7663661
hide	show
or if you actually want to show hide it entirely server side then you could use the rendered attribute for this instead

7663675
int	double
textbox.text can only ever show string text value regardless of what it is bound to int double datetime etc.

7663744

7663794
submit	submission
you will need to detect the submission of the form and then disable the submit button

7663884
getter	setter
a property can be assigned changed with getter setter functions but you may only expose as public the ones you need

7663912
width	height
also note that you were setting the canvas width and height via css properties

width	height
with the canvas element css width and height control the magnification of the element while dom-level attributes control the actual dimensions

7663915
width	height
you can explicitly remove the height and width from the image by accessing its style

7663942

7664193
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
in general you should avoid dynamic memory allocations malloc calloc new when it s reasonably easy they are slower than stack allocations but more importantly you must remember to free free delete manually the memory obtained with dynamic allocation otherwise you have memory leaks as happens in your code

7664194
folder	directory
is there any simpler way to backup my work other than by copying the relevant folder inside app skin and media and their directory structures

this works fine in portrait mode with the animation or in landscape mode without the animation

7664292

no matter the transport udp or tcp the data format is mainly the same

7668578
udp	rtp
so to get data from udp you only have to strip off first 12 bytes which represent rtp header

7668578
udp	rtp
then read one short 2 byte that represents the length of the rtp data that follows so read that much bytes and now do the same as for udp

7668578
udp	tcp	udp	mtu
h264 and mpeg4 data are usually packetized in sdp there is packetization-mode parameter that can have values 0 1 and 2 what each of them means and how to depacketize it you can see here because there is a certain network limit that one endpoint can send through tcp or udp that is called mtu

7668578
udp	tcp
this can be done by encoder streamer on tcp and udp transport or you can relay on ip to fragment and reassemble video frame on the other side.

7668578
udp	tcp
the first is much better if you want to have a smooth error prone video over udp and tcp

7668578
udp	tcp	udp	rtp
h264 to check does the rtp data which arrived over udp or interleaved over tcp hold fragment of one larger h264 video frame you must know how the fragment looks when it is packetized

subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	addition	multiplication
assuming you have an ieee754 architecture and if you are only performing addition subtraction and multiplication and if the result fits then it should be correct

7668661
put	get
now you could simply put the num rules before the expr rules and allow the default reduce reduce conflict resolution to deal with it the first rule appearing in the file will be used if both are possible but that s kind of ugly in that you get these conflict warnings every time you run bison and ignoring them when you don t know exactly what is going on is a bad idea

7668685

7669237
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

i m currently working on an cocoa application that needs to hash massive files using sha-1 and md5

7669516
hash	md5
what s the best easiest if possible as well but i m not averse to doing some extra work to speed things up way to perform md5 and sha-1 hash on massive files like this

7669516
hash	md5
then for md5 for example use cc_md5 followed by a series of cc_md5_update to compute the hash in chunks

7669530
rubygems	rvm
use rvm rubygems 1.6.2 to select that version of rubygems

7670079
post	get
write this script as you would if a form were being submitted from another page ie it ll have post and get variables validations etc

7670079
post	get
next you ll use jquery to grab the data get post params from the page and make a request to the php script you created

7670079
post	get
so basically write a php script as you normally would that returns something other than html signifying success fail or a response message unless you need to inject html right into the page and then use jquery.post or jquery more generic jquery.ajax method to have your browser request that script with the get post vars you define and parse the response

i am using php undercontrol and the code browser report some crap index error on every setter getter code like this

7670198
getter	setter
the getter setter are covered by the unit testing the complexity is none since there is no if for switch foreach

7670198
getter	setter
ps self answering myself might be because the complexity is none but my main issue is that every getter setter generate a warning because of the crap index so is there anyway to tell phpunit php code coverage to make the crap equals to 0 for function with a 0 complexity index

7670209
stdout	stderr
my advice would be to create a simple java wrapper around the ganymed-ssh library that takes the java s stdin and outputs it to the shell s stdin and also pipes the shell s stdout and stderr to java s equivalents

7670510
int	chars
then i changed int ch to chars ch it also worked for me

7670510
int	chars
i changed chars ch to int ch then it s working fine

7670552
int	chars
since fgetc can return the int corresponding to any chars plus a distinct value eof you cannot store its result in a chars and then test for eof reliably

7670591
cpu	affinity
if i understand your question correctly all you need to do is set the affinity of the process or thread to be the set of cores that reside on a cpu

7670597

i want my data model and my getter and setter set like a simple java class let eclipse create all the getter and setter and if i call them i want the data to be stored persistently

7671066
getter	setter
i dont understand why this oo language has this very comfortable way of objects and getter and setter to easily define a data model but when it comes to persistence i need dozens of helper classes

7671083
submit	submission
when submission the changes the last item could be deleted from the db but the problem is that the changes are submitted for the whole context and since in the first step i have removed an item that can t be deleted from the db the submit operation fails

int	double
for example int is basically system.int32 and double is system.double and so on

7671382
int	double
i want to know it means structs only or any type derived from value type like int double enum ant so on

7671382
int	double
your so-called simple types like int double and enum are nothing more than c# keywords that correspond to the system.int32 and system.double structs and system.enum class which is based on system.valuetype which makes enums also value types despite enum being a class itself

7671396
post	get
so i m wondering if i can post what i m trying to do and someone can help me understand how i can get the result i want

7671424

i use the js-sdk to login the users in my fb-app but directly after the user authorized my app i m passing a ajax request in wich i need the fb-session in firefox its working as it should without any special data about the fb-session but in google-chrome and safari the fb-session is lost

a bit of clarification the site is for a school project i want it to help with learning japanese and the idea is that you can put a string of japanese text and it will simplify it to your level so when you sign up you tell it what your level of japanese is an int between 1 and 9 then it will go through the chars list kanjis table and find all with a number equal to or less than your level called grade in the kanjis table then i want it to add all these to the kanjis_users table with the int 2 to indicate it is known then i will do it again with one level up chars and save them with int 1 for learning

problem i dont want to allow user to enter max value less than min value and so on

7675024
min	max
but above code is not working for the first time when other class try to set min max value when min max value has default value of zero

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
when nesting a custom uiviewcontroller under a uinavigationcontroller the methods viewwillappear and viewdidappear of the custom viewcontroller may not be called depending on the complexity of your view controller hierarchy think modal views navigation controller inside tab view controller...

7676489
getter	setter
the getter is being triggered and inserting the default defaultavatar.jpg as if it were a setter

7676538
teamcity	nant
this mean that you would be able to write simple msbuild nant script which executes dottrace from command line and then extract a results set xml file and show in teamcity as well

7676634
getter	setter
obviously this doesn t work because the getter and setter don t know which index to use when assigning the values

7676649
folder	directory
however i need to access the folder files outside d test the home directory any suggestions

7676650
.war	manifest.mf

7676701
exif	jfif
convert from ff d8 ff e1 exif to ff d8 ff e0 jfif

7676798
ant	maven

7676992
hash	salt
is a typical hash salt method enough for a 4 digit pin

7677035
prng	random
if the prng was seeded with data from a truly random source having 64 bits of entropy then this approach is computationally infeasible

7677042
hide	show
show hide sample

7677061
inherited	subclassing
because java does not allow inherited from multiple classes for an object to be an instance of both number and arraylist number would have to be a subclassing of arraylist or vice versa

7677063
hash	salt
if someone stole your database that stores the salt and hash of the pin it would be trivial for him to compute the actual pin because there is only 10000 combinations

7677077
allocator	stl
i m thinking to account for this by specifying an allocator to the stl container type declarations

7677107
getter	setter
however a dyanamic bean conforms to standard java idioms getter setter

7677107
getter	setter
for example you can easily add a getter or setter to your dynabean that is explicit and the code would read very idiomatically and cleanly interact with other bean apis

definitely use a salt when computing the hash but do not store the salt in the same location as the hash

7677256
integer	unsigned
i is an unsigned integer

7677274
maven	m2e
only in the latest versions of these m2e and m2e-wtp plugins weboverlays are supported the old maven builder we see in the is not capable of doing that

7677274
jar	war
by default maven war plugin not eclipse plugin will copy the resource files from dependency war also jar in to the context path when we maven build the project

7677328
division	modulo
you should be able to use division as you ve stated and modulo division to accomplish what you want

7677329
getter	setter
the getter and setter for this transient property set the appropriate id field which in turn updates the database

7677346
tunnel	packets	packets	pcap
i took a pcap trace when accessing a website using opera mini on my mobile and as opera mini uses a socks proxy to tunnel http traffic the wireshark trace shows most of the packets as socks packets

7677375
cvs	svn
unlike cvs or svn there is only one project as far as mercurial is concerned and actions commit update merge status work on the entire project tree at once

7677401
division	modulo
there are lot of different arms and there are arms which do not have a division instruction as ray toal already mentioned modulo is usually implemented as additional result of the division implementation

7677437
range	max
first loop s range would be max - 1 to 0 both inclusive

7677437
range	max
second second loop s range would be max to 1

7677441
stdout	stderr
after reading python-daemon source i ve added stdout and stderr to the daemoncontext and finally was able to know what was going on

7677460
width	height
what i want is to automatically resize the iframe on load and on resize event so that it fits the available width and height of the panel

7677475
spaces	delimiter
if you want to parse all words you can use the spaces as your delimiter then you get a row for each word

7677480
equals	gethashcode
distinct uses the default equality comparer which means you ll have to override equals and gethashcode on streetinfo for it to work

7677494
realloc	malloc
you can use malloc and realloc though if you need this facility but i would advice against that and suggest including and using std vector instead

7677496
equals	gethashcode
you could override gethashcode and equals in streetinfo - but that wouldn t be terribly nice in its existing form given that it s mutable

7677518
hide	show
currently to get each sub-menu to show and hide i use this jquery

7677539
stdio	fflush
exit will fflush the stdio output buffers but those same buffers are being managed by the parent whereas _exit will just end the process

7677602
width	height
you can get the element s client width and height by element.clientwidth and clientheight

7677602
width	height
you can set the element s width and height by assigning element.width and element.height

7677636
lisp	prolog
does anyone have any leads examples or even something vague as it is similar to prolog or perhaps it is a dialect of lisp

7677661
int	chars
but the kicker bug is that you are unloading from the stack into an int when you are closing the that should be changed to a chars which outputs a + instead of 43

7677694
vfork	posix
the current posix standard does not support vfork at all

7677694
vfork	posix
in the old 1997-ish posix standard the page for vfork said

7677741
draggable	droppable
i have two droppable containers that have draggable divs in them

7677741
draggable	droppable
the relevant code in that jsfiddle is that function where the container divs are made draggable and droppable and where the contained div elements are made draggable with containment of document

7677763
comparator	icomparer
if the parameters were passed by reference instead of by value performance with value types would be enhanced at the expense of impaired reference-type performance and of course compatibility with the existing comparator t and icomparer t

7677768
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for some reason this does not render the press release text from the json string in ie but it works fine in safari google-chrome firefox opera.

7677787
accelerometer	gyroscope
i have build an imu consisting of an accelerometer and gyroscope that can provide 6dof motion output results to pc

7677886
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome work fine with just the first line as i expected

7677887
equals	gethashcode
now overriding equals no problemo but i have some issues with gethashcode

7677919
integer	unsigned
and in unsigned __int64 0xf0000000 0xf0000000 starts off as an unsigned integer type because it cannot fit in an integer type

7677923
filesystems	fat
first off make sure you are mounting with filesystems type vfat -- and make sure your kernel is compiled to offer vfat support it s a sub-option of fat

7677930
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
i tested this on several browsers the latest firefox ie safari opera old ies - even ie6 worked and on a basic test inserting a text input with type name and maxlength attributes they all passed

7677944
width	height
you can play around with width and height percentages width and height values in options variable and even push the legend to bottom as one single line

7677949
free	realloc
you should never use realloc or any other c memory allocation functions in combination with memory allocated or free by operator new and delete or and as pointed out above

7677956
width	height
i have 4 inline-block elements with fixed width but variable content and i want all of these elements to have the same height - that of the largest element

7677985
opera	firefox
in opera firefox etc

7677992
equals	gethashcode
as others have mentioned using anonymous types is a good solution because the compiler creates the equals and gethashcode methods for you

7678003
profiler	yourkit
here are the results from yourkit profiler

7678019
free	malloc
you could write your own allocation and deallocation routines and use them instead of malloc free for the strings

7678019
free	malloc
if your routines malloc one or more big buffers and portion out little bits of it then you can free the whole lot in one go just by calling free on each big buffer

7678022
hide	show
but in the meantime the calling function has already done the hide show action

7678022
hide	show
for the dialog position not to be affected by the hide show actions those actions must happen after the dialog box closes

7678022
hide	show
the only way i could ensure that this happens was by putting the hide show calls inside the dialog button functions like this

7678040
for-loop	arrays
the variable lsresults- file is actually an arrays reference not an arrays so you have to de-reference it to iterate over it with the for-loop

7678043
int	chars
i am writing a java program that uses a treemap and the performance slows down to a crawl once there are 10 s of thousands of int chars mappings

7678043
int	chars
i was wondering if there is an implementation of some type of sorted set implementation out there that can use the int and chars primitives and has something like the headmap and tailmap functions

7678046
pull	push
once your cloned repo has these you can push or pull changes like so

7678060

this all works fine but when testing on a galaxy tab running android 3.1 i get this exception if i launch the app when the tablet is in portrait orientation

7678060
oncreate	setcontentview
it is happening on this call to setcontentview in the oncreate method of my initial activity

7678099
integer	unsigned	implements	extends
here is how gcc does it it sign extends if the integer type is larger than the pointer type this ll happen regardless of the integer being signed or unsigned just because that s how gcc decided to implements it

7678112
hide	show
and then you can use css to show hide the child elements

7678180
put	get
from what i understand is that i cannot put special symbols like but with this way i will get the hacked way prices by advanced search from home page in multiple select dropdowns

7678208
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this script is working perfectly with google-chrome and safari but firefox is bugging up for some reason

7678208
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works great in google-chrome and safari but in firefox it bugs and the keyboard nav instead only works if you re typing in an input or textarea

7678222
versioning	upgrade
even if you were using the new entity framework you still can t get visual studio etc to track changes in a database schema automatically for you you d have to track the changes between versioning manually and apply them usually when the upgrade app runs for the first time

7678303
ubuntu	linux
i m on linux using gcc my gdb version is gnu gdb ubuntu linaro 7.3-0ubuntu2 7.3-2011.08

7678337
google-chrome	safari
i m having a jquery issue in safari but not on google-chrome so it s not a webkit specific issue or is it

7678337
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the most weird thing is that this doesn t happen in google-chrome firefox or opera

7678377
put	get
if you are getting your assemblies from the command line and creating an assemblycatalog for plugin1 then you will also need to tell it about plugin2 and get that into an aggregatecatalog or put them all in a directory and use a directorycatalog you could pass the directory name on the command line

7678468
quicksort	mergesort
given a huge data set of integers what would be the advantages of using map and reduce techniques over traditional sorting algorithms such as quicksort and mergesort

7678511
imagemagick	magick++
now i m trying to do the same thing with imagemagick to be more correct with magick++

7678521
put	get
the best solution would be something like a black box so i can just feed the list of afr points and get out 12288 coefficients but i would be grateful also for multiple libraries pieces of code if only it can be put together easily

7678529
quicksort	mergesort
don t get me wrong but mapreduce actually use sorting algorithms like quicksort and mergesort to sort the input for the reduce step

7678545
int	chars
in c chars literals are of int type so

7678563
chromium	webkit.net
chrome uses webkit chromium engine while webkit.net uses cairo and openwebkitsharp nightly

7678570
qsqlquery	qsqldatabase
qsqldatabase and qsqlquery are lightweight wrappers around concrete implementations so your first example is fine

7678570
postgresql	mysql
removedatabase is equivalent to closing the file for sqlite or the connection for odbc mysql postgresql so that s typically something you would do at program termination

7678582
google-chrome	firefox
i m using jquery and flot in google-chrome and firefox

7678586
int	chars
3 chars literal type int

7678610
google-chrome	firefox
i m working on a site for a client and they ve asked for a fix for the font rendering in firefox and google-chrome not looking as good as it does in ie

7678612
hide	show
you can actually bind the column as normal but you can show hide them at runtime using jquery

7678648
stdout	stderr
redirect stdin stdout and stderr of the started process to files or pipes if you impose strict limits on runtime and number of concurrent processes

7678665
put	get
and to use the entities correctly and seamlessly with the caching i need to detach the entity from the current context before i put it in a cache and attach it back the the new context when i get it from the cache

7678668
pop-up	dialog
that is when the user clicks the button instead of the page loading onto the screen i would like for the print dialog to pop-up and allow the user to print the report directly to the printer since they are able to view the report using the separate button if they should so desire

7678672
google-chrome	firefox
my css styles are not working for some of my ids that is the styles aren t being applied or even seen by google-chrome or firefox

7678782
post	get
you can force this by passing a get post variable though it s a bit hacky

7678782
post	get
form post or even a get querystring

7678788
rubygems	bundler
c dev ruby ruby192 lib rubygems 1.9.1 bundler gems delayed_job-8efc2aa99e8b lib delayed backend base.rb 28 in

7678791
implements	extends
understand implements support and extends primarily a .net shop

7678793
width	height
doing it from onmeasure is a good way to do it even though your code doesn t work since you re not using the measure spec you ve created. you could also override onfinishinflate and call getlayoutparams and change the width and height fields

7678795
hash	md5
i came cross the similar issue that we were using java md5 hash to determine whether a file has been processed

7678846
post	get
rails also allows you to define nested resources within your routes that will give you for example post 1 comments 1 edit and in your action you basically get params post_id and params id

7678864
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
while ie does use cleartype fonts by default this can be turned off in tools internet options advanced tab multimedia settings option always use cleartype for html checkbox turning it off doesn t seem to change the fact that ie will render text slightly differently than firefox google-chrome opera etc

7678890
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
for large amounts of memory you should be using the head with malloc and or calloc and free

7678898
free	malloc
large objects whose size isn t known at compile time should be allocated via malloc which means you need to keep track of the allocation and release them with free

7678974
quicksort	mergesort
so you d express a traditional sorting algorithm like mergesort or quicksort as a map reduce if you wanted to do it as a parallel computation

7678974
quicksort	mergesort
it s not a question of is map reduce better than mergesort or quicksort because map reduce is just a tool for implementing a sorting algorithm like mergesort or quicksort in a parallel way

7678975
uiview	subviews
if i have a uiview as a subviews of the uiscrollview and this scroll view is a horizontal scroll view how do i know when the uiview the subviews is out of the uiscrollview so that i can remove it as a subviews and store it somewhere else for reuse

7679068
pull	push
second you can use tofront and toback to pull objects to the front or push them to the background

7679221
children	parent
you will get the children with classname color of the parent tag with class link

7679249
mouse	keyboard
but when i click a virtual keyboard button the mouse events seem to interfere with ime and basically just cancel the composition

7679270
google-chrome	firefox
our issue lies in that we are getting a double post back in firefox and google-chrome for some reason

7679270
hide	show
does anyone have a straight client site solution or a solution where we don t have to use an update panel to get the status or our calls to the server and show and hide an update panel

7679286
sorting	grouping
we had severe performance problems with tadvstringgrid from tms which is based on delphi tstringgrid when loading sorting grouping large grid sets but also when inserting one row at the top of the grid expanding a grid grouping node

7679301
disk	ram
when the user minimizes your application windows will eventually swap its address space to disk freeing up ram for other programs

7679352
svg	vml
obviously both are missing from ie8 and earlier but ie does support a competing format called vml which is an xml-based vector language similar to svg

7679352
svg	vml
there are javascript libraries available for ie which will render both canvas and svg graphics using ie s vml engine

7679353
opera	google-chrome
in opera it looks a bit lower that in google-chrome within a text but i wish it to be exactly by the line of text in any browser

7679426
superclass	subclassing
it looks like your subclassing isn t being set up properly as you are setting the subclassing s prototype to a concrete instance of the superclass

7679426
superclass	subclassing
i m not sure exactly what you re trying to achieve but i d wager that the subclassing constructor needs to call the superclass constructor directly something like this

7679450
getter	setter
to get this working read about getter and setter with __get and __set

7679492
children	parent
if you know that all of the elements are children of the same parent you can use the index provided by each

7679534
svg	vml
however ie does support an alternative graphics format called vml and there are javascript tools for ie which allow it to convert both svg and canvas into vml so you can use either of them and they will work in ie using these tools which makes both svg and canvas effectively cross-browser compatible

7679557
antivirus	mcafee
i need to trigger my antivirus mcafee when accessing a test-virus url via python

7679577
post	get
outside of the loop and get the post meta that way for the data i need for the body and stylesheets

7679581
ubuntu	linux
i hardly know anything about ubuntu or linux

7679603
implements	extends
in clauses 2 and 3 it is possible to create a relationship by creating a new class that extends arraylist and implements adjustmentlistener

7679635
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
i decided to choose the avfoundation and avaudioplayer for this purpose

7679650
put	get
also you should put quotes around line so you don t get burned by any pipes or semicolons hanging around

7679749
versioning	upgrade
to install upgrade versioning from ubuntu s repositries are too old

7679825
folder	directory
in my experience installing subversive prevents eclipse from copying the .svn folder to the build directory

7679859
put	get
it can take a lot of effort to even deter those who really want to get around whatever licensing you put in place

7679882
implements	extends
where noncachingfooloader simply extends fooloader and then have dbfooloader implements noncachingfooloader and wire up accordingly

7679884
int	boolean
public linkedhashmap int initialcapacity float loadfactor boolean accessorder

7679899
subtraction	addition
subtraction is not the inverse of addition

7679944
spaces	delimiter
by default awk uses spaces as its column delimiter so this simply tells awk to print out the second column

7679957
free	malloc
the c++ standard states explicitely that the c malloc and free functions must not call operator new or operator delete 20.6.13 3 and 4 in the c++11 fdis

7679971
innodb	myisam
i am using mysql database innodb and myisam both engines

7679984
free	malloc
malloc free is not necessarily compatible with new and delete

7680072
put	get
so even though your cfloop correctly skips the first 19 rows you re telling it to put the first one in the 20th position in the array so you get 19 empties before that

7680110
pop-up	dialog
when the user tries to use the app with a disabled gps a dialog pop-up

7680131
width	height
i do not want to zoom crop it i simply want the image constrained to either the width 400 or height 300 depending on orientation the image centered and the rest of the image filled with black

7680159
ubuntu	debian
rvm is a nice way to manage you ruby environments and manage multiple versions of ruby on unix based systems os x ubuntu debian

7680160
put	get
but when i do this the whole gui frames swing including their elements get frozen aftr the second put call

7680187
disk	ram
if you want to test this theory put your code into ram disk and compile it

7680193
post	get
this is a related post to this one as it deals with the same program but i now implemented it iterative and not recursive anymore but i still get sigsegv but later while running the program

7680211
backgrounding	multitasking
i ve a multitasking application and i m using all the app delegate events for backgrounding but when the device locked or idle timer expires none of the delegate events get fired

7680254
ssl	https
i have a domain mydomian.com and the host offers shared ssl so i can use https by using this address

7680325
post	get
3 set the size of the canvas to get the map displayed again it is in your post but not in the code

7680370
width	height
that value might only be used to tell datatables after this amount of scrolling render more results so you might have to create a facade that updates the sscrolly and then manually updates the css width of that table to the desired height

7680379
onclick	onsubmit
you must prevent the default action of either the form or the submit button by calling onclick onsubmit

7680457
pop-up	dialog
now i wanna be able to have a pop-up login dialog so that people don t have to be redirected too many times for authentication i preferably wanna use a jquery dialog to do that

7680490
spaces	delimiter
we have a dash and a spaces as two delimiter

7680530
google-chrome	firefox
all works fine in firefox and google-chrome but in ie 8.0 i get download progress window and after couple of seconds error

7680603
put	get	pop-up	dialog
the clicks on the login link or button at this point you will pop-up a dialog and begin an ajax call using jquery s .load function to get the html content in login.html and put it in the jquery modal s content section

7680604
post	get
you will have to use post get to send a js variable to php because php is processed by the server and js is processed by the client

7680617
calloc	malloc
the assembly output is very similar when using malloc rather than calloc

7680637
put	get
the important thing is to make sure you get back from the database exactly what you ve put in it not how is it stored in the tablespace

7680644
implements	extends
changing what a class extends or implements is a breaking-change to avoid odd run-time exceptions code should be re-compiled against the new class structure.

7680647
nunit	moq
in that context nunit and a mocking framework like moq are largely sufficient

7680687
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
i think you need a plain onclicklistener instead of an onitemclicklistener

7680712
webkit	blink
edit 2 webkit blink has line-clamp -webkit-line-clamp 2 will put ellipsis on 2nd line

7680717
plot	errorbar
however this suggests a workaround you can write a version of errorbar that uses the line command instead of the plot command to draw the errorbar thus allowing you to browse just the plot

7680725
restrict	shared
the underlying access to these resources would be shared access signature-controlled at the granularity appropriate for the objects - for example restrict only see one file in a folder or the whole folder or ability to create a file in a folder etc. can all be expressed

7680733
postgresql	mysql
here s what it looks like in mysql postgresql and sqlite

7680733
informix	firebird
in firebird and informix

7680734
postgresql	mysql
implementation of the top 1 part is t-sql mssql sybase other implementations vary but it is always possible mysql postgresql limit 1 oracle

7680770
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop checks the value of circles.length whatever that is but your arrays is called circles_test .additionally you should check with the less-than comparison because arrays are zero-based

7680803
width	height
i ve tried getting the rendered geometry bounds width and height and still the same

7680812
pop-up	dialog
my problem is once i click on the submit buttom i lose control and a download dialog pop-up

7680848
for-loop	loops
next a better way to write your for-loop is to include the increment statement in loops like so

7680881
google-chrome	safari
i never found this white line in google-chrome or safari

7680916
disk	ram
this attempts to hold the data for the file in ram if possible but it does not guarantee it -- the data could be written out to disk if memory gets low enough

7680950
hide	show
i had to look up some jquery selectors to figure this out but that doesn t disprove it s validity basically it first hide all the span elements in the element which holds them which will need an id of containerelement starts an interval for the brandchange function which fades out and hide the four current brands then fades in and show the next four brands while incrementing the i variable to keep count then it waits for the interval to happen again in five seconds

7681034
post	get
hi i am trying to convert this script that i have from the ajax get method to post method as i think that it will solve one of the problems that i am having on my website

7681046
explode	implode
alternatives - instead use some form of data that you can process more easily for example use json_encode json_decode or a classic implode explode

7681047
system.in	system.out
its generally not a good idea to close system.in or system.out

7681054
button	checkbox
in my struts2 application i d like to bind a boolean property lets call it frobbed with an isfrobbed getter on my controller to a pair of yes and no radio button i know that i could use a checkbox but for various reasons we would prefer an explicit yes and no

post	get
in my controllers using one controller for each page and creating session beans to pass information between them i have two methods one for capturing a post and one for capturing a get request method

7681080
post	get
my issue is that once they get back to the initial page that their session expired at if at the time of expiration they clicked a submit button it is redirecting them past the initial page and handling the post event from the submit

7681080
post	get
instead of following the logic of the get for the main page they are treated to the post of the main page and i m not sure where the post variables are coming from

7681113
width	height
there is an image restriction that is not documented or at least i couldn t found anything the aspect ratio limit is 1 3 when the height is bigger than the width on the image

7681164
int	chars
in c chars constants have type int in c++ they have type chars

7681166
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd

to manually correct set self.view.bounds to the right co-ordinates in your featured view s viewwillappear or viewdidload if you use manual coordinates viewdidload is fine but i think you need viewwillappear if you re using parts of self.navigationcontroller like the position of navigationbar

i have tried setting style to display inline-table on the table and it does make the textarea which is a sibling to the table in the dom show up to its right but it does not line up in ie9 opera or firefox

7681519
versioning	upgrade
i would then modify the layout files directly editing or commenting out content in files like catalog.xml page.xml checkout.xml etcâ i never liked editing these files directly as i knew that when it came time to upgrade to a newer versioning of magento that had upgrade the layout files iâ d have to merge the changes into the new layout files

7681526
width	height
the height changes on rotation but it won t fill the width

7681538
serializable	deserialization
this would work if the jsonproperty and jsonignore attributes only took affect during serializable but not deserialization however unfortunately that is not the case

7681538
serializable	deserialization
essentially the logic is that a client may provide any documenttype so during deserialization the server needs to ensure this matches the expecteddocumenttype and then during serializable when the server sends this document to the client the server knows the correct documenttype so needs to populate it with the expecteddocumenttype

7681558

the error i get is a windowserror as it can t find the file the string its passing is not what the file is known as by the windows os. i put in a try clause to allow me to work rounf it but i really like to deal with it properly

7681705
put	get
second if you put an alert hello in a script tag in the html pane then with every keypress you get an alert

portrait	landscape
i have set it up so that if the iphone is held in portrait mode nothing happens and the current image remains in landscape mode

7681849
uiview	subviews
for uiview to adjust the subviews properly you will have to take a look at this uiview property autoresizingmask and set the mask to autoresize what is needed if that does not work you will have to override

7681851
mousemove	mouseup
i was having trouble with losing the mousemove event outside of the parent container and found some code to bind the mousemove and mouseup functions to the document instead of the element

i apologize for the length of this post but i ve tried to include an appropriate level of detail to explain the issue well enough to get some help

7681946
post	get
yes you should never rely on a get variable or even a hidden post variable to say sure let me in i m a valid user

7681946
post	get
also you may already know this but the default method of transferring is get so be sure to specify method post in the form tag

7681968
ironruby	ironpython
all i can find at the moment are ironruby and ironpython

7681986
post	get
the main idea behind post redirect get as the article you linked to points out is to avoid users resubmitting data most of the time

7681993
setinterval	settimeout
i m using settimeout because i heard that setinterval will cause loops to overlap if one isn t finished yet

7682014
post	get
prg or post redirect get is just a pattern you can use to prevent the message boxes

7682051
postgresql	mysql
it is better to use postgresql but if you want to use mysql innodb then probably you ll need a workaround for loading fixtures with forward references the bugfix is already present in django trunk and i ve also ported it to django 1.3.1 see django 1.3.1.1 on github

7682063
google-chrome	firefox
i got a solution for firefox and ie but i didn t find any solution for google-chrome

7682067
hide	fadeout
to fadeout a complete website you might want to hide the or tag

7682074
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome seems to be the fastest browser but usually firefox is not far behind but ie is still slow

7682107
stopwatch	nstimer
if you programming a stopwatch you could use the nstimer to display the results to the user while an nirtimer one of my favorite classes keeps track of time

7682116
onresume	onpause
this is further complicated because this is an activity in a tabhost and tabhosts call both onpause and onresume every time you load a view so this breaks lifecycle functions

7682133
for-loop	loops
i tried wrapping the for-loop around the linkitself but it obviously breaks hell as it is reused in a loops creating a loops within a loops and destroying my layout

7682181

you re assigning directly to artworkinfo in viewdidload instead of using the properties accessor which would ensure that the array is properly retained

7682249
activemq	rabbitmq
if you want to use the same model as what you described with activemq installing brokers on both your client and server machines then install the two brokers and connect them using the rabbitmq shovel plugin

7682259
post	get	helpers	actioncontroller
there is also a actioncontroller testcase helpers that adds for methods like get post etc

7682260
superclass	subclassing
actually the error happened because it wasn t using the methods of the subclassing cause they were implemented up in the superclass that s why it wo

7682293
width	height
this image control is height 600 and width 800

7682311
post	get
i think rather than connect to a database remotely you want to use rest services to get and post data to your remote database

7682311
post	get
in your android app you can do an http get or post to consume the aforementioned service

7682369
jquery	scriptaculous
since you are loading scriptaculous after jquery it is overwriting the alias to jquery

7682380
client-side	server-side
i could find server-side example and could not find client-side example with it

7682381
int	double	int	boolean
remember arrays are never automatically initialized in java unless they are arrays of int floats double or boolean

7682389
mouseup	mousedown
coulda sworn this wasn t how it used to work but with jquery my click event is firing even if i return false on both mousedown and mouseup

7682398
subtract	add
you don t actually need the since you re subtract but i ve included it on the assumption that at some point you might want to add 1 at which point you ll run into string concatenation issues unless you convert the string to a number first.

7682403
mouseup	mousedown
because a click event is a mousedown followed by a mouseup

7682488
hide	show
what is the best way to show hide text field based on drop down selection in rails3

7682501
int	chars
mysql_real_escape_string is pointless - after int there will be no bad chars

7682529
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome and firefox it looks great

7682539
g++	gcc
if you really want wraparound pass -fwrapv to g++ or gcc when compiling

7682607
ccscene	cclayer
let the parent of the label take care of that i m assuming a cclayer or ccscene object

7682618
floating-point	integer
this invokes floating-point division instead of integer division

7682660
gridview	sqldatasource
when using a gridview with a sqldatasource alot of the work is done for you as long as you set up correctly

7682683
cgsize	cgrect
nsvalue can also deal with cgsize and cgrect using similar way

7682686
maven	pom.xml
these are my dependencies in the maven pom.xml

7682709
accessor	properties
you use retain in two situations 1 in the implementation of an accessor method or an init method to take ownership of an object you want to store as a properties value

7682720
hide	show
basically you hook into the drop-down s change event and when that happens you check the value of the drop-down and either show or hide the text-field based on what was selected in the drop-down

7682721
post	get
i ll update this post later as i get a better understanding of the problem

7682742
int	double	int	boolean
mongo uses special data types in addition to the basic json types of string int boolean double null array and object

7682772
width	height
it is able to get the width height after loading the image

7682772
width	height
but once you alter the width it still logs the old height

7682810
google-chrome	firefox
an interesting side-effect of the problem was that firefox and google-chrome didn t seem load the css file

7682810
google-chrome	firefox
viewing the css in google-chrome or firefox would show chinese characters

7682861
width	height
you didn t change the height yet because your image s height width make

7682861
width	height
when you change the width in ie8 it will only resize the width but in chrome it will both change the width and height i think this is browser depended

7682878
minimum	max
i want to limit the value of angle to minimum -pi 3 and max pi 3

7682901
post	get
now that i ve added the form collection to my post actionresult and get the selected value using

7682907
post	get
there is a nice pattern called post redirect get

7682907
post	get
this basically means the submit will post to the form it ll do it s work and after finishing will ask the browser to redirect to itself response.redirect then the next request will be a normal get request

7682914
width	height
now i am having problems with resizing adjusting width height of the grouped select

7682914
width	height
this is my code to position it on the screen even if i add width and height to this it seems like it is not updating

7682922
mongodb	bson
mongodb stores data in a binary format called bson which supports these numeric data types

7682922
mongodb	bson	floating-point	integer
it s worth mentioning that the mongodb shell - being a javascript shell - doesn t recognise the distinction between integer and floating-point values it treats all numbers the same because javascript represents all numbers as 64-bit floating point regardless of their underlying bson type

7682943
width	height
instead of setting width height you can try to set image.style.maxwidth image.style.maxheight then image will resize with preserving aspect ratio

7683044
integer	unsigned
bytes 0 and 1 an opcode of the type uint16_t an unsigned integer always 2 bytes long

7683053
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
now it looks perfect on firefox or google-chrome but when i look at it on mobile safari it has these weird semi-transparent boxes going from the right of the container all the way off screen

7683074
portrait	landscape
for phones a vertical scroll makes sense as apps are usually used in portrait mode but on tablets when in landscape a left to right scroll seems much more usable then a top to bottom scroll

what i do is before animation i put buffer view in the right position then simply changes the both views frame origin to get the animation effect

7683201
getter	setter
that gives you a private-by-visibility support class only available in your implementation with an instance variable and setter getter methods on your class that are not visible outside the compilation unit either

7683233
put	get
if you don t want to put that in the __unicode__ method which does get used for other things you can easily put it in some separate method and directly call that one rather than implicitly calling the __unicode__ one

7683282
int	double
you need to call next on resultset before using the getxxx methods where xxx can be int string double etc.

7683285
children	parent
the parent process at each level should break out of the loop after launching the second right child and wait for its children to die

7683289
width	height
overflow hidden will not clip contents unless it has limited width and height

7683300
prepare	execute
so change this and prepare query when you received response in doget function after that execute it

7683332
width	height
setframe - position the button relative to its container and set the size for usability reasons the width and height should be at least 44 pixels as mentioned here

7683336
ienumerable	ienumerator	ienumerable	idictionary	idictionary	ienumerator
foreach on an idictionary will use the idictionary.getenumerator function which returns an idictionaryenumerator internally this tells the ienumerator function on the internal enumerator class which type to return. whereas the cast function operates on ienumerable which will make it return a keyvaluepair

7683366
factors	matrix
you want to use blas for basic linear algebra operations like summing or multiplying two matrix and lapack for more computational intensive algorithms like factors matrix

7683496
width	height
then you should not worry about the height of the width because the div1 would be extended based on its contents

7683509
pop-up	dialog
i d like to be able to add an option to the download dialog that pop-up in firefox when starting a file download

you ll need to you can change the width height as you see fit and determine the x and y coordinates from the head tracking

7683562
width	height
is there any way to get width value and height value dynamically please let me know it

7683581
ceil	floor
if your values aren t the decimal n 2 that they appear to be then you might want to pull out round floor or ceil to make your desired rounding or truncation explicit

this properties is inherited from cim_processor

7683613
width	height
jquery has multiple ways to get the css height and width of an object

can anyone give me a practical case in which i want my custom-exception class to have serializable and deserialization

7683793
unix	solaris
it seems that all the major investment banks use c++ in unix linux solaris for their low latency high frequency server applications

7683806
typedef	struct
for example it may not be reasonable to use a simple typedef to mimic a windows event object on unix so you might use a container struct for events.

7683868
clang	llvm
because this couldn t be compiled on iphone with gcc llvm clang i want to removed c++11 features from it

7683883
actualheight	actualwidth
neither will change actualwidth or actualheight as this would influence the inner layout of the object that s being transformed rendereing the transform operation useless

mkannotationview	mapkit
the problem now is how to display a beautiful annotation view like the mkannotationview from mapkit the callout bubble - marker balloons

7683944
lwjgl	jogl
instead you should try and use one of the existing 2d libraries like swing or 3d libraries like opengl with jogl or lwjgl as java bindings - note that it doesn t have to be 3d with opengl

7683950
equals	gethashcode
you need you implement equals and gethashcode for the license class otherwise sequenceequal will not work

7683952

clang	llvm
the apple llvm 2.1 is actually that clang is the front-end and llvm is the back-end right

7684360
ubuntu	debian
my suggestion would be debian or ubuntu

7684392
client-side	server-side
i would write a client-side javascript function that calls a server-side method through an ajax call through jquery.ajax

7684484
width	height
the canvas is set to have a width of 30 and height of 4 but when i run this it ignores the width and height of the canvas and the resulting window is sized around the label instead

how would i create a gui where all the frames and the window are sized to the canvas size of width 30 and height 4

the error says that it cannot convert from superclass to subclassing but everywhere i look heads first design patterns etc. i can see it this way return as type the superclass of created subclasses.

7684609
superclass	subclassing
the error says that it cannot convert from superclass to subclassing

7684609
int	double
it s the same reason you can t store a number in an int for instance the number could actually be a double

7684620
superclass	subclassing
if you get a subclassing you can assign it to a superclass variable if we assume subclassing extends superclass

7684623
centos	linux
this is centos 6.0 on linux 2.6.32

7684628
superclass	subclassing
as the method returns superclass you cant directly assign it to a subclassing

7684630
superclass	subclassing
you could explicitely cast the return value to subclassing which will fail as soon as the factory returns another subclassing of superclass and will throw an exception during runtime

nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
you can use nsdate nsdatecomponents nscalendar the date programming guide gives a pretty thorough explanation

ssl	https	versioning	upgrade
i did find make a connection to a https server from java and ignore the validity of the security certificate as well as disable certificate validation in java ssl connections but the accepted answer to the first is for httpclient 4.0 unfortunately i cannot upgrade unless someone can point me in the direction of how to use two different versioning of that same library within the same project although it does have another answer with little more than a dead link that supposedly went to a 3.x solution

7684654
ssl	https
the code at the second page seems to have no effect at all when i use a slightly adjusted version of it basically declaring the classes in the old fashion rather than using anonymous ones inline as well as applying to tls in addition to ssl using ssl for the default https socket factory as done in the example code

int	double
you may use int or fix functions but return value type of these functions is double so you have to convert it to int if option strict is on

7684773
integer	unsigned
as long as you do your arithmetic in unsigned integers or else can rely on implementation-specific guarantees about how signed integer overflow behaves there are various tricks you can use

setinterval	settimeout
i would suggest any setinterval is too many you should always use settimeout instead

7693994
int	chars
i have an int int the range 0-255 and i want to create a string of length 1 so that the ascii value of this single chars is the specified int

7694012
int	chars
assuming the int is as you say between 0 and 255 you ll get an array with a single chars back from character.tochars which will become a single-character string when passed to string.valueof

7694012
int	chars
using character.tochars is preferable to methods involving a cast from int to chars chars i for a number of reasons including that character.tochars will throw an illegalargumentexception if you fail to properly validate the int while the cast will swallow the error per the narrowing primitive conversions specification potentially giving an output other than what you intended

7694015
stdout	stderr
normally a process will start out with file descriptors 0 1 and 2 assigned to stdin stdout and stderr and the first file descriptor that you explicitly open will be 3 so you ll get away with it

7694021
public	protected
the protection classes public protected and private exist to provide protection for data

7694027
public	protected
having declared as protected the static variable can only be accessed with in it s member functions and it s derived classes public protected inheritance

7694050
integer	unsigned
not that i think this is a good idea but in c at least you can check if your unsigned integer is greater than int_max for two s complement anyway not so sure about the sign magnitude and one s complement variants but they re probably rare enough that you could safely ignore them until a problem pops up

7694050
integer	unsigned
this is of course assuming it was read in as an integer and converted to unsigned somewhere - if you use customised input routines expecting only unsigned numbers they may barf at the presence of a leading - sign

7694055
maven	m2e
i am used to m2e workspace dependency resolution for plain java maven projects and i d love to see something similar working with grails

7694055
maven	m2e
as far as i know that s a feature coming from m2e but enabling this one on the grails project just causes sts to crash and i assume that it would still conflict with grails even if i would use the grails maven plugin

7694056
integer	unsigned
use columndefinition attribute and set it to integer unsigned

7694085
equals	charat
i am trying to get all 0 values to equals 11 in the array of nums and print bob every time it does that but for some reason the first if statement doesnt seem to be executing even when charat i equals 0

7694106
int	chars
you compared int and chars my mistake

7694162
webkit	gecko
it s important to note that with the invention of tools like firebug gecko and inspector webkit you don t need to download modify and the view the html page

7694186
google-chrome	firefox
it renders correctly in google-chrome and firefox but ie 7 butchers it

7694201
g++	gcc
i should clarify that i m using gcc g++ 4.4.5

7694201
g++	gcc
however with gcc g++ 4.4.5 this gives invalid use of pack expansion expression

7694201
g++	gcc
it s great that this works in osx clang but is there a way to do this in gcc g++

7694210
hash	md5
however it does have libraries for md5 and sha1 hash and rsa encryption

7694210
hash	md5
from what i understand to verify the certificate first compute the sha1 hash or md5 of the certificate

7694210
hash	md5
sha1 hash produces a 20 byte value and md5 produces 16 byte value

7694252
pop-up	dialog
i want a service to pop-up a custom alert dialog

7694252
pop-up	dialog
a if i can pop-up an alert dialog from a service simply haven t tried yet dont know what context to give it

7694252
pop-up	dialog
c if i can pop-up an alert dialog from outside the app it is a niche application the users will be expecting pop-up alerts

7694294
google-chrome	firefox
for example firefox with firebug or google-chrome with its developer tools

7694365
width	height
otherwise its width and height will be zero and so it won t show

7694365
uiview	subviews
there is a tree if views class uiview and their subviews

7694365
uiview	uiwindow
the root of the tree is uiwindow mainwindow notice that uiwindow is a subclass of uiview

7694365
uiview	calayer
each uiview has a layer property of type calayer which actually holds its visible content

7694365
uiview	calayer
uiview is just a wrapper around calayer to add things like touch handling ability

7694377
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
you can add annotations specific for code generation this only works for svcutil.exe not for xsd.exe to your xsd file

7694377
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
if you use svcutil.exe instead of xsd.exe then the generated code will by slightly different

7694378
implements	extends
when i try get the methods to be implements while implements a interface or extends a abstract class i have tried using the eclipse feature to auto generate the method skeletons for the to override implements methods and it never worked for me but the compiler complains that methods need to be overridden

7694416
hash	md5
when you want to break a md5 password what you really want to do is a first preimage attack find any password m such that hash m matches stored hash h

7694449
post	get
posting news items only by friends was slightly different because i was getting data directly from the database and using select subqueries to only get post by friends of the current user

7694484
profiling	debugging
it s got intellisense debugging profiling etc.

7694503
jobs	cron
the best option would be cron jobs

7694517
hide	show
i m not sure how well this would work but possibly you could write a subclass of whichever class is causing the keyboard to be show ex edittext where you either track when the keyboard is show or take over the calls to show and hide the keyboard overriding at least onkeyup and ontouchevent

7694521
ant	maven
i m a maven newbie have been studying maven for a week now have 5 years experience using ant so i m able to come up to speed without trouble

7694558
folder	directory
for example i have a folder called media inside my public directory on my rails app i want nginx to serve public media index.html when mysite.com media of mysite.com media is requested

7694617
portrait	landscape
this could be possible even if your app is locked in landscape orientation for instance - occasionally a portrait draw could still happen - even if it s not visible to the end user

7694649
apache	nginx
right now the dev server setup has nginx and apache

7694649
apache	nginx
it seems node is not like apache or nginx where there s an independent server that serves up code

7694649
apache	nginx
but if this is becoming a blockage to our current infrastructure i m willing to try other technologies and servers that is similar to how nginx or apache works--so that it is independent of the app code and can be compatible with our current development environment

7694653
getter	setter
if not can you make sure the getter and setter are correct

7694676
hash	md5
md5 and sha1 are one way hash

7694676
hash	salt
it is merely obtaining hash values of a string that has been encrypted with a salt key three times

7694698
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
that s the whole point of inherited to be able to use in superclass behavior that is refined in subclassing

7694704
folder	directory
you could monitor parent directory and set filter property to your folder s name to get only events for the folder and set includesubdirectories to true

7694709
lxml	beautifulsoup
use a parser either lxml or beautifulsoup

7694714
put	get
it strikes me that i need to first get the latest version of the two sites from svn put them where

7694729
hash	salt
a salt must be unique for each hash password

7694774

clang	llvm
i tested with a relatively recent build of clang llvm

7694937
setcontentview	findviewbyid
setcontentview r.layout.something put this first after write findviewbyid function then you will not find this null pointer exception

7694939
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you need to call setcontentview before findviewbyid or it will return null

7694948
ceil	floor
when i use functions like floor abs ceil and other simple floating point operations i get warnings about values being truncated

7694954
children	parent
this function gets passed all the information it needs to create a new board and then it should add the pointer to that new board to the end of the parent board s children list

7694964
folder	directory
on the other hand if your javaloader is on a different hard drive and tucked away deep in folder then you ll have to change directory to get to it

7695030
explode	implode
of course you can use implode and explode to convert between the two output formats

7695032
button	checkbox
i want to create custom button in table view.in that by clicking on that button the label will be create with current date.in that button i also have to implement checkbox functionality

7695094
nhibernate	queryover	nhibernate	massive
but using a native sql query like this is not a good idea becouse here comes the beauty of nhibernate this what we should use nhibernate for to eleminate these massive sql statements and to express our tables in some oop flavor.so for a basic query like this you better use hql query language or queryover .look at your sql statement how much lines you wrote but with nhibernate you could do that with a few words you only use native sql statement for the queries you couldn t achieve with nhibernate

7695120
uiview	subviews
i want stuff that drawrect draws appear above the subviews of my custom uiview

7695183
uiview	calayer
each uiview has a calayer that its content is drawn in and that layer has several implicit animtions setup to animated changes to certain properties such as the frame or position properties

7695191

to restate i m trying to modify what a button does based on whichever checkbox is ticked basically i m just trying to change what file it operates on

7695302
pull	push
i have been able to push and pull from both public and private repositories

7695345
setcontentview	findviewbyid
looking at your code it looks like you are trying to findviewbyid before you have set the content of this activity by calling setcontentview r.layout.main

7695345
setcontentview	findviewbyid
make sure you call setcontentview before you try any findviewbyid

7695442
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox safari google-chrome all is well but in ie the forms lack their box-shadow

7695449

however it knows that gt2 returns boolean and expected an int

7695544
int	chars
chr x returns the ascii chars with int index of x

7695560
unix	bsd	pthreads	fcntl
the other answers cover perl flock locking pretty well but on many unix linux systems there are actually two independent locking systems bsd flock and pthreads fcntl -based locks

7695560
fcntl	fork
fcntl provides range-level locking within a file and network locking over nfs but locks are not inherited by child processes after a fork

7695560
sysv	systemd
sometimes sysv systemd flock is emulated using lockf or fcntl

7695561
hide	show
actually for show hide i am using uiview animation

7695584
aggregate-functions	sum
also if you are using any aggregate-functions like sum max etc then you cannot use where clause on the field in this case the field is uniqueid which is being used in the group by clause

innodb	myisam
innodb is good for creating reliable data-driven web application and myisam is good for performance

7695792
uiview	subviews
depending on your specific requirements you may need to have a plain uiview as the background container view with your existing subviews in there and then your custom view as another subviews added to the very top so it has the highest z-order

7695818
innodb	myisam
for example is a statistical thing myisam can answer instantly while innodb actually does a count

7695825
textview	imageview
and i am using a baseadapter class to put the data into the appropriate places of the listview which consists of an imageview and four textview but i don t think that is relevant now

inherited	properties
i ve tried inheriting the classes to add a new properties id so each stroke+polyline has the same id but i cannot inherited because these are sealed classes

7695937
post	get
edit 2 you should probably implement some sort of tracking for the traffic you get from facebook custom links etc. and use that as a metric and not wall post for individual users where there are numerous reasons on why the post might not appear

7695948
versioning	upgrade
it has a servlet listener which can automatically upgrade the database when a new versioning of my app is deployed

7695966
udp	tcp
udp headers has no info for ordering and there is no guarantee that some won t get lost more info so you have to provide your own ordering in the payload or switch to tcp

7696079
solaris	bsd
the file system structure of not only linux but any posix-compatible system including bsd solaris and to a lesser degree even mac os x are standardized in the fhs

7696079
ubuntu	debian
specifically for ubuntu have a look at the debian policy for java and the packaging guide of the ubuntu-java team

7696086
width	height
this should return the correct width and height

7696086
width	height
so the width and height is not calculated yet

7696086
width	height
to get the height and width

7696104

maven	pom.xml
i am trying to deploy my web-application to tomcat using maven 3.x here is the snap shot of the pom.xml file

7696196
equals	gethashcode
in this case it is probably better to use other methods than equals and gethashcode to implement this kind of equality as it really changes over time

7696246
width	height
most examples out there specify exactly the width and height of the popup window

7696246
width	height
i want them to be wrap_content - since the content is dinamically determined so in the constructor i set -2 for both width and height and show it via showasdropdown view anchor

7696277
winpcap	pcap.net
pcap.net uses c++ cli to wrap winpcap which is considered more efficient than pinvoke

7696282

7696330
awt	swing	children	parent
part of the problem is an impedance mismatch between the locale resolve mechanism between awt vs swing the former resolves up the parent chain expecting most of the children to have a null locale property the latter explicitly sets the default as returned by jcomponent.getdefaultlocale very early in its life in jcomponent constructor

7696333
int	double	int	boolean
double precision floating point this handles int longs dates times currency etc string boolean error

my first bit of code is to allow users to select single and multiple files using keyboard commands arrows and shift and mouse click and shift click

7696359
post	get
after processing a post request redirect to another page using get

7696363
getter	setter
anything a getter setter does a public field does better

7696363
getter	setter
first if you want public data make it public get rid of the getter setter methods to reduce the number of methods the client has to wade through and make it cognitively simpler for the client to change it s value by eg

7696363
getter	setter
where the client must now check the getter setter method to see if it has any side-effects

7696363
getter	setter
imho the moral is to name methods to say exactly what they do follow the srp and get rid of getter setter

7696363
getter	setter
if there s problems without getter setter tell objects to do their own dirty work inside their own class instead of trying to do things with them in other classes

7696367
viewdidload	dealloc
i just made then an assigment in viewdidload and release in dealloc

7696398

quicksort	shellsort
bubble sort provided much better performance than others such as shellsort quicksort and a native javascript functionality

7696525
spaces	delimiter
i do the assumption that views are stored in a single cell spaces delimiter and if a view consist of more that one word - are place in between for example city-center

7696551
width	height
this seems fairly easy with absolutelayout since i can get at runtime the defaultdisplay s width and height and so i can position objects in an absolutelayout relative to the display metrics

7696669
memset	malloc
until you call malloc you don t own what it s pointing at so you can t really memset it

7696675
post	get
because you haven t mention method type either use post or get by default it will use get method

7696729
children	parent
the contacts list file has elements without groups so some children will be without parent

you can switch the view shown in activity using setcontentview method you can call setcontentview in onclientclick callback.so that whole you can switch between gridview and listview

7696772
for-loop	loops
put the contents of the for-loop in another function and call it in loops

7696807

pthreads	fcntl
the pthreads approach is to set your file descriptors with the fd_cloexec flag using fcntl 2

7696855
pthreads	fcntl
stock lua doesn t have the fcntl feature but it s possible to add it with the lua pthreads module as introduced in previous answers

7696876
width	height
i m making a one page site with sticky navigation on center top with width at about 1000px and height of about 20-25px now i also included a smooth scroll function but my problem is whenever the page scrolls to it s active page the title hid under the sticky nav how do i get the offset of the bottom of the sticky navigation

7696958
rtp	rtsp
are you streaming rtp over rtsp have you checked the use rtp over rtsp tcp option in vlc

7696958
rtp	rtsp
you can check this in vlc under the preferences input codecs- demuxers- rtp rtsp

7696958
rtp	rtsp
if so- if you are not doing rtp over rtsp then you would also need to forward the ports for the media which is not the same as the rtsp port 554 or 8554

7696958
rtp	rtsp
if you do rtp over rtsp the media is interleaved over 554 or 8554 and you don t have to worry about this

7696958
rtp	rtsp
you can run it from the command line and specify -t for rtp over rtsp which is basically what the vlc option does

7696958
tunnel	packets
you can specify -t for http tunnel etc and it allows you to write captured media packets to file etc

7697068
filewriter	printwriter
i used a printwriter instead of a filewriter to get the line endings correct

7697076
mkmapview	mapkit
you probably won t use mkmapview and mapkit for that but the google maps static api that allows you to download static images even with pins on it directly

7697084
width	height
so the parent width height won t be affected by this child s size

7697179

fprintf - anyway libudev as of version 172 has a nifty little function that when enumerating devices it auto-binds the search enumeration to a single parent and returns only it s children

7697280
division	multiplication
this register - memory location is automatically used by the multiplication and division operators and normally called the extended accumulator register

7697307
getter	setter
and on the server-side you could handle things either in the setter when requestfactory applies the property diff and calls the setter if the value is different from the true version then throw an exception or in the service methods compare the version sent from the client â which you d get from a different getter than the one mapped on the client as that one must always return null â to the true version of the object and raise an error if they don t match

if all else fails measure the width and height of the textview and then use setwidth and setheight as expected

7698709
width	height
okay so i took your code you posted and verbatim tried it on my device and you were right it didn t work because when android is determining which views to layout to put it in it relies on the width and height you provided

7698709
width	height
what that means is since you are using 0 and 0 as your width and height android will come along and say oh look the box is only a 0 by 0 box so i can display it as a popup below the content. this isn t what is desired though

7698709
