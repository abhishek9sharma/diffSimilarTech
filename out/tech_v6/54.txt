background please note that the web app works just fine in all browsers i tested firefox google-chrome ie but the warning appearing in google-chrome is bugging the hell outta me

7108716

if this was a web form i might suggest having combobox2 as two separate comboboxes and hide show the one you need

7108780
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome supposed been working +- but firefox seems having some problem always loading when i open the dialog

7108861

carrierwave	paperclip
i ve done some thorough research and found that alot of these plugins such as carrierwave paperclip and a few others are used to upload photos and i am not trying to do this

7109008
carrierwave	paperclip
both carrierwave and paperclip can be used to upload any type of files - they have extra features if you want to upload images but they are not restricted to handling just image files

7109008
carrierwave	paperclip
i found both paperclip and carrierwave to be very good at what they do

7109028

you can have a wrapper to the element you are trying to fadein fadeout and provide an appropriate height to this wrapper element

7109034
width	height
i am fetching data from server side and assign data into lightface dialog but the problem is dialog s height and width is not getting bigger according to the content size

7109062
client-side	server-side
the client-side doesn t keep a cache that was probably the case in the early iterations a year ago though but has never been the case in non-milestones releases and the server-side is responsible for firing the events you ll see them in the json response payload

7109094
bcel	cglib
other options would be to do it programmatically using commons bcel or cglib

7109101
readonly	temporary
because an anonymous type is readonly anyway is would be more efficient if they implemented them as structs so that linq queries doesn t need to create tons of temporary objects

7109118
openfeint	scoreloop
i too evaluated openfeint and scoreloop

7109120
google-chrome	firefox
when i run this in firefox or google-chrome the drop down has the newly inserted blank option selected

i have ojdbc14.jar in a lib folder in the same project and i added it to the build path of my project so it also resides in the referenced libraries directory but yet i still get an output to the console of could not find the database driver

7109152
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt

7109248
google-chrome	firefox
the above fiddle demonstrates the issue in firefox 5 and google-chrome 13

7109283
width	height
therefore the dialogbox gets set on a width and height before the content is determined

7109283
width	height
if this is not helping try to set width and height to auto and see what happens

7109283
width	height
setting width and height programmatically

7109286

7109513
google-chrome	firefox
i tested on firefox ie8 and google-chrome

7109519
hide	show
put all 8 input fields on the page and use jquery to show hide the fields based on the selected number in the select box

7109679
jsf	wicket	jsf	stripes	wicket	stripes
further there exist mvc frameworks which removes all the boilerplate duplicated repeated servlet code for this kind of use cases such as jsf spring mvc wicket stripes struts2 etc

7109679
jax-ws	jax-rs
or to go a step further use a webservice framework instead such as jax-ws or jax-rs which do this job transparently like a mvc framework does for html pages

7109682

custom content is created as uibutton and uilabel that are added as subviews of the cell s contentview

7109810
pull	push
the ci server can then pull the last commit s compile and test them and only if this passes push them to the main repository

7109819
yacc	bison
it s also used by other tools that generate c source code such as lex flex and yacc bison so that error messages can refer to the input file rather than the temporary generated c code

7109826
google-chrome	firefox
these links work fine in latest versions of google-chrome and firefox so i m pretty sure this is an ie quirk

7109834

why not trying using the show and hide methods

7110035
public	protected

7110158
organization	naming
i think that choosing naming strategy for tests is at least as important as test code organization

7110162

inherited	properties
i recently inherited some c# code where nearly every item in a file was wrapped in an individual #region #endregion block -- every class every function every properties every enum but not the fields

7110823
mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseout	mouseleave
when you mouseout the image without mouseover the navigation then the navigation needs to hide as of right now it stays open until you either mouseover the image again or mouseleave the navigation

7110823
hide	show	mouseover	mouseleave
second problem is when you mouseleave the navigation directly to mouseover the image it loops the function and hide the nav then opens the nav again i ve tried changing slidetoggle to show but that causes a whole bunch of other issues

7111112
stdout	stderr
i believe stdout and stderr point to the bit bucket when there is no console connected to them so just writing to cout or cerr is harmless though i wonder if the output literally sits in some location in the pagefile swapfile wasting space

7111186
stdout	stderr
but nobody here has explained what the difference between stderr and stdout is so i feel obligated to at least touch on the topic

7111202
stdout	stderr
in many systems including windows and unixes there are two standard output streams stdout and stderr

i have implemented two radio buttons within a table and they appear correctly in all versions of google-chrome and firefox but show incorrectly in ie7 and ie9 see below

7111393
children	parent
if it s multiple parent-child inserts which is why you are using a transaction - although i see no indication of this because you do not seem to be saving a parent id for children creation could this possibly be done with a table-valued parameter to a stored proc which does the entire transaction in a single call - begin transaction insert parent insert children commit transaction

getter	setter
now the compiler will generate the setter but not the getter it will use the getter you provided you can still use it with self.color

7112535

the question about range of max subarray is already managed by the class vector

7115671
ubuntu	centos
i have discovered that building the module on centos and then copying the binary over to ubuntu and it works

7117615
strcpy	memmove
you might have noticed that the code in xstrdup used memmove instead strcpy

7117615
memcpy	memmove
i used memmove because it can never go wrong even if the strings overlap even though in this context it is clear that the strings can never overlap and so memcpy - which is not guaranteed to work correctly if the strings overlap - could have been used since the strings cannot overlap

7117633

7119045
x86	64bit
to note this may change depending if your using a 64bit machine or a 32 bit machine but the 64bit emgu version will not run on x86 machines

7119054
hash	salt
then when the user enters the password encrypt the user input with the same hash function and salt and compare the encrypted values

7119066
hash	md5
what you re doing here is getting the md5 hash of the password rather than decrypting it

7119066
hash	md5
one use of the md5 hash is to store the hash in the database instead of storing the user s password

7119066
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
have a look at this question for an example md5 hash with salt for keeping password in db in c#

7119176
hash	md5
like the other users have said before md5 is a one-way hash algorithm

7119176
hash	md5
the best you can do is to guess the password hash it with md5 and compare it to the hash

7119176
hash	salt
and if a salt was used when generating the hash then it will take even more time

7119176
hash	salt
a good article on bad passwords hash salt rainbow tables...etc

7119500
int	chars
if you enter the chars a you will get a or 0x41 returned upgraded to an int and assuming you re on an ascii system of course

7119500
int	chars
the reason it returns an int rather than a chars is because it needs to be able to store any chars plus the eof indicator where the input stream is closed

7119505
textview	imageview
however i am not able to see imageview and textview

7119512
int	chars
the c chars type is 8 bits which means it can store the range of int from -128 to 127 255 distinct values

7119590
int	chars
unlike some other languages you may have used chars in c are int

7119590
int	chars
chars is just another int type usually 8 bits and smaller than int but still an int type

7119590
ord	chr
so you don t need ord and chr functions that exist in other languages you may have used

7119590
int	chars
in c you can convert between chars and other int types using a cast or just by assigning

7119590
int	chars	getchar	fgetc
unless eof occurs getchar is defined to return an unsigned chars converted to an int same as fgetc so if it helps you can imagine that it reads some chars c then returns int unsigned chars c

7121938
distance	altitude
a negative verticalaccuracy signifies that altitude is invalid whereas normally a smaller but positive value of verticalaccuracy actually means that altitude is more precise since it s the vertical distance that it may be off by - i ll leave the discussion as to why this measure is called verticalaccuracy and not verticalinaccuracy for some other time

7121957

i was reading about the newer python amqp library puka not to be confused with pika and was wondering if the way it handles it s event loop would be compatible with gevent or eventlet

7122995
eventlet	gevent
based on my limited knowledge it seems like you could automatically patch it with gevent eventlet

7123010
pascal	delphi
of these innosetup uses a pascal variant as its scripting language and so is a very popular choice amongst delphi developers

7123027
hash	md5
where value is the hex-encoded value of your md5 hash

7123027
hash	salt
you should only store salt hash passwords in the database

i usually bumble for several hours and never get anywhere so i d like to put the question out here with my real-world example

7123273
google-chrome	safari
that works on all modern browsers ff4+ google-chrome safari ie8 and ie9+

win7 width 7 height 21 --- width returned is wrong

7123334
button	checkbox
regarding your removal feature you could just use a checkbox or even a submit button like

7123396
jtextfield	jtable
why not using autocomplete combobox jtextfield and if you don t want to display jcombobox then there is autocompleted jtextfield and for somehow reduced autosuggestions would be better look for undecorated jdialog window with jtable with one tablecolum and without tableheaded in the jscrollpane just with plain rowsorter very simle job

7123412
width	height
if i understand correctly you need to check the modulo of px and py and set the width and height according to it

7123470
apache	nginx
whilst it is possible to make post request with node i think the pattern you re describing is better suited to using a a server like nginx or apache in front of both node.js and django and proxying requests to whichever port is appropriate based on the request

7123473
tunnel	vpn
suggest another secure alternative - the only thing i could think of is to set up the vpn with them on a non-azure server and then tunnel the requests through using azure connect - which is obviously extra work for us and also defeats the point of hosting the service on a cloud if it depends on a non-cloud service

7123544
floating-point	integer
contrary to dense factorisation sparse methods always include a non-negligible amount of integer work in addition to the floating-point work done though the floating-point is still dominant

7123586
post	get
when i try and post json data through the chrome extension simple rest client i get a 500 internal server error stating the document does not have a valid root

7123602
int	chars
many languages will either stop on the first chars that cannot be represented as an int the letter a will blindly convert all chars into their ascii value the letter a becomes 97 or will ignore chars that cannot be represented as int and only convert the ones that can - or return 0 empty

7123629
hide	show
i want to query the hide show status of parameters of a report

7123638
inherited	subclassing
i m trying to determine what the best practice is regarding the storage and access to class data so that it can be inherited and potentially extended by a subclassing

7123673
google-chrome	firefox
this is working in firefox and google-chrome but not ie 8

7123674
int	chars
many most languages represent strings on some level or another as an array or list of chars which are also short int

7123674
multiplying	add
starting from the left you multiplying your current total by 10 add the next character s value and move on

7123674
int	chars
i suppose that since most int have limited bits 32 or 64 usually you know that it will come to a certain number of chars at most in a string 20

7123685
width	height
the following assumes that the width and height of the image is known

7123685
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
update in modern browsers margin auto will produce the desired result withing knowing the width height of the image

7123699
inherited	properties
the c in css cascading which means elements inherited properties from their parents

7123702
webkit	gecko
with enough patience you could take a look at some prominent open source rendering engines like webkit gecko chrome at find out how they render dropdown buttons as part of a combobox

7123710
int	chars
to convert a string to an int take each chars in turn and if it s in the range 0 through 9 convert it to its decimal equivalent

7123710
multiplying	add
now multiplying any previous results by 10 and add the new value

7123723
qhash	qmap
if you want to be able to reference items by name you re going to want to use a qmap or a qhash

7123723
qhash	qmap
qhash is faster but qmap values are sorted by key if you iterate through them

7123731
hash	salt
the user registration form has a few fields which i don t want to store in the database such as the password and password confirmation i m storing a salt and a hash instead

7123742

7123773
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
extend exception if you want it to be a checked exception extend runtimeexception if you want it to be an unchecked-exception

7123778
solaris	sunos
i was going to earn my credit with the supervisor for my quite advanced graphics program at a sunos solaris with instant messaging enabled where with zephyr.vars or whatever it was called you could make an image appear on your listed friend s screen like if you alowed me i could just send you an image that appeared on your display

7123801
mouse	trackpad
i am scrolling down using my mouse and then also using my trackpad

7123821

7123824
tax	shipping
but for buyers outside of my state pa i did shopping car rule that gives discount in the amount of tax charge for those who chose regular shipping

7123961
children	parent
it is only an orm if your children do not have their reference set to the parent why would it assume that because the parent has a list of children that the children reference in turn should be a reference to the parent

7123961
children	parent
however removing the inverse statement would cause the children to be saved the parent to be saved then the children s parent id to be updated

7123963
button	checkbox
for checkbox and radio button you re rather interested in click event than the change event

7123969
width	margin
this solution doesnt care about outer div s width or innder div s width because i am using margin auto which takes care of centering the element perfectly

7123998
children	parent
if there s an item with children as the last item nsstring item will be the parent if it s not expanded or the last child if it is expanded

7124010
gif	png
if you can t do that create the symbols you need as png or gif images and insert them inline

7124014
equals	gethashcode
because the equals and gethashcode methods on anonymous types are

7124014
equals	gethashcode
defined in terms of the equals and gethashcode methods of the

7124056
x86	64bit
check the box for 2008r2_sp1_snac_cu2_2567714_10_50_2772_x86 if your web server is an x86 machine and 2008r2_sp1_snac_cu2_2567714_10_50_2772_x64 if it is 64bit

7124065
boost	eigen
when using header-only libraries such as boost or glm eigen etc

7124078
int	chars
the exception you re getting indicates that the stored procedure is trying to cast a chars value that is not a number to int

7124095
google-chrome	firefox
i have observed this happens in both google-chrome and firefox and it manifests somewhat differently

7124095
width	height
one solution would be to use css3 transform instead of height and width that would at least allow me to not have to deal with the coordinates of the elements while they re off screen but it doesn t change the fact that settimeout gets all bunched up and weird

7124108
put	get
8.54 had support for compile_ints 1 but it was not enabled by default so you may want to build with that so that the initialization files get put into the exectuable as compressed data

7124128
getter	setter
i want to know if there is any way we can expose the public properties getter and setter of a webservice on the client side client side being a vb consumer not javascript

7124160
keydown	keyup
you bind the keydown event to the input box in order to prevent the undesired characters from being entered and bind the keyup event in order check the value modify the div s height

7124189
int	double
in your example you are providing a double constant which is not an unsigned int

7124189
int	double
change your unsigned int to a double if you want it to work the way you intended

7124218
post	get
i need somehow this value to reach my web application no mater trough post get method or by opening new ie window

7124284

vsto add-in word excel

7124284
vsto	add-in
my vsto add-in is not shown in the menu

7124304
inherited	subclassing
and that would not be inherited anyway since changes to baseclass.__dict__ would affect all instances of baseclass and all subclassing that use its datamap

7124319
mongodb	bson
i naively assumed that i wouldn t see a difference because mongodb itself keeps the records as bson and there really shouldn t be much difference between having 600 fields each with an integer or a single string which contains a json record which in turn keeps 600 integers

7124365
post	get
i think that button_to uses post by default my ror route skills are a bit rusty but i think the route you ve shown uses get

7124383
mouse	keyboard
a conditional function to go off when a keyboard or mouse button is pushed

7124395
getter	setter
you can then access c.x and it will automatically call the getter for x and automatically call the setter for x when you assign to c.x

7124418
post	put
so to put it in a nutshell i want to delete every post that isn t on the latest 15

gif	png
create an image of a div in javascript gif png

7124736
width	height
the canvas has a width and a height

7124739
apache	nginx
if that is possible and provides a performance increase could you do something like cloudfront which routes to an elastic loadbalancer which routes to an ec2 instance which has nginx as a front still have some static content not on cloudfront which in turn routes all php to apache s mod_php

7124744
google-chrome	firefox
since google-chrome firefox etc

7124794
google-chrome	firefox
it firefox and google-chrome console it find a match for the string d once every two attemps

7124813
implements	extends
extends to what jason said you would need to implements a code that works efficiently and not rely on the brute force algorithm that falconeyes suggested

7124822
int	chars
so chars + int 8 2 bytes

7124822
int	chars
for it to be 8 bytes you would have to declare an actual int 4 bytes and a chars 1 byte

7124836
qdatastream	qbytearray
i am byte-packing the string into a qbytearray using a qdatastream

7124836
pull	push
i would really appreciate some insight from someone who has some experience with zmq specifically with mixed pub sub push pull and req rep patterns

7124864
portrait	landscape
they will be displayed on an ipad in both landscape and portrait modes

7124870
accessor	properties
it says that the properties accessor for the httpchannelbinding properties does not support the operation on this platform

7124873
comparator	comparable
i would avoid comparator and have object implement comparable so that i can simply use

7124934
nunit	nsubstitute
i am doing some unit testing with nunit and nsubstitute on a function that uses httpresponse i know you can t mock these objects so i have created interfaces to represent them and some of there properties

7125030
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this only happens in safari and google-chrome firefox on ie are fine

7125046
filtering	grouping
choose an application grouping filtering drop down choices recap filtering

7125179
superclass	subclassing
what purpose does it serve to have a subclassing nested as an inner class of the superclass

7125214
dictionary	map
also for the reflection solution as long as your requirements weren t too complicated you could create your mapping definitions by creating a typed dataset with a couple of tables with column names matching those to map and then using the information in the datacolumn s of the tables to do your mapping definition instead of dictionary lists and tuples

7125220
children	parent
as harypyon suggests storing the children is a more efficient way of viewing this problem than storing the parent and then computing the children

7125243
division	modulo
integer division and modulo should give you the values you need

7125271
phpmyadmin	adminer
using the adminer plugin phpmyadmin i have looked at the wp_options table and there are none of the custome settings fields that i have specified

7125286
spaces	delimiter
i need to write a query to select the data from col1 break up each value using the spaces as the delimiter and inserting the data on either side of the spaces into col2 and col3 respectively

7125288
google-chrome	firefox
the code behaves the same in modern browser google-chrome ie 9 firefox .and the result is

7125289
keydown	keyup
is there a way to listen for volume up and volume down keyup keydown events in air actionscript 3

7125316
min	max
that said i don t know why the compiler isn t smart enough to use the sse min max instructions on the ternary operator when it seems to use sse instructions for all floating point calculations anyway

7125334
vbo	vao
as you noted vbos are still shareable so you just have to create a vao for each context that binds the shared vbo

7125340
post	get
it is trivial to do this as post or get

7125351
google-chrome	firefox
the really strange part that might also indicate the problem is that this issue occurs in ie firefox and google-chrome

7125432
post	get
if this doesn t work you should post a new question about how to get it to work

7125451
width	height
this will generate the table like this without borders the last rows just increases in height if the text is longer then it fits in width

7125453
width	height
i know how to use jquery to assign width height etc

7125453
width	height
what i m building is a slideshow of images that occupy the full viewport recalculating the image s width height and left properties on resize so that the image is always centered favors width over height except when the viewport is taller than it is wide resizing does not reload the page just fires a function to resize the image

7125455
gif	png
similar result with png and gif

7125455
gif	png
note instead of png i tried jpg and gif but didnot make a difference

7125499
width	height
is there a way to control the backstretch image so that it fills the height and width of the division and not the entire body

7125505
width	height
if you are working in 2d the main ones you ll be dealing with will be the width height aspectratio saves calculating it yourself and if you re planning to deploy to 360 the titlesafearea the rectangle safe to draw to on all tv s older tv s will clip 5-10 of some of the edges

7125505
width	height
you probably won t be changing the width and height of your window in runtime so if you store an x and a y for the camera position you can store the width and height of the screen and never have to look at the viewport again except maybe to place hud elements within the titlesafearea

7125538
width	height
if i forcibly set a width and a height of 400px on all of the anchor tags then everything would show up

7125538

you also have to give the element with the background a width and a height to fit the background image

7125682
google-chrome	firefox
i have also seen that google-chrome firefox and even ie will gracefully handle a queue of about 100 requests

7125697

children	parent
the children table is a way of mapping parent to the person table to associate the child-to-parent many-to-many relationship

7125808
mdpi	hdpi
on top of that aspect ratios don t match up with pixel density so using ldpi mdpi hdpi to decide on aspect ratio is probably not a good idea

system.in	system.out
i have created program that takes input from system.in and output to system.out

7125909
portrait	landscape
for example you ll see that each row contains some portrait and some landscape photos

7125909
portrait	landscape
the overall effect however is that g+ can pull from a large pool of images and therefore can choose a combination of images that meet the needs of the individual aspect ratio landscape or portrait aspect of the given image as well as overall aspect ratio of the containing rectangle

7125909
width	height
i would take images that are available in the pool and calculate their aspect ratio a simple width divided by height

7125909
portrait	landscape
2nd row 2 landscape photos 2 portrait photos and 1 square photo

7125909
portrait	landscape
3rd row 3 landscape photos 1 portrait photo and 1 square photo

7125909
width	height
the result is that since all thumbnails have the same height their combined widths in these particular combinations give you the desired resulting width for the layout rectangle

7125931
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari don t support changing the css of map or area elements

7125979

7126298
put	get
is there a way to get the max number of variables and put each variable into an array

7126308

width	height
keep in mind that there may be very wide pictures which need some workaround cropped or width of them should be width of row and height variable

7128104
cout	cin
this can be useful for console output but 1 often this is not the case cout is automatically flushed when input is requested from cin via the tied-stream mechanism and only wastes cpu time and 2 you often find it used also on file streams where it is almost never useful and results in poor file writing performance

7128547
eventlet	gevent
upon initial inspection it appears to be pure python so gevent and eventlet should work fine

7128571

7128575
folder	directory
i suppose i could compare the number of files in the source directory to the number of files in the target directory as cp progresses or perhaps do it with folder size instead

7129268
int	double
i m not seeing any point in going and flipping every one of my 100+ fields a mix of 2 to 8 byte int along with floats and double and then making most all of my users turn right around and flip them all back and dealing with all the minor coding errors on both sides

7129281

7129417
width	height
when i resize a borderless form to a small width and height it won t get smaller than width 132 height 38

7129597
width	height
i m trying to make a widget that selects an area in the page using javascript but the issue is that when it saves the x y and width height it s actually only relevant to that screen size so if we try to draw that selection on another user s computer it ll go off the correct position

accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
if you re using properties accessor in -dealloc because you don t have access to the ivar directly you should do the same in -dealloc that you do in -viewdidunload

7131116
subclass	accessor
the point of using -release in -dealloc is to avoid calling the accessor which conceivably could have been overridden by a subclass to have side effects that you don t want in -dealloc when everything else from the subclass has already been deallocated

7131116
accessor	ivar
but if you re already calling the accessor in -dealloc you might as well use the setter to release the ivar and ensure that it s done right

7131131
inherited	properties
you can therefore handle any properties values even inherited and none - you just need to ensure you keep the correct sequence throughout and don t miss any properties otherwise the array keys go wrong

7131226
daemon	cron
it s safe to ignore the advice to start and stop the cron daemon when editing a crontab 5

7131226
daemon	cron
the crontab 1 utility notifies the cron daemon that the crontab 5 file needs to be reread and changes will take affect immediately

7131226
daemon	cron
the only reason you would ever need to restart the cron daemon is if you edited the crontab 5 file directly without the crontab 1 utility

the trick to put multiple files in a single zipfile is to use the zipentry descriptors prior to writing marshalling the jaxb xml data in the zipoutputstream

7131645

keep a variable for the min value and one for the max values

7131645
min	max
then for each element update the min or max value if that element is less than or greater than the min or max value respectively

7131672

ms chart exports a binary image jpg png bmp etc.

7132030
listview	gridview
there is a setdivider for listview but not gridview

7132049
width	height
i don t think however that an image can be created from a stream containing integers instead you probably need to create an empty bitmap of the same width x height as your array then loop like in the code snippet above and set pixels according to your values

7132129
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
also shouldn t your jcheckbox also be jradiobutton that with the help of a second buttongroup object only allow one selection at a time

does it go to the subclassing first because the sublclass was passed in as the parameter then the jvm checks whether there is implementation code provided in the subclassing and if not then the superclass method is called if there is implementation code

7132250
put	get
if you want to get around this you need to put a table inside the cell

7132707
google-chrome	firefox
i m looking into creating an extension for firefox google-chrome that creates a button in the toolbar

7132759

however in order to achieve the effect that you mentioned you could use a customized dialog to pop-up within your main gallery activity and then set the rest of the screen as blurred with the use of window manager

7132881
width	height
yes as said above you need to put a # when referring to ids in css but you also need to specify a width and a height for your #twitter div so that is will have some dimension

7132896
put	get
the way i would get around this is to put this switching code inside of a rootviewcontroller that is on the window

7132944

i also use min and max for years which is quite helpful

7132944
min	max
max is in my case 99 and min 9

for-loop	loops
i was thinking of creating a for-loop that loops through the number of rows in the text file saved in the code as height generating a new random number each time to select a different verb set or row in the two dimensional array. essentially i d like to get a loops to run through the entire verbrun class and pause for the actionlistener until all of the verb sets have been displayed

7133731
post	put
this is not answering your question directly but i feel i put it as an answer plus it is too big to post as a comment

7133745
super	self
the simplest way to do that is to call super s implementation which will return the view or any subview of itself if the point is within the view and then just return self if that method returned non- nil

7133758
postgresql	mysql
i m converting a rails 2.3.8 app on ruby 1.8.7 from mysql to postgresql 9.x and while it everything appears to be working correctly in development mode all of my tests standard unit and functional tests with yml fixtures immediately error with the message

client-side	server-side
i need to check the file size on client-side and not on server-side is this possible

7133969
post	put
put a breakpoint in your inner for-loop and inspect the values of j i and getelementsbytagname object .length as well as swf j .getelementsbytagname param .length after the first iteration and post the results

7133978
postgresql	mysql
example on postgresql since mysql doesn t support with

7133999
folder	directory
copy the fires directly to the folder directory in the workspace and then use file - refresh to refresh the eclipse view of the native system

7134006
getter	setter
in this case there is no need for getter or setter methods and so no need to use property or synthesize at all

7134006
getter	setter
then create getter and setter methods if you need them

7134054
int	double
beats the purpose of int doesnt it change the column type to float or double

7134058
charindex	substr
it is even easier if the tasks are 1-character long you can use left longtaskname 1 instead of the ugly substr charindex mess

7134060
int	boolean
instead of using an int use a boolean

7134116
folder	directory
i included the library by building it with maven and placing the directory in my web-inf lib folder and then including the jar netflix-client-2.3-snapshot.jar in my build path

if you are using http urlconnection for the request then you can use cookiemanager to handle cookies

7134141
setinterval	settimeout
this is the proper solution don t ever rely on passing a string as a function when using settimeout or setinterval it s slower because it has to be evaluated and it just isn t right

7134161
min	max
you may think of each input to the black box as an n -digit number in a max - min + 1 radix system

7134161
min	max
simply iterate over all the numbers from 0 to max - min + 1 n decode each number and feed the resulting vector to the black box

7134172
initializer	class-method
also how do i access this dictionary since these are class-method and cannot use a dictionary instance variable to initializer with the dictionary used in the plist

7134189
min	max
notice that right now we can read off the max and min of the stack by looking at the top of the stack and seeing that 7 is the max and 2 is the min

7134189
min	max
now if we want to query the max and min we can do so in o 1 by just reading off the stored max and min atop the stack 9 and 1 respectively

7134189
min	max
and as you can see the max and min are computed correctly

7134189
min	max
- however you may want to consider implementing the stack using one of the standard stack implementation techniques such as using a dynamic array or linked list of objects each of which holds the stack element min and max

ld is a format specifier for a long int not a long double

7134588
ssl	https
so i tried changing the href of the tag to use https for the validator but then the page simply doesn t load i guess because the validator doesn t use ssl

7134603
put	get
it s almost unreadable this way but if you make a wrapper-class for parts pros whatever your names are you get niecer looking and reading code and can put some utility functions inside the classes while hiding the implementation-detail of using dictionaries

7134626
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
mappedsuperclass means that entities extends this class inherited columns and associations from the superclass but these columns and associations go in the table of the subclassing

7134655
int	chars	int	double
if you create a template class and then use it with for example int chars and double then the compiler will create methods for the template for those types

7134657

it may be better to use the .hover jquery function which handles both enter and leave rather than mouseenter and mouseout

7134682
width	height

7134688
google-chrome	firefox

7134697
xslt	xquery
for example having named types is important for advanced use like if you want to exploit schema-aware xml processing in xquery or xslt but less important if you need the schema just for validation

7134699
opera	firefox
firefox the event is transitionend in opera otransitionend and in

7134741

i have three lists a parent and two children list that are linked through lookup columns

7134909
filtering	grouping
the client wants to see all the lists together in one view and be able to filtering and edit grouping of items

7134909
filtering	grouping
the business need is for the client to filtering the three lists based on criteria they select from either list a and list b and list c to get a grouping of items they make the updates and save the changes back to the 3 lists

7134921

where site is a unique identifier of my site password is the user password and salt is a user-specific random salt and the hash is a general purpose cryptographic hash function like sha-1 and || indicates concatenation

7134935
installation	upgrade
it was probably a isolation issue which was only addressed by the upgrade because it replaced the base installation

7134993
stdout	stderr
but this 1 takes forever to start because it starts sbt 2 causes all stdout and stderr to go to stdout and 3 causes all output to be decorated with a logger info or error

7135007
put	get
to test this i put a config transform in my web.release.config to add an appsetting key if you do this make sure the appsettings node is present in your base config file or you will get an error

i found a good solution using autoresizingmask to mantain min and max y margin and allow height resize

7135247
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
my question is for performance reason dictionary is the best or should i go with sortedlist sorteddictionary

7135272
prepare	execute	prepare	bindparam	prepare	pdostatement	bindparam	pdostatement
note that with pdo prepare you can either use pdostatement bindparam to bind parameters prior to calling pdostatement- execute or you can pass the parameters as an array to pdostatement- execute

7135274
mouseleave	mouseenter
hover is just short hand for mouseenter and mouseleave

7135307
ilist	icollection
mainly because ilist inherits from icollection and strings do not support the mutable beahviors icollection promises add remove clear - when you add or remove character elements from a string it creates a new string

7135312
gif	png
but if the url points to a single file resource like a png gif txt etc

7135315
lisp	scheme
try to forget about scheme if that is your main mental model of lisp -- it will limit you more than help you in understanding scoping funargs etc

7135377
post	get
i need to simulate the parameters contained in the url and i read that the post method will do that however when i get an error

7135467

opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is not necessarily limited to images. the script works 100 in google-chrome opera safari ios but not completely in firefox and ie

7135485
text-align	height
as a guide make everything inside the article relative float left set equal widths declare height and text-align as you wish

7135492
validationsummary	customvalidator
my initial consideration is to send back a with failed validation messages and then dynamically create a customvalidator control since apparently you can only bind one error message to one validator control for each error to show in the validationsummary when there are any

7135519
implements	extends
you need to implements a javascript class which extends overlayview

7135605
post	put
i put the code in pastebin as i tought it would clog upp the post

7135610
public	protected
a class or struct in c++ has access specifiers public protected and private which control the access level to everything following the specifier

7135636
mouseleave	mouseenter
simply use the mouseenter and mouseleave events

7135653
awt	swing	swt	swing
if your program needs x uses awt swing swt it will need to wait for x to come up then etc x11 xsession.d would be the place to put the startscript

7135676
button	checkbox
decide which controls on the form you d like to have the delete key work from button checkbox etc. but maybe not text boxes and use the keydown event in those controls to take the appropriate action

7135718
jtabbedpane	jscrollpane	jeditorpane	jtabbedpane
in the center pane is a jtabbedpane with two tabs one with a jtextarea in a jscrollpane of course used for entering markdown code and the other a jeditorpane again in a scroll pane for displaying a rendered html preview

7135718
jeditorpane	jtabbedpane
the jtextarea and the jeditorpane do not have the same size and that jtabbedpane is resizing when i switch between them since i m resetting the jeditorpane text every time

7135757
post	put
but i also have code that i got from a post on another site that is suppose to put the progress bar value in the middle of the progress bar as percentage

7135784
hash	salt
from a pure hashing perspective unless i m reading your question wrong you re proposing creating a hash of the password concatenated with a user specific random salt which is the usual approach

7135784
hash	salt
when you look at the breaches we ve seen in recent times password disclosure is usually happening when they re either stored in plain text obviously very vulnerable or hash without a salt easily vulnerable to rainbow tables

7135784
hash	salt
sure the sha derivatives will be faster to work through particularly if it s a single hash but in combination with a cryptographically random salt it s not a small task

7135792
getter	setter
this generates bird_nests_attributes accessors getter setter for tree object

7135805
width	height
another alternative is to handle the wm_getminmaxinfo message that returns the minimum and maximum width and height for a window

7135805
width	height
in your case you would return the current width and height

7135824
ubuntu	linux
i m a ubuntu linux lucid lynx user

7135826
src	attr
doc.select div.box-art .select img attr abs src

7135839
ready	each
so it appears that you cannot solve this problem without either changing the jquery implementation so it doesn t unbind to allow multiple firings or changing each piece of ready handler code to use your own events that you can fire as many times as you want

7135860
firefox	safari
firefox 5 6 doesn t play well with quicktime 7.6.6 default under os x 10.6.8 which somehow is affecting safari 5.1 and quicktime interactions

7135860
firefox	safari
safari now ignores whatever firefox and quicktime had cooked up together

7135879
width	height
you can try to set the autoresizingmask attribute on the three buttons to have flexible margins height and width so that they grow with uiview b as you change the size of uiview b

7135893
draggable	droppable
i m using ajax to populate some thumbnails for search results and i d like to make them draggable and droppable

7135902
jboss	glassfish
my application worked fine in glassfish 3.1.1 but broke with this duplicate context initialization parameter resteasy.injector.factory error when i moved it to jboss 7

7135918
width	height
the height of the containing div would be ok to measure but the width would always be full width and the height would only fit that particular width

7135918
width	height
change the width and the height would be different

7135934
accelerometer	gyroscope
are there classes for dealing with the gyroscope similar to uiacceleration uiaccelerometer uiaccelerometerdelegate for the accelerometer

7135950
children	parent
this will remove the foreignkey between the parent and the children table

7135953

7136000
mouse	keyboard
here is my situation we are writing an application that must transform microsoft kinect coordinates into keyboard and mouse events

7136012
javassist	cglib
you could use cglib or javassist to do the same thing for an abstract class

7136021
draggable	droppable
yes you can define draggable and droppable objects using jquery ui where an object will revert back to it s previous position if not dropped on a predefined object

7136021
draggable	droppable
as for your second question yes you will need to call the draggable droppable methods on your dynamically created objects to give them those respective properties

7136037
width	height
make the width and height equal to what you want in

7136052
width	height
while the cropping is no problem i did notice that i had to swap my width and height values when creating a cgrect bound to crop on

7136056
oncreate	setcontentview
setcontentview sets already the layout inside oncreate of an original activity

7136056
oncreate	setcontentview
i need to call super.oncreate in my oncreate and then call setcontentview again

7136065
mdpi	hdpi
android has 4 densities either ldpi mdpi hdpi or xhdpi

7136085
for-loop	arrays
you can even assign them to an arrays and iterate through with a for-loop but jquery gives us the .each syntatic sugar so the idea is

7136186
min	max
but i d imagine you could also do like it says on jquery s own docs and use the .data method to store the min max values

7136186
min	max
in other words make your code look for existing data on the elements so the first time you call it won t find any existing data so it ll place those min max values in an object and save them using .data

7136275
allocator	stl
i ve never really used the stl much but i knew you could use vector to deal with the allocator of arrays of objects and i could have sworn there was a way to use the default constructor to allocate the items within when the vector is created

7136322
post	get
try with post instead of get because your form has post method declared and checking the submit button instead of a variable

7136380
inherited	properties
it s a rare case you actually want to inherited a properties like margin you may be thinking it does something that it really doesn t

7136380
width	margin
...where 0 here can be any valid margin width value as documented here

7136406
super	self
why not super b self .__init__ self

7136406
super	self
if i omit the second argument in super and the return proxy object is an unbound one then should i write super b .__init__ self

7136415
super	self
super returns an instance of the base class so self gets implicitly passed to __init__ like in any other method call

7136441
int	chars
then when used in self.text_entry.insert insert chars text_entry is trying to insert an int into a str and causing the above error

7136481
ubuntu	linux
so both machines are 64 bit linux although 1 is ubuntu while the other is arch linux

7136554
button	checkbox
that activity has a back to main page button but when the user just clicks the back button on the phone the checkbox are already checked from the last time the user was on the page

7136574
serializable	deserialization
if you don t care about making your format easily consumable by different platforms you can create classes encapsulating the container ensure they re serializable then use serializable deserialization for converting the container to a stream binaryformatter is one option for converting objects to bytes

7136593
rss	feed
all i want it to do is parse a rss feed from a specific site and take the title and published date and put those items into a listview and when a list item is clicked it will open the browser to display the webpage containing the article

7136627
turkish	polish
for example i ve heard that russian polish and turkish have pretty different rules than english so that might be a great starting point

7136627
internationalization	localization
edit i also would like to know some good non-english test phrases for my unit tests here what are some good non-english phrases with singular and plural forms that can be used to test an internationalization and localization library

pop-up	dialog
and i doing one project in asp.net where i need the pop-up dialog box with multiple texbox and label such as name comments remarks etc.and those data should be fetched in some variables.i use simple javascript code but it worked for single textbox but doesnot support multiple

7136697
setinterval	settimeout
besides using setinterval you can also use a recursive settimeout pattern like the following

7136716
strstr	substr
your best bet might just be to crawl your input with strstr which finds occurrences of a substr and manually tokenize on those

7136792
post	get
you can easily get the embed code for a youtube vid and post it on your site but you don t want to allow users to just post vids without some type of validation otherwise everyone will write scripts to redirect the page etc

7136825
children	parent
the two children form columns within the parent div so are therefore floated to place them side by side

7136827
width	height
setting the width and the height of it still keeping the resolution

7136841
strcpy	strncpy
strcpy is not safe so you are much better off using strncpy it allows you to explicitly specify how many characters to copy rather than rely on null terminator of the source string also this helps avoiding buffer overflow since you explicitly specify a length

7136850
width	margin
you need to add the margin to the total width - the margin-left of the right column is not margin left from the parent it is margin left from the left column so if you total is 400px and your left column is 200px and your right column is also 200px there is no room for margin

7136857
ubuntu	linux
i m relatively new to linux only ever having installed ubuntu a few times and never really stuck with it

7136930
filtering	grouping
start by adding all the 16 column fields to the report filtering and the 2 you want to sum to the values area.that gives you the first grouping

7136962
qiodevice	qnetworkreply
the qtwebkit may have retrieve the content of the qnetworkreply a qiodevice the size of it would be 0 after readall .maybe the qtwebkit as a browser has read it for rendering i guess

7136983
subtract	add
change the value of to add subtract columns

7137002
crypt	hash
it seems like crypt is returning different hash on different environments with the same arguments

7137016

if the amount of elements within the ul surpass a certain height width when dynamically filled in i want to flip the container they reside in from a container that will stretch as it fills to one that scrolls

7137032
int	chars
this argument list is passed to the main function of the executable command program as an int count often called argc and a pointer to a null-terminated array of nul-terminated 0 chars arrays

7137045
strstr	strtok	strlen	strstr	strlen	strtok
this is pretty much exactly the same as the implementation of strtok just calling strstr and strlen instead of strcspn and strspn

7137105
pull	push
you can do this either in a push or pull based fashion pull is probably simpler just poll for changes

7137114
jtable	jlabel
i start to add some jlabel s inside the object of array over the cells of the jtable using this code

7137116
width	height
for your example as you want them equal sizes you should make the -webkit-box-flex to 0 for all three children but set their width or height if appropriate to 33.33 each

7137117
openni	kinect
regret it now because i dont plan to use a kinect soon and openni is giving me headaches with normal opencv programs

7137148
post	get
the username and password are passed from html to php using either of two methods post or get

7137171
inherited	properties
extending native objects seems less dangerous he explores the problems of enumerability which seems to be a problem the for-in statement enumerates all object properties inherited or own if you add a properties on object.prototype for example any object used with this statement will show the properties name

7137172
free	malloc
note memory allocation shown below as new and free can consist of malloc and free calls or can be some common method for limiting overhead by using a pool of available nodes

7137211
put	get
i am currently working on customize listview in which i had extends array adapter and using getview method of it displayed each row with radio button on extreme right and item name on left side of each row now i want to put all radio button in radio group so that only one of it get selected at a time but i am gettin exception as java.lang.illegalstateexception the specified child already has a parent

7137315
add-on	xpcom
i finally have some time to work on it but it turns out that this add-on includes a native portion compiled as an xpcom component and xpcom components are now strongly discouraged

7137332
openni	kinect
primesense openni primesense makes the sensor inside kinect

7137341
oncreate	onstart
i think you do need to target the onsaveinstancestate and either onrestoreinstancestate or use the oncreate functionality to do it onrestoreinstancestate is called after onstart whereas oncreate is called before onstart - so you ll need to use the oncreate way of doing things although i ll list both below

7137379
submit	submission
a get is issued when you browse to a page normally not just when you submit a form with that method - if you want to use the same view to display an initial form and handle submission via get you should check for a value from the form having been submitted

7137544
hide	show
i am trying to create a show hide comment functionality to the posts on the main index page in wordpress

7137544
hide	show
i currently have it working however since each comment div has the same class and the script show all divs with that class when you click on any of the show hide buttons all of them on the page open

7137544
hide	show
is there a way to make it so that when you click on a show hide link for a specific post s comments only that post s comments section will open

7137550
portrait	landscape
how can i probably in viewwillappear force the orientation to change to portrait even though the user is holding the device in a landscape position

7137599
updatepanel	scriptmanager
you can bypass any logic you have inside your page_load method by checking the scriptmanager.isinasyncpostback property with a scriptmanager and updatepanel

7137613
int	chars
as i understand it it takes four 1-byte chars starting from the memory location pointed to by from treats them as unsigned long int in order to give each one 4 bytes of space and does some bitshifting to arrange them as a big-endian 32-bit int

7137634

octal	decimal
in other words a change in the most significant digit of the octal number will change even the least significant digit in the decimal representation

7138364
octal	binary
the conversion to base-1000000000 is simple because you only need to support incrementing and multiplying by two just consider the input as binary with three bits for each octal digit

on my pc the time to convert an 80 000 digit octal number to decimal resulting in 72246 digits is about 1.2 seconds

7138364
int	double	division	multiplication
i tried also using 64 bit int or the 53 bit int part of a double but the code was running always slower than in this case one reason is probably the division in the inner loop that can be converted to a multiplication in the 32 bit case

7141217
udp	tcp
it greatly simplifies and streamlines network programming such as tcp and udp socket server

7141225
getter	setter
this is probably a silly question but if i have a variable called say nstate defined with appropriate getter and setter within a class and i would like to get its value from within the class is it better to use

7141227
integer	unsigned
first unpack the string to unsigned 4 byte integer and then use this function

7141234
many-to-many	one-to-many
i think you re asking for either a many-to-many relationship or multiple defined one-to-many relationships so it depends on the use

7141258
postgresql	mysql
if you re using a sql database such as mysql or postgresql test with union and union all instead of or

7141286
for-loop	loops
being var d inside of the for-loop made it act oddly when used outside so i had to move the var assignment outside of loops and use as normal

7141291

7141359
opera	safari
i remember that at some point opera mostlikely it was safari instead

7141359
opera	safari
so i did indeed find a lot more about this when i started searching for this bug in safari rather than opera

7141367
maven	m2e
you can install multiple different versions of maven and configure m2e to use a specific instance see the setting under window preferences maven installations

7141371
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
instead of a regular xmlhttprequest you need to do a xdomainrequest

7141371
google-chrome	safari
not sure about safari but google-chrome has a command line switch for this

7141456
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome and firefox

7141484
implements	extends
that being said however elementat idx dates back to the days when vector did not follow the list patterns by extends abstractlist -- if you read the full docs you ll see that vector was modified to implements the list interfaces

7141487
min	max
doesn t say anything about swapping the start_expression and end_expression to match min and max values

7141532
put	get
by default you ll get a new sessionid on each postback unless you put something in the session

7141535
disk	ram
for example if you query select from company where id 1 from a client 1 million times only the first query needs to go to disk the next 999 999 will come straight from the in ram cache

7141614
folder	directory
what about when one process plants a malicious plugin or something similar in the folder of another process s config directory

7141633
post	get
i have also tried get instead of post but that didn t work either

7141648
symlink	777
im sure the permissions of every file and folder under the pictures folder pointed by the symlink are setted 777 anyone can access to them

7141688
width	height
the layout s height is less than the height of everything else and the width of the layout is the same as everything else but when i use layout.getheight and layout.getwidth in my onresume they always return 0 so i can t really use that

7141720
carrierwave	paperclip
something similar to the paperclip and carrierwave gems

7141731
hash	md5
i want to encrypt hash some strings with md5 in my mac application

7141731
hash	md5
i googled about it but it keeps throwing me examples on how to do it with iphone apps like md5 algorithm in objective c or using md5 hash on a string in cocoa

7141756
gridview	sqldatasource
if that s true the reason is because the same sqldatasource is bound to both your dropdownlist and your gridview and the select command for the sqldatasource retrieves all the employees - there is no where criteria to select a desired employee

7141756
gridview	sqldatasource
i would use 2 sqldatasource - one for the dropdownlist and one for the gridview

7141756
gridview	sqldatasource
then assign this sqldatasource to the gridview instead of the first one

7141777
int	boolean
if you take a look at this it explains that you can t change the type on boolean int and strings thus they cannot be subclassed

7141781
webclient	httpwebrequest
since you have one specific page you want to automatically populate it s going to be a lot easier to recreate the post message that is generated using either the webclient or a httpwebrequest

7141785
hash	md5
md5 is not encryption is just a unique string that you usually store in a hash table calculated from a stream that could your text image sound data etc

7141820
super	self
it s in the last line super snippet self .save force_insert force_update

7141823
folder	directory
furthermore i looked in each folder and could not find the fab file or directory

7141836
post	get
the test sounds like it is generating a get instead of a post though so it might be a problem with the link_to call

7141836
post	get
seems to indicate that link_to will generate some javascript to make a post call on click and that users with javascript disabled will get a normal get link unless you use href # so it might be because your test engine isn t running the javascript

7141837
super	self
super snippet self causes python to look in the mro of the class of self self.__class__.mro for the next class listed after snippet

7141837
super	self
super snippet self .save ... calls that class s save method with self bound to the first argument

7141837
super	self
so super snippet self .save ... will not call snippet s save method

7141837
super	self
which class super snippet self ultimately represents depends on self and in particular its class s mro

7141846
implements	extends
in addition to what everyone else said by implements an interface or extends a class you get compiler enforcement of the contract of the supertype

7141846
comparator	comparable
in the case of comparable that means that you get a compiler error if you fail to implement the int comparator a ana method in the implementing class

7141874

locally it is working with ie8 and firefox but with google-chrome it is not working

7141906
client-side	server-side
i typically utilize json as much as possible when trying to present server-side data to the client-side as it helps to separate the different layers

7141930
system.in	system.out
java final system.out system.in and system.err

7141955
post	get
you should change the input code to populate it with the post data instead of get and you would avoid having that nasty looking url

7141965
system.in	system.out
however system.in system.out and system.err are final static fields that for legacy reasons must be allowed to be changed by the methods system.setin system.setout and system.seterr

7141981
extjs	mootools
facebook s js uses function.prototype.shield context args... mootools uses function.prototype.pass args context sencha nã e extjs has function.prototype.createdelegate fn args appendargs false and i ve even seen some called partial fn context args however partial usually has the added ability to pass around a placeholder to allow the passing of different default arguments

7141989
nsstring	nsdata
nsuserdefaults can t store arbitrary objects but only instances of nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary

7142004

this code was executed on rotation for both portrait and landscape

7142027
portrait	landscape

7142153
hide	show
how can after click on button show a message and next hide it after 30 seconds

7142168

if the children are moving like in the case on your parent then it has to redraw and recache that element every frame and you don t get any performance boost

7142179
getter	setter
1004 to minutes seconds and i can successfully pull my seconds from the xml but i dont know how to work with getter and setter so i can convert my seconds to minutes seconds

7142179
getter	setter
i had a look at timespan and i know it can do what i ask but i dont know how to write the getter and setter so it will convert the integer values seconds to a minute seconds format

7142192
setinterval	settimeout
because of the nature of requestanimationframe you should never queue animations using a setinterval or settimeout loop

7142201
post	get
in the first case you are using http post in the other http get

7142202
post	get
without type post it defaults to get according to the docs which your server side code is probably not expecting

7142203
post	get
the type of request to make post or get default is get

7142247
queue	fifo
basically i want a fifo queue that is thread-safe and will automatically throw out old enough items once it gets to a pre-specified limit

7142274
for-loop	arrays
if don t want to change where arr points but you want to change the values stored in the memory where it is pointing you have to do it one element at a time with a for-loop that iterates over each element in the arrays

7142288
google-chrome	firefox
works in ie8 up google-chrome and firefox

7142334
mouse	keyboard
scroll wheel isn t implemented but the other events work including mouse drag and keyboard

7142351
nstimer	nsrunloop
as long as your app is based around nsrunloop which pretty much all of them are you can use nsobject s performselector withobject afterdelay or nstimer

7142353
pop-up	dialog
this is why when a user tries to delete an application that has an alternate entry point with a running process in the background a dialog box always pop-up letting the user know that the application will be removed on restart and asking whether they would like to reboot now

7142355
prepare	execute
the best way to ensure this is to prepare the query once then execute it each time

7142372
post	get
my form was posting via get method and the mvc just uses the culture for an action parameter when it s passed in the routedata or by the form via post method

7142383
ioexception	gzipinputstream
gzipinputstream fails with ioexception in android 2.3 but works fine in all previous releases

7142388
interpolation	splines
it s meant for doing thin-plate splines interpolation 2d equivalent of cubic splines for spatial data but will take up to four covariates although it will expect them to be euclidean x y z + time so you need to be clear that you are selecting the correct options for your particular case

7142434
for-loop	loops
note that using dispatch_apply means that each iteration of loops may run concurrently with respect to one another so this won t be applicable if your for-loop requires to be run in a serial fashion

7142438
centos	linux
i want the following following node.js program to read a file and print out login failed. if the text in the file is login failed. however the line fails to return true and the program prints out login succeeded. i m using centos release 5.5 final linux distribution

7142522
daemons	systemd
other daemons run by root may only create files for the systemd administrators

7142522
daemons	systemd
however if a daemons is not written carefully enough or has different ideas from the systemd administrator about what permissions should be used but it does set umask to 0 or another known value the systemd administrator maybe left without a method to override the default permissions set by the daemons

7142538

7142626
cvs	svn
there are plenty of projects on sf to choose from that use svn and not cvs

7142629
integer	unsigned
if you want a number larger than the largest 64-bit unsigned integer 18 446 744 073 709 551 615 then you will need to store it as a varchar or other textual field and hope that you don t need to do much mathematical manipulation on it

7142643
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in ios i would generally start with a rootcontroller which contains a uitabbarcontroller and fill this with 4-5 uinavigationcontroller

7142643

if the user gives you an integer instead of a fractions or any other invalid input

7142697
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
i could just customize a few uibutton to look like an uisegmentedcontrol however i would also have to implement the momentary switch logic

7142702
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
these directives will work in all popular browsers ie6+ firefox google-chrome except for safari on windows which alone lacks a persistent http cache that works across multiple sessions

7142705
onresume	onpause
furthermore shared document like data is written in onpause and restored in onresume

7142712
implements	extends
in the end i implements a method inside my custom adapter extends from baseadapter just to call notifydatasetchanged there like

7142857
setinterval	settimeout
the minimum time resolution for setinterval and settimeout varies by browser and in some cases can be as much as 15 or 20 ms some articles state up to 75ms

7142870
mouse	keyboard
i use a microsoft ergonomic keyboard and evoluent mouse which help but don t allow for hours of endless typing and mouseing

7142873
width	height
you could set the width and height directly

7142880
width	height	width	font-size
however as lalit has realized since each character appears differently in different fonts different fonts will take different width and height for the same string of characters of same font-size

7142881
post	put
obviously this post or rather put should be committing to shift id.

7142891
width	height
take out x11 and pass your height and width arguments directly to jpeg

7142896
folder	directory
i have saved the icc profile in a folder called profiles and have set the copy to output directory value to always

7142906
rss	feed
with these loose definition rss feed also appear to be a web service too since they share data across http in format intended for parsing by software rather than humans altough they re not usually included in such discussions

7142906
udp	tcp
while we already have a transport layer in our networking stack tcp udp then when we talk about web service which actually an api on the top of http then we also need an api transport layer

must be faster than imagemagick or any of its forks graphicsmagick

7142983
imagemagick	magick++
i am using imagemagick or magick++ its library to render the final gif animation because it is relatively fast at doing so

7143022
union	distinct
in fact combining union and the distinct used in your first part of the union is redundant because the union is going to ensure that duplicates are removed from the final set both within sub-parts of the union and across parts of the union

7143043
setinterval	settimeout
in general setinterval bad and settimeout good for animations

7143058
jar	war
and what are the web application fomat of those war or jar etc...

7143072
spaces	delimiter
note that in the second case a spaces may not follow the semi-colon - otherwise it will be interpreted as field assignment delimiter

7143079
post	get
you need to use f.select instead of select_tag because rails automatically append table name to each ids f.select will be post_position if your table is post but select_tag will be just position so data won t get stored in db

7143108
for-loop	arrays
at the moment each country is updated separately there s a for-loop going through the countries although if it would simplify it then this could be modified to temporarily store new prices to an arrays then update an entire row at a time

7143124
vim	emacs
i know than this exist for vim but i can t find a similar mode in emacs

7143140

7143434
accessor	properties
otherwise you ll need to use the accessor method for the asset properties

7143501

others have explained and i like shelleybutterfly s suggestion to derive polynomial from the list except that i d make it protected not public so that outside code is not too free to mess with the contents of the list

7143505
postgresql	mysql
i am new to postgresql and to my surprise there appears to be no single function equivalent to utc_date from mysql

7143512
opera	firefox
opera and firefox offer mobile browsers as options

there is a single mousemove x1 and mouseenter + mouseleave for each div x100

7143601
google-chrome	firefox
code is tested with ie firefox google-chrome and works properly

7143610
getter	setter
yes getter and setter can be made private

7143610

the firefox safari google-chrome is ok but in ie8 value is no change

7143807
glut	sdl
there are game libraries that work on multiple platforms like sdl or glut

7143808
versioning	upgrade
in fact this versioning system should probably be used on all external script files so when you upgrade them you can make sure that viewers get the new versioning immediately and old new versioning of the scripts are never accidentally mixed by a caching system

7143828
typedef	struct
i would probably go with the first for readability and also for readability i d probably either set up a #define or a const in later versions of c with the value for your sizeof call and a typedef for your struct to compress the size a bit

7143852
free	malloc
this way you don t have the malloc free overhead for every single new allocation

7143870
width	height
i am given the amount of elements to populate a grid with but through this i need to know beforehand what the width and height in amount of elements the grid should be

7143870
width	height
i would like the aspect ratio between width and height of the grid to be 1 1

7143870
width	height
the width and height of the grid would then be 3

7143870
width	height
with 10 elements i would like either the width or height of the grid to be 4

7143879
google-chrome	firefox
i have an example which finds the difference of days between 2 specified dates and works only in google-chrome i think in firefox 6 and ie8 it does not support the format of date that i am using shows nan

7143900
portrait	landscape
how can i use these portrait landscape in same time

7143910
hide	show
if what you ve done was show different forms with show showdialog then the equivalent would be to use different windows and show hide them

7143916
oncreate	ondestroy
if you only need a list of activities in your application you can create some kind of registrar mechanism so each activity registers in oncreate and unregisters in ondestroy

7143935
folder	directory
using qt qdir i m trying to display the set of directory in treeview as it is displayed in windows explorer when u select the folder icon

7143939
width	height
either way though you can take the square root of the number of items and then take either the floor or ceiling to get the desired width height

7143939
width	height
for example math.sqrt 11 is 3.3166 so which is your desired height width

7143941

7144083
children	parent
as for performance jsperf - mousemove parent vs children

7144089
getter	setter
there is no reason why you can not make getter and setter private

7144089
getter	setter
in fact if you insert some convoluted code you can have code that can call these setter getter methods that can not modify the properties directly without using reflection

7144094
getter	setter
can create the setter and getter method private

7144094
getter	setter
as far as the jls is concerned there is nothing linguistically different between getter and setter methods and any other methods

7144094
getter	setter
we want to combine some logic in this case enforcing of a constraint with the setting or getting of an attribute but we don t want the setter or getter to be visible

7144100
int	chars
let s say i have a table with two columns iu uniqueidentifier id int sel chars 1

7144101

finally if you want to have your users download pdfs instead of view them in the web browser in your http request response set the content-type header to application octet-stream and set the content-disposition header to attachment

7144101
doc	rtf
i suppose if you re willing to rely on your users having other plugins installed you might be able to fake it using a java pdf viewer applet maybe icepdf or perhaps another one from this list of java pdf tools or using flash pdf2swf as mentioned in how can i show doc or rtf or pdf in flash player or in none editble format

7144203

to seemlessly support landscape portrait mode screen with different densities you need to put appropriate drawables with following naming convention res directory

7144542
folder	directory
res directory will be root level of you application folder

7144542
portrait	landscape
mode would be land port for landscape and portrait respectively

screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
density would be hdpi mdpi ldpi for high medium and low density screens respectively

7144542
portrait	landscape
suppose i have a background image which needs to look differently for landscape and portrait mode

maven allows you to define properties in the project s pom.xml

7144725
maven	pom.xml
now if you don t want to specify them from the command line and if you need to further isolate these properties from the project pom.xml into a properties file then you ll need to use the properties maven plugin and run it s read-project-properties goal in the initialize phase of the maven lifecycle

7144780

if the sentence is ç ã ãƒžãƒ¼ãƒˆã ãƒšãƒ³ã ªã ã œå è ã ã there is no way for the computer to know whether it s ç ã start sentence spaces delimiter or ãƒžãƒ¼ãƒˆ spaces comma delimiter that is the right it should choose

7145600
profiling	debugging
you should run profiling to spot the memory problem or debugging with a breakpoint after the save method and following a line by line execution until it crashes

7145611
pull	push
another option is to run hg serve on all the workstations and only pull from one another never push

7145640

7145859
integer	unsigned
u will output the unsigned integer value and

7145859
integer	unsigned
the value 255 is represented the same both as unsigned int and integer therefore you will see 255 twice

7145868
range	max
as the range is for unsigned char and unsigned xxx -1 by standard means - give the max value for unsigned xxx type

if you need to pop-up multiple dialog first read modeless dialog section of qt docs

7146319
super	extends
i can also add that the super instruction only works if the class you inherit from extends from object otherwise you get an exception

7146371
public	protected
all public and protected members are directly accessible

7146386
getter	setter
making fields public by using struct or publicly deriving from pair for performance reasons is not a good idea inline constructor getter and setter are just as fast as reading or writing the variable directly and they have the advantage of encapsulating the implementation

7146390
uiview	calayer
1 how would i apply this approach to a calayer object that is a sublayer of a uiview layer object like in the following

7146414
innodb	myisam
it s called full-text indexing but currently it s not supported in innodb only in myisam

7146428
post	get
change your form to do a get request instead of a post then you can use both the form and the url

7146431
implements	extends
i think i need to implements a new class that extends from activity and implements the code above and try again

7146491
hide	show
hide and show the container div because you don t want the form to hide when the user mouse s out of the parent and mouses-in to the form

7146518
typedef	struct
now as you ll notice both the struct and the typedef are named list which is fine as far as i know

7146557
datediff	difference
- if date x is earlier than today then difference datediff x now with the x year is current year

7146557
datediff	difference
- if date x is later than today then difference datediff x now with the x year is one year before

7146557
datediff	difference
then the difference will be datediff 6-6-2011 22-08-2011

7146557
datediff	difference
then the difference will be datediff 10-10-2010 22-08-2011

google-chrome	firefox
firefox obviously shows the google-chrome uri of the page and i was trying to figure out how to prevent that from happening just for aesthetic reasons mind you...

7146609
try-catch	exception-handling
if the filenotfoundexception occurs during a ftl or inside your main ftl template then i think you can catch the exception-handling with ftl s attempt-recover -construct similar to java s try-catch

7146614
implements	extends
your adv variables should extends common superclass or implements common interface

7146639
listview	gridview
i have found lots of help for listview but nothing on gridview

7146641
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
you can free only pointers returned from malloc or realloc

7146643
free	malloc
there s no way of testing a pointer before you free it so you will have to make sure that you only free valid pointers one returned from malloc etc

7146700
pivot-table	crosstab
i suggest using a crosstab - these are the crystal equivalent of pivot-table in excel or matrixes in ssrs

7146737
post	get
you can use url rewrite to issue 3xx redirect which will use get method but you will loose all post data

7146737
post	get
issue 301 or 302 redirect to the proper url it will have all post data sent as get variables

7146737
post	get
such rewrite to custom page should be easy -- you need to check what method is used post or get and only invoke it on post

7146737
post	get
the reason for all of this complexity is the difference in how post and get requests work with get all data is sent as part of url while post uses request body to transfer variable s data

7146782
iboutlet	ibaction
i use uitableview using ib i defined a uibutton in a custom cell and some labels the custom cell subclass already have definitions of ibaction of the button and necessary iboutlet on it but i want to handle the button click events in the tableview controller it self but not in the custom cell subclass

but i m looking to install freetype libjpeg pil build to add image processing to my django projects i ve followed this installation which installs it site wide but i can get it inside my virtualenv project

7146820
hash	md5
the principal difference - md5 and other hash functions designed to verify data have been designed to be fast and bcrypt has been designed to be slow

7146820
hash	md5
an attacker with a copy of a password hash will be able to execute many more brute force attacks because md5 and sha1 etc are cheap to execute

7146827
imagemagick	magick++
i have a problem creating a tiff image with a jpeg compression using magick++ the c++ api of imagemagick

7146943

or if you prefer to use cron syntax anyway just write export jobs to a user crontab using a wrapper which calls back to your running app or starts the job in a standalone process if that s possible

7146993
pull	push
for getting and setting application configurations or properties push pull

7147021
integer	unsigned
just stumbled in my mind over pthread_self which returns a pthread_t which is usually a typedef to an unsigned integer

7147046
loops	if-statement
but the if-statement ceases to work once the function has been called upon itself again in loops

7147070
ready	each
downloadcompleted event of each image must notify changes to the binding that it is ready to display

7147070

see these two post and see if you can get a hint.

7147076
ssms	sqlcmd
when i run this stored procedure from sqlcmd it s working and the stored procedure is created but when i execute the same from ssms it s failing with the error below

7147094
post	get
both get and post should have some kind of corelation id

7147134
free	malloc
you can t blindly design free without knowing how malloc works under the hood because your implementation of free would need to know how to manipulate the bookkeeping data and that s impossible without knowing how malloc is implemented

7147134
free	malloc
so an unswerable question could be how you would design malloc and free instead which is not a trivial question but you could answer it partially for example by proposing some very simple implementation of a memory pool that would not be equivalent to malloc of course but would indicate your presence of knowledge

7147148
free	malloc
malloc and free only have a meaning if your app is to work on top of an os

7147159
free	malloc
edit as sharptooth noted only makes sense to design free and malloc together

7147173
clang	llvm
for clang llvm c c++ complier build on libclang and llvm the translation unit created after preprocessing stage

7147186
int	chars
fputc converts its int input to unsigned chars and that conversion can t do anything too unpleasant

7147189
free	malloc
your malloc needs to check which areas of the right size of that pool are still free through some data structure and hand out pointers to that memory

7147202
free	malloc
there is an architecture that malloc and free are supposed to adhere to -- essentially a class architecture permitting different strategies to coexist

7147202
free	malloc
then the version of free that is executed corresponds to the version of malloc used

7147205
hide	show
if 0 is returned hide show parts from your xml

7147209
uidatepicker	uipickerview
i have a couple 4 uipickerview and one uidatepicker

7147210
subplot	imshow
i create a figure with 4 subplot 2 x 2 where 3 of them are of the type imshow and the other is errorbar

7147217
implements	extends
update the main issue i can think of is if you have a class that extends something else and implements this interface it won t work you can t inherit from two classes

7147222
gson	xstream
xmltool search on google code jsoup google gson xstream joox search on google code

7147235
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome

7147235
kde	gnome
older methods used in gnome 1.2 and kde 1 and 2

7147241
post	get
on both occasion i was able to change the post to a get including in the php files that were being called and it would then work on my host s live server

7147370
division	multiplication
division is a lot more expensive than multiplication

7147425
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
if the data being monitored supports inotifypropertychanged and for collections inotifycollectionchanged then some behind-the-scenes observer pattern technology gets hooked up and you can get have portions of your gui respond to very precise changes in your data rather than having to refresh everything

7147447
int	chars
fputc takes the chars to write as an int argument whose value is expected to be in the range of unsigned chars not chars

7147528
postgresql	mysql
i m trying to change my db server from mysql to postgresql

7147537
opera	firefox
i m using some old but workable javascript in a lotus domino application to set a session and persistant cookie it works fine in firefox opera but isn t working in ie8

7147537
opera	firefox
its the same in firefox opera

7147553
fadein	fadeout
fadein and fadeout are done asynchronously from your own code

7147553
fadein	fadeout
so for over 99 of its time it will be visible while for only less than 1 of the time from the precise instant the fadeout completes till just before the fadein starts it will be hidden so you will almost always see the speech-bubble-sun rather than speech-bubble-dark

7147580
initializer	class-method
the constructor behaves the same as any other class-method its only special property is that it s automatically ran when the class is initializer normal variable scope still applies

7147590
accessor	properties
as i can see from the stack trace calling sendpropertychanging causes system.data.linq.changetracker.standardchangetracker.onpropertychanging to fire which calls the get accessor of the same properties in order to get data copy of the properties before the change

7147593
free	malloc
malloc a single int and have the new thread read and free it

7147593
free	malloc
option 3 is immensely more efficient than either of the other choices both of which involve an extra synchronization step for option 1 the synchronization is in malloc free and will almost certainly involve some cost since the allocating and freeing thread are not the same

7147622
portrait	landscape
new android tablets with honeycomb have portrait orientation when held like in landscape on phones

7147622
portrait	landscape
maybe one of this devices has also landscape as a portrait default orientation

7147656
free	malloc
does he mean given an existing malloc implementation how would you go about trying to develop a more efficient way to free the underlying memory

7147656
free	malloc
after all in order to design your own free function you first have to know how malloc is implemented

7147656
free	malloc
but before you can write your own malloc free you first need memory to allocate free

7147656
free	malloc
it s only once you have access to a large contiguous looking block of memory that you need malloc free to manage it

7147656
free	malloc
they re all designed for different purposes too like limiting fragmentation due to small allocated chunks mixed with small unallocated chunks or ensuring that malloc and free run fast or sometimes even more slowly but predictably slowly

7147701
nuxeo	alfresco	nuxeo	magnolia	magnolia	alfresco
i have looked through a number of cmss jahia magnolia alfresco nuxeo walrus and a couple more but haven t found anything that readily provides managed components that i can integrate easily

7147702
hex	binary
by the way its an 8 bit binary number and has to come out in two digit hex form

7147708
pthreads	fork
there are much cleaner more modern ways to do shared memory like mmap with map_shared|map_anonymous for anonymous shared memory that you ll only share with your fork ed children or shm_open pthreads named shared memory or even mmap of ordinary files.

7147755
pull	push
if you have inexperienced users it is much safer to pull then to let them push

7147761
httprequest	httpresponse
option is to use httprequest and httpresponse

7147787
getter	setter
after that default data contract serialization was introduced so you don t have to place datacontract attribute on your classes and all public properties with getter and setter will be serialized

7147800
portrait	landscape
my app shows diffent views for landscape and portrait for that i defined 2 views one in layout and one in layout-land

7147800
portrait	landscape
after clicking some button i will start one async task which will fetch some data from service and bind it to my ui which is different in landscape and portrait

7147812
away3d	papervision3d
then you should investigate using one of the 3d frameworks such as away3d or papervision3d

7151838
devise	cancan
because the devise identity check is failing it s never hitting your cancan authorization check

7151838
devise	cancan
this is why i think you ve got devise config in your base applicationcontroller causing this not to hit cancan

7152416
scheme	racket
what are the perks a #lang racket against #lang scheme

7152416
scheme	racket
is it best or even possible to use #lang scheme in racket to follow all the content of structure and interpretation of computer programs or even how to design programs

but we kept #lang scheme around for compatibility as well as various scheme --- libraries that are kept and can sometime be different than racket --- counterparts

7152632
scheme	racket
no racket is very different from chicken scheme

7152642
google-chrome	firefox
it happens in both google-chrome and firefox

what iâ m doing here is a technique eilon showed me which is to map all urls to these routes but then restrict which routes to ignore via the constraints dictionary

7152794

7152838
repo	egit
problem is every time i try to clone a repo through egit it gives me the error cannot list available branches

7152849
children	parent
thus in the server the child processes can read from the client send that data back to the parent process and the parent can then using the entire list of pipe descriptors that it s accumulated for all the children write back to each individual child process the broadcast message which is then sent back to each client

7152863
hide	show
in my app i call the show method in the beginning of the function call then the hide method when the ajax call returns

you seed the prng with the first 64 bytes and then every time you call it you add one more byte of your random data to the entropy pool of your prng

7152923
fgets	getline
in c i would use getline fgets

7152940
pascal	delphi
i can t recommend lazarus as a good option for learning delphi because besides the languages are basically pascal they have some differences which could confuse you

7152958
hide	show
is it just a matter of creating 2 view controllers next to each other with the master view keeping a reference to the detail view and handling rotations properly to show and hide the popover or is there more to it than that

7152962
stdout	fflush
it could also be that you are not waiting for data to be fflush if you print on a terminal data is fflush after every new line but if you print to a file it s only fflush when the stdout buffer is full 4096 bytes on most systems

7152976
rpm	yum
fwiw if you creaate a yum repo and used that to update you would find that updating one rpm would automatically drag in the other

in your example though additemviewcontroller inherited from detailviewcontroller which has the properties customcell so you need to access the textfield from that properties

7153133

it happens in ie google-chrome and firefox

7153582
iboutlet	ibaction
but if you actually set it up as a custom subclass of uitableviewcell and write the code files for the subclass you can write iboutlet declarations and ibaction methods in the code and wire them up to your custom elements in ib

7153583
cassini	iis
there is additional solution - install iis express and use it instead of cassini

7153652
maven	pom.xml
as expected where the current directory is that where my web app is for example where my maven pom.xml is

7153668
put	get
i wouldn t recommend using though at least as it is implemented in std map because this may make difficult to track elements added to the map for exapmle using with a value adds that empty value to the map and go for a more explicit get and put operations for adding and retrieving elements of the map

7153769
fadein	fadeout
when you use fadein or fadeout it s essentially changing the display property hence if it has not finished one vs other and you execute second effect object will no longer have appropriate properties jquery needs to run the effect so either decrease the time and or add stop instead of dequeue and if you like try this i am using fadeto which will not break even if your mouse enters and leaves abruptly and repeatedly on and off

7153774
width	height
use the view.getwidth and view.getheight as the desired width and height respectively for the bitmapfactory resize procedure

7153781

google-chrome	firefox
but both google-chrome and firefox starts using a lot of resources

7153963
jar	war
i speculate that because pomrefid on your first line has a value of war the valid value for type would be war and not jar

7153982
width	height
it seems that the sizetofit method is prioritising using the available height rather than taking up the width and shrinking the height

7153982
width	height
right now i ve set the width again after the sizetofit which works around the issue but it leads to odd spacing depending on the height of the label

7154002
gmail	hotmail
when i try to send emails to gmail it works but when i try to send emails to hotmail or yahoo it fails.

7154024
google-chrome	firefox
it happens more often in google-chrome than it does in firefox so my guess is that it has something to do with the page loading before the css has a chance to be added

7154046
serializable	deserialization
i use serializable deserialization technique

7154152
getter	setter
this way in order to set the state of the object you are forced to go through the property so that the references are more carefully managed by the compiler produced getter and setter

7154181
hash-collision	key
in other words the expected number of hash-collision per key is the collection size divided by the hash limit

puts	gets
the average time for puts and gets is calculated per 10 puts gets

7154181
put	get	puts	gets
for each test there s an output image regarding the average put time per 10 puts and the average get time per 10 gets

7154181
puts	gets
the colour maps are calculated separately for puts and gets but encompass all tests for their respective categories

7154181
put	get
remember the below maps are all relative to best worst get times the put times are no longer taken into account

7154182
next	except
you will not run in any problems except that the debugger doesn t catch the ivars directly anymore they won t display nicely next to your console. - but that s not really an issue

7154206
opera	safari
update after a hack i did for safari it suddenly works in opera as well

7154214

sequence	permutation
permutation of an n-element sequence assuming each element is distinct

7154288
sequence	permutation
6 permutation of the sequence abc

7154288
sequence	permutation	capitalize	capitalization
the fact that there are six ways to capitalize a three-letter sequence without giving all letters the same capitalization and that there are six permutation of abc is a complete coincidence

7154307
accessor	properties
if you re using the synthesize directive to create the properties accessor the compiler will also create any ivars that you leave out of the class declaration

7154310
getter	setter
you can create an attached property that is bindable and has a getter and setter

7154314

uilabel	uitapgesturerecognizer
you can add a uitapgesturerecognizer instance to your uilabel

7154370
config	ini
as far as the reasoning for this approach is that down the road i want to define either by ini or some other storage method a config file that would be a list of fields elements that belong to a specific form that a non-programmer type could easily edit that the generic form class would read pull in the element info and create the form on the fly

7154387
hash	salt
i m looking at some existing code that is generating a salt which is used as input into an authentication hash

7154410
hash	salt
it seems that someone misunderstood the concept of salt or what input your hash needs and thought it only accepts hexadecimal digits

all i want to do is send the post request with the number and get the final page back

7154421

7154621
width	height
my question is what do i assume the width height of the printed page as

7154623

7154786
getter	setter
you have declared an property â this is effectively a contract saying you will implement getter and setter methods but you haven t

7154791
getter	setter
synthesizing creates the setter and getter methods for you

7154791
getter	setter
you also have the option of defining the setter and getter methods yourself but unless you want to do something specific go with synthesize for now

7154808
getter	setter
using property tells the compiler that you intend to access the corresponding member variable through setter and getter functions functions which change the value of the variable or return its value

7154808
getter	setter
because you ve told the compiler that those variables should be accessible through setter and getter functions you need to define those functions

7154811
width	height
i assumed the width as 600 and my height as 800

libpcap	wireshark
wireshark sees all packets and i think it uses libpcap too

7155050

keep in mind usually such action would use post or put in which case you need to specify method with either post or put

7155276
sdl	xlib
i found out that any sdl calls that call xlib functions need to be the main thread so in this code all functions that rely on xlib are in the main thread

7155299
google-chrome	firefox
the reason for the differences is that firefox uses directwrite - a different technique to render text than google-chrome does

and that method is the substring method which takes an int as its argument and slices off everything before the specified chars position

7155354
jar	war
i solved this by creating a war of my application and replacing the sfl4j jar in the glassfish installation with the jars from my war file

7155365
width	height
you could have for example and it would grow in height and width while fading from its starting value of 80 opacity to completely transparent all smoothly at the same time

7155370
printf	strncpy
as stephen has mentioned for most platforms running strncpy 12 times versus printf should produce a negligible difference

7155370
memcpy	strncpy
if you are only interested in handling const strings you may be able to effectively precompute the length of the strings and then use memcpy instead of strncpy to perform the string append

7155417
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i m working on making customized gridviews with the use of dropdownlistfor and checkbox

7155427
post	get
one reason it matters is that the protocol spec assumes that things served by get requests are idempotent and things served by post are not

7155427
post	get
we re a long way away from a world in which the above rule holds 100 of the time but i d encourage you to do your part - use get for cases where you re simply retrieving a document and use post when you re modifying a resource changing state etc

7155491
getter	setter
is there in one of the specifications any reference to methods that start with is while the suffix of the method s name is a property s name similar to getter setter methods of java beans

7155521

7155543
getter	setter
should i make the setter and getter for each one of these attributes

7155597
post	get
you should use _post not _get to get the post value

7155600
put	get
otherwise you just get exactly what you put which is currentrowid

7155689
printf	strcpy
on the other hand printf likely has to do extra work compared to a strcat or strcpy because it must parse the s on each call to figure out how to deal with the variable argument list

7155690
width	height
incase you want to set a minimum maximum height and minimum maximum width to a div css allows the specific feature

7155690
width	height
similarly for setting maximum width and height of a div or any other class id element use

7155690

7156293
sorting	filtering
i was originally using pagination to make the inital load quicker however this means i need to do my sorting filtering server side otherwise it will only sort filtering the records on that page and not on the entire datasource

7156293
sorting	filtering
alternatively i can load the entire datasource into the grid which with 1000 records takes 20 secs to bind and then do all sorting filtering client side which is pretty much instantaneous

7156357
width	height
if you want your windowsformhost always have width and height like your parent control you can

7156357

find out how how many bytes is the int and the long double in your case

7156534
int	double
on x86 32 bit sizes are as such int 4 bytes long double is actually 16 bytes at least it should be on some arch s its 8 bytes and on others 12 bytes and each cycle can only operate on 4 bytes at a time so int takes 1 cycle and long double takes 4 3 and 2 respectively for the other sizes mentioned cycles

7156535

now the problem which i m facing is that the timeout function is scheduled to terminate the threads after 10 seconds and it does so very well

7156703
int	chars
on the other hand suppose that the contents of stringbuffer is still an array of chars but we also store an int size which tells us how long the string is number of chars

7156724
width	height
although most html elements support unites when writing width and height i have never seen that this is supported in case of applets so remove px

7156726

realloc	malloc	memcpy	malloc	memcpy	realloc
i can keep using malloc realloc memcpy but i m pretty sure that they are not recommended in c++

7156849
sorting	filtering
and its working.well i think this is more promising way to approach because you dont need sorting or filtering techniques but one unused column

7156855
post	get
to get the list of addresses that were selected you can add the control name as a parameter in you post handler and extract them during the save edit insert function

should i use getter setter

7157946
getter	setter
a good code-completing editor will also be helpful here though really good javascript code-completing editors are thin on the ground. but you re right that getter and setter in the java sense methods like getfoo and setfoo would make it more obvious when you re creating accessing a property that you haven t defined in advance through a typo by causing a runtime error calling a function that doesn t exist

7157946
getter	setter
i say in the java sense because javascript as of es5 has a different kind of getter and setter that are transparent and wouldn t help with that. so that s an argument for using them

7157946
getter	setter
you can define a java-style getter with no setter

you may want to implement something like that in a weblog ince most of your visits will be looking at your homepage reading your post and then leaving all that is done in the same single pageview so it may be a good idea to fire an event when the user leaves to get the correct time on site or maybe fire an event when the user scrolls past some threshold in the end you ll be measuring the same ting if the user scrolls more he reads more and if the user spends more time then he reads more

therefore the question can be translated to which one is faster the http get request or the post request

7160669
post	get	content-length	content-type
because the post request needs two additional http headers content-type and content-length comparing to the get request the latter should be faster because less data will be transferred

7160669
post	get
use post if you re modifying something use get if you want to fetch something

7162569
braces	reformatting
disable the following code style option - project settings - code style - wrapping and braces - keep when reformatting - line breaks

7162624
integer	unsigned
the same applies to other signed unsigned integer types too.

7162624
twos-complement	modulo
on a twos-complement system signed and unsigned char types are completely compatible modulo the difference in how the values are interpreted and it s perfectly safe to access them as either type

7162624
int	chars
even if the values as chars these are int

7162657
put	get
in your custom constructor use caller to get the filename that called the constructor and put it in

to fix this add another div within .top give this div a fixed width that is wide enough to contain all the content it seems you need 1124px and give this div the margin auto

7162680
for-loop	loops
you need to put it inside the for-loop before the while loops

7162688
int	boolean
a bit field uses a single value to represent a number of boolean states for example if we were using an 8 bit int then we might say that

7162688
int	boolean
as we wish to track 140 states 1 for each queue true indicating that queue contains a task 140 bits are required and so as 140 32 4.375 we need at least 5 32 bit int to store all boolean states

7162701
children	parent
but this again is wrong design because the chunk block is not shared by all children and shouldn t go into the base parent

7162703
int	double
as a side note if you come from a language like java in c++ the term object also refers to variables of built-in types like int double etc

7162703
children	parent
in any type of hierarchical data structures like trees a parent object can own its children

7162703
boost	stl
stl s auto_ptr and boost scoped_ptr have strict ownership semantics described above respectively with and without the ability to transfer ownership

7162757
single-sign-on	shibboleth
instead i d have a look at shibboleth - a single-sign-on intended for a decentralized architecture

shibboleth	simplesamlphp
shibboleth implementations are available on many services like apache2 or on application level like in php simplesamlphp

7162770

7163527
pull	push
it essentially depends on how often you decide to push your code and how often others are pull ing the code

7163527
pull	push
for example if you push a small change and someone else pull that change it will not be a large merge

7163527
pull	push
however if you do not push until you have committed locally numerous times then the pull could be a large merge

7163549
pull	push
if you pull from a repo then immediately try to push and it fails with non-fast-forward then something else is going on

7163581

7168350
hash	md5
i would rather not write my own so should i consider writing obtaining an md5 hash

7168374
width	height
so what i did is create a that is of 0px width with 170px of height and float right

7168386
versioning	upgrade
that is weird -- you probably want to upgrade to a later versioning

7168423
google-chrome	firefox
this is particularly true in the day where firefox google-chrome are putting out releases ever few months and mobile browser use is growing

7168429
dictionary	map
btw calling a list variable map isn t a good practice maps are usually dictionary

7168443
filtering	grouping
another solution is to find the tasks that have questions 2 or 8 and then use grouping by and having to filtering by grouping that have exactly two of those

7168460
hide	show
what you can do is bind a click event to the document that will hide the dropdown if something outside the dropdown is clicked but won t hide it if something inside the dropdown is clicked so your show event or slidedown or whatever show the dropdown

7168472
min	max
i then try and assign the min and max dates to a uidatepicker using jquery

7168482
getdate	dateadd
for example select getdate + 1 returns the same as select dateadd day 1 getdate and cast 40777.44281 as datetime is the same as 2011-08-24 10 37 38.783

7168482
getdate	datepart
datediff day 0 getdate 7 takes advantage of the fact that datepart day 0 which at the risk of overemphasizing the point is the same as datepart day 1 1 1900 returns 2 monday

7168485
hide	show
what you can do is bind a click event to the document that will hide the dropdown if something outside the dropdown is clicked but won t hide it if something inside the dropdown is clicked so your show event or slidedown or whatever show the dropdown

7168494
width	margin
i am working on a site design in which the main content area is centered via margin auto and has a fixed width

7168500
profiling	debugging
i know it was rendering properly in the first pass as i have a debugging window showing me the rendering results and in addition am using apple s opengl profiling and can see all of the textures

7168512
hide	show
what you can do is bind a click event to the document that will hide the panel if something outside the panel is clicked but won t hide it if something inside the panel is clicked so your show event or slidedown or whatever show the panel

7168545
ant	maven
but i m in the middle of converting a java project once built with ant to do so with maven instead

7168545
jar	war
when i open the war file for the project that i m trying to deploy with apache tomcat these are the only jar files i can find.

7168576
google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in firefox but for some reason jquery is returning completely different positions for each of my .post-info pi items in google-chrome and is even getting the document .height wrong

7168585
crypt	salt
however as i understand it php has a crypt function which takes a salt as well as the number of iterations of a particular algorithm

7168585
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
supposed to pass the returned hash of crypt back into crypt as the salt

7168585
crypt	salt
in that case would i just use a fixed salt for crypt and then generate a separate crypt for each user

7168598
folder	directory
you need to publish the project to iis or copy the compiled output to a folder that is within your iis s site s directory path and change that folder to an application from the iis mmc console right clicking on the folder and selecting change to application i believe.

7168606
inject	interceptor
the problem is i m not sure how to inject a businessobjectinterceptor into a new hibernate session or the proper way to annotate my classes so that they can use the interceptor

7168626
crypt	md5
crypt is one-way hashing like md5

7168640
uiview	subviews
the way i see it is that the view controller retains the uiview object and the viewcontroller.view also retains the uiview object through adding subviews

7168645
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the code below works well in safari but in google-chrome and firefox the form will not submit

7168660
war	manifest.mf
if your war is part of an ear file you may also want to check the project webcontent meta-inf manifest.mf classpath attribute

7168660
ant	maven
note that maven and ant are different beasts

7168660
ant	maven
maven can provision transient dependencies as necessary whereas ant scripts may have to define them explicitly

7168665
crypt	salt
when you pass this output als salt back to crypt it will extract the right algorithm and salt and use these for the operation

7168665
hash	salt
the hash part in the passed salt parameter is ignored

7168700
gridbaglayout	cardlayout	gridbaglayout	boxlayout	cardlayout	boxlayout
this uses various layouts including gridbaglayout boxlayout and cardlayout

7168711
portrait	landscape
my app is landscape only though and the login page loads in portrait

7168754
wordpress	joomla
i have it narrowed down to drupal joomla or wordpress

7168754
wordpress	joomla
from the information i have gathered drupal has a steeper learning curve wordpress has a large and ready set of theme resources and joomla brings a bit more simplicity for beginning developers

7168772
wordpress	expressionengine
i usually use either wordpress or expressionengine when an off-the-shelf cms is appropriate

7168796
getattr	subclassing
in which case you d probably be better by creating a simple helper to load all the classes from a module and put subclassing of testcase in the current module with different names should be straightforward doing this through a dir getattr in the module

7168796
folder	directory
still note that in pydev you may select multiple files folder and do a run as python unittest and it ll run all the tests it finds in the module or recursively in a directory so that may already be enough for you depending on your use case

7168843
exponent	addition
edit to ensure that the two exponent are equal requires the addition of the condition

7168847
textview	imageview
being z1 an imageview element and z2 a textview element

7168848
wordpress	joomla
from my experience working with a handful of wordpress and joomla sites i would suggest starting with wordpress

7168848
wordpress	joomla
the learning curve is much smaller and i ve found wordpress documentation more helpful than the joomla documentation

7168848
wordpress	joomla
unless the development you want to do requires the larger more flexible joomla or drupal framework start with wordpress for the sake of simplicity

7168949
width	height
google chrome set the height and width after document .ready

7168957
post	get
you should either disable magic_quotes or strip the slashes on all get post cookie data as early as possible following example #2 here

7168965
uiview	subviews
i think the question to ask is will there ever be a case where your uiview instances are removed as subviews but then preserved and re-added as subviews to some other view

7168988
requestfactory	gwt-rpc
simply use valueproxy instead of entityproxy and you turn requestfactory into a simple rpc mechanism similar to gwt-rpc

7168995
for-loop	loops
why is a for-loop used here instead of a while loops

7169035
for-loop	arrays
that s the only explanation i can see for both the for-loop and the i++ being placed inside of an arrays subscript

7169035
for-loop	loops	google-chrome	firefox
on windows the while loops above is 20 faster than the original for-loop in google-chrome in ie and firefox both loops perform the same

7169035
firefox	safari	for-loop	loops	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
on os x the for-loop has a 10 advantage in firefox there is no difference between the two in google-chrome and safari prefers the while loops by 6

7169035
google-chrome	firefox
if anything then judging by market share you would probably want to optimize for google-chrome on windows before optimizing for firefox on mac in which case the while loop would be preferred

7169075
width	height
i need to compare each object of the list with all the remaining objects in such a way that if the currentobject.location x y falls in the rectangle x y width height of the other object i need to delete the other object from the list

7169080
post	get
as such i can t get the actual post id so i can t delete that post

7169081
inherited	properties
i m using this class contact on a webservice and i need only the custom properties how can i re-use the class contact without the inherited abstractentity

7169096
webrat	cucumber
i m working on migrating a large set of cucumber features from webrat to capybara and i m running into quite a few issues

7169098
nszombies	nszombieenabled
anyway to turn on nszombies go to project edit active executable arguments tab then add a variable called nszombieenabled and set the value to yes

7169136
stdout	stderr
in a c++ program we have 3 streams stdin stdout and stderr

7169187
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
does it continue to animate in firefox safari google-chrome etc

7169191
addition	multiplication
this approximation can be had for the cost of a multiplication and an addition after reducing the angle mod 2 pi

7169196
int	chars
the two are also interchangeable but only if you re working with chars or int and only one condition is being tested

7169209
hide	show
what i want to do is hide or close the console application without terminating the whole application and show it later by pressing a button or something like that from form

7169210
getter	setter
you could write getter and setter that take the format you want and return the format you want

7169232
hide	show
basically seems like you need to call some windows api functions to show hide the console

7169245
google-chrome	firefox
so far everything works in firefox and google-chrome

7169269
gif	png
however the browser will only display documents that it knows how to either natively html text gif png jpg etc. or via a plugin pdf swf etc

7169273
express	everyauth
my authentication is done via the everyauth module i use the express framework

7169276
onresume	onpause
in that case you should implement your timer object as an instance member of your activity create and start it in the onresume method of your activity and stop it in the onpause method of that activity

7169297
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested in current versions of google-chrome firefox ie safari and opera

7169312

they load fine since i get the correct amount of rows put for some reason i can t the text printed

7169340
submit	submission
after clearing the cache and opening a new window submission a login request the first time wont submit correctly and the page reloads and nothing has changed but after the first time it works fine..

7169371
for-loop	arrays
you could make a function for this to remove an arbitrary element of an arrays have a parameter for the initial value of the for-loop

7169390
pull	push
as for tracking branches that s just an entry in your config file telling git where to pull and push a local branch to from by default

7169397
min	max	width	height
anyway..the problem with expressions seems to be that it gets evaluated constantly...so...watch for that...anyway a source for min max width height

7169426
button	checkbox
now lets you have a button with id show-message in your view and you want to load custom html base on the values of an input field id field1 and a checkbox id box1 into a div id put-message-here

7169441
many-to-many	many-to-one
essentially i have a many-to-one relationship for currentdog and a many-to-many relationship for pastdogs

7169511
subtract	add
once we found the starting point and assuming it was there at all we add the length of that substring to that starting point using pointer arithmatic and then find the resulting string s length by subtract the starting position from the ending position which is found with strchr position

7169512
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome on my windows machine however refuses to render it firefox works just fine

7169512
ubuntu	linux
i m using font-face to serve the ubuntu font set to browsers which is the font that i m using by default on my linux machine i can t really see how this might be a font issue though as it works in one browser but not the other

7169521
put	get
i know i could use js outside but as you will see in my code...i m gonna try to put php values...so i need to have some control directly in the expression so it excecutes automatically just once and then i don t have to write js functions elsewhere....i think this should be very simple...but i just can get it...anyway...my code is something liek this....

7169535
portrait	landscape
this means that the first view controller in your setup must support landscape otherwise the child will only support portrait

7169545
put	get
ignoring the hardware side of things get better harddrives servers etc. there are ways to optimize put commands

7169562
uilabel	nsstring
this method and its multiple variations return the size that a nsstring instance will use therefore you can scale the uilabel to your needs

7169574
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
almost all modern browsers support local storage meaning ie8 firefox 3.5 safari 4 google-chrome and above

7169586
jcomponent	bufferedimage
you can then draw this bufferedimage in a jcomponent s paintcomponent method with the graphics#drawimage ... method or even better for its simplicity and if you don t want to use the image as a background for a jpanel or gui draw the image in an imageicon that is displayed in a jlabel

7169619
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	put	get
i would love to not spend sometimes that much time in css and such...but unfortunately there are days in which i spend a whole afternoon trying to solve a little visual problem this is because of ie firefox google-chrome opera safari differences usually the one that gives more problems as we all know is ie...but sadly ...as we all know too it s the one that s typically used by the normal user...so...i spend a lot of time trying to get things to work the way i need in just one css sheet and without trying to make the exceptions for every browser...i know that s faster but for quality purposes...as far as i know there s usually a nice way to put everything in just 1 css sheet and work for at least ie6+ and ff3.6+ ..usually what works in firefox follows for the others ..

7169631
folder	directory
have another request that returns all the folder in the user directory and put them on the page

7169642
super	implements
please tell me your professional recommendations and some super simple tips on how to implements it which asp.net objects to use as well as how said objects provide the mechanism for managing my complex profiles

7169646
folder	directory
nb suggest making these folder in a different directory then your root directory maybe users obama

7169655
vb.net	vb6
so the natural progression says that more people will probably use c# than vb and vb.net s grandfather vb6 wasn t a good language...hence there are more resources for it

7169659
execvp	posix
as a possible contrast the posix specification for the exec family of functions specifically states that execlp and execvp should invoke sh in the case of an unrecognized executable type

7169700
decimal	ieee
as all know decimal fractions like 0.1 when stored as floating point like double or float will be internally represented in binary format ieee 754

7169724
hide	show
on initial load only one container will be visible then hide and show another container after you click the next li

7169741
cout	cin
the best way is to change the use of cin cout etc to parameters of type and

7169758
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
there is a subclassing with readonly properties inherited from the base class

7169761
int	double
in addition the return type of main should be int you should include stdio.h and you should have double quotes around your format string in printf

7169776
rcurl	libcurl
rcurl has an scp command based on libcurl not a system call

7169856
getter	setter
the exposed variable can be changed to a getter setter using simple search-and-replace

7169874
richfaces	tomahawk
the stacktrace hints that you re using both richfaces 3.3 and tomahawk 1.x

7169874
richfaces	tomahawk
the stacktrace shows that the tomahawk one is parsing the request body before the richfaces one

7169874
nullpointerexception	illegalstateexception
the nullpointerexception which you re facing is just the unforeseen consequence of this the richfaces guys should have thrown a more clear exception instead something like an illegalstateexception with the message uploaded file is missing in the request body or like but ala

7169874
richfaces	tomahawk
if you want to use richfaces file upload functionality then you ve really got to remove the tomahawk extensionsfilter from web.xml

7169879
width	height
the html5 element does not accept relative sizes percent for its width and height properties

7169879
width	height
not dependent on jquery i use it to get the width height of the parent div

7169887
hash	salt
you can combine that temporary id with some salt and or encryption and or hash of some connection-specific aspects like client ip time etc.

7169891
postgresql	mysql
we re currently using mysql for storing all of our data solr for indexing and i m investigating postgresql with postgis

7169891
postgresql	mysql
i m going to be writing either an apache module or mysql postgresql extension in c++ for each of these tests and following implementation once we make our decision

7169910
mockups	prototyping
i ve searched and haven t found any flexible gui mockups prototyping tools for ipad that would allow me to create winforms like business interfaces

7169975
width	margin
at the time of writing this my last attempt was with margin + - but i tried left width etc

7170043
int	chars
it is very common to have natural keys which could be candidates for a primary key with varchar chars data but yet instead enforce referential integrity on surrogate keys usually some kind of autonumbering int which is simply an internal reference and often the clustered index and primary key

7170058
springboard	tweak
yes you could write a mobilesubstrate tweak that launches the app when springboard starts

7170061
jobs	cron
if this all works it will confirm that you can run cron jobs

7170061
jobs	cron
if it works from the command line but not from cron test.py might have some dependency on environment variables cron jobs run with fewer environment variables set than interactive commands typically do

7170069
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it is 450 byte cross browser ie6+ firefox 3.0+ google-chrome opera safari 3.0+ script that unlimit s much of javascript s prototype property collision issues

7170087
post	get
try it and post any errors you get

7170097
width	height
the canvas width and height attributes are separate from the same canvas s width and height styles

7170097
width	height
the width and height attributes are the size of the canvas s rendering surface in pixels whereas its styles choose a location in the document where the browser should draw the content from the rendering surface

7170097
width	height
it just so happens that the default value for the width and height styles if they re not specified is the rendering surface s width and height

7170097
width	height
it s possible to check before setting width and height and leave the canvas alone if it doesn t need resizing which would eliminate some of the redraws but you can t get rid of all of them

7170130
min	max
a result from the query would look like doesn t matter which parent use as group as long as it is from one of those parent in the group min id or max id would do

7170132
getter	setter
it s perfectly ok to have a public getter setter when the object property should be exposed via the public interface so there is no rule such as setter is always private

7170132
getter	setter
if you have doubts over deciding whether to use getter setter over the class variables there are numerous explanations on the internet why getter setter are better

7170151
cos	sin
or at least alternative to replace the math operation of cos radians sin etc in gql

7170155
accessor	properties
in you viewdidload it should be self.flashsets this will insure the accessor method is used to set the value and thus the retain behaviour you specified on the properties definition will be implemented

7170172
inherited	subclassing
there is no way to really inherited from array or subclassing it

7170178
getter	setter
i don t know if this will help but you may want to use the setter and getter methods when referring to flashsets - the retain part of the property doesn t apply i don t think when setting the variable directly

7170211
post	get
probably the quickest solution is to just create a new app id for the site get the app access token for that app see app login on and then use that access token to retrieve the post

7170213
getter	setter
private getter and setter all make sense when the data in question involves several variables have additional constraints you want to make sure you adhere to and these operations are done several times in your class

7170276
dumpsys	adb
this could be easily checked by running dumpsys meminfo with adb shell

7170302

uiview	subviews
actually you probably don t want to create a uiview you should create a uiscrollview then add the images and that as subviews of the uiscrollview

7170441
iboutlet	ibaction
iboutlet and ibaction helped interface builder detect what outlet and actions you wish to connect to your ui controls at compile time these iboutlet and ibaction are ignored and have no use

7170441
iboutlet	ibaction
you can have a scenario where you don t need iboutlet or ibaction when you are building ui controls programmatically in code

7170546
getter	setter
you can mark dependencies by putting them as constructor parameters or as public property getter setter or using declarative syntax such as attributes

7170604
width	height
you have to change image size width height same as form size width height

7170626
codeigniter	cakephp
is a convention used in several web frameworks ror cakephp codeigniter etc. it s not a rule that anyone has to follow

7170677
post	get
i am trying to parse the webresponse i get from a multiform post

7171117
post	get
the string can be passed on to server as post get parameter

7171128
hide	show
i have a simple gallery grid with a nested span that show the title which i want to slide up on mouse over and hide on mouse out

7171175
children	parent
i am using the id in order to compare changes between parent entities children so it s fairly fundamental to the current way i ve designed it

7171181
nsmutablestring	nsstring
in ios you should use nsstring or its mutable version nsmutablestring to work with strings nsstring has a method named isequaltostring that helps you compare two string objects

7171183
portrait	landscape
you could use the rotateanimation on the textview but if you just trying to use a different layout in landscape and portrait specify different xmls in different folders

7171208
mouseleave	mouseenter
try using the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead

7171225
ftp	smb
in this context you should use a file transfer protocol like ftp ssh sftp smb or any other suitable protocol to transfer the uploaded file to the directory

7171246
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko
with this setup both webkit safari and gecko firefox will enlarge the 16x16 canvas space and the small image to 128x128 with the nearest neighbor algorithm

7171246
google-chrome	safari
in fact as of 2011-12-24 it works with safari on mac os and google-chrome on mac os but not with google-chrome one windows safari on windows was not verified as stated on issue 106662 of the chromium bug tracker

7171288

i have an old java project which i need to rebuild from a maven ant task and which has a lot of dependencies

7171383
vim	emacs
as vim and emacs use entirely different syntax description and scripting system it s obviously impossible to get vim syntax colouring under emacs automatically

7171450
accessor	properties
in addition to the standard javabean accessor methods indexed properties may also have methods to get set individual elements in the array by specifying an index

7171450
getter	setter
the javabean may therefore have the indexed getter and setter

7171450
getter	setter
in addition the standard getter and setter for non-indexed access

7171450
accessor	properties
going by the javadoc description if you omit the non-indexed accessor you can obtain a return value of null for the properties type of the properties descriptor

if i understand the code it seems the ruby code is hashing the key separately before feeding it to hmac which shoudln t be cryptographically necessary as hmac will hash a long key itself if necessary and feeds the hash key to hmac together with the original message

7175371
hash	hmac
on the other hand your c# code computes a hmac with the original key and a hash of the message

7175743
mouse	keyboard
your mouse cursor can only click on one object and you can only send keyboard input to a single text box

put your int into a string delimiting every int by a chars for example a comma and then save them as a string

7176095

the maven way of resolving situations like this is to include a section in your project s root pom.xml where you specify which version of which library will be used

7176130
width	height
so i want to dynamic height editfield but fix width

7176162
getter	setter
if you re considering something like this you most likely would be far better off implementing something like the inotifypropertychanged and stick this as part of your getter instead of only caring about the setter like normal usage

7176178
opera	google-chrome
why my following code don t work in ie7 but work in google-chrome opera mozila..

7176215

7176555
multiplying	add
it works fine but what i wana do is if the result antal_ordrar is larger than say 50 i wana multiplying the result total_provision with 1 2 add an extra 20 to the result

7176575
qtreewidget	qtreeview
first i should ask if you are really using a qtreewidget or rather a qtreeview

7176575
qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel	qtreewidget	qtreeview	qtreewidget	qabstractitemmodel
you cannot use custom delegates with a qtreewidget according to the documentation for qtreeview and will have to use a qtree view and some form of qabstractitemmodel for you to be able to use a custom delegate

7176591
joptionpane	jdialog
i suggest instead to run a jframe for the main gui and when the user wants to search pop a joptionpane or modal jdialog to accept the details to search for

7176650
calloc	malloc	memset	malloc	memset	calloc
you could use calloc which will initialize the memory to 0 or malloc and memset

7176661
range	minimum
this basically re-bases the range to have the minimum at 0

7176689
hide	show
if you can use show and hide instead or if on page load you had both classes already assigned and then you switched them immediately.

7176690
int	chars	unsigned	short
unsigned is a modifier which can apply to any integral type chars short int long etc. but on its own it is identical to unsigned int

7176705
super	implements
it s implements in python 3 unicode strings super without arguments and __getitem__ slices

7176757
implements	extends
it would seem that if all the classes i wish to instantiate extends the same abstract class or implements the same interface this is a reasonable request

7176772
filtering	grouping
the entities are grouping in an hierarchy and i can filtering using those

7176808
wtl	atl
this is caused by an incompatibility between wtl s atlapp.h and atl s atlbase.h

7176808
wtl	atl
this part of wtl was probably an attempt to supplement an earlier version of atl and was just not removed when atl came up to speed

7176812

7176885
division	modulo
so the first thing to note here is that the modulo returns the remainder of a division

7176889
width	height
but it is better practice to place the width and height in the tag so the browser doesn t have to calculate these dimensions

7176899
width	height
as far as i know you do not add the px label to width height attribute values on the img tag itself and i believe though could be wrong it s because pixels are used regardless

7176899
width	height
in css however one may use different units to specify width and height therefore it is appropriate to add the label when using css

7176935
powerpc	i386
i am trying to find a way to get gcc to temporarily ignore -arch powerpc and -arch i386 flags

7176966

7177002
min	max
we take note of how min and max work and pull the common sub-expression explicitly

7177002
min	max
this eliminates the min and max macros completely

7177068
post	get
we found a solution for this perform a post request instead of a get request inside the flash

7177068
post	get
you must also pass a faked data as flash will automaticly change your post request to a get if there s no datas to send along the request here s a flash code sample to make this work

7177075

the most obvious is transactional semantics only on the innodb engine not available with myisam so that you can safely know that whole groups of uploads or modifications take place consistencly

7177179
swt	swing
rich clients in java are done using swing or swt

7177179

7177217
slideup	slidedown
i have a simple accordion menu i ve put together today using the jquery slidedown and slideup methods

7177217
slideup	slidedown
this works great however if you click on one of the s once then again before the animation completes you can break the slideup or slidedown event

7177377
rss	feed
im using channel tags to display content for an rss feed

7177642
joptionpane	jdialog
either a generic joptionpane or undecorated jdialog

i probably should have mentioned this in my initial post but is there any way i can also get the table name associated with each field

7178162

7178209
getter	setter
is there a way i can create a java class with a pair of general getter setter methods such as

7178217
implements	extends
your block file should extends mage_adminhtml_block_template and implements mage_adminhtml_block_widget_tab_interface meaning that you ll have to implements some methods and in the construct you can set the template file ie

7178234
prepare	execute
the more complex queries you want to execute the more complex your application will get prepare statements mysql escaping getting last insert id etc

7178276
put	get
the problem is that if i put the absolute loginurl in the applications web.config instead of login.aspx i put i m successfully redirected but the passed returnurl is not absolute but relative and so i cannot get back to the calling application

7178307
qiodevice	qnetworkreply
qnetworkreply is a qiodevice so you can read it the same way you would read a file

7178309
button	checkbox

google-chrome	firefox
also google-chrome and firefox will not load content from disk by default use the --allow-file-access-from-files flag while invoking google-chrome like so

7178337
public	protected
the linkedin api does not allow you to fetch all data some remains protected in their walled garden but at least it gives easy access to all public data

7178365
elf	coff
for both elf and pe coff formats the memory for p will be inside of the stack frame for main and the memory for hello will be in a read-only data segment .rdata for pe coff .rodata for elf

7178370
google-chrome	firefox
a lot of browsers google-chrome firefox will block files being loaded directly from your disk for security reasons

7178398
pull	push
depending on the package manager this might involve push solutions drop the package with configuration information into a directory or send it using an interface while others are managed with a pull solution

7178428
getter	setter
edit faulttype looks like this getter and setter omitted

7178457
mouseover	mouseout
this will call a timeout when you mouseover the #menu-navigation li element and that timeout will be canceled if you mouseout before the timer is called half a second in the above example

7178479
hex	binary
in fact since hex can be interpreted as a shorthand for writing binary you might even say that when you print out a decimal number using printf it has to be converted from hex to decimal

7178497
button	checkbox
when they press a submit button it will check to see which checkbox are clicked and remove them from the database

7178499
width	height
the itemscontrol would have it s itemspaneltemplate set to a canvas and each widgetbaseviewmodel would contain a top left height and width property

7178532
base-class	subclassing
revised by hiding with a more restrictive access - in this case private access - you will still see the base class member from a base-class or subclassing reference but it would defer to the new method when available from the new access level

7178543
cassini	iis
however running my application on my laptop computer a windows xp machine with iis 5.1 causes me to get an error every time i call the service from my silverlight plugin either in cassini or in hosted iis

7178545
goto	break
they don t go as far as to implement goto but they implement continue and break

7178560
post	get
why do you want to send objects using a get request post is the defacto method for posting data to server

7178597
pull	push
do a git pull and then do the git push

7178604
implements	extends
1 which class has the original addhandler function implements from which i need to extends my class

7178621
pascal	delphi

blog post like this 1 get indexed in google and people assume it s an acceptable substitute it s not

7178634
jmenubar	jmenuitem

7178672
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
yield and let aren t in google-chrome or opera or safari or ie yet

7178701
hash	salt
however i don t really see how that helps - if the attacker has access to the hash of the password as they do in the example i ve been reading they most likely they will also have access to the salt

7178701
hash	salt
therefore can t an attacker just prepend and postpend the salt to each item in a dictionary before running through the dictionary to see if it matches the hash

7178733
min	max
simply change the min max swap stuff to

7178738

7178789
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview that is a subviews of uiscrollview

7178822
hash	salt
2- if two users have the same password the hash would be different if salt so it s harder to catch common passwords

7178831
inherited	subclassing
another and simpler possibility is to declare the annotation as inherited - thus it applies to the subclassing as well

7178846
gif	png
validate it s an image gif jpg png

7178890
hash	salt
increase the computational cost of breaking it because for each password in the dictonary the attacker need to try hash it with all possible salt

7178925
pull	push
we ve created some hooks where when we push to the dev branch the dev server automatically pull the new commit in

7178925
versioning	upgrade
also regarding your master branch - leaving this as the vanilla install of wordpress is awesome because you can actually test new versioning upgrade easily

7179001
uiview	subviews
note you may add one view controller s uiview property as a subviews

7179033
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
i solved this issue by using the mousemove mousedown mouseup selenium commands to move to a different field on the page which gets rid of the date picker

7179045
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
ie is just slower at running javascript than firefox google-chrome safari etc

7179071
maven	pom.xml
yet i also couldn t found any maven repository for retrieve all birt related dependencies but i am using some method to retrieve birt related dependencies by configuring maven properties in pom.xml as follow please use this url for more detail

7179079
width	height
have you tried to explicitly set the height and width of the acccordion to the content

7179117

how do i get each seperate file name so i can put them in my mysql database in seperate columns

7179161
std	ostream

i used the solution proposed by roman below based on adding an additional div with position absolute i tested it in ie7 ie8 ie9 google-chrome and firefox and seems to work fine

7179178
opera	google-chrome
for ie opera and google-chrome

7179203
post	put
windows mobile also supports httpwebrequest class and you can create http post put request to upload a file to a server

7179215
button	checkbox
when save button will clicked first three textbox values will go to listong table and the identity will then paired up with the selected checkbox from the list control and save to map table

7179222
uicontrol	uibutton
why don t you want to use a uibutton - it inherits from uicontrol and has a lot of code that you probably don t even know exists

7179229
int	double
as far as i can see the reason for this is that foo asdf does not have a well defined type it s either int int or double int

7179268
width	height
while i ve been developing happily along with a stage width and height of 930x270 the truth is that not every single site is going to be using those dimensions

7179268
width	height
everything that runs uses the stage.stagewidth property and same with stage.stageheight for this exact reason however i cannot seem to dynamically set the width and height values even with basic to advanced embedding techniques on the web pages themselves

7179268
width	height
or even if i set a specific width and height or not

7179268
width	height
is there anything in mxml or some property i can modify or some embed tactic that i m missing to get the stages properties set to the width and height of its embedded object

7179282
width	height
the application crashes when you use the lower right resize action ie change the height and width at the same time

7179285
cout	ofstream	ostream	ostringstream
then you can call that function passing cout or any other object of a class derived from ostream ofstream ostringstream etc...

7179292
webclient	httpwebrequest
especially the link to upload files using an rfc 1867 post request with httpwebrequest webclient

7179326
post	get
post is not like get where you tack the variables onto the url

7179331

don t forget that your url can contain a combination of get and post parameters

7179336
submit	submission
open my software submission software pad worker to submit the xml

7179350
int	double	int	boolean
common types such as floats double int boolean and urls

for collections a combination of instances of nsdata nsstring

7179353
hide	show
one large template some js ajax for validating input additional hidden inputs that hold current step-id and php deciding which fields to show or hide

7179364
std	ostream
have tried using std ostream o

7179364
std	ostream
std cout is a variable of type std ostream by the way

7179397
nsstring	nsdata
the object you are storing to the user defaults and all of it s children has to be a plist type of object or in other words nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary

7179425
width	height
use surfaceholder.setfixedsize int width int height

7179443
pop-up	dialog
also its better to go with wix dialog as you can capture the option selected by user on the pop-up

7179449
pop-up	dialog
i am creating a pop-up dialog box uialertview

7179460
post	get
don t you guys think the original post is way too elaborate to get the clear picture

7179481
post	put
looks like the best one involves modifying post to put the value you want into the fields

7179490
implements	extends
the first reason that comes to mind is to make it easy to substitute with some other object one that implements a common interface or extends a common superclass

7179493
setinterval	settimeout
with the html5 side-specs no need to hack javascript anymore with settimeout setinterval etc

7179506
strncmp	strcmp
if this is a nul-terminated string the compiler must use strcmp or strncmp

7179523
width	height
there is a textblock in my statusbar which has width and height set to auto

7179523
width	height
so when i changed text of my statusbar textblock it s width and height gets recalculated and it s parent s recalculates it s layout

7179523
width	height
but setting scrollviewer.cancontentscroll false disables virtualization and i want to use virtualization to my listbox so i set fixed height and width to the textblock

7179535
width	height
if there s no universal functionality that will work for all i m ok better than nothing for partial functionality i mean supporting some of the browsers by that not setting window width height etc

7179535
width	height
don t come with answer telling to set window width height i know how to do it i m not looking for it too

7179545
ant	maven
you can then associate this ant task with the initialize phase of maven - the overhead would be minimal

7179553
subtract	add
i then add or subtract a certain amount of lat or long from the

7179554
width	height
that ensures the texture is allocated by the driver proper width height buffer ready for later updates

7179567
children	parent
i have two types of rows one displays parent and second displays children

7179596
crypt	salt
even with the simple unix crypt s 2-letter salt this already is a factor of 3 844

7179596
hash	salt
modern password hash algorithms use a much larger salt for example bcrypt uses a 128-bit salt which gives a factor of 2 128 .

7179596
hash	md5
to protect against dictionary attacks too you ll use a slow hash algorithm instead of a fast one like simple md5 or sha1 sha2

7179626
superclass	subclassing
any class may behave as superclass or subclassing

7179630
union	distinct
you can select the color of both column in two queries union the result and output the distinct colors

7179659
pull	push
another approach would be to use pub sub to fire off messages to the workers and push pull to harvest results

7179679
google-chrome	firefox
now i am facing a strange issue on firefox and google-chrome allthough it works fine in ie8

7179679

7179690
ivar	subclassing
i ve subclassing uipangesturerecognizer and added an panenabled bool ivar

7179690
uipangesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
i know if you subclass the uigesturerecognizer you need to maintain the state yourself but i would think that if you are subclassing uipangesturerecognizer and for all the touches methods calling the super that it would be setting the state in there

7179729
post	get
or use php and check if there is any variable named mem_follow this is for post although it doesn t matter if it s get or post

7179742
children	parent
let s say that you d like to create a nested menu in which one of the children links to the same path as its parent

7179789
button	checkbox
some of the checkbox automatically check other boxes ie a check all button

7179793
getter	setter	public	protected
think about it we have access rules such as private protected public and conventions on how to name getter setter and a lot of things

7179794
hide	show
i need to be able to hide show multiple div tags on the same page via a drop down menu but i want them to use the jquery fadetoggle

7179829
button	checkbox
the correct way to set checkbox and radio button as of jquery 1.6 is -- or omit the second argument to get the value instead

as you said it s a button not an input type submit so it shouldn t be submission

7180343

i ve been staring at the graph api documentation for the ad grouping object and don t see an equivalent call to achieve all of the filtering in a single call

in google-chrome and firefox everything is fine but in ie the form shows but i cannot write inside the textboxes fields

7180570

for-loop	loops
yes the instance of parserobject that is declared within the for-loop goes out of scope each time loops iterates

7180630

7180782
versioning	upgrade
specifically the old versioning of the app had a default.png which the new app doesn t yet have as part of the build yet the upgrade app displays the old default.png while it is loading

7180809
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in ios 5 the concept of container view controllers was introduced of which it turns out that uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller were special container view controllers all along - notice that these view controllers already route these methods to your own view controllers

for-loop	loops
first there is never a length cost for using a for-loop over a while loops but you get additional functionality with the for-loop so some coders just always use the for

7181392
for-loop	loops
when you read this code you have to switch from the for-loop mode of thinking to the while loops mode of thinking

you need to pass in the static visibility dependency properties itself which button inherited from uielement not the value of the properties on the button instance

7181485
distance	polygons
my simplest example is i place a cube on a table place a projector attached to a tripod some distance away measure the distance orientation between the two using gom photogammetry product open an existing obj polygons model that is exactly the same shape as the cube dimensionally very accurate but with some fancy coloring then project the polygons model to the lcd projector

7181489
children	parent
i got a problem with my db design i am developing a forum in which you can add topcis and then subtopics inside that forum and so on but in that subforum it must show the answers of that topic and the subtopic so you have a parent topic and children my problem comes with the id i mean for example when you create a topic id 1 then you assign parent_id 1 but how do you know the children of that topic for example topic id 2 parent_id 1 you can assign to the children id 2 but are there a better way

7181698
post	get
i believe it could be done by sending all the required content through get or post and then make php stuff it to a variable however i m not exactly sure

7181708
post	get
if you want to pass a variable to the server you can use a form and send the data through a get or post

7181721
post	get
the php script you pinged with ajax either via get or post can then take the value you passed and push it into a _session variable

7181735
put	get
what i don t get is where do i put the php script that tells mysql to do the calculations and what the calculations actually are

7181752
min	max
i want to find out the min and max price from a list of item objects contains price using accumulate

7181850
int	double
but if you do this to get the current behavior of int division you need to use the double slash

7181884
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is another free option in some ways maybe free-er than mysql given mysql s oracle connection. but mysql is likely to be more readily available on a lot of inexpensive hosts

7181895

7181968
int	chars
it replaces the extension of a filename with the empty string takes the last three chars as a string and tries to convert to an int

7181993
min	max
never optimize min max without benchmarking and looking at actual compiler generated assembly

7181993
min	max
i m writing this because you are assuming strong optimization and yet trying to outsmart the compiler on min max

7182025
min	max
you ll probably want to set a max for screen say 1260px and a min for mobile say 320px

7182031
hide	show
that s all working fine but what i want to happen is when the user selects a different school year i want it to hide the div that s open for the school year they currently have selected and then show the new one

hide	show
same with when a position is selected if they first pick center and then shortstop i want it to hide the hs-center div and show the hs-shortstop div

7182068
submit	submission
in this case they d probably not even by submit buttons but just buttons with sum js code to handle submission

7182090
preferenceactivity	listpreference
there is no code in my preferenceactivity that affects this listpreference

7182127
addclass	removeclass
this should be faster because there s half as many jquery calls and just setting an attribute is way faster than addclass and removeclass but it is also more brittle and a bit less readable for what changes you re actually trying to make

7182167
put	get
i generally create a constants class or some other appropriately named static class and then put static get only properties for the various constants

7182315
width	height
but i want to do something like board.show and have all of the square objects that are members of that class that have a height width and color show up

7182343
pull	push
this way you end up with two unrelated repositories which mercurial will refuse to push pull without the use of force only containing the history of a single directory

7182356
move	drag
you ll notice that if you try to drag the image you can see the helper move but it won t leave the gallery box

7182573
folder	directory
uses third-party code for functionality that is included with the rest of the code via actionscript build path source path note that this folder must be included explicitly for this project even though the path included is already in the source directory

7182573
folder	directory
source and project directory contain svn repository folder and files probably irrelevant

7182575
width	margin
there is still a margin on the left but i want my table to stretch over the complete width of the screen

7182587
google-chrome	firefox
the code works as expected in google-chrome but not in firefox

google-chrome	firefox
it still works in google-chrome but not firefox

7182588
apache	nginx
because php is ran through apache nginx

7182646
width	height
whatever you put inside that widget has better know how to compute its width and height or else.

7182687

because it creates a temporary int where the double is converted and mutable references cannot bind to temporaries whereas const ones can

7182715

7182791
daemons	launchd
the problem is that i need a daemons script preferrably php that runs in background and constantly launchd queries to mysql db and basing on some of criterias time and conditions from resultsets updates other tables

7182817

you could then use a daemon cron job querying the view every 10 minutes or so if you have to send out emails or do some cleanup work etc

7183004
inherited	subclassing
but if this is your default division operation or you are doing a lot of this then do like the pseudocode below inherited from one of the subclassing of numbers.number real rational or integral new in 2.6 redefine __div__ or else define a non-default alternative __divra__ operation

7183019
min	max
i would decide on a resolution for the analysis the size of your closed interval call it delta x and then as jerry mentioned find the max and min of the function within that closed interval including the end points

7183019
min	max
that will give you n intervals or delta xs and you will have found the max and min of each interval let s call them the delta ys

7183036
invokerequired	begininvoke
if invokerequired is false you are in theory already running on the ui thread and can simply perform synchronous actions directly or still begininvoke if you need to fire them off asynchronously

7183085
hide	show
i think that it is cleaner to refactor it and have the form live inside a hidden div and use javascript to show hide it as required

7183117

7183228
children	parent
the parent should list the children as modules they will then be executed as part of the parent build process

7183300
decltype	auto
since this is pre auto and decltype your best bet is using eric niebler s foreach macro

7183307

i get values from an html form using a post method and store them in my db through the mysql insert command done in php

7183480
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
ie 8 9 firefox 5 6 safari and google-chrome all can implement my code correctly except ie7

7183747
mouse	keyboard
i thought that you might be able to set any field on any kind of event using the mouse pressure field on a keyboard event since the system almost certainly won t have set that to pass along arbitrary information and so identify the events that you ve constructed yourself

7183774
post	get
when i post to update-levels sometimes i get the message

clang	llvm
most assuredly you will have your llvm trunk checkout and under the tools path you have checked out clang trunk as well explained under building clang via

7186214
debian	linux
on os x the build set up is a bit different but on debian linux i m building it daily as follows

7186214
clang	llvm
note if you re at the top level you can svn update the llvm trunk project-test trunk and clang trunk as follows

7186214
clang	llvm
at the top of the llvm tree you build against running make build_examples 1 will build the llvm specific examples then going inside your build tools clang path you then must run make build_examples 1 again to build the clang examples

7186214
clang	llvm
verify the examples installing under usr local bin for llvm and usr local lib for clang

7186220
width	height
you will have to find the heightof the text you need to contain inside the uitextview of a particular fixed width and then set its frame height to that value so that it is not scrollable

7186233
move	drag
for example if my drag started on element1 and during the drag i move to element2

7186233
google-chrome	safari
while desktop browsers do reflect it google-chrome safari .

autofac	castle-windsor
you can also achieve similar results using an ioc container such as castle-windsor ninject autofac etc

7186283
dictionary	map

7186296
int	double
you can use the wrapper classes int and double instead int and double

7186315
hash	salt
however to create the hash of this guess word needs to be generated using the same salt that was used for the password hash

7186315
hash	salt
my question here is how can i extract the salt from password hash

7186327
switching	screens
by lock and unlock do you mean when the screens sleeps or the device power switching is pressed putting the device to sleep and then woken back up

7186327

if so i suspect you need to release the camera resources in your onpause and then start the preview again in onresume via the surface view callback

7186336
range	infinity
can only give me a generator for the squares up to and i can t see any obvious way to call range infinity so that it just keeps on truckin

7186340
hash	md5
md5 will produce a hash for password but it will always produce the same one

7186340
hash	salt
by not using just password but instead password + salt a different hash is produced and mrun is foiled

7186340
hash	salt
if you need to find the salt you will have to have at least one known combination of password and hash

7186343
sudo	passwd
although your passwd can show up in strange places so you might want to do a sudo grep passwd -r first to see if its anywhere else on the system and then clear out your history

7186344
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
a core data object is usually a subclass of nsmanagedobject not a nsobject

7186354
opera	firefox
in terms of supporting the html5 video tag i believe firefox and opera only support ogg vorbis and i don t see them getting .mp4 support in the very near future .3gp and .mp4 are patented

7186369
x509	openpgp
one of the options is to use detached signature using an openpgp key or x509

7186375
hash	salt
just pass the password hash as the salt -- it is smart enough to extract itself

7186375
crypt	salt
note the salt parameter of crypt is not the salt

7186375
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
see also why does crypt blowfish generate the same hash with two different salt

the rails framework is improving at a steady pace and if there is a downside to that is that it can be a pain to upgrade from versioning to versioning especially as regards to major versioning changes which introduce tons of backward incompatibilities

7186564
put	get
why then would you want to put yourself in the hole at the get go

7186574
pdfbox	itext
itext is probably the best but if you cannot live with their license there is also pdfbox

7186586
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in internet explorer 7

7186586
google-chrome	firefox
when the text within the textarea is 12345 and all this text is selected firefox and google-chrome returns

google-chrome	firefox
i got this code with js parsing from xml my output displays nan in google-chrome firefox ie.

7186639
keydown	keyup
i have tried keyup keydown and keypress

7186699

use instrumentation particularly the time profiling instrumentation

7186721
hide	show
to hide show rows you can do it on the template file with an structure similar to this

7186748
textchanged	keyup
you are adding the keyup event handler multiple times inside the textchanged handler

7186774
implements	extends
actually what i would like to have is something like class a implements hasastate and where b has a reference to a and can call a.addstate b only because b extends and where a can call b.setparent this

my instance of mergeadapter should include a simplecursoradapter which is correctly reading data from my db and as a footer a new textview or button which should be clickable

7186925
getter	setter
you may use constructor arguments or explicit getter setter or you could declare your properties to be public

7186941
int	boolean
for example avoid mapping 2 value logic with boolean or for more values like the colours of a semaphore red green yellow with int 1 2 3

7186973
width	height
for width and height you can use and

7186973
inherited	properties
if you want the image to be customizable you should inherited the button class and add an imagesource properties

7186976
udp	tcp
summary mailslots are rather like udp but named pipes are closer to tcp

7187022
width	height
this page says that the video can be max 398px in width and height developers.facebook.com docs guides attachments

7187059
sse	avx
it s hidden away on intel s avx technology page but it s equally useful for sse programming

7187078
getter	setter
is there a way in c++ to enforce the use of getter or setter within the class

7187078
getter	setter
the only thing that comes to my mind is to put all the super-private members as private variables into an abstract base class with protected getter setter

7187078
getter	setter
and currently before setting any variable i search whether i created a getter or setter to find out whether i have to consider invariants

7187083
opera	google-chrome
a suggestion was made to try opera 11.00 or higher to see if google-chrome has a bug here or some security model that disallows this

7187086
put	get
in my mini.login.phtml which i put in the footer of my pages and the good news is it does get the item count in the cart

7187088
pull	push
i would like to create a git repo in which the users can only pull the files from the git repository and can never push into it

7187125
min	max
a simpler solution might be to implement a wrapper class for your integer and declare min and max in that class

7187150
google-chrome	firefox
following works in google-chrome ie9 and firefox on a .php

7187150
google-chrome	firefox
why will it work in firefox and not in google-chrome and ie

7187150

7187228
wordpress	oscommerce	wordpress	joomla	joomla	oscommerce
i saw this with other systems like oscommerce joomla wordpress etc

7187242
bazaar	git
check out gitworkflows for the idea behind it or the bazaar workflows for a very nice graphic repesentation of the possibilities it is also possible to use git or any other dvcs like a cvcs

7187252
pull	push
a dvcs mixes version control branching and labels with publication push pull to from remote repo

7187252
perforce	svn	pull	push
i don t think you can summarize that way especially considering it would be difficult to emulate the push pull features since most of the vcs svn clearcase perforce ... have no local repo only local working spaces and depend heavily on their central repo

7187255
bazaar	git
that s why git and certainly hg and bazaar have strong merging algorithms

7187289
width	height
when i debug to everything worked fine in watch window i can see width and height with 640 and 480

7187289
width	height
but after excute the copy method it returns the bitmap to bmp but the width and height of bmp is -1 and -1 and it couldn t add the text

7187368
post	get
can you also post the errors jsps get when they are unable to load these

7187386
hash	salt
the salt of a password hash function is concatenated with the password and the resulting string is then hash

7187386
hash	salt
to get back the salt that would mean you d need to get back the string which was hash

7187398
subtract	add
in order to resolve the problem you can add subtract a small number to find an answer that is correct up to a certain accuracy

7187401
implements	sealed
personally i rarely implements idisposable myself and when i do it s typically from a sealed class as i like to seal classes where possible - and it almost never involves a finalizer.

7187427
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a newer versioning of ld versioning 2.21 that comes with mingw 4.5.2 works fine

7187449
post	get
how do i get on these post also the share link

7187479

7187542
slideup	slidedown
slidedown and slideup animates the hiding showing

7187556
button	checkbox
in addition quick movements performed may let the user click on the button rather than on the checkbox

7187588
inherited	properties
this rule applies the colors to every element so neither of the two properties is implicitly inherited

7187588
inherited	properties
because this breaks the inherited chain completely for any properties that is normally inherited such as color setting those properties in a rule is considered bad practice unless you have a very good reason to break inherited this way most use cases that involve breaking inherited require you to do it for just one element not all of them

7187640
slideup	slidedown
the only diffrence that exists between hide and slideup slidedown is the animation

i set the display to none hide it and then attach an event handler to the click event of a the element with id thebutton not in html to show it again

7187829
super	extends
if b extends a you simple use a call to super int a in b s constructor and everything is fine

7187829
super	extends
for constructors not calling a super empty or not extends a super class the compiler will add a call to super

if you have a properties with an internal set accessor and public get accessor it means that code within the assembly can read get and write set the properties but other code can only read it

7187869
button	checkbox
or the checkbox might not respond to clicks because the button swallows the event

7187869
button	checkbox
most users will think that your layout has a bug because they ve never seen a checkbox inside of a button before

7187869
button	checkbox
along with any rendering issues what will the checkbox look like when i press the button

7187869

google-chrome	firefox
after experimenting with the css3 flex-box proporty i quickly noticed some differences in google-chrome and firefox

7188085
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
dynamic memory management on an small embedded system is tricky to begin with but realloc is no more complicated than a free and malloc of course that s not what it does

7188085
realloc	malloc
the other reason is that some embedded systems must be high reliability and malloc realloc can return null

7188089
instances	transient
if you want a new instances of a component every time you request one from the container use transient

7188106
width	height
according to slider change value dynamically increase height and width of your label

7188110
kde	gnome
when it comes to window managers there is a lot more to it than just font size for instance the width between 2 controls are handled differently in gnome kde

7188129

gdal	ogr
- define low-level data sources implemented in form of a set of drivers as named in gdal ogr or providers as named in fdo

7188249
gdal	ogr
fdo gdal and ogr are all implemented in c++ programming language

7188249
gdal	ogr
gdal ogr gives access to data stored in enormous number of geospatial formats lots of data processing algorithms and operators

7188249
gdal	ogr
fdo provides those features too interestingly thanks to integration with gdal ogr in some places like fdo provider for gdal but it feels more like a framework whereas gdal ogr feels more like a library

7188249
gdal	ogr
you may find matthew perry s blog and following discussion helpful fdo gdal ogr and fme

7188249
gdal	ogr	gdal	proj	proj	ogr
note gdal and ogr are bundled together under the umbrella of common software proj called simply gdal

7188277
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	memcpy	free	realloc	memcpy	malloc	memcpy	realloc
well it s better to avoid using realloc if it s possible since this operation is costly especially being put into the loop for example if some allocated memory needs to be extended and there no gap between after current block and the next allocated block - this operation is almost equals malloc + memcpy + free

7188310
hash	md5
i think a hash is what i want here perhaps something like md5 seed + seq max but javascript doesn t have md5 and if i m doing it in code there s probably a better choice of hash

7188327
hide	show
if you want to add a nice hide show transition i suggest looking at the css3 transition

7188367
hide	show
i ve got an button that on page load reads show content and when clicked the content is show and it switches to a button with hide content

7188367

7188501
gridview	sqldatasource
i have sqldatasource assigned to a gridview and a lot of the fields returned are only used in the code behind to determine whether a column is visible etc

7188525

alternately you can put the action handler in your view controller as you have done above then get the visible cells in the action handler and loop through them finding out which one matches the superview for your button view

7188535
textview	imageview
in my application i have activity group in which i have a custom listview with imageview textview and a spinner

7188551
realloc	malloc
realloc can fail just like malloc can

7188551
realloc	malloc
realloc is worse than malloc in that you will need to have the old and new pointers valid during the realloc

7188551
realloc	malloc
in other words you will need 2x the memory space of the original malloc plus any additional amount assuming realloc is increasing the buffer size

7188551
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
i m not saying that realloc is worse than implementing realloc using a malloc free

7188551
free	malloc
if you can do a single malloc and free without resizing it s slightly better yet still dangerous

7188556
put	get
i wanted to put a value to x and y manually and i guess i need an array for it cause i get that value from my database sqlite which has many x and y value inside

after this much of code i tried all the methods that is given in previous post but not able to get this newssmage behind the original image

7188744

you have to specify the width and height in pixel for canvas

7188744
width	height
of course your parent may refer to different things you need to change the width and height accordingly

7188757
folder	directory

7188899

i tried this in both safari 5.0.5 and firefox 3.6 and both cases the alert says 8 and the -tag ends up 8 pixels from the top of the page whereas the body tag starts 100 pixels further down on the page as can be seen if inspecting using e.g firebug

7189373
min	max
a group by on filename with max on time to get the last time to get the first time use min should suffice

7189403

otherwise you will be forced use some isolation framework like typemock or moles to simulate values from your static methods

7189695
gridview	rowdatabound
for example see this article where a gridview in extended to do the same or see this where rowdatabound event is used to apply the css class to column header classes will set back-ground sort image or see this that uses rowcreated event to actually add image control into header cell

7189717
google-chrome	firefox
that form has one field label select columns for report which is the longest label and it is getting wrapped over multiple lines in ie which i don t want whereas in firefox and google-chrome it is working properly

7189728

this is the best i could do so far using tables checked on firefox google-chrome and ie8

firefox and google-chrome seemed to handle it fine but ie didn t like it

7189986
int	chars
a chars and int can be casted to each other so use that technique

7190038
getter	setter
i have a tendency to use only properties starting with a capital and define the getter and setter public or private

7190055
fadein	fadeout
i can guess that the fadeout fadein changes the pixel value and thus it is not equal to the transparent key

7190070
maven	pom.xml
you should create an umbrella maven project with pom.xml packaging and make all of your other project modules of this aggregator

7190137

7190358
gridbaglayout	miglayout
do you know some way to make miglayout acting like gridbaglayout

7190363
backslash	double-quotes
the backtick environment is like double-quotes so backslash are used for escaping

7190368
set	bag
you don t have to activate the document id feature just ensure that in the property bag of the root web of the destination site collection where the document set will be imported again exists a property named docid_msft_hier_siteprefix with an value of empty string

7190389
int	boolean
so to make a hash you will need to use the bytes of all simple value types int floats boolean etc and have a special case for strings that take the bytes that the string points to

7190443
awt	swing
then nothing needs it any more no awt swing components ...

7190449
hide	show
there s no direct way of doing this in apps script but there is a feature request open to provide a way get the show hide status of a row if you want to star it

7190471
for-loop	loops
what i have learned is that using the get i in for-loop will result in an iteration over the whole list over and over again each loops run

7190499
put	get
get the window height substract height of heder and footer divide by the 1 element height and put as a parameter to the link

7190526
post	get
i guess that was done using rest webservices i do understand that in order to perform post gets to the server i need to construct a request string then pass it to the webserver get results parse them xml or json and then view them

7190532
hide	show
the comboboxes work my problem comes when i want to show or hide one of them

7190532
hide	show
simply wrapping the source list boxes in divs will let you show and hide that div and all the controls within it including the autocomplete combobox

7190590
put	get
you need to put the clear both on the wrapper instead - but first make sure you get rid of the duplicate ids

7190705
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly fine in google-chrome safari firefox and ie

7190727
hide	show
an even simpler idea is to put the progress bar inside some container say a linear layout and show hide the container

7190731
onfocus	onblur
like onblur there is also an onfocus event

7190768
width	margin
the first-child column has 10 pixels or whatever the margin size is greater content area width than it s siblings

7190772
boost	eigen
disclaimer i do not know anything about the speed of eigen or boost multi_array which is probably what this question is really aiming at

7190799
width	height
lets say i have a main page which has a link that opens a modal div which has position fixed and some width height

7190816
width	height
when you apply a zoom-in or zoom-out change this variable accordingly and change the size of each element on your page both width and height for elements displayed as block and font size

7190833
google-chrome	safari
there is the zoom css3 property which does exactly this the latest webkit browsers google-chrome safari support it

7190840
folder	directory
i d like to be able to list files from a distant directory on the network with rails for instance listing every pictures in a folder to move them and do some processing on them

7190846
getter	setter
i can use property and synthesize in objective-c so i do not have to write getter and setter methods

7190852
hid	keyboard
i don t fully understand hid usage pages so i didn t know whether or not to use generic desktop page 0x01 with the keyboard usage id 06 or the keyboard keypad page 0x07 with usage ids for the individual keys

7190863
sorting	filtering
local sorting and paging works fine but filtering does not

7190880
int	double
this is because the uniqueifier which helps sql server identify a row when there is no true key is only 4 bytes which means it can t exceed the capacity of an int it does use both positive and negative unlike identity unless configure it as such which is why you get double

7190883
equals	gethashcode
i have overridden the gethashcode and equals even put return true in the equals method

7190922
apache	nginx
my understanding is that the app role should refer to the application server thin mongrel whatever and the web role should refer to the frontend server nginx apache so i m rather confused by the choice of running all tasks on all roles even though capistrano separates them by default

7190944
getter	setter
in ruby you ve got the arr_accessible method who create for you getter and setter

7190944
getter	setter
in objective-c property creates directly getter and setter in your .m file

7190948
onkeyup	onkeydown
in my activity i have an onkeyup and onkeydown event handlers which are called for normal characters and even for some unicode characters like cedilla ã

i m retrieving an ip address as an unsigned long integer via json

7190964
hide	show
then do your show hide

7191069
getter	setter
use a getter setter pair

7191069
getter	setter
the make getter setter pair is ok but it doesn t have the check for removing the listener off the old instance and adding the new onw

7191091
implements	extends
public class viewidentification extends activity implements onfocuschangelistener

7191100
min	max
we get min and max limits

7191137

it has options for public protected private etc.

7191200
filtering	grouping
if you want add further filtering then use having after grouping by

7191220
profiling	debugging
if yes then try using debugging provisioning profiling

7191224
allocator	stl
create your own stl allocator and track the size of the memory requests placed to it then jsut add the size of the container itself

7191226
google-chrome	firefox
in ie 7 google-chrome firefox etc

7191303
junit	mockito
junit combined with some mocking framework like mockito should get you a fair bit on your way

7191306
getter	setter
synthesized properties should provide setter and getter but that method would look like - void setmoney int money and - int money

7191307
submit	submission
you have to active ajax only when you submit the form and prevent the default browser form submission

7191327
oncreate	ondestroy	oncreate	onstart	onresume	onpause	onstart	ondestroy
so ideally you should run your code after calling the super in oncreate onstart onrestart and onresume and before in onpause onstop and ondestroy

7191371
firefox	safari
this vertical center alignment is working fine in firefox safari and ie8 but is not properly working in ie7

7191431
hide	show
the search bar automatically hide the cancel button when inappropriate but i m using the view controller in a modal state - so i would like to always show the cancel button and use it to pop the modal view controller when the search is cancelled

7191483
actionscript	mxml
for example if i am in java perspective and open a mxml or actionscript file then i want the perspective to change automatically to the flashbuilder perspective

7191490
filtering	grouping
to reverse the sense of the query that is to determine which entries are the member of a grouping use the ismemberof or memberof with an assertion in the filtering used in the search request

7191513
folder	directory
but when i perform deploy to my tomcat built-in web server 6.0.32 suddently in the build directory build web web-inf classes the deleted folder appears ok with no-content again

7191529
hide	show
depending on your layout you could try placing the second image under via z-index the first then show the second even though it will be covered still at this time then hide the first which will then reveal the second that was underneath

7191542
onresume	onpause
an activity is visible to the user in onresume and not visible whenever onpause is called

7191542
onresume	onpause
set the boolean to true in onresume and false in onpause

7191546
min	max
we need the max_password_length constant because we can t simply use either the max or the min of the two input lengths as that would also leak timing information

7191600
hash	md5
if you need a hash lookup table you won t need cryptographic-level hash functions like sha-1 md5 or sha-256 since you ll make a modulo according to the hash lookup table size and those functions are much slower than the following one

7191606
inherited	subclassing
you can try setting paddingbottom to see if the label will inherited that but you might have better luck creating your own subclassing of label and using it as the textfieldclass

7191625
hide	show
currently the span are not hidden and therefore do not toggle between hide and show as they should

7191657
implements	extends
public class orderlist extends arraylist implements parcelable

7191663
folder	directory

2 see friend you have declared variable n as an unsigned chars but you have used x which is for unsigned hexadecimal int

7195108
integer	unsigned
so at the time of printing the value of n is promoted or technically you can say typecasted as an unsigned hexadecimal integer

7195108
int	chars
in a 32-bit compiler it will be represented in memory as 0000 0001 as chars is provided 1 byte of memory.but afterwards when you typecast it as a unsigned hexadecimal int the interpertation in a 32-bit compiler is 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 well if you declare int n 1 or you declare unsigned int n 1 or you declare int n 0x1

melt	reshape
i tried melt in the reshape package but that results in a data.frame where strings are treated as factors so i d have to do something like

7196523
many-to-many	one-to-many
this makes little sense in my case as each element of c is either linked from a or xor b but not both at the same time both relationships are one-to-many not many-to-many

7196534
opendj	openam
openam is embedding opends as its configuration datastore and can leverage opends or forgerock led opendj the continued open source ldap directory project derived from opends as the user data store

7196997
free	malloc
one very common cause of memory corruption is deallocating memory with the wrong routine especially on windows it s something of a tradition to redefine malloc and free on unix so unix systems often go out of their way to make sure it s possible to do that

7197003

ie8 is also broken when the parent element is position relative and when the children are either absolute or relative

7197097
viewdidload	viewwillappear
same for anything you create in viewdidload or viewwillappear or elsewhere such as data models if you can recreate it easily later when the view loads again or when the object is needed then it should be released in viewdidload to reduce memory usage

udp	tcp
each client has a remoting object on which it makes its synchronous calls via tcp and udp handles the asynchronous stuff so the client remains stateless

7197892
width	height
if you also want the width and height to be correct you will need to find an opencv pixel type that is the same number of bytes

7197894
children	parent
the parent process then uses waitpid to wait for all of the children to finish

7197898
magento	oscommerce	magento	bigcommerce

7198079
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested in recent versions of google-chrome safari firefox

7198103
google-chrome	firefox
i ve found that unless you want the css re-ordering or the multi-line which isn t yet implemented in firefox and google-chrome what you think you want to use display box and box-flex for you really want to use display table and display table-cell

7198103
google-chrome	firefox
but back to your actual question i found firefox and google-chrome display identically if you set a width in pixels but not if you set a width as a percentage

7198106
lxml	beautifulsoup
i use similar tricks in some production code where simple checks like if somevalue in htmlpage are much faster and more understandable than invoking beautifulsoup lxml or other ml libraries

7198123
width	height
the parent div would be of width height 200 or if you want to get fancy you could simply have the height width be 100 and use some fancy math in js to dynamically size the divs as the port moves

multiplying	add
then to generate the sequence you multiplying the last two numbers with a and b and add to get the next

7198171
cos	sin
also if sin and cos work in radians rather than degrees you want instead of 360

7198179

7198343
button	checkbox
two radio button two checkbox on different pages

7198348
maven	m2e
the m2e developers appear to believe that any resources will affect a maven build even in the case where meta-inf services is a functional part albeit a resource

7198348
m2e	pom.xml
if you want to hack around it you can apparently encode a special m2e profile into your pom.xml files to make the m2e incremental build filter and copy resources sonatype m2e wiki

7198359
rss	feed
my app is a basic rss reader which displays the items in the table view and i want to use the uitabbar to select from 2 or 3 different rss feed refreshing the existing table view in the process not switching to a different table view

7198482
ssl	https
i need to have certain urls actions in my app where i receive credit card information be ssl https

7198483

7198493
pop-up	dialog
i also tried to load it directly using the install new software ui and that failed added a directory where the toy plugin is and the response is a dialog box pop-up no software site found at dir_name

7198493
pop-up	dialog
at the same time in the name list area box behind the pop-up it says could not find file dir_name the directory is valid and the jar file is there - the other attempts are to load the jar file directly selecting archive instead of local in the add repository dialog - that too fails first the jar name is mangled somewhat to jar file dir_name toy_name.jar

7198543
post	put	post	get	put	get
from the perspective of a restful application like rails there are four relevant request types get post put and delete

7198543
post	put
new gives you a form to post create a new object and edit gives you a form to put update and existing one

7198543
post	get
the important basic thing to understand is that links by default are get requests and forms by default are post requests

7198543
post	get
where i wrote get in the examples above you can use any of the four verbs -- get is normally what you do if you want to show a page and post is normally what i d use if you re submitting a form

7198577
post	put
what i would recommend is to put the code that uses result_url inside a continuation call back and call it after you know that the last post request has completed

7198592
nsmenu	nsstatusitem
i used nsmenu and nsstatusitem to display custom menu on status bar for a long time in this way

7198743
folder	directory
in my project there was a folder called .settings inside the actual project directory tree having files named org.eclipse.jdt.core etc

7198824
width	height
i will need to request the exact height needed based on how much width the component will receive during layout

7198824
width	height
for example if the component will receive enough width to contain all the text on one line then it will only request one line worth of height

7198824
width	height
but if it will only receive enough width to have the text fit on three lines then it will request a height which will allow for three lines of text

7198824
width	height
then once it s received the amount of width it is allowed to request the amount of height to fit the text on multiple lines if necessary

7198824
awt	swing
edit to clarify i d gladly use a jtextarea but the pbp doesn t have any swing and limited awt components

maven	m2e
previously with the m2e and subclipse plugins i was able to check out as a maven project - but this no longer seems possible

7204336
put	get
if you then put your backing bean in the view scope the ajax requests originating from the model input field will get the same instance and you have direct access to the manufacturer field that you previously remembered

7204434
folder	directory
once i do the project on the already existing main.cpp i save it as a main.hpp i even tried main.h in the project folder tricycle which by the way has the directory on my desktop i did not change anything as to where it goes to reach the source code

7204438
free	malloc
the subsequent fopen will malloc a buffer the same size as before and it just happened to return the same memory the previous free released

i m using node.js and express

7204520
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
everything works ok in firefox google-chrome opera but not in internet explorer ie9

if you have the choice prefer lossless formats bmp gif png

7204567

chrome allowed to resize text area by drugging that on the bottom right corner but some times this movement may break design of the page so i am wondering how to restrict the max and min width for that action of how to disable that function at all with thml javascript css on the page

7204585
maven	m2e
while we re at it if you plan to use maven together with eclipse do not use maven-eclipse-plugin but rather the m2e m2e eclipse plugin

7204656
min	max
to restrict size max min -width and height should do the trick

7204697
int	chars
you could just remove all the non digit chars parse to int and then sort

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works well in firefox but does not work in google-chrome or safari

post	get
with my website i m not looking to post information to the admin s fan page but rather just get the id of the page they want to use with my site

7204846
daemons	systemd
other ways to solve the problem would be conventional batch processing offloading the heavy lifting to a multi-process multi-threaded daemons via a network call or asynchronous messaging systemd or even a single threaded job processor using a message queue

7204857
width	height
that will handle the layout within another container that takes care of the 80 width easy enough and 80 height a bit more complicated

7204860
mp4	h.264
if it isn t it s safe to assume that it s a mp4 f4v both of which are different suffixes for the same type of mpeg-4 h.264 file and that you should be able to play it on your iphone

7204865
getter	setter
for example you will need to pay attention to the visibility of the startc flag or write a public getter and setter for it so b and c both have access

7204922
google-chrome	firefox	hide	show
if u dont have to use the plugin and hide divs or wathever element after five seconds of inactivity and show it once its active again i came up with a script like so tested in google-chrome firefox explorer

but from time to time i see those strange width height

7204976
interbase	firebird
my connection string as stated is driver firebird interbase r driver

7204998

if you have better networking people than server people or find ssl daunting have the network people establish a secure tunnel forming a vpn between your sites instead and make service b unavailable from the raw internet besides the tunnel

7205025
jboss	glassfish
in terms of deploying a java web app on the internet what is the difference between sites that offer app server hosting such as tomcat jboss and glassfish and sites that offer platform as a service such as google app engine heroku and amazon ec2

7205154
colt	jscience
since i have to move from python to java for a project i was looking for any equivalent in well known math libraries colt jscience apache commons math

7205175
integer	unsigned
the easiest way to do this is probably to convert the time to a unix timestamp unsigned integer representing the number of seconds which have elapsed since january 1st 1970

7205227
ssl	https
one of the benefits of ssl the s in https is established tools for key management you won t have to re-invent the wheel

7205256

the above color code inserted in after width 600 height 400 colors in every other line like it should

7205308

running python over ssh and trying the same code is successful ie i get a list of post objects

7205344
keydown	keyup
this example creates a textbox and whenever you press a key two messageboxes one for the keydown one for the keyup pop up

7205348
submit	submission
because you re submission the form directly using js you re not clicking on a submit button so none are been submitted

7205357
int	chars
i care a great deal about using the right formats for the right content so i wonder if chars gives any performance improvements over int

7205359
portrait	landscape
thanks both answers are correct and work if i am using different image name for portrait and landscape

7205370
textview	imageview
i am trying to animate a textview sliding down from behind an imageview

7205370
textview	imageview
i am using a relativelayout instead of a linearlayout to get the description textview to appear behind the imageview z-index-wise

7205391
int	chars
the only benefit i can see of using int over chars in this case is slight performance

7205456
comparator	icomparer	iequalitycomparer	iequatable	icomparer	iequalitycomparer	icomparer	iequatable
so i ve made sure to implement comparator iequatable iequalitycomparer and icomparer and sorting works fine

7205530
ienumerable	ilist
c# offers you ienumerable and ilist interfaces and all the stuff that derives from them so no need to stick with old fashioned arrays

7205565
folder	dir	folder	directory
inside your plugin dir look for the org.cfeclipse.cfml directory it probably has a timestamp after the name which depends on your version but there should be only one and inside that there is a dictionary folder containing a bunch of xml files

7205624
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
runtimeexception indicate broken contract like nullpointerexception and should never be thrown if code has no errors

7205630
min	max
the error can be gotten around if you don t care about which row the subquery returns - simply return min terms_id or max terms_id or whatever to only bring back 1 row

7205638
portrait	landscape
it looks great in portrait orientation but there is a ton of white space on the right when it is turned into landscape mode on the iphone

7205711
pop-up	dialog
i have created 2 pop-up dialog box when you click on a link

7205716
textview	imageview
i have a xml component composed by an imageview and a textview

7205725
unsigned	short
this is because when the option is set to no wchar_t becomes a typedef for unsigned short which means you can no longer overload on it

7205725
unsigned	short
as a result the expression invoked the for unsigned short rather than the one for wchar_t which doesn t give the correct result

7205730
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the site works perfectly in google-chrome and safari and only teething problems in firefox

7205747
post	get
yes you can just switch from get to post and it just works

7205747
post	get
get is more appropriate than post for queries because of its safe semantics

7205750
profiler	perf
the stdlib profiler uses feature of ruby that incur a tremendous perf hit set_trace_func among others

7205781
opera	google-chrome

opera	google-chrome
google-chrome has it fixed since version 12 opera still looks awful

7205831
disk	ram
when the operation completes windows might be notified that it needs to pull previously swapped memory from disk and shove it back into ram causing a delay

7205858
firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox and ie as well but not safari

7205885
int	chars
now for the real problem it looks like you have already defined truck to be a string further up in your code so when you try to read write to it as if it were an associative array you are really read writing the first chars in that originally defined string the string key your are using is converted to an int

7205909
junit	easymock
unit testing with junit and easymock

7205909
mockito	jmockit	powermockito	jmockit
you could also check out other mocking frameworks such as mockito powermockito and jmockit

7205922
int	chars
if you re worried about performance a chars 4 takes up as much space and or so one would think disk i o bandwidth and processing time as an int which also takes 4 bytes to store

7205947
sorting	grouping
ordinary key index is key for speeding your searching by this column sorting grouping and joining with other table by this key

7205972
width	height
also to ensure that your layout will not break if the images do not load you could give the a tag the normal height and width of its image

7205988
postgresql	mysql
so a key in a relational database such as mysql postgresql oracle etc is a data constraint on a column or set of columns

7205998
dataoutputstream	bufferedoutputstream
i tried various kinds of outputstreams bufferedoutputstream dataoutputstream pipedoutputstream servletoutputstream

7205999

7206059
postgresql	mysql
oracle mysql postgresql sqlite

7206066
post	get
what can i do to get this dropdown to post back on change

7206101
width	height
by that i mean entering new height width value and get new coordinates not using transforms

7206151
pull	push
for the sake of simplicity and interoperating with subversion it is recommended that all git svn users clone fetch and dcommit directly from the svn server and avoid all git clone pull merge push operations between git repositories and branches

7206166
maya	blender
is it possible to use a software like cinema 4d maya blender to animate in real time single character

7206166
maya	blender
we are considering maya cinema 4d blender or zbrush poser 3dmax however last three does not have scripting language as far as i know

7206198
post	get
however in the database only 234 post get inserted and i suspect it is mysql not being able to insert certain post but i have no idea why

7206199
hide	show
show and hide divs at a specific time interval using jquery

7206200
getter	setter
note getter setter are supported in some js environments which would allow you to map to card.set pip .

7206227
width	height
lastly change you layout height and width attributes to

7206262
width	height
so you can check width and height with the old ones

7206285
firefox	safari
works as expected on safari firefox mac firefox win

7206286
short	base
in short only the base version file is stored statically all the other versions are dynamically generated with base file and necessary change sets

7206356
google-chrome	firefox
i have found that firefox and google-chrome will execute the fb.logout call quickly enough for this to work properly but that ie and mobile browsers because of network speed in addition to differences in the javascript engine will not complete the call successfully before the browser loads whatever page you re redirecting to

7206356
google-chrome	firefox
i was originally putting fb.logout directly in the onclick event of an anchor link and while that worked in firefox and google-chrome it did not work in ie or in my android browser

7206419
min	max
i just want to get a list of the first and last days basically and max and min day date for each year-month combination

7206429
sql-insert	sql-delete	sql-insert	sql-update	sql-delete	sql-update
you can use loader sql-insert sql-delete sql-update elements to configure store procs for entities and lazy load collections although it means quite a lot of keystrokes

7206455
folder	directory
i have wcf service that twice a minute check programdata myapp folder and send all xml-files from this directory to sharepoint site

7206511
google-chrome	firefox
i was originally putting fb.logout directly in the onclick event of an anchor link and while that worked in firefox and google-chrome it did not work in ie or in my android browser

7206511
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome will execute the fb.logout call quickly enough for this to work properly but that ie and mobile browsers because of network speed in addition to differences in the javascript engine will not complete the call successfully before the browser loads whatever page you re redirecting to

7206513
post	get
i tested it and binding works in both get and post scenarios

7206528
width	margin
the reason this fails is that the column mixin not only sets the width of the element but also floats it left and applies a right margin unless it s the last column which has no margin

7206528
width	margin
so you can use span here to simply set the width without getting the float and margin that column would add

7206528
width	margin
if you just apply the margin yourself you don t need to override the grid width that container sets

7206596
savefiledialog	folderbrowserdialog
well if all you need is for them to pick a directory then you don t need the savefiledialog and can instead use the folderbrowserdialog to at least let them choose where it goes

7206601
width	height
use max-width in your css to fix a maximum image width and don t specify your image height

7206616
postgresql	mysql
inspectdb works with postgresql mysql and sqlite

7206616
postgresql	mysql
foreign-key detection only works in postgresql and with certain types of mysql tables

7206619
treelist	grid
i would like to fill the grid with data after selecting some nodes on treelist

7206619
treelist	grid
the treelist nodes are filtering the grid data

7206620
post	get
you can create two copies of the controller method one for http get and one for http post

7206640
width	height
height and width are dynamic

7206661
savefiledialog	folderbrowserdialog
as adam said above you could just use a folderbrowserdialog instead of a savefiledialog

7206685
for-loop	loops
now is it better to use the native js for-loop and use return or is it better to use the jquery.each and use return false to break out of loops

7206807
gtk	pygobject	pygtk	pygobject
i m currently foolish enough to try to maintaintain two parallel code bases for a python desktop application one using pygobject introspection for gtk 3 and one using pygtk for gtk 2

7206807
pygtk	pygobject
i work mainly on the pygobject branch and then i port changes over to the pygtk branch

7206807
pygtk	pygobject
i ve seen that there are some libraries for this but the main ones for pygtk haven t been updated in years and so they will almost certainly fail with pygobject introspection

7206877
inherited	properties
im trying to create a domain class constructor that inherited another class properties dynamically

7206945
width	height
from there you will need to iterate x y over width height and suppress non-maximum edges

7206965
post	get
if someone ends their session on facebook.com their session on your website is still present - though if you tried to get or post data to facebook using that session it would probably fail

7206974
coldfusion	railo
due to a bug in adobe coldfusion that doesn t work like that though it does in other cfml engines like railo and you have to split it into two lines like this

7206991
textinput	textfield
then simply style the textinput to make it look like there s only one textfield

7206994
hide	show
i have treeview in windowsform application when searching for node is performed i need to hide all the remaining node and i need to show only the searched node and its parent .like

7207003
mouse	keyboard
you should be more worried about the slow response times from the keyboard and mouse

7207004
facebook	fbconnect
i am a facebook developer have a site which registers using fbconnect register feature button

7207012
vsto	add-in
i have a vsto add-in which allows users to drag n drop emails to an item in a listbox and save it

7207036
queue	fifo
you can create your own serial queue that will execute in fifo order with dispatch_queue_create

7207061
jobs	cron
php running scheduled jobs cron jobs

7207061
subtract	add
add 50 to x column subtract 20 form y column preform an equation based on time on z column etc. i have the necessary update in a update.php page but how would i go about calling that page every 20 minutes short of scheduling a task on a computer

7207075
firefox	safari
this worked fine in safari but not with firefox

7207089
put	get
you might get better help if you put your query on where the readers deal with this kind of data all the time

7207094
listview	gridview
implement a scrollable listview for most sizes a paged gridview for a very large list or a single textbox if your list is very small

7207120
windows	wow64
the other direction is possible through an emulator on windows it is called wow64

7207150
button	checkbox
problems no support for checkbox or radio button

7207153
ssl	https
if the asset you need is available on ssl then always use the https asset

7207166
profiling	debugging
another thing to try is the excellent entity framework profiling - has saved us many headaches in debugging performance issues like these - gives you a lot more than sql profiling and you can see what queries objects are created per objectcontext and method source line etc -

7207178
jar	war
the created artifact jar is not supposed to have any persistence.xml because it is already contained in a war file which includes several modules

7207183
hide	show
it looks like you re trying to flip between two different images not just show hide a single image like the other answers show i m basing that on the fact that in your examples you reference two different images. if i ve understood that correctly then you can do the following

7207197
opera	firefox
be aware some browsers like firefox or opera might be masquerading as ie

7207223
getter	setter
use property declarations to synthesize your getter and setter

7207270
put	get
you can read file system using file api then get resulting data to javascript array string and then put this content to a websocket message

7207273
min	max
now extract the min and max for each month

7207293
openssl	gnutls
edit 2 it appears that the difference between command-line and library use is that the command-line version is linked to openssl and the library is linked to gnutls

7207304
realloc	malloc
you could also create it on the heap with malloc and friends but again you d need to make it large enough at the outset to hold your extra values or else grow the array as necessary with realloc before adding your new values

7207387
disk	ram
today most of the functionality is written in c or perhaps c++ but one still needs to go to assembler for the very earliest stages that take over from the bios loads more code from disk than the single sector bios gives you and puts the processor into protected mode so it can access more than 1 mb of ram

7207387
free	malloc
no malloc free new delete unless you implement them yourself for example

7207415
client-side	server-side
the demo link that you sent along does show the server-side automatic crud operations with inline editing not client-side

7207451
int	chars
the tilde chars is used as an operator to invert all bits of an int bitwise not

7207454
packets	multicast
failing that try running tcpdump and see if there s a device that s spewing out multicast packets on the network

7207476
google-chrome	firefox
in ie 7 ie 8 ie9 google-chrome and firefox it is looking the same

7207491
width	height
the sub-view the one contained in the white section is 75 width x 160 height

7207506
short	base
in short a base class pointer may point to a derived class object even if derivation is protected or private

7207513
int	double
three of the four columns are int or double so i could add an if statment to convert searchstring to a number if needed

7207517
client-side	server-side
this way you don t have to perform a bunch of style changes in server-side or client-side code after the page has loaded or mix your user preference code in with your html or change much about the base pages if you want to change the way the stylesheet works

7207584
draggable	droppable
the droppable method then provides an event called over which will execute a function whenever a valid draggable object is hovered over it

7207587
unix	bsd
exception when running on certain bsd s or other unix s or managed hosts you don t control

7207589
button	checkbox
from their inbox my users can select multiple checkbox click the delete button and selected messages are removed

7207593
int	double
for searching a column with int using double equals should work fine too

7207598
post	get
i realise that similar questions may have been asked here before but as i am a complete novice the post that are saw here did not contain enough information for me and i require as much help as i can get - almost a step by step guide

7207661
put	get
unfortunately the xslt has been mangled a bit by the blog engine and i haven t put in the effort to get it working yet

7207665
rss	feed
i have an rss feed that pulls in three weather images sky temp and wind

7207665
rss	feed
the wind images are titled as follows windn.gif windne.gif respectively for all directions.the rss feed sends the wind image title in the exact same format

7207665
rss	feed
i also cannot get the rss feed changed to have no caps in its title format

7207673
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
try mouseenter and mouseleave instead of mouseover and mouseout

7207681
put	get
its broke if you put a filter in you get the erroneous error message and no data in your chart

7207730
move	drag
i am trying to create a mechanism to allow the user to right click and drag on a toolbar in order to move a window.

7207740
updatepanel	scriptmanager
since you re using a scriptmanager and updatepanel use the asp.net ajax pageload function

7207770
jquery	simplemodal
i ve noticed that many plugins such as simplemodal that work fine in a desktop browser do not work fine on the ipad with jquery mobile

7207770
jquery	simplemodal
simplemodal has a close button that fails to work and i believe it s because the event listener needs to be for tap. is there some easy way i can tell all my jquery plugins to respond to tap instead of click

7207778
for-loop	arrays
this works because the way the for-loop is written it s going to return the first one that it finds that has the most duplicates so if the arrays is sorted the smallest number will come first so it ll be the one that the for-loop finds

7207783
xslt	xquery
you either have to live with it assembling the text yourself at application level or use a higher-level interface for xml processing such as xslt or xquery

7207847
move	drag
for a business reason i need to move the canvas also if i hold and drag the canvas

7207867
put	get
what order by clause should i put to get the following result

7207885
gridview	detailsview
do you mean it doesn t work with a gridview but does work with a detailsview

7207889
width	height
if you simply leave out the page height and width properties as follows it will work fine

7207891
box-sizing	border-box
there is a css3 box-sizing border-box style that will let you do what you want

7207903
contentplaceholder	loginview
i would place a contentplaceholder in the master page that contains a loginview control

7207903
contentplaceholder	loginview
the reason for putting the loginview control in a contentplaceholder is so that your pages that use the master can easily replace or remove the menu if needed

7207914
int	chars
in your case using chars and int there are no differences

7207915
int	chars
have a table with file ownerid int ownertype chars 1

7207926
int	chars
in the case of a chars and an int which are both primitive types initialization actually means no initialization here

7207934
int	chars
for small types like int or chars this isn t a big deal but when those member variables are large types that would take lots of cycles to construct you definitely want to use the initializer list

7207934
int	chars
1 for built in types like int and chars they are actually not constructed at all

7207952
post	get
but to get the information it has to redirect out to the login site which sits on a different server and the login site then post back the login information to the php page and the php page turns the raw data into something the first page can understand

7207977
google-chrome	firefox
i am defining this function in javascript and i am getting an error like myobj is undefined in firefox and google-chrome

7207994
getter	setter
it is always recommended to use getter setter for accessing private variables

7207994
getter	setter
anyway we are accessing it using getter and setter

7207996
hindi	tamil
however cp1252 doesn t support tamil and hindi characters or â º

7208013
post	put
usually i would just put all objects from these three arrays into one array and compare them using the same variable which they all contain but in this case post has the variable dateofupload and like and comment have the same variable date

7208033
getter	setter
and that would save you from having to make massive amounts of changes to where you accessed the public property instead of using the getter setter

7208038
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	idictionary	idictionary	icollection
if i implement idictionary it seems that it is a bit of an over kill to implement all the idictionary icollection ienumerable and ienumerable

7208042
hide	show
if you want to hide and show the div with id addchild while clicking the button with id addbutton

7208076
width	height
we re building out the page as a grid and setting the transposed height width from the printdocument s printablearea

width	height
this gets the content to be rotated correctly and everything appears to be stretched the width well height in this case of the page but the bottom section is being cut off

7208076
width	height
it s almost like the content displayed to the normal width of the page typically the 8.5 width although it was rendered to the height of the page the 11 height

7208082
webclient	webrequest
webclient doesn t allow you access to the webrequest object used so you ll need to drop to using webrequest webresponse directly

7208086
implements	extends
it will produce a family of concrete products that extends or implements the abstract products

7208090
accessor	ivar
if the imagearray is an ivar for an object perhaps not a safe assumption you should use an accessor to set the array to nil

7208113
couchbase	couchdb
normally nosql database work handy when you know which object you have to retrieve from the database if you need to have some query on your data think about couchdb or couchbase or mongodb which use json like document to save data and gives you querying ability with different pros and cons

7208122
clang	llvm
at the moment i think that your best bet is clang you can try some simple code on the try out llvm page

7208122
clang	llvm
when compiling c c++ or obj-c with clang llvm you may ask the compiler to emit the intermediate representation llvm ir instead of going the full way to assembly binary form

7208122
clang	llvm
clang lowers the c++ code to llvm ir

7208134
post	get
the model binder could do you a bad joke d if for example you have a class account with a property isadmin and you expose this entity in a registration form the user could try to pass an arbitrary isadmin true parameter in the get string or in the post payload and the mvc model binder will set that property in your model.

7208150
width	margin
if it s at the end for instance you can then give the placeholder a negative top margin that s the same width as your border thickness - so basically you re drawing a rectangle of the background color on top of the bottom border of the last item in your list

7208162
pull	push
later when the next user tries to push the changes git will give error that the global repo has been changed and you must pull the changes first

7208169
getter	setter
so this is twice times slower than using a getter or setter and 3 or 4 times slower than accessing the property directly

7208174
terminate	timeout
the session key is discarded when the ssl session either timeout or is terminate

7208190
min	max
still need to set the x axis max min values as well though

7208213
hide	show
clickable so clicking on the show content will not hide the content

7208215
inject	interceptor
if you need to inject something beyond that you can also use an interceptor

7208223
firefox	safari
this code works fine in firefox and ie but when i access this cookie s data in safari - an empty string is returned

7208242
hash	md5
uuid3 generates a uuid by taking an md5 hash of an arbitrary name that you choose within some namespace url domain name etc

7208242
hash	md5
uuid5 is the same as uuid3 except using a sha-1 hash instead of md5

7208243
put	get
to correct this you need to put your code within the sandbox that created the widgets or get a pointer to that sandbox for your use function call

7208288
width	margin
p s total width of divs with margin is 1345 1400

7208331
g++	gcc
note that i don t mind using g++ for the unit tests as long as i can use gcc for the project itself

7208403
gridview	repeater
you can set up a web service or controller that allows you to retrieve data by the page much like just calling a paging service using gridview or other repeater

7208420
hide	show
a better approach would be to have the img there all along and just show hide it when dragging

7208454
primes	modulus
if the only reasons that the things being compared wouldn t match would be random corruption of one of them then the use of a primes modulus for an adler-32 checksum is probably not particularly helpful

7208454
primes	modulus
it wouldn t be especially likely that they d occur an exact multiple of 257 bytes apart but it s a risk which can be avoided by using a primes modulus provided at least that the number of bytes in the file is smaller than the modulus

7208459
client-side	server-side
i need to know best practices for how the data-flow of an interactive web application can be best organized in terms of database server-side code and client-side code

7208459
client-side	server-side
i have been using jquery s ajax function to make calls from the client-side to the server-side to retrieve a json string and then parse it

7208474
inherited	subclassing
also important is that public non-static methods could be inherited and overriden by a subclassing so making them static could actually break the code in possibly unexpected ways

7208490
width	height
i would like an image to have proportional scaling to be as big as posible but no bigger than div either the image width should equal the div s width or the image height should equal the div s height but i dont exactly know which case

7208606
superclass	subclassing
my factory class has a collection of classes i don t want that dependency when i add a subclassing of superclass i need the factory file to stay unchanged

7208606
superclass	subclassing
my factory class has to return all superclass s subclassing instances but i can t have a collections of them or their names because that s means i will have to change the factory file whenever i add a new subclassing

7208609
hide	show
the current version of jqm uses and to show and hide the loading spinner respectively

7208614
getter	setter
you do not want all of your private variables to have public getter and setter

7208614
getter	setter
your getter and setter refer to externally visible state

7208614
getter	setter
some people automatically write setter and getter for them anyway but this is a bad idea because it exposes your implementation details

7208650
public	protected
i also tried to create the crossell block and making the protected method that wraps around getlastaddedproductid function public however that returns null just like it does when i try calling it on its own

7208701
packets	multicast
the listener will listen for both multicast and tcp and will note the difference in packets arrival times

7208719
width	height
here s a javascript method that computes the aspect ratio of image and container and sets the corresponding height or width value that will first hit the edge and the image then scales the other dimension proportionally

7208720
bellman-ford	dijkstra
finding the shortest path between two points in a graph is a classic algorithms question with many good answers dijkstra s algorithm bellman-ford etc. my question is whether there is an efficient algorithm that given a directed weighted graph a pair of nodes s and t and a value k finds the kth-shortest path between s and t

7208721
g++	gcc
you can run g++ or any gcc front-end with one or more of the -fdump-tree- flags complete list which will dump intermediate representations of the code from different compiler passes in an output format that looks similar to c

7208781
folder	dir
so my question is how can i get all path variables sources dir binaries dir drop folder dir build number and others from build definition template to my msbuild on the tfs server

7208828
wtl	atl
i ve only learned a little bit of atl in the last couple of days after realizing how much pain pure win32 is and also learned about wtl and mfc and from what i see there are quite a few different string classes available for me

7208828
wtl	atl
i have no idea whether i will stick with atl or whether i ll switch to wtl mfc or something else

7208891
stdout	stderr
then in the crontab put at the end of the command line so stderr and stdout are merged

7208923
post	get
when calling in the app or browser i get only one item in the feed - the most recent wall post

7208923
post	get
i think the more worrying thing is that i can t even get those post in the browser

7208938
folder	directory
and of course there s app directory in the root folder

7208947
wtl	atl
my preference would be to stick with cstring for atl mfc wtl

7208966
fast-forward	merge
i ve read about rebasing which is suppose to help making the next merge a fast-forward since you from what i understand inject the history in the middle altering your own history

7208966
pull	push
we push often to the central repository for backup and we usually just hg pull everything

7208975

i doubt you ll find much on this actually mainly cause lj2 is still in beta and thus most profiling are done naively as there are no debugging hooks for lj2 specific things like the trace recorder

7209213
int	double
you do have to be careful however because if the payload contains an int you can still read it as a double

7209239
filtering	grouping
the key is that i want to use this- user to automatically filtering the grouping query based on the owner_id in this- user

7209239

7209249
int	boolean
this worked for me i passed in a primitive int and expected a primitive boolean

7209251

only block level elements use width and height

7210667
hide	show
absolute simplest solution use css display none to hide the elements that you don t want to show

the best way to figure it out is to take a guess at how many bullets or whatnot you plan on having on screen at any given time multiplying by two for when you decide that your bullet hell shooter doesn t really work to well with only 50 bullets and then add a little buffer

7211623
textarea	textbox
i ve learned it s possible to trim a string from a textarea and put break tags after it so each sentence written at a new line in the textbox will also be written at a new line in the php file

7211689
hex	binary
the reason why hexadecimal base-16 notation is so convenient is because it is easier to convert between binary to hex than binary to hex

7211689
hex	binary
putting the two nibbles together you can see the relationship between hex and binary

7211689
hex	binary
because hex 12 is binary 0001 0010 which masks bit 4 and 1

the 354 and so forth are octal escapes not decimal so you cannot just write them as 354 to get the integer values of the bytes

7212035
width	height
also the image from the assets seems to be loading correctly as when i get the width and height property from the bitmap object these correspond with the dimensions of the file on disk

7212629
width	height
consequently i can t include the image width and height in the tags because i don t know what they are

7212629

in order to get around this at the client side i use cycle s onbefore to fire a script that dynamically looks at the image being processed and then sets the slideshow container to a width and height matching the photo s native width and height

7212631
folder	directory
i also tried to create a database folder in the src directory and then put the db file inside the folder src database database.db and access it using

7212634

7213015
inherited	properties
of course when you have unique per-item properties the unique values for each object then yes you can can performance issues i hesitate to use the term instance because it doesn t mean the same thing in prototypical inherited compared to class based inherited

7213015
children	parent
instead of looking at it as the child doing stuff look at it as the parent prototype tending to the set of functions that live on it like a central phone operator that everything routes through with children as thin clients

7213015
inherited	properties
the constructor properties inherited same as anything else but they re all named constructor so you only get the direct prototype s constructor for free

7213025

then you just checkout master and do a regular fast-forward merge of mybranch

7213165
getter	setter
i am still very confused about getter and setter methods

7213187
getter	setter
the point of getter and setter is that only they are meant to be used to access the private varialble which they are getting or setting

7213187
getter	setter
there is no requirement for getter and setter to start with get and set - they are just normal member functions

7213196
fast-forward	merge
note it will be no harm since it is only a fast-forward merge and would not clutter your history

7213217

7213263
int	boolean
boolean promptmenu int menu

7213302
getter	setter
other than that i see 3 reasons for having getter and setter

7213302
getter	setter
2. classes with getter and setter often follow the java beans design pattern

7213302
getter	setter
wrapping the date variable with getter and setter that operate only with the value not the reference would prevent this

7213335
getter	setter
getter and setter -- how properties are accessed -- still function like methods in this regard

7213335
getter	setter
the copy of the structure value is made when it is returned from the getter or passed to the setter

7213356

7213387
bufferedreader	bytearrayinputstream
copy all the data to bytearrayinputstream and use tostring on it or read text as text using bufferedreader

7213458
return-value-optimization	nrvo
see below the difference with the second case is that the compiler was smart enough to use the nrvo named return-value-optimization and elide the middle copy instead of creating a temporary copy on return from play the compiler used the actual b inside of the play function as the rvalue for t1 s copy constructor

7213503
width	height
the map div must have width and height declared otherwise it doesn t work

7213529

what are their min max values

7213611
int	chars
i am having to format the values appropriately so that string chars int decimal are inserted correctly

7213621
int	chars
they are assigned to int and chars variables at least that s my goal

7213645
width	height
also when you create new view then you have to set its layout parameters height width

7213648
width	height
you can look at the output html sample to get the code to generate width and height attributes instead

7213671
int	chars
in the first case you call two different versions of f one with int one with chars in the second case you use the same for both and the compiler inters it top-bottom left-right - remember

7213750
post	get
i found a post on a forum i will add the link if i can find it again that explains this issue and indicates that in order to get this type of xml jaxb needs to see a collection rather than a map

mapping static resources within rest says hey developer come get post put delete thoses static resources it s okay

7214106
post	put	post	get	put	get
if you can t get put post delete those resources then you shouldn t map them in rest

7214139
put	get
if the format for currdate is fixed i guess you will have to process your string and put a number of if and else to get the final result

7214154
inline	inlining
the advantage is that the compiler has access to the whole code and that means that it can take the best decisions as to whether it inline or not the code and might be able to optimize further in the case of inlining

7214181
pull	push
make something with your repository clone push pull and view the output

7214189
serializable	deserialization
the binary serializable standart one is usually cheap in terms of memory used on hard disk but not very scalable as one time you refactore your code you will face deserialization problem of previously saved binaries

7214190
width	height
also it enables you to see the real width height margins and paddings of a element

7214215

postgresql	mysql
but in mysql it is ok and in postgresql it is wrong and ask for the other fields besides site_id either in a group by clause or in a aggregation function i know that postgresql is stricter on sql than mysql so i must select the site_id in the query object of msg_published but in pure sqlalchemy i can do like this

7214445

when i am switching between first two activities the activity which is going to background passes the onpause state while the new one becomes active and onresume is called

7214528
multiplication	modulo
looking only at the units digit of an arbitrary product is equivalent to taking the remainder of the multiplication modulo 10 for example

7214530
multiplication	exponent
i m sure there s a proper mathematical way to solve this but i would suggest that since you only care about the last digit and since in theory every number multiplied by itself repeatedly should generate a repeating pattern eventually when looking only at the last digit you could simply perform the multiplication until you detect the first repetition and then map your exponent into the appropriate position in the pattern that you built

7214584
viewmodel	caliburn	viewmodel	caliburn.micro
according to structure viewmodel knows about abstract iview.if you worked with caliburn caliburn.micro mvvm frameworks you remember viewaware class and iviewaware which allows get view in viewmodel

7214586
switching	screens
unfortunately currently it is not possible to switching off the type verification using jsdt configuration screens in eclipse

7214587
dictionary	map
however it should be accompanied with a well-planned memory management strategy if you have a dictionary of tile locations that naively map to vectors of entities you re going to have a lot of memory being allocated and freed when entities move from one tile to another

7214612
exponent	modulo
after that just call it with modulo 10 for you desired base and exponent and there s your answer

mousemove	mouseleave	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mouseleave
if you definitely need to fire a mouseup when the mouseleave the panel you can check the mouse location in the mousemove event and call mouseup whenever it is outside the panel and the button is pressed

7218748
actualheight	actualwidth
the actualwidth and actualheight properties however do not return the correct value that is the difference between the points

7218748
actualheight	actualwidth
i need to use the actualwidth and actualheight properties since i am using an algorithm which uses those properties for other shapes

7218773
octal	binary
8 is not an octal digit no more than 2 is valid in binary or g is valid in hexadecimal

7218776
octal	decimal	octal	binary
octal numbers can only use digits 0-7 just like decimal can use 0-9 and binary can use 0-1

7218807
post	get
but when i post the form with html in the dynamic tab content i get the following error

7218860
width	height
if you want to avoid having the images cut off you need to explicitly set height and width on the div s.

7218860
width	height
with those numbers matching the height and width of the images

7218861
client-side	server-side
javascript is a client-side scripting language it can not store anything on your server as you will need a server-side scripting language

7218908
hide	show
now i want to dynamically show hide these buttons based on a boolean that is bound to my repeater

7218908
hide	show
so my question is how can i either dynamically show hide an html button inside an asp repeater based on a boolean value that is bound to the repeater

7218950
nsobject	nsuserdefaults
which indicate that nsuserdefaults inherits and extends nsobject

7219047
cpu	affinity
if you can do the latter then look in to cpu affinity under linux

7219058
range	min	range	max	min	max
inside the range min max inclusive

7219066
for-loop	loops
if you want to limit the scope of line variable to inside loops only then you can write a for-loop as

7219070
range	min	range	max	min	max
however i should point out that the range -3 -29 has its min and max reversed

7219075
min	max
has anyone mentioned that his min and max are reversed

7219104
width	height
lets say one div has width w1 and height h1

7219202
x86	64bit
i use a 64bit win7 but build the application in x86 mode

7219213
wtl	atl
it s easy to manually change the font of a single dialog item but how do i display a dialog box with the correct system font from lfmessagefont applied to all of its controls by default not manually when calling dialogbox or using atl wtl

7219242
minix	linux
i look at the definition of the file struct at mac os linux minix and k r c book they are all different

7219252
stdout	stderr
dumps the stderr and stdout streams

7219252
stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush	stderr	fflush
the problem especially when mixing stdout and stderr streams is that there is reliance on the streams being fflush by the program

7219252
stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush	stderr	fflush
if for example all the writes to stdout are not fflush but all the writes to stderr are fflush then they ll end up out of chronological order in the output file and on the screen

7219252
stdout	stderr
this will cause stdout and stderr to write to the screen and file immediately and keep them in sync when being combined and redirected to tee

7219256
toolchain	binutils
is use of toolchain like binutils is mandatory for cross compilation

7219274
git-rebase	undo
assuming you still have master checked out and haven t done any git-rebase since run git reset --hard orig_head to undo the git-rebase

7219274
fast-forward	merge
it will be a fast-forward merge since you just rebased

7219277
int	chars
after further testing it seems that a becomes an int rather than unsigned chars

7219293
ssl	https
using https http secured with ssl tls encrypts all traffic between the web site and the client which takes care of transport security for you

7219296
nsoperationqueue	nsblockoperation
i highly recommend checking out nsoperationqueue nsblockoperation and related techniques - they can remove a great deal of the pain

7219300
pull	push
i want to be able to push that green uiview up with my finger and pull it back down again

7219324
post	get
you were supposed to pass the result that you get after making a post request to the search.php file

7219342

jboss	glassfish
glassfish 3.1 for instance allows this using a jdbcrealm while jboss 6.0 supports this with a databaseserverloginmodule

7219588
put	get
if i put incorrect value for example password which is not meet asp.net membership settings criteria then i get server validation error saying that i need to fix

7219591
google-chrome	firefox
also note that the latest versions of firefox google-chrome doesn t support visited pseudoclass due to security issues

7219608
folder	directory
if i understand you correctly you re asking for a pointer on how to get the directory listing of a remote folder

7219629
post	get
this is because http provides no in-built method to list the files in a directory - it is not designed to be a direct alternative to ftp and has less commands only 8 request methods are defined by the rfc one of them very vaguely and only 2 of these are commonly used by browsers - get and post

7219636
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works correct in ie9 in native and even in the compatibility mode ie8 google-chrome 13 safari 5.1 opera 11.50 firefox 3.6.20 and nightly 9.0a1 next version of firefox

7219708
put	get
or better yet create an android project from scratch and put in the minimum code that will render a map and then test it on a phone to see if you get the same result

7219719
put	get
if i cannot get a match then i will put in something like true or false in the outputs

7219793
pop-up	dialog
i ve attempted to make some modifications to a userscript to enable it to work under chrome but when i drag it into chrome s window in order to install it a dialog pop-up and says invalid script header

7219812
rss	feed
if you are in luck it might provide an rss feed that you could use or it might be marked up with some of the new html5 tags like etc

7219827
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
qt s qgraphicsview has a habit of automatic transition sliding of the view in such a way that everything drawn on the attached qgraphicsscene is visible

7219830
post	get
edit by saying live i mean for example send post request through ajax and get information and similar

7219833
for-loop	loops
i would make loops be a for-loop using integers

7219833
int	double
so to convert the double into int for the purpose of the loop

7219863
put	get
is the only solution to put javascript into plugin main .php file and get the page variable from there feeding it to the script it should certainly work via hooks

7219868
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
at present opera version 10.5 onward safari version 5 onward and google-chrome version 5 onward all support the individual border- -radius properties and the border-radius shorthand property as natively defined in the current w3c specification although there are still outstanding bugs on issues such as border style transitions using percentages for lengths etc.

7219868
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome and other webkit based browsers have supported border-radius with the -webkit- prefix since version 3 no longer needed from version 5 onward although again with some discrepancies from the current specification see this article for further details of how older versions of webkit handle border-radius

7219872
google-chrome	safari
will only be recognized by webkit browsers google-chrome safari -moz- .

ssl	https
since the ssl channel is negotiated prior to the reception of the host header an https server can use at most one certificate per bound ip endpoint ip address and port

7219934
spaces	delimiter
if there may be at most on spaces delimiter use

7219989
ssl	https
i am trying to establish a connection with a php script of mine in java using the secure socket layer https but i have found out that to ensure maximum security validity i have to import the ssl certificate that my website uses into my application.

7220001
distance	polygons
on each side of the polygons in which 2 is true i need to check the maximum distance at right angles to the side of the layer between the side of the moving layer and the side of the layer that is near this is a negative value when the layers overlap

7220005
inherited	base-class
with the virtual inherited a d object has a single base-class a sub-object

7220005
inherited	base-class
in contrast without virtual inherited a d object has two distinct base-class a sub-objects each with its own implementation of the function which is ok until you try to call it on a d object at which point you need to indicate which one you want

7220022
macports	homebrew
most people i know use homebrew or macports i prefer macports because of its clean cut of what is a default mac os x environment and my development setup

7220090
accessor	properties
make them private and define public accessor or public properties for them

7220125
accessor	properties
one way to debug this without the nice shiny vs2010 fetures would be to make the access to the _sync only possible with a properties accessor

7220133
width	height
which code in html will allow me to use an image as a background image for a table but not so that it would be repeated several times vertically and horizontally in case the table is several times bigger than the image but in such way that the image height is stretched out to be equal to the height of the table and its width is stretched out to be equal to the width of the table

7220160
put	get
i tried to put a el expression in my javascript code but it won t get resolved

7220160

implements	extends
there are a lot of prebuild ones see know subclasses at the top of the class documentation but you may also implements your own by extends the inputfilter class

7220230
hide	show
hide show the page header footer

7220261
width	height
an idea that comes to mind is adding an image element to the page with a height and a width set to be 100 of its container and then positioning your table with a transparent background color over it

7220296
client-side	server-side
you cannot asynchronously send a value from php server-side to flash client-side

7220296
post	get
just use a regular urlloader to query the server for the preview url specifying the file id or similar as a get or post variable

7220306
hash	salt
store the final hash and the associated salt in your database for that user

7220306
hash	salt
next time the user logs on repeat the process using the same salt and compare the final hash

7220328

7220374
scrollable	panels
my web application i am creating features a lot of grids and one baffling requirement is that it needs to be able to show a gridview which sometimes has over 1000 rows all without paging and in within one scrollable panels

7220397
width	height
so we can at least simulate the full screen for those that not support it by using the width height or whatever you want to fix the player size and make use of the wmode property

7220405
comparator	comparable
and this comparator only works as the javadoc says if the elements of the collection implement the comparable interface

7220405
comparator	comparable
you should either make the song class implement the comparable interface look at its javadoc to know what this interface must do or you must use a specific comparator implementation

7220415
division	modulo
you can have the minutes with a division by 60 and the seconds with a modulo

7220452
post	get
can i replace get with post

7220472
inherited	properties
my first thought was to inherited my user class from membershipuser but then i lose the control over the properties

7220491
width	height
but it s recommended to use 0dp so view s do not do extra calculation of their height or width which is then ignored

7220516
postgresql	mysql
if you look at the generated sql in the sql_query setting of config development.sphinx.conf for source person_core_0 you ll see how municipalities.name is being concatenated together i d post an example but it depends on your database - mysql and postgresql handle this completely differently

7220535
post	get
the only difference of post and get is that post sends the data in the http-body and not in the url headers so both methods are not secure for transmitting login credentials

7220548
haskell	agda
i wonder if it is possible to create such a type constructor using a richer type system such as agda or haskell with various extensions

7220578
filtering	grouping
w3c s solution is that you should be filtering out rlo and other characters from the grouping known as â œ not suitable for use in markup â

the error only seems to surface when i define width or margin to the offending div

7220743
inherited	subclassing
if you don t specify any special mappings for the derived classes ef will assume tph table-per-hierarchy inherited which means that all subclassing together with the base class are stored in the same database table distinguished by a discriminator column

7220743
inherited	properties
if you have many derived classes with many properties each the better inherited strategy might be tpt table-per-type

7220777
google-chrome	firefox
if you use inspect element on the page it looks commented out in google-chrome or isn t even visible in firefox so you might have to view source

7220798

7220862
int	chars
if needle is not a string it is converted to an int and applied as the ordinal value of a chars

7220866

7220984
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
right now i add the cellvm s to a collection in the igrideditor s methods then when the containing viewmodel imports the instance sets the containing viewmodel s cellvm collection to the instances collection and the item control binds to that using caliburn.micro s conventions

7220984
caliburn.micro	mef
i m using caliburn.micro mef btw

7220990
rss	feed
include is a bad idea because the contents of are evaluated as php code which opens your site open to attacks if someone can inject php code in the response of that rss feed

7221000
rss	feed
however if i understand you right you could not just include the rss feed using the include construct anyway because it is not valid php code - include expects the path to be a valid php source code file

7221000
rss	feed
you need to connect to the rss feed using curl or fsockopen depending on the level of control you want over the request to the remote site and parse the feed data so you can output in a sensible format

7221237
children	parent
a good way to get around that is to have the children use weak references to point back to the parent

7221247
jlabel	jinternalframe
unless you have good reason to directly draw into the jinternalframe why not create a new jlabel new imageicon bufferedimage and just add it to the jinternalframe

to uplift this post beyond a debug my code for me answer there are two fundamental things you do wrong they are going to get you into a lot more trouble

7221409
integer	unsigned
i have come across code from someone who appears to believe there is a problem subtracting an unsigned integer from another integer of the same type when the result would be negative

7221409
integer	unsigned
result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer

7221424
strlen	memmove
memmove shouldn t use sizeof p which is always going to be fixed say 4 it should use strlen line - p + strlen p - line

7221430
hide	show
then you d attach a client-side event to your first dropdownlist to check for specific values and show hide controls accordingly

7221432
strlen	memmove
memmove p+ strlen deststr -strlen srcstr p sizeof p

7221432
strlen	memmove
if you want to move the remainder of the line to adjust for the changed length try this memmove p+strlen deststr p+strlen srcstr strlen p+strlen srcstr +1

7221435
post	get
when someone post a form on the page with for example swedish characters ã ã ã then i get questionmarks in my servlet code when i look at the posted string in a debugger or in the persisted string on the deployed server

7221449
integer	unsigned
because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is

7221449
integer	unsigned
note that although it does say a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow which might lead you to believe that it applies only for exceeding the upper limit this is presented as a motivation for the actual binding part of the sentence a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is

mp3	flv
your question is how to extract audio from mp4 flv files and save as mp3 file

7221556
mp3	flv
what i would suggest is to use your mp4 flv parser to extract audio track do transcoding if audio track is non-mp3 and save the transcoded if audio track extracted is mp3 then extracted data data

7221556

just to give one example some versions of webkit the renderer used by google-chrome and safari mis-report the margin-right property in some situations

7221691
getter	setter
since i am planning to add getter and setter for all of them i was wondering is there a shortcut in eclipse for automatically generating the getter and setter in a given class

7221702
getter	setter
select the variables you wish to create getter and setter for and click ok

7221707
getter	setter
use generate getter and setter from the source menu or the context menu on a selected field or type or a text selection in a type to open the dialog

7221707
getter	setter
the generate getter and setter dialog shows getter and setter for all fields of the selected type

7221720
getter	setter
there source generate getter and setter and next to it you can see the shortcut which is alt+shift+s and r on my system

7221738
tapestry	struts
this rule is a customized one probably written by the tech lead to prevent you from adding instances variables into singleton classes such as struts 1 actions ejb statless sessionbean and tapestry

7221740

you can use std stringstream as an in memory std ostream

7221747

7221767
post	get
until now i only use fixed fields so i always know in my php script how many post or get vars i will get

7221795
outputstream	inputstream
the server will then receive the message through its inputstream and can in return write to its outputstream again flushing when done

7221798
multiplying	add
as long as the weights add to 1.0 you can simply multiplying them by the texture values

7221828
getter	setter
if the property name is foo the getter is just named foo and the setter is named setfoo

7221840
actualheight	actualwidth
you can t override actualwidth and actualheight they are computed

7221846
implements	extends
in other words how could i go about having a concrete dao class extends the abstract class while also implements the interface

7221897
division	multiplication
assuming your system does multiplication with constant speed and no division at all caching or pre-calculating 1

7221897
multiplying	division
in reality multiplying larger numbers is more costly and you also could do division 90

7221902
getter	setter
since processing is opensource out of curiosity i tweaked the pshape class by adding setter for vertex positions and getter setter for the fill colour then recompiled the library core.jar

7221963
int	boolean
i always assumed that boolean were more efficient than int at storing an on off value - considering that s their reason for existence

7221963
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome it s significantly faster to do this using 1 0 but on firefox it s slightly faster to do this using bool

7221963
google-chrome	firefox	int	boolean
this appears to have significant advantage for int as opposed to boolean up to 70 faster to use 1 0 instead of boolean - on both firefox and google-chrome

7221963
int	boolean
why are int so much better at boolean s job

7221977
width	height
the grid needs to know things such as xmin xmax width height .

7221977
width	height
the scatter renderer also needs xmin xmax width height

7221977
width	height
looking at the schematic drawing how would you lay out the objects so that a new state new indicators year selection width height would easily propagate down through all the sub-objects

postgresql	mysql
i suggest you use innodb or if that s feasible switch to postgresql - not only does it provide foreign key constraints it also has full support for transactions unlike mysql which will silently commit a pending transaction whenever you do something that s not supported in a transaction with potentially devastating results

7222058
innodb	myisam
if you have to want to use mysql i suggest you use innodb for everything unless you know you need the extra performance you can get out of myisam and you can afford the caveats

7222058
innodb	myisam
also keep in mind that migrating large tables from myisam to innodb later in production can be painful or even outright impossible

7226056
width	text-align
text-align works for text but not other elements and auto margins only work if you know the width of the container so not a solution if you don t know the width in advance

7226062
for-loop	loops
because you re assigning event handlers inside the for-loop and because javascript does not have block scope this means that every handler you create in loops is referencing the same myclasssrc variable which will be set at whatever value it was after loops completed

7226113
qstyleditemdelegate	qitemdelegate
the easiest way to do that seems to be by subclassing qitemdelegate because the text is drawn by a separate virtual function drawdisplay with qstyleditemdelegate you would almost have to redraw the item from scratch and you would need an additional class deriving from qproxystyle

hide	show
what we want to happen is to hide the misaligned images meaning not centered on then run the function for centering on window.onload then show the images after that

7226214
google-chrome	firefox
the images hide immediately on firefox and google-chrome when the page is loaded

7226218
width	height
the getcomputestyle is not designed to retrieve the element s width or height

7226227
width	height
an ellipse an oblong circle has no such property- it has a width maybe and a height and possibly an x and y coordinates or a position property

7226227
width	height
for an ellipse you will probably need another method that adjusts shapes that have width height left and top properties

7226242
hide	show
you should hide the img first before it appended to dom waiting for the condition meets then show it

7226259
nexus	artifactory
nexus and artifactory and i am sure all other repositories do as well

7226310
width	height

7226558
post	get
also when a page is loaded on a tab a post request is sent to your server with a signed_request callback so your server or code may be expecting only a get request

7226568
vim	emacs
if this part is separated with an api through which it can be told things it needs to know where are the files of the project what are the include paths etc. then it can return the necessary information help for a symbol at the cursor possible completions etc. and any editor emacs vim etc. can use it

7226615
ada	pascal
but heck i like languages like pascal and ada which both go to great lengths to specify a formal interface separate and distinct from the implementation

7226623
int	chars
basically given an int i need to generate a string with the same length containing only the specified chars

7226626
put	get
if i simply put the task on the threadpool unity will eventually get to the point where another class that needs my product cache is executing its initialization code and it is then accessing datastructures that aren t fully initialized yet in this case it would result in a cache miss and a call to the db to fetch the particular product and there might be many such requests in 30 seconds

i tried implements it so that controller implements observer and the view extends observable

7226769
integer	unsigned
in practice the unsigned long long above equates to an unsigned 64bit integer on my targeted platforms above and g++ 4.4.1 on linux 2.6 a different type that amounted to the same thing would also be acceptable but i haven t found any.

7226777

google-chrome	firefox
note that google-chrome firefox and ie9 all provide developer tools just press f12 for ie9

7227027
google-chrome	firefox
i recommend using firebug in firefox or using the dev console in google-chrome anduse the console.log function to log things so that you don t have to alert them all the time

7227043
haskell	ocaml
all i can say is that fp languages like ocaml and haskell are exceptionally good at doing exactly this

7227050
nsurl	nsstring
i am changing the nsstring to nsurl and creating the uiimage

from the reference - the sum and avg aggregate-functions do not work with temporal values

7227078
google-chrome	firefox
well first off you re not listening for any errors that might be happening which might be the case and if you wanted to debug you should of used something like the developer panel in google-chrome or firebug in firefox to see the http request

7227303
client-side	server-side
it is a server-side issue the server -side application is not sending the expected http content-type header field value for the client-side script resource

7227303
client-side	server-side
but if the client-side script resource is generated by a server-side application like php then it is necessary to set the content-type header field value explicitly as the default is likely text html

7227303
client-side	server-side
server-side generation can happen easily to a client-side script resource even if you have plain .js files on the server if comments are removed from them as they are served if they are all packed into one large response to reduce the number of requests which can be more efficient or they are minimized by the server-side application in any other way

7227340

google-chrome	firefox
when i copy the same url and try to run the website in google-chrome or firefox it shows me the following error

7227935

now you can place the show hide code in the manager and also the code that alex provided to you

7227998
hide	show
this is one of a number of ways to avoid code duplication as the show hide close handling is always the same

finally there is the matter of screens sizes but you ll probably target one type of device in particular tablet phone and then decide which sizes for that form factor you ll work for

7228438
integer	fractions
the idea i have is to first truncate the floating point number into a temporary integer and then convert that integer into string and then consider the fractions part multiply it with 10 while the fractions part does not become 0

7228438
integer	fractions
after the fractions part is transferred into the left side of the decimal point apply the integer to string function again and convert the fractions part to string

7228666
stdout	stderr
main problem here is pipes stdout stderr you can t just close then script will most likely get error on write to pipe end exit itself

7228666

even though you set the height and width inline ie may still have issues with haslayout

7234963
rsa	aes
use rsa for nothing else than symmetric key wrapping and digital signatures in all remaining cases where you want to actually encrypt sensitive data you use a symmetric cipher aes is a good choice - 128 or 256 bits doesn t really matter

7234963
rsa	aes
now you would rsa-encrypt this symmetric key and nothing else using the server s public key and send the key to the server then encrypt your private data using aes and the symmetric key the server would decrypt the symmetric key using its private rsa key and decrypt the packets you send to it

7234964

add-ons and their dependencies should be always added to web-inf lib to make the server-side classes available to the application and client-side code available to the gwt compiler

ienumerable	iqueryable
the reason your second query works is because the linq to sql returns a list and then you do a linq query to filter out what you need on a c# list which implements the ienumerable iqueryable interfaces and understands the grp.lastordefault

7236072
public	protected
if it matters then yes you should make it protected private and make public wrappers like you have

the other alternative is to force php to treat it as an unsigned integer as per the notes on the ip2long man page

7236146
128bit	64bit
as well remember that ipv6 will be widespread any day now and you ll need to use a 128bit integer to store those values which mysql doesn t support - it d have to be two 64bit bigints at least

7236171
uiview	uitouch
so you should be able to retrieve the current cgaffinetransform applied to your uiview then apply this cgaffinetransform to the point of your uitouch using cgpointapplyaffinetransform probably after inverting the affinetransform to apply the inverse transformation to your point

7236186

7236254
keydown	keyup
if you need to have some special effect on keys that don t generate characters press you need to listen for keydown keyup events in those you got keycodes they are fired for every key in the key board and the shift status is not applied when you press the key for a don t matter if shift is pressed or caps lock on you always get 65

7236254

the 256px image is actually stored with width and height equal to 0 because that field is byte sized and 0 was formerly invalid

in addition the fpdi website says fpdi has a dependency on fpdf_tpl file which looking into the file tells me it extends fpdf

7236854
tcpdf	fpdi	tcpdf	fpdf	fpdf	fpdi
so to my question how do you configure fpdi to work with tcpdf instead of fpdf

7236904
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure on the specifics but some quick tests show that google-chrome uses body but firefox and ie use html

7236918

you won t get live update but you will be able to process the mouse and keyboard events however you like

7236974

if the form is unpredictably doing something script-illegal under those circumstances and the template is submission only with js perhaps that s why it won t submit

7237146
fadein	fadeout
how to fadein and fadeout img tags in div use jquery

7237160

also if you are looking for integration tests rather then acceptance tests which is what it sounds like plain capybara with rspec will probably be a better fit scroll down to capybara + rspec

7237327
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you fully qualify it on the client side it will work with firefox and google-chrome and safari

7237329
width	margin
note that the outer linearlayout should be set to have the dimension of the image and the width of the gridview column should be the width of the image plus any margin

7237348

in some post i ve seen that people have changed the web.config file to get things working but according to the documentation net connector 6.4.3 the connection should be added and edited via adding a new data source via the database explorer

7237367
google-chrome	firefox
here is my issue top raw messed up in google-chrome and ie but working fine in firefox

ubuntu	linux
i m currently implementing a threading library in linux my os is ubuntu natty

7237518
wireless	umts
however especially if your payload is small think messages the size of a typical sms or tweet the overhead you create with webservices is prohibitive bytes sent over a wireless network like gprs or umts are still very expensive compared to bytes carried over cable or adsl

7237518
short	base
so if your use case is based on short messages i d at least advise to do some bandwidth simulation calculations and base your decision on bandwidth savings vs increased complexity of your app

7237522
oncreate	ondestroy
then the service will be spending the majority of its time not in the protected oncreate onstartcommand or ondestroy methods

7237528
google-chrome	firefox
based on your live site now adding float left to the rule below should fix it in google-chrome and it still looks ok in firefox

7237531
pull	push
stax is a pull not push library so its a lot easier to keep track of state

7237578
getter	setter
as long as i get a symbol through square brackets or on initialization i can easily store the k v pair and create instance methods for the setter and getter

7237580
getter	setter
i assume spring may also require getter and setter on fields of the somecommand object

7237583

the benefits of map-reduce and indexing as well as eventually consistent replication that couchdb brings are nothing less than huge for membase...and the benefits of low-latency clustering and ui that membase brings to couchdb are arguably just as important

7247203
apache	nginx
it does not do any sort of domain name resolution and virtual host handling so you have to use a http server with a proxy such as apache or nginx

7247210
hash	salt
generate a cryptographic one-way hash function using sha-512 or other encryption and store the resulting hash and salt in nsuserdefaults

7247210

store the resulting hash and salt value in nsuserdefaults -- these values can t be used by hackers to determine the original password so there is no need to store them in a secure place

7247210
hash	salt
grab the previously saved hash + salt value from nsuserdefaults

7247210
hash	salt
create a forward-only hash using the same one-way hash function that you used to encrypt the original password -- passing it the attempted password and the salt value from nsuserdefaults

7247210

what i am trying to do is to have a very simple tooltip that hide show on hover using jquery

7247511
next	except
for example i have never asked for the next node at the current level except within a given parent because leaving a given parent takes me to another context

7247511
children	parent
but within a parent i already have the children and their order

7247511
inherited	properties
being inherited from treenode they can be used directly by the tree but because they have overrides of the basenode properties such as loadchildren and display properties the display and retrieval any given set of data is implied by the type of node and the guid that the item represents

7247514
int	chars
if i understand correctly you want to store chars s and int s in a dictionary as keys and values

7247514
int	chars
wrap the chars s and int s in the nsnumber object

7247514
int	chars
or if you don t want boxing why not just make a function that takes chars s and returns int s

7247781
width	height
i resized them using width and height properties in css but i would like to show them bigger maybe in popup or something like that after clicking on them

7247795
width	height
if you want to go a fancier route you can define a width and height check for overflow and make it wider using javascript

7247835

7248017
children	parent
i am using jstree and it is loading ok with json data the searching in the parent nodes works fine as well but when it comes to searching the child nodes which are not loaded at first as the tree is big and children are only loaded when a parent is selected i am experiencing a problem

7248017
children	parent
my tree is two laryers in depth only parent and children so based on above doc i should only send the parent node that contains that child node which has the search string in its title and in the success section of the search ajax i can see that all the appropriate parent nodes are being passed by the server but no results show up i am thinking it has to do with my formatting i pass a list of the id s of the parent nodes

7248093
put	get
get yourself a good profiler i use redgate s ants memory profiler which has a free trial put your app through it s paces let the memory usage build up and then use the profiler results to narrow down the actual culprit

7248119
width	height
if you remove that and set width and height to auto or leave out you ll likely get what you want

7248119

this will recalculate the height and width of the fancybox

7248320
opera	firefox
it s working fine in firefox and opera

7248401

7248487
width	height
height and width works normally

7248507
public	protected
you probably know this but with inheritance you can have public protected and private member access

7248507
public	protected
if a member is private in the base class the derived cannot access it while if that same member is protected then the derived class can access it while it still isn t public so you re maintaining encapsulation

7248507
public	protected
this could be useful because class b could inherit from class a as protected thus getting its protected members while class c could inherit from the same class a as public thus not getting access to its protected members

7248515
hide	show
it s much easier to hide show controls when needed or use repeaters or datagrids

7248574

opera	firefox
webkit-browsers firefox and opera will handle html5 elements quite normally even if your doctype is not html5

7248930
margin	height
you will have to add the height of the fixed element to the limit to get it to move up the page again before it touches the element you do not want it to touch plus some margin if desired

7248950
int	double
if i understand this page by oracle describing the format used for number on sparc correctly the sparc uses the opposite endian as x86 for int but the same endian as x86 for floats and double

7248950
int	double
however pb encodes floats double by first casting them directly to an int type of the appropriate size via means of a union

7248950
x86	64bit
as lyke pointed out ieee 64bit floating points are stored in big-endian order on sparc in contrast to x86

7249037
multiplying	subtract
subtract the latency of the router and computer divide by 6 then multiplying by the speed of light and hopefully you will have the distance to a resolution of a few metres

7249048
width	height
since i m looking at mobile devices i set the viewport to which ever width height is smallest

7249048
width	height
edit i actually did this and coupled it together with a update width height routine on my div s based on screen.width height and it turned out pretty good

7249090

it not hide and still is show

7249289
implements	extends
simple but no other benefit beside very easy to implements and extends

7249312
hfs+	ntfs
it really boils down to how tfs 2010 is exposing it s file store to the mac os - my guess is that it s a smb share and that s why your aliases are failing to survive the translation from hfs+ to ntfs storage through a smb api

7249351
for-loop	arrays
to iterate over arrays use a classic for-loop

7249371
integer	fractions
you can perform mathematical operations on amt to transform it to an integer value within a range then use that as an index for an array lookup to get the fractions text

7249375
jstl	taglib
don t forget to update the jstl taglib uris in any jsp to include the new jsp prefix which was introduced since jstl 1.1

7249407

7249976
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux 10.04

7250020
inherited	subclassing
if there s inherited that can happen with the return types as you ve described with avatarbase and subclassing then i think the right approach is to make the return type the lowest common denominator and just handle the resulting object on the other end

7250041
google-chrome	firefox
i ve checked firebug in firefox and also in google-chrome developer tools and they both show the app looking at localhost

7250073
linefeed	delimiter
some compilers on unix linux do not like files edited on windows dos which contains cr linefeed 0x0d 0x0a instead of linefeed 0x0a as line delimiter

7250075
backbone.js	sammy.js
if you re going to build complex user interfaces in the browser then you will probably find yourself eventually inventing most of the pieces that make up frameworks like backbone.js and sammy.js

7250075
backbone.js	sammy.js
if what you plan to build is something where the ui regularly changes how it displays but does not go to the server to get entire new pages then you probably need something like backbone.js or sammy.js

it is not completely clear what you are trying to do but if this page is linked to from a javascript-based page that does the calculations you can pass the variables using get or post see here

7250295
move	drag	mouseup	mousedown
you should search for examples on how to drag and move controls i actually did it in delphi looong ago about 11 years ago and it was all about mouse coordinates and flags to set on mousedown and mouseup

7250307
move	drag
i would recommend that you implement some type of visible drag handle that appears which would allow them to grab and move the control

7250311
min	max
i try to set max and min to mposy and mposx but it s hard and complicated because when the pic is smaller than the screen it must be centered.

7250317
bash	zsh
thanks for the os and bash version but this is functioning as designed for bash ksh zsh and probably others

7250332
firefox	safari
to my surprise firefox 6 and safari 5 are faster just adding a bunch of strings together than using .join

7251522
google-chrome	firefox
if your code is using setinterval and you are running in a browser like firefox or google-chrome then this is because those browsers are slowing down timers in background tabs while they are in the background and thus not displayed

7251522
setinterval	settimeout
consumption even for pages that are using settimeout and setinterval

7251522
setinterval	settimeout
instead of setinterval use settimeout and then just reset the settimeout each time it fires to create your own repeating interval

7251797
viewmodel	caliburn
for wp7 apps i prefer caliburn micro because it does a lot of work for you like making it easy to navigate pages in the forced view first approach but then makes using the viewmodel first approach on sub pages easy as well

7251809

i like the idea of being able to write both my client-side and server-side code in coffeescript which is a great language

7252357
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however firefox google-chrome safari parse them out

7252369
oncreate	ondestroy
i think in your case you can register the receiver in the oncreate and unregister in the ondestroy

7252371
versioning	upgrade
you should really upgrade to a newer versioning of asp.net

7252411
pop-up	dialog

i m profiling debugging build c++ code in msvc 2005 and certain code takes an extremely long time to execute 30+ seconds compared to 1-2 seconds in release

7252549

this may be too greedy though as some programs use stdout and not stderr to report warnings

7252586
post	get
the browser sends a post request to the server the server responds with a 302 found redirect with a location header the browser issues a get request to the given location

7252588
post	get
using this access_token as i mentioned in my post i get the same result using the graph api explorer

7252616
getter	setter
is this for variables that other classes may wish to read from or write to hence why they automatically create getter and setter methods

7252626
margin	height
i m pulling my hair out here because this seems like it should be straight forward to fix but margin-bottom 0 padding-bottom 0 defined height nothing seems to work to fix it and firebug does not even show the whitespace as margin or padding

7252634
hide	show
i want to show hide a block of html based on if the current row property capassignedtousercode is the same as the variable currentusercode see if statement

7252652
getter	setter
also property tag helps to make getter and setter for your variable

7252652
getter	setter
you use property in header file and than synthesize it in implementation which will let you access thru getter and setter

7252668
put	get
if you re pulling the list of image names from a databse you could use ajax to get that data out and put it in an array then you could assign that to the array images

7252716
keydown	keyup
what i ve done in the past and i m not sure that this is the best way to do it but it works ok is to instead listen for keydown and keyup events and stack modifier keys

7252761
profiler	visualvm
the profiler i use visualvm always end up chashing the server without telling me where s the problem

7252767

i would suggest using phpbb forum or wordpress with the buddypress plug-in

7252826
getter	setter
lastly you can get built-in behaviors with property attributes and the synthesize keyword but you can also decide not to use the synthesize keyword and write custom getter and setter for your properties

7252846
accessor	properties	getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
properties and synthesize tags are used to create automated getter and setter or accessor and mutators in objective-c terminology but there is more

7252854

i need to show and hide a div in javascript

7252946
post	get
this post request from facebook includes information which tells you the current page id if the user likes the page etc see s page parameter which can t be safely passed in a get request

7252954
getter	setter
objective-c like most object-oriented languages adopts the concept of getter and setter for object properties

7252954
getter	setter
prior to objective-c 2.0 you had to write getter and setter yourself which introduced a whole lot of repetitious boilerplate code

7252954
getter	setter
the initial purpose of property was to declare getter or setter in the interface

7252965
hide	show
use jquery toggle function to hide and show the div

7253000

7253061
inherited	subclassing
subclassing would inherited this as well

7253110
ant	maven
i can recommend you not to use mxmlc directly but take advantage of maven with flex mojos or ant

7253119
multiplying	add
it concatenates the string instead of my somewhat hacky multiplying by 10 and add approach

7253166
folder	directory
i checked the android-sdk folder but couldd not find any such directory

7253180
width	height
you will now find that the above url is working fine since i have modified my js to call setsize with explicit width and height

7253208
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
the simplest fix to do would be to use a bufferedreader and a stringbuilder

7253219

you can pass in parameters that are eventually used as maven properties using the parameters section of a maven build run configuration in eclipse i ll assume that you re using the eclipse m2e plugin

7253281
maven	pom.xml
the following screenshot demonstrates how the property that i eventually used in my maven pom.xml is specified from the run configuration

7253359
for-loop	arrays
i usually run the arrays through a for-loop and set the request code dynamically for each item in the arrays

7253363
inherited	properties
ok so i decided to not inherited from a base and instead implement an interface with the same properties my base had

7253375
versioning	upgrade
i guess this is specific to 3.7 as i upgrade the eclipse versioning and started getting this issue first way still works in eclipse 3.2

7253388
width	height
then change only the width and height attributes to be whatever you want and hopefully that should work

7253403
accessor	properties
then in the viewmodel i make sure that the accessor is created and set to the passwordbox.password properties

7253530
ubuntu	linux
however in ubuntu linux i did and it worked

7253536
post	put
this is probably because you put the code of auth the login data in the same action probally by check whether the request is post

7253538
hide	show
when i click common it start check my vim settings and create sub menu for instance show hide line number

7253549
int	double
the compiler can t decide whether to convert f2 to double then add double and int or to construct fraction from 2 then add two fractions

7253551
int	double
it can first convert f2 to a double using the fractions s double operator and then simply add the double and the int

7253552
hide	show
the method show then hide some html content on this webpage however the html or css is not functioning correctly

7253552
hide	show
here is the css id i am using to show and hide

7253552
hide	show
basically when i run the page and show the content the styling is becoming skewed and the positioning of the html that is not with the show and hide content is also becoming skewed

7253555
put	get
once solution is to put a toarray or tolist at the end of your db call which makes that one line an explicit call to get the data instead of lazing loading on each of the other lines

7253587
stdout	stderr
try using to capture both stdout and stderr

7253751
getter	setter
your workaround is valid you don t even need getter setter private field is enough

7253787
folder	directory
store your data as xml serialization in specific file under predefined directory appdata folder

7253795
trie	tree
if you do care about efficiency i suggest you split each string into a sequences of words or even characters and make a tree data structure such as a trie d1 tutorials d2 usingtries which allows fast look ups on each sub sequence

7253814
skip-lists	linked-list
i first thought of linked-list but insertion is o n and amit corrected me with skip-lists

7253924
implements	extends
for refreshing the cellwidgets which is attached to asyncdataprovider you will probably have to extends the asyncdataprovider and either extract the rpc call to a getdata method which is called in the onrangechanged method or create an interface with a refresh method and implements it in your custom asyncdataprovider which calls the protected onrangechanged method

7253929
mouse	keyboard
you can link an event handler into the mouse and keyboard events that will bring up the context menu

7253963
put	get
i by no means have not put every single framework in the options but it should be enough to get your started

7253973
width	height
you can either use fb.canvas.setautoresize to have your page automatically resized or if you know exactly what the height and width of the page will be use fb.canvas.setsize

7253992
dbcontext	objectcontext
as you can see the approach reverts back to objectcontext api because dbcontext api is only for simple scenarios where you don t bother with such details like mapping metadata

7254001
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in firefox and google-chrome but but in all ies it fails after the first reload

7254070
air	flashdevelop
yes remote debugging from flashdevelop works with air ios android projects provided they share the same wifi lan

7254087

though if space is an issue you will have to resort to only checking if the children are not the same as the parent or some kind of limited version of this approach

7254179
uilabel	uibutton
then start creating controls you want like uibutton uilabel etc using its allocation alloc and initialization init methods and set its frames

put	get
use javascript to get the current time in the client system and put that in a javascript variable

7254764
try-catch	exception-handling
here s a food for thought...from the code above you have used a try-catch block...my guess is that one of the above operations is throwing an exception-handling because of which the out.close operation is getting skipped...why not add a finally block and close the stream there...it would definitely help you save the trouble

7254785
put	get
either way i d code the task s class es and command implementations put them on a package make them singletons or have public references in some main class and get rid of the map

7254802

i find the inorder and preorder traversal of tree a

7254808

margin	word-spacing
the genius and trick to this method is in using inline-block elements and then using word-spacing to counterbalance using a negative right margin

width	margin
a negative right margin on it s own will pull elements together allowing you to have 100 width set and still fit things in between but leave the elements overlapping

i assume that because you are able to traverse children and parent of objects that doing var_dump gives infinite results because it finds the parent of an object and then recursively finds it s children and then finds all those children s parent and finds those children etc etc etc

7265191
children	parent
using the simple html dom parser example if i have a dom object that has no children and i var_dump it i d like it to just dump the object and no start traversing up the dom tree and dumping parent grandparents other children etc

floyd-warshall	dijkstra
as others have pointed out floyd-warshall runs in time o n 3 and running a dijkstra s search from each node to each other node assuming you re using a fibonacci heap to back your dijkstra s implementation takes o mn + n 2 log n

7265454
bellman-ford	dijkstra
the algorithm works by first running bellman-ford on the graph to transform it to a graph with no negative edges then using dijkstra s algorithm starting at each vertex

7265454
bellman-ford	floyd-warshall
because bellman-ford runs in time o mn the overall asymptotic runtime is still o mn + n 2 log n so if m o n 2 note that this is little-o of n this approach is asymptotically faster than using floyd-warshall

you aren t going to be doing any multiplication or division on the cc number so it should be a string in my opinion

7269655
inherited	properties
it doesn t actually make the call to grab the information until the properties is accessed for the first time and also it does so without locking so if there where multiple threads accessing that area of the code it is not atomic so there is an inherited risk of race conditions - it shouldn t matter to much anyway as it is a read only properties who s value should always be the same

7270432
folder	directory
set the directory root to your project root folder

7270439

but restkit does more than translating objects it actually maps restful requests to actions in your model thus abstracting all the data handling needed after a get post delete request to your backend

7270526
hash	salt
so i found out on so that you re supposed to hash the password together with a salt

7270537
button	checkbox
set the values of checkbox as per appdelegate dictionary.and update the state in appdelegate dictionary when user selects or deselects the button

7270546
sorting	grouping
this is called natural sorting where you effectively treat a grouping of digits as a single character

7270571
addclass	removeclass
other posts suggest calling removeclass on all items then calling addclass on the one you want

7270581
hash	md5
no because when the password gets hash it doesn t look like fishabc09 it looks like 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99 which is an md5 hash

7270581
hash	salt
we use salt in order to add complexity to our hash and to prevent hash lookups in rainbow tables

7270581
hash	md5
for example do a google search for the md5 hash of password which is 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99

7270581
hash	salt
now i m going to create a hash again i will still use password but i will add a salt which is ahg

7270657
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
this worked well for the nt4 password process which used md5 hash and no salt

7270657
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
when a salt is added to a password before hashing then the rainbow table is useless - instead of looking for the md5 hash of mypass it has to precompute mypass-random-string_of-letters

7270657
hash	salt
you append the salt and hash comapre to the hash stored in database

7270657
hash	salt
a salt adds a two factor defence to the passwords - even with the hash an attacker will need the salt to have any chance of cracking it

7270657
hash	salt
this way you can re-confirm the password by rehashing with the salt and reversing the hash is next to impossible

7270657
hash	salt
to brute force this by computing the hash directly ie making my salt specific rainbow tables i should see a collision after 62 8 2 and at lets say 100 hash per second it will take around 12 million days

7270657
disk	ram
i have no idea how to tell if my server just swapped the ram holding my salt into disk and thats only one mistake i can immediately think of in rolling my own authentication

this can be done in a repeater but a datalist control is more straightforward and is just as easy to use

scrypt	salt
the correct way to handle password matching is to use a salt to alter the original password in some simple way so that simple dictionary passwords will now no longer result in values that can be easily reversed by a google lookup and then use use a cryptographic hashing algorithm like bcrypt scrypt or if your really have to sha1

7272038
folder	directory
this is a normal folder under the project directory but it s displayed specially in solution explorer

7272038
folder	directory
the only reason i ve ever seen anyone change it is when there were multiple .csproj files in a single directory so it didn t make sense for them all to share the same properties folder but that was a very oddball scenario

7273027
width	height
looking at width height of them was not overly helpful - some were the dimensions of the iframe itself some were the dimensions from top-left pixel of slide 1 to bottom-right pixel of slide n some were 0x0 and some burried in the middle were the dimensions of a slide

7273027
width	height
the pattern i found was that you have to skip the first element in document.all and iterate through until you found one with non-zero width height who have identical values for clientheight offsetheight scrollheight as well as identical values for clientwidth offsetwidth and scrollwidth

7273027
width	height
the first one of these will give you the height width of a single slide and you can go from there

7273027

7273195
implements	extends
if a class extends an abstract class should we implements all the methods in the abstract

the simplest way to use long term caching for speed and efficiency but immediate and safe upgrade when you upgrade a js file is to include a versioning number in the deployed filename or path like jquery does with jquery-1.6.2.js and then you bump change that versioning number whenever you upgrade change the file

int	chars
i thought that the int binding on quantity threw an exception in the setter when you typed alpha chars

7273826
int	chars
note that if you change the chars to int this works fine

use the jsoup htmlcleaner with a configuration specified by a whitelist

7273993

the problem with passing directly is that the string class interprets every int as a separate chars while after converting to string treats input as raw bytes and understands that 195 164 is actually is a single chars consisting of two bytes rather than two chars

7274023
cos	sin
again by checking the sign of dot product you are actually checking the sign of cos theta and by checking perpdot you are checking the sign of sin theta

for-loop	arrays
how about using arrays a function and a for-loop

7277320
hide	show
just as an example if you have two functions to show and hide an image they could be called show and hide and exist in any scope

7277320

opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
web sql database has more browsers which currently support it but firefox doesn t support it and outweighs safari opera and assorted mobile browsers and so it s only at about 28 while indexeddb is near 36 global support

google-chrome	firefox
the issue doesn t seem to be related to either javascript on or off no difference browser tried google-chrome and firefox or wysiwyg used input formats with and without

use a pure ruby web server like unicorn or thin

7278558
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop always leaves one too many objects in the arrays

7278558
for-loop	arrays
this is because each time the for-loop cycles the len drops down one because of the removed item in the arrays and on the last object it cancels the for-loop before it can remove the object

7278559
bluetooth	usb
it doesn t support varying input devices such as d-pads touch screens trackballs or even bluetooth usb controllers

button.getlayoutparams should return viewgroup.layoutparams which you can access the height and width on - no cast needed

7278871
post	get
then if you still get an exception post that one - not the one with the casting

7278872

onclick	onfocus
through an inline js call or a listener capture the onfocus onclick event on the options and toggle a classname selectedoption whatever you wish the name to be on that element

7287915

you would need to track the original start point somewhere variables data attributes on #currenthighlight wherever you want and check for width or height 0

7287915
width	height
then set the #currenthighlight width height to the same difference but positive

7287924
lxml.html	beautifulsoup
unfortunately python does not have useful html parsing in the standard library so the only reasonable way to parse html is by using a third party module like lxml.html or beautifulsoup

7287930

7288246
vb6	vba
does anyone know the simplest way to do this in vb6 vba or know of any source code

7288249
hide	show
here s a fiddle use .show and hide instead of explicitly setting the css display properties even though show and hide do this in the background

by adding class attributes to the item you want to trigger the show hide and the element you want show hidden you can do something like this

7288347
textview	simplecursoradapter
i have a database and textview i bind them together with a simplecursoradapter

7288362
width	height
it doesn t loop and accounts for both height and width

7288367
client-side	server-side
for example the client-side exit can prompt the user for id and password encrypt these and then forward to the server-side exit for validation

7288402
width	height
it doesn t loop and accounts for both height and width

7288404
g++	gcc
i use g++ gcc but i cannot link the c executable with c++ shared library

7288444
folder	directory
however i noticed that each directory the root folder and all of its sub directory that the installer created does not give write permissions

7288444
folder	directory
in my case i need give the root directory of the application and all of its sub directory and the folder that is placed in the programdata folder read write permissions for the users group

7288485
g++	gcc
you may have to use g++ as the linker not gcc

7288489
post	get
in the core-data scenario you implement declarative mappings between your data model and the content you get from and post to the server and it takes care of things like injecting objects from the cloud into your client model posting new objects to the server and incorporating server-generated objects ids into your client-side model doing all of this in a background thread and taking care of all the core-data context threading issues and so on

7288496
google-chrome	firefox
everything works great in all tested versions of google-chrome firefox and ie9

you can use a qstackedwidget and a qsignalmapper to do that

7288555

7288686
super	self
quick question about python ic inheritence what is the difference between the idiom posted here super childclass self .method args vs

7288741
super	self
using super childclass self .method args allows you to walk the method resolution order and -- if everyone but the last parent uses super -- call every class in the hierarchy exactly once

7288759
jobs	cron
its path magic will break in non-obvious places cron jobs and you ll be up a creek

7288759
ubuntu	debian
here s a tutorial for ubuntu that should translate pretty well into debian

7288786
vb.net	vb6	vbscript	vb6
as darin dimitrov pointed out this is definitely vb.net which is definitely not vbscript vb6 asp classic

7288788

button	checkbox
checkbox -- expand button -- rest of treeitem stuff

7288828
integer	fractions
treating this as an integer and incrementing it gives a fractions part of 0000 with a carry

7288828
int	double
converting the representation to an int incrementing and converting back to a double does work nicely for positive normalised numbers

7288828
range	infinity
finally eventually you will overflow the largest normalised number and increment the exponent into the infinity and nan range

7288832
getter	setter
this implementation will contain synthesize instructions that generate the getter and setter methods for you

7288839
pop-up	dialog
dialog are slow to pop-up so i used a textview..but its not working

7288876
filtering	grouping
paging filtering or grouping to be performed purely on the client by

7288921
projectile	angle
so a projectile hitting a surface at an angle of 45 degrees will bounce at -45 degrees

7288921
projectile	angle
this will require you to know both the direction angle that the projectile is moving as well as the angle of the surface

7288952
inherited	subclassing
i m looking for a simple example of creating a class in javascript which is then inherited in a subclassing

7288972
versioning	upgrade
i for one would certainly prefer using a custom separate database and leave drupal databases to its own devices if you would ever need to upgrade the site to a higher versioning of drupal it helps if you don t modify it and also consider using webform as it makes development easier both in components and hooks

7288973
post	get
this would seem to cause a problem because you are using method post in your form not method get

7288977
google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine in google-chrome but for some reason its not hiding the elements in firefox ignoring ie for now another guy in the office specializes in that so he will make it work there poor soul

7288980
division	addition
after this its trivial addition and modular division in case you don t know what that is have a look at this

7288983
stdout	stderr
con is the equivalent of dev stdout and dev stderr in windows

7288994
getter	setter
and last if you change your mind you can run the unlombok or let your ide create these setter getter and ctors which i think no one will ask for once they see how clear your pojo becomes

7289004
inherited	subclassing
you need to look into the objects prototype however you won t have traditional subclassing and inherited

7289026
put	get
class dbadapter get s the values to put into the listview and allows for programatically controlling the display

7289058
bindparam	pdostatement	bindparam	bindvalue	pdostatement	bindvalue
you could try pdostatement bindvalue as it seems that pdo will modify the reference you are passing in to bindparam even though it should only read it

7289058
bindparam	pdostatement
from pdostatement bindparam

7289058
pdostatement	bindvalue
unlike pdostatement bindvalue the variable is bound as a reference and will only be evaluated at the time that pdostatement execute is called

7289099
put	get
if i understand you correctly you have to get rid of in the loop and just put before the loop

7289143
post	get
within your function you have access to the wp object and you can get either the pagename or the post name with

7289143
post	get
if on the other hand you really need the post data the first place to get it and arguably in this context the best is

7289147
google-chrome	firefox
it s strange works on my machine in both firefox and google-chrome -- how are you calling hide_slide_left and what is button_one and button_two when you call it

7289165
restrict	shared
in the same way if the first eight logical cpus shared an l3 cache and the other group of eight logical cpus shared an l3 cache then 8 threads modifying the same memory may run better when restrict to one group of logical cpus and not spread across separate physical chips with separate l3 caches

7289198
subtract	add
the latter is trivial - just add and subtract a value

7289250
inherited	properties
and because clr don t allow you to inherited from structs - you should specify an interface and encapsulate your fields into properties in your structure

7289252
post	get
the following url points to a blog post with links to resources that will help you get started

7289295
rss	feed
i currently have an android activity which manages some locally-stored rss feed

7289301
xdebug	xhprof
because you will download xdebug report to local machine but with xhprof you will look at profiler page in real time

7289315
put	get	uilabel	uibutton
finally i get to replacing it with a button so i delete the uilabel and put a uibutton in its place keep in mind this is all in interface builder

7289318
installation	downgrade
if using .net 4 specific features is less important than avoiding installation you can try to downgrade your app to .net 2 or even .net 1

7289339
screens	tablet
working with a xoom tablet and the menu options button on the bottom of the screens does not light up is not active

7289364
post	get
i will try the other suggestions when i get back and post my findings

7289406
width	height
so the first thing you have to do is calculate the rectanle x y width and height which defines the visible area of your original image

7289409
google-chrome	safari
webkit for safari and google-chrome though each have differences themselves

7289434
content-length	content-type
additionally you can set content-length header but in my opinion if you are building webservice it s not http server proxy server content-type is enough

7289474
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
in their sample app the geocoder is set using the properties accessor otherwise the autorelease will release the ivar when you exit the method

7289476
width	height
so i need to tell the div wrapping around the iframe to change its width and height

7289482
int	double
not much you can do with this unless you pass in an array of double int

7289512
oncreate	ondestroy
the game data is loaded in the oncreate method and saved ondestroy so it s a problem if i can t then send that data on

7289512
getter	setter
need some very basic help with setter and getter

7289512
getter	setter
i was trying to use bundles but it was suggested using setter and getter would be simpler

7289555
getter	setter
i don t fully understand the question but to use those setter and getter that you wrote you will have to have a spacewarz object created somewhere in your code

7289555
getter	setter
then you can call its setter or getter method

7289560
jar	war
this will let you call out your jar just like you do a dependency but it will copy it wherever you like so that it can be included in your war

7289566
getter	setter
but getter setter are as simple as they sound

7289580
udp	tcp
is socket is the choice what is the best to use tcp or udp

7289593
width	height
to put the values of the width and height variables in the string you have to concatentate them into a string

7289616
post	get
at my current website i am using this code to get the first image witch is inside the post

7289616
post	get
i wanted to know how to get all the images that are in the post not only the first one

7289677
freebsd	linux
while i haven t verified the exact process for gnu linux on freebsd it works like so

7289753
dateadd	datepart
2 use dateadd and datepart to add hours first then minutes then seconds...

7289756
inherited	properties
what is plain wrong is trying to inherited from dependencyobject as viewmodel and specifying dependency properties

7289757
udp	tcp
http and tcp udp reside in different layers of the communications systems models the two most popular being the osi model and the tcp ip model

7289757
udp	tcp
i can t tell you if you should use tcp or udp - that depends on lots of factors but the basic difference is that a tcp connection would guarantee a successful delivery if there s connectivity available or an error message if not while udp just sends the data and doesn t care if it gets there or not for streaming live video there s no point in ensuring that every bit of data is being transferred as 1 second later it s no longer relevant

7289774
sorting	grouping
sorting details is not as simple as sorting grouping

7289774
sorting	grouping
sorting details is not really point and click like sorting grouping

7289777
google-chrome	firefox
however even though a verbose mode is available in firefox with webgl.verbose set to true i haven t found such a thing for google-chrome

7289790
post	get
you would need to use group by to get the post count

7289811
boost	stl
please don t give the why don t use stl boost whatever

7289849
stdout	fflush
it s possible that the second line doesn t print because stdout isn t fflush

7289865
jar	war
you probably have added the same jar file in both your war and your ear and you use it in your ear

7289900
sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering	int	boolean	filtering	grouping
the has method is for attributes - which are mostly int floats timestamps and boolean values which are used by developers for sorting filtering and grouping

7289911
int	chars
and you re only supposed to use int signed unsigned or otherwise as the type not chars

7289956
put	get
but if i put the run_test helper call in the view twice i get a double render error which shouldn t be happening with partials

7289958
do-while	break
an unlabelled break only break out of the enclosing switch for while or do-while construct

7289969
many-to-many	one-to-many
technically if two people live at the same address you would not be completely normalized if there was simply a single one-to-many detail table for the row in tblperson called tbladdress however if you want just one instance per physical address you will incur the overhead of a many-to-many relation table of tblpersonaddresses which fk s to tbladdress

7290106
children	parent
i wouldn t recommend this solution if the user can reassign the parent of a category because you need to regenerate the lineage for all affected children

7290145
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome ie8 not checked 9 and firefox 3.5 this looked perfect

7290160
put	get
also you neither need to compare the return value of get to n nor put it in a loop

7290174
qtreeview	qmodelindex
the signal for a qtreeview expansion event is expanded qmodelindex

7290214
google-chrome	firefox
and suddenly i get 2 to 5 mm of green space between the two iframe s folder content email content in both google-chrome and ie8 haven t tested firefox

7290217
post	get
keep in mind that people could load a page in their browser and then use the javascript console built into most browsers to load your ajax page providing whatever get post data they want

7290220
switching	screens
choose task manager select my app shown in the list and select switching to to bring the app to the front instead of activity 2 it ends up on the activity screens 1

7290227
next	except
flashdata is similar to a session except it disappears after the next page call

7290274
interpreted-language	smalltalk
there are already some things allowing simple development on android using interpreted-language like smalltalk web-based development etc

7290284
profiling	instrumentation
compiling with -pg instrumentation your code so that gprof reports detailed information see gprof s manual 9.1 implementation of profiling

7290284
profiling	instrumentation
please note that with such an instrumenting profiling you re profiling the same code you would compile in release without profiling instrumentation

7290284
profiler	vtune
contrary to an instrumenting profiler a sampling profiler like intel vtune works on non instrumented code by looking at the target program s program counter at regular intervals using operating system interrupts

7290287
ssl	https
is it not possible to use https ssl

7290301

7290384
google-chrome	firefox
does anyone have any ideas on how to solve this problem across google-chrome firefox

7290413
inject	interceptor
is there a way to look that up do i need to inject something into the interceptor that can look that up based on the requested path

7290438
int	chars
why is the behavior of the haskell range notation different for floats than for int and chars

7290442
rss	feed
in this case you d have the first rss feed item in an itemtemplate then the second rss feed item in an alternateitemtemplate another row then the third rss feed item in an itemtemplate and so on

7290458
division	modulo
if you have exponentiation division integer truncation and modulo you could use the following to see if to find out if bit x is set

7290493
int	double
for float and double the semantics of the enumfrom family is given by the rules for int above except that the list terminates when the elements become greater than e3 + iâˆ 2 for positive increment i or when they become less than e3 + iâˆ 2 for negative i

7290516

7290578
uitableview	nsindexpath
based on the sample app i ve added the following to my - uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath function

7290592
submit	submission
you have not shown what your submit function does but if it does a normal form submission not ajax then you will need to redirect at a later time

7290612
post	get
i m assuming you ll know the user advertiser id based on authentication so you can have an empty create method signature for the get to display the form and a create method signature that takes an advertisement object for the post

7290637
vbo	normals
i found someplace that listed these as the indices for glvertexattribpointer but they could easily be wrong these are the shader position shader normals etc in the vbo setup function

7290639
gif	png
if i have an image jpg png gif .doesn t really matter and i want to have some javascript code change part of an image

7290720

7290732
post	get
i m going to be writing a pagercurrsor adapter for sqlite so i ll post it here when i get it working

7290762
multiplying	add
i think this would work but it s clumsy means preprocessing the deps file to add all that build whatever prefix stuff and would multiplying its size by however many kinds of builds

7290850
folder	directory
you can use project_loc at the begining to specify the project directory so for your example you would type project_loc src main res as the folder to link to and use the automatically generated name of res for the created folder

7290855
postgresql	mysql
as far as databases go there are plenty you can use mysql sql server postgresql etc.

7290967
int	chars
then use the chr built-in to convert a 8-bit int that is in the inclusive range 0-255 to a chars

7290981
jar	war
just add an execution of it somewhere before your war is built to copy the jar to an appropriate place

7290987

7291060
grass	proj
you might benefit from combining each proj into a single war but i do think this is really one of those the grass is always greener problems

7291086
coldspring	model-glue
fortunately model-glue has tight integration with coldspring a popular bean container for cfml and model-glue 3 makes it easier than ever to use coldspring beans in your controllers

7291144
pull	push
once the upstream branch has been configured you can use a bare git pull to automatically pull from origin new_auth when you have new_auth checked out you might also want to git config push.default upstream so that git push will only push to the upstream branch instead of pushing all branch names that exist in both your local and the remote repositories

7291146
google-chrome	firefox
i also got frustrated why the json file not being processed even if i don t use google-chrome - i use firefox or ie

7291270
rss	feed
i m using codeigniter and inputting some data from rss feed

7291313
free	malloc
as asveikau mentioned you could longjmp out of the signal handler and try to clean up but this could make an even worse mess if the crash happened in the middle of malloc free printf or any function modifying the state of global data or data that s shared with other threads or that will be accessed in the cleanup code at the longjmp destination

7291333

in google-chrome 3 it works like in firefox

7296303
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome 4 it works similary to firefox except some keyboard combination

7296319
min	max
firstly i suggest you create a random number r between your min and max number and we ll try to approach that number in cost to simplify this a bit. so

7296393
zoo	xts
use na.approx from the zoo package which is automatically loaded by xts

7296450
jobs	cron
check your cron jobs using

7296458
int	chars
in line 2 isn t the right hand side promoted to an int and then for assigning int to chars won t we need an explicit cast

7296458
int	chars
but since java does not allow automatic down type conversion don t we need explicit cast from int to chars

7296468
prepare	execute
you must prepare them every time you need to execute one

7296490
ubuntu	linux
i m on ubuntu 9.10 linux ghc 7.0.3 from the haskell-platform

7296496
google-chrome	safari
but other browsers at least safari google-chrome don t display any line

7296501

so this solution can be put together with cron jobs which would persist the view count and the latency of 1h between each cron would not matter because you re always looking into memory redis not db

7296505
x86	64bit
you re trying to load the 64bit dll in your x86 application you can probably find msobj100.dll in c windows syswow64

width	margin
this would plot a bar chart with a margin of 0.2 on both sides which results in a bar chart with gaps of 0.4 times the total width of the bars

7296734
int	double
you just need to use the same function but pass in a double value rather than an int value

7296740
gridview	linqdatasource	gridview	objectdatasource	gridview	sqldatasource	sqldatasource	linqdatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource	linqdatasource	objectdatasource
as far as paging is concerned as ricknz correctly points out it will only retain the state if you bind the gridview to either a linqdatasource sqldatasource or objectdatasource but if you bind it to custom business objects what you need to do is save the data in session and rebind it again on pageindexchanged

7296749
uiview	subviews
i had the same requirement and saw many approaches -- from using layers which ends up very complicated if you just want to deal with a uiview to suggestions that i needed a container to then transition between to subviews

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i can t seem to get the web worker delegation example from to work on google-chrome firefox or safari

7296938
for-loop	arrays
the problem is by the time the ajax requests return the for-loop has been fully iterated over and key is equal to the last key in the arrays

7296944
setinterval	clearinterval
you just have to remember the return value from the original call to setinterval and you can then pass that to clearinterval in order to stop the timer

7296944
setinterval	settimeout
sometimes when you want more control it s easier to not use setinterval but to use settimeout and just repeatedly call settimeout on each successive timer until you want it to stop

7296949
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i don t know about firefox but this hasn t even been implemented in google-chrome or safari yet

7296994
implements	extends
so i noticed this wired spring aop s behavior - if your class implements some interfaces then it will use jdk s proxies to implements them and delegate all calls to target but if class does not implements any interfaces then it will use cglib to extends your class and delegate each method call

7297068

qcheckbox	qpushbutton
qlabel qpushbutton or qcheckbox don t support font changes including text-decoration in the hover pseudo-state css selector

7297147
hash	salt
one easy solution if you re an optimist may be to use a private salt and hash your parameters to make sure requests are coming from code you have distributed

7297158
g++	gcc
note that since foo isn t being referenced in the main path g++ correctly ignores the function entirely but gcc does not

7297203

the typical place to do this is in onpause and onresume

7297313
post	put
i don t know which page those are supposed to go on because the post that contain them from googling don t usually say on which page to put the codes

7297335
int	double
we can think about this as for instance int or double

7297335
int	double
so its type is a function which takes an int double and triples it and ads the two together

7297346
mockito	easymock	easymock	powermockito
however powermockito can be used with either easymock or mockito to mock a static method call

7297356

i can get it to resize smoothing by updating the image s width and height but then the aspect ratio is off

7297379
git-merge	git-rebase
if i m on a branch say working and i want to merge in the changes from another branch say master then i run the command git-merge master while on the working branch and the changes get merged in without git-rebase the history at all

7297396

7297437
ubuntu	debian
i use debian but i guess cron is in the default installation of ubuntu

7297445
put	get
before we get to that question we put on our statistical caps the profiling reports from summaryrprof profr ggplot etc. only reflect the cumulative time spent for a given call or for calls beneath a given call

7297445
profiling	instrumentation
as r doesn t yet have line profiling like python and matlab the simplest way to handle this is to just instrumentation one s code

7297450
udp	tcp
this is almost impossible to do for tcp but can be done for udp

7297451
png	ico
you can t just save it as a png with the ico extension.

7297451
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i m guessing google-chrome opera firefox can t read the file so they decide to open up the file and find out what the actual format is rather than depending on the file extension while ie doesn t

7297457
int	chars
notice the second line where i had to cast back down to chars from int as the addition operation is automatically widened to an int

7297481
addclass	removeclass
the float isn t being added as a class so using addclass or removeclass will have no effect on it

7297481
folder	directory
just copy the image plugin folder from the ckeditor _source plugins directory and put it in the ckeditor plugins directory

7297571
trie	tree
i am implementing a suffix trie this is different from a suffix tree that stores the characters suffixes of strings as nodes in a tree where a string is made up by following traversing the tree until you hit a or you hit the end of your search

7297571
trie	tree
this is homework and it isn t a requirement to make it a compressed suffix trie which is basically a suffix tree

i have a celeron processors and android emulator on eclipse uses 100 of cpu and hangs everything unless i kill it

7297597
min	max
in the following example why does the min query return results but the max query does not

7297615
post	put
given that and the fact that put is idempotent and post is not put seems the logical choice here for both your create and update

7297661
x86	64bit
c program files x86 adobe adobe dreamweaver cs5 configuration 64bit os or c program files adobe adobe dreamweaver cs5 configuration 32 bit os

7297674
filtering	grouping
the having clause is used to filtering grouping of rows

7297674
min	max
you reference min a and max a which in the absence of any group by clause aggregate over all a values in the table but then use a comparison against a single a value

7297716
min	max
that relationship would be many-to-many with team with a min and max value of 2

7297768
matlab	simulink
there is a library for matlab titled hardware input output library for matlab simulink by werner.zimmermann that have some good facilities such that it can make simulink to be run near real- time and it can make connection and send data via tcp ip between two computers but it seems it can just make the connection between two computers running simulink

7297768
matlab	simulink
it also have some constraints for os and version of matlab simulink and is not updated

7297785
button	checkbox
i followed but that wasn t enough for me because i have to handle with checkbox and radio button

postgresql	mysql
to do in postgresql what mysql allows requires a subselect

7297975
int	double
how can i check if a number is a double or int

7297976
mouseover	mouseout
use the jquery .hover method instead of binding mouseover and mouseout

7297976
mouseleave	mouseenter
the .hover is actually binding the mouseenter and mouseleave events which are what you were looking for

7297982
int	double
note that this will view 1.00000000001 as still a double - if these are values which have been computed and so may just be very close to int values you may want to add some tolerance

7297982
int	double
also note that this will start failing for very large int as they can t be exactly represented in double anyway - you may want to consider using bigdecimal instead if you re dealing with a very wide range

7297992
udp	tcp
there is an excellent article about udp and tcp hole punching techniques

7298015
innodb	myisam
are you using the innodb or myisam engine

7298039
salt	md5
so md5 + strong password + average salt is better than usual password + phpass

7298300
vim	emacs
it could be separated from the eclipse ui and it could be run in a separate process with which emacs vim and other editors simply talk to when they need information want to perform intelligent code completion or do some refactoring

7298350
vim	emacs
as a vim lover i can t speak for emacs

7298359
inherited	properties
is it safe to say that static properties and methods can not be inherited in php

7298370
inherited	properties	public	protected
public and protected static methods and properties are inherited as you would expect them to be

7298370

7298404
int	double
all are of same data types which may be short int long double

7298443
inherited	properties
static methods and properties will get inherited the same as non-static methods and properties and obey the same visibility rules

7298443
inherited	properties
incrementing an inherited static properties in the base class will also increment it in all the child classes and vice versa

7298453
post	put
if you have forms then what you should do in your case is to put method post so that the fields don t end up in the url at all in your case

7298514
width	height
cell size of 74 pixels for the height and width of a cell

7298514
width	height
minimum width and height in density-independent pixels dp use this

7298514
width	height
following this formula you should use 72 dp for a height of one cell 294 dp and for a width of four cells

7298518
width	height
as you can read here one cell in height takes 80 pixels and 100 in width so you should change 200 to 160 if you want 2 cells

7298552
rsa	aes
what you can do is use asymmetric cryptography in javascript include javascript encryption code for example rsa not the symmetric aes and a public key in your code

7298621
cvs	svn
note for those who have a svn cvs background and new to git the equivalent of git clone in svn cvs is checkout

7298629
glut	sdl
as a side note i suggest using sdl instead of glut

7298658
for-loop	arrays
however s value changes with each iteration of the for-loop therefore each of your query s parameters would have the last item in the arrays as their value not what you want i m sure

7298658
bindparam	bindvalue
i would suggest using bindvalue instead of bindparam

7298670
gif	png
its working fine but when i click on the btnaddimage the folder will be open with images those have extensions as file type like png and jpeg and gif and jpeg

7298670

7298788
for-loop	loops
i had tried to create a load of nested for loops to go through the collection of players etc and attempt to replace the tags each time but with there being many possibilities of tags i was just creating one nested for-loop within another and it has become unmanageable and also i suspect inefficient since i need to loops through over 1 000 base string like the samples above and replace difference tags with players etc for each one.
