4100150
hash	md5
rob thank you for offering to help and pointing out the difference in the md5 hash

4100150
hash	md5
1 the md5 hash i noticed the hash you pasted in your answer is shorter than the one i was getting but it took me a while to see yours was exactly twice shorter

4100171
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a gridview that displays the contents of a database table using an sqldatasource

4100203
hide	show
once it looks ok checking multiple browsers etc then you can just show hide the div and you won t need to worry about custom positioning it with jquery

4100221
sorting	filtering
you ll probably need to use a standard jtable rather than a swing.table but it can handle all of the sorting and filtering you will ever have to do

4100278
int	boolean
precendence of boolean ops is rather easy if you map it to their corresponding int ops

4100285
post	get
if your post or cookie also set tour_date to an empty string then the request values get overwritten

4100295
subtraction	addition
random-access iterators support addition and subtraction and std vector iterators are random-access

viewdidload	viewwillappear
i never was able to get either tableview scrolltorowatindexpath atscrollposition animated or scrollrecttovisible animated to accomplish this either from the viewcontroller viewwillappear or viewdidload methods

4100311
viewdidload	viewwillappear
note that the workaround method previously only worked when called from viewwillappear and not from viewdidload

4100320

4100373
lisp	scheme
edwin is a variant of emacs which uses scheme instead of emacs lisp

4100373
scheme	racket
you could try plt scheme racket which would let you run scheme code you might have better luck in windows

4100382
width	height
images will tend to look fuzzy if you either place them at non-integer coordinates or set the width height to a non-integer value

4100385
mouseleave	mouseenter
i ve run into a similar problem before and it s caused by the mouse raising a new mouseenter mouseleave event before jquery could process the previous show command

4100385
hide	show
the easiest way to fix the problem is to add a generic command to cause all of your color images to show before running your filter to show hide the color and b w image you re working with

4100385
hide	show	mouseleave	mouseenter
when the mouseenter or mouseleave events fire the script will first show all of the color images and hide all of the b w images

4100385
hide	show
then if it was a mouseenter the script will hide the color image and show the b w image

4100423
fadein	fadeout
then use the jquery fadein and fadeout methods to change the opacity of element b on hover

cassini	iis
cassini runs as your account whoever is logged on iis runs as a service which means some things change quite a bit

4100546
cassini	iis
what i would recommend for anyone wanting something as simple as cassini yet more compatible is to use iis express which supports almost all features from iis yet with a much simplified model suited for development

4100597
ubuntu	linux
have you tried using vlc on a linux machine like ubuntu

4100597
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux and apps seem to be more stable than windows

4100599
cassini	iis
i used to debug like you host the website in iis an then attach the debugger but i ve found using cassini far more productive because of the edit and continue feature which is an absolute godsend

prepare	execute
what i recommend is to prepare standalone script readable only by specified user and execute it from rails with system command with db name as parammeter

4100747
128bit	64bit
for example if the largest integer type of your platform is a 64bit type then at assembly level on your machine you have access to mul operation producing the correct 128bit result

4100749
width	height
if there is no special reason for having the relativelayout s width and height to wrap to it s content i d say specify it like that

4100782

folder	directory
i can t have php create the files folder itself because it doesn t have access to write to the root directory either

chgrp	chmod
you could chgrp the files to the web server s group or php s if it s set up to run as its own user and chmod 770 them

4100899
folder	directory
have the users chmod 777 the root directory have your script create the new folder and then have them restore the root directory s permissions

4100995
stopwatch	timertask
i am trying to create a stopwatch in c++ something similar to java s timertask

4101017
treemap	treeset
you might be able to do this by doing some fancy stuff with subclassing the treemap and wrapping the treeset s that are added to it but it would be quite challenging to make it all work properly i think

4101020
versioning	upgrade
the problem i have is that the upgrade path from 1.0 to 1.0.3 is not working but only if i add 1.0.2 to the previous versioning list

4101020

if i remove 1.0.2 from the previous versioning the 1.0-- 1.0.3 upgrade path works perfectly

4101040
entity-relationship	diagram
i have the following entity-relationship diagram below that outlines my table structure

4101059

4101063
google-chrome	firefox
for me the text is white in both firefox and google-chrome so i m pretty sure there is some issue with another part of the css the pseudo selectors on the link element

i ve tested in google-chrome and firefox on linux and windows and the results are always the same

4101071

assuming you want to initialize your bit-field to zero calloc might be preferable to malloc

4101184
crossover	mutation
the other two ways that new members of the population are usually referred to as mutation and crossover

4101215
temp	tmp
whats the difference between the two types of temp tables tmp vs #tmp in sql 2005

4101230

vs2010 supports iis mode pretty well plus you get the advantage of being able to test web.config properly since cassini doesn t support system.webserver portion

4101231
onchange	onkeyup
there is no onchange event but there is an onkeyup event

4101240
temp	tmp
tmp refers to a variable of type table stored in memory whereas #tmp refers to a table in the temp database

4101257
post	get
how do i get post data to bind with the parent s model object

4101280
keydown	keyup
you could listen for keydown keypress or keyup events but remember to add a timeout to make sure that their last keypress has been taken into consideration as their last press may have been the backspace key

4101319
ubuntu	linux
for example compiling a program on 32-bit linux wont run on 64 bit windows but if you compile a program on ubuntu and then put it on another ubuntu machine it should run fine

4101352
ilist	iqueryable
you re also returning an iqueryable when your method clearly says it gives back an ilist

4101352
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
whether you really need an ilist or if you can get away with a concrete list which is also ienumerable and iqueryable and thus allows for easier further manipulation is a topic for another discussion but understand that ilists as ilists cannot be iterated

4101370
sorting	grouping
# my understanding is that mapreduce applies to large dataset for sorting analytics grouping counting aggregation etc is my understading correct

4101407
min	max
those methods seem to match the operators you can use with collections sum min max distinctunionofobjects etc

4101433
lisp	scheme
the one that comes to my mind is scheme lisp

4101468
ssl	https
if you re using https ssl and please do for anything that needs to be secure then yes an ajax request is no more or less safe than a full postback to the server

4101501
oncreate	onstart
onrestoreinstancestate is called after onstart whereas oncreate is called before onstart

4101522
keydown	keyup
we then create another array that stores all the keys that are being pressed keydown add the item keyup removes it

4101575
queue	fifo
in windows it s fifo queue at each priority level and a thread

4101595
subtract	add
if the sortid values are always continuous you don t remove records which would cause a gap then you can just add or subtract one to get the next or previous record

4101642
voip	sip
voipcore is just an old version of abto voip sip sdk from voipsipsdk.com so that may be a better choice

4101667

4101691
rss	feed
bbc basic rss feed reader

4101707
post	get
now the problem is the list is not being passed over correctly...i am doing a get here and cannot post the data...so now i know it has to some how pass it like ...so how can achieve this...i found this but are there other alternatives

4101714
128bit	64bit	16-bit	64bit
so i would prefer choice b since it scales with whatever system you re running 16-bit 32-bit 64bit maybe even in the future 128bit but that kind of effort may not be necessary for you

4101742
post	get
this request has both get and post values

4101742
post	get
the script on the other end of this is php and expects certain values to be in the get and others to be in the post

4101765
filtering	grouping
here s an example where i m trying filtering out a grouping

4101773
post	get
for example if you wanted to send a get request with username fred to www.example.com index.php you would send a simple get request to so to answer your question just use the post method but have the url contain your get data

4101867
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this works perfectly with firefox opera and ie but safari doesn t seem to see the hashtag for the anchor in the link

see migrating from nunit to mstest

4101925
nunit	mstest
mstest nunit wins for unit testing

expression-blend	silverlight
in order to create and use behaviors you need to download and install the expression-blend sdk for silverlight 4 and add a reference to system.windows.interactivity.dll

4101950
stringbuilder	stringwriter
you have to use the read methods of the inputstream and append the bytes to a new string using a stringbuilder or a stringwriter

4101993
put	get
that doesn t make the original their copyright but if the original is a piece of software and all the fixes get put into the new copyright version that won t matter too much

4102048
wmv	asf
for asf wmv your only cross-platform option right now is probably silverlight

4102048
google-chrome	firefox
silverlight works in ie firefox google-chrome and on pc mac s

4102048
mp3	wmv
access to licensed media codecs mp3 wmv vc-1 is provided by microsoft to moonlight 1.0 and 2.0 users

4102056

you may need to set up an onreadystatechange event for ie instead of the onload event

4102073
int	chars
where that int is 174 chars long

4102096
hide	show
for example say you have a document with a ruler view that can be hidden show via show rulers off state and hide rulers on state menu items

4102168
int	chars
in c++ language byte is synonymous with chars type which is simply an ordinary int type that can be signed or unsigned

on sunos 5.11 based oses eg opensolaris solaris 11 express ... you can just use the file event notification framework

4102219
simplecursoradapter	convertview
i know that for regular arrayadapters you can check convertview for null and inflate if null from the xml and if not null recycle but i m having a little trouble visualizing how that works with the from and to arrays within the simplecursoradapter subclass

4102237
int	double
4 bytes for int 8 for double

4102265
multiplying	multiplication
the other key to notice is that your cpu is much faster at multiplying ints and longs than you are by doing long multiplication in java

4102280
mousemove	keydown	mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	keydown	keyup	keydown	mousedown	keydown	mouseup	keyup	mousedown	keyup	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown

4102412
maven	pom.xml	children	parent
as far as the philosophy goes the assembly plugin is there to help you build custom artifacts and in maven each project should produce one main artifact not counting sources classifiers etc. so if multiple children need to use the assembly plugin you would only put what is common to all of them in the parent pom.xml

4102420
heapsort	shellsort
bubble sort comb sort selection sort insertion sort heapsort shellsort

4102448
subtract	add
add or subtract a fixed value

if you are only trying to hide the strings then you could just try compressing your executable with something like upx

4102507
post	get
post can be substitued with get if necessary or even cookie or request although you probably want to be more sure what you are getting

4102517
internationalization	localization
the long answer is to read apple s internationalization documentation understand how resource look-up interacts with localization directories within the bundle structure get familiar with nslocalizedstring and its relatives and play around with some .strings files and changing your system language around in order to get a feel for how what you re doing will affect the end-user

4102517
internationalization	localization
when it comes to localizing information contained in xibs you should read wil shipley s article lost in translations. you might also want to look at how open source cocoa projects such as growl and adium handle internationalization and localization

4102575
distance	mercator
if you wish to work with projected linear distance then you will need to use the mercator projection

4102578
post	get
i m trying to get it to do a plain http post of the file to a url with the filename as a parameter

4102615
ssl	https
however the wide availability of ssl tls stacks on various languages platforms os makes it rather convenient for many applications to protect the communication between the client and the server via https

4102616
int	double
they are easy to code in java and should be fast enough if you ask me you d just have to change filter double samples int count to filter double samples int count i guess

4102617
implements	extends
i m trying to get the line number of a domelement object in php - the documentation says domelement extends domnode which implements the getlineno method however when i try to use this method i get

4102627

i came across this question and was curious under what real life situations you would actually want to use a stack from multiple threads as opposed to a fifo queue or a priority queue

4102669
xsl-fo	xslt
here s an example of an xml file xslt stylesheet and the resulting xsl-fo

4102694
folder	directory
pbhrenamesync can be used to rename a file directory or volume. however it is marked as deprecated and replaced by pbrenameunicodesync . naturally pbrenameunicodesync is documented as renames a file or folder which hardly makes it a viable replacement

4102730
oncreate	onnewintent
you need to be prepared to handle the intent in oncreate and onnewintent

4102773
ati	nvidia
i was just set to purchase a nvidia gtx 470 when i saw some statistics regarding ati which i didn t know

4102810
userid	usergroups
it s also worth noting that you may not need all the relationships you would define in sql - for example if you have a group containing a million users the ability to get a list of all users in a group is completely useless so you would never create the groupsuser list at all and rather than a seperate usergroups list have userid groups as a multivalue property

4102810
userid	usergroups
if you just need to check for membership you could set up keys as usergroups userid groupid and get constant time lookup

4102831
put	get
you cannot expect to get the same format html out of the dom serialised from that as you put in

4102851
realloc	malloc
you can code around c-style strings using asprintf if your system provides it else some hackery with sprintf and or snprintf malloc realloc etc and use smart-pointers to get the exception-safe and automatic memory deallocation but it s still clumsy

4102875
mouseover	mouseleave
what about this code causes the mouseover event to fire when the mouse is just leaving the expanded div and why it only happens as the mouseleave via the bottom edge

4102875
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
behaviour observed in osx google-chrome firefox safari

4102916
try-catch	exception-handling
but i would consider this one to be a not too good practice to employ it of course using those provided by api like the int32 one to avoid try-catch is exception-handling

4102923
udp	tcp
first i would check that you can access ports tcp 1433 and udp 1434 on that server you need also the udp port since you are using the sqlexpress instance in the server

4102982
asp.net-mvc	openrasta
is there any way to tell openrasta to explicitly map url routes to certain methods like in asp.net asp.net-mvc

4103090
affinity	processors
if you have a multi core processors you can set the affinity on each process to only use which cores you want it to use

not sure about artifactory but in nexus other maven repository manager it s certainly possible

4103310

4103390
fgetc	fread
as others have also said rather than calling fread or fgetc over and over again on tiny units you should fread large chunks 1-4k at a time into fixed-size buffer and run your parser over that reading a new chunk whenever you reach the end

4103408
rss	feed
i m trying to write a rss feed for a website which mostly has russian articles though sometimes english

4103410
hash	salt
however you could and should change your code to at least not send the credentials in plain text but at least hash them with a hash salt generated by your web service at the beginning of the current session and put in a cookie for example

4103410
hash	salt
since the cookies are not logged on the server and the hash salt changes between sessions there is no way for someone tonextract the credentials from the log file only

4103431
performselector	delegation
for an indeterminate indicator i send the startanimation message in the menu s menuwillopen delegation method using performselector .

4103450

4103629
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
the vanilla jdk doesn t have any method to do that you ll have to do it yourself by using fileinputstream fileoutputstream

4103631
int	chars
the goal is essentially to split the int into 8-bit segments then take each of those segments and get the corresponding ascii chars for that chunk then glue the chunks together

norton	mcafee
firewalls include mcafee norton windows firewall which ships with windows xp sp2 and internet connection firewall icf which ships with windows 2000

4108235
postgresql	mysql
a quick search indicates there s a datediff function in mysql but the syntax may be slightly different in postgresql so you may have to create your own function there

4108236
outputstream	inputstream
i m using the following code to close an inputstream and an outputstream from a connection to a server

4108241
folder	directory
typically files in a library directory would be included by files in the public web folder

4108251
super	self
instead the trick is to call super car self ._setspatials

4108272
pop-up	dialog
what s even worse is that getopenfilename pop-up an open dialog that looks like the one in windows 95 at least when you try to customize the dialog with the lpofnhookproc feature on vista or windows 7

4108291
entities	entitymanager
is it good practice to use entitymanager inside entities

4108299
punctuation	words
in this case you would want your expression to allow non-english characters since you don t want to split a words but you might be able to remove all punctuation marks that aren t inside of a quote-delimited phrase

4108300
getter	setter
is it possible to use obsolete attribute on only a getter or a setter of a property

4108328
multiplying	add	cos	sin	cos	atan2	atan2	sin
just like this link 1 20 i have already know some procedure heading atan2 sin lon2-lon1 cos lat2 cos lat1 sin lat2 - sin lat1 cos lat2 cos lon2-lon1 then multiplying by 180 ï then add 360 such as

4108328
cos	sin
cllocationdegrees ycomponent sin deltalong cos coord2.latitude

4108328
cos	sin
cllocationdegrees xcomponent cos coord1.latitude sin coord2.latitude - sin coord1.latitude cos coord2.latitude cos deltalong

4108457
post	put
there s got to be a post or put request around somewhere in the open graph api

4108465
inherited	subclassing
abstract classes from which subclassing can inherited code and behavior but not table structure

4108465
inherited	subclassing
you could implement a #path attribute on content using attr_accessor and it would be inherited by subclassing but it would not be persisted to the database unless the table for your model subclassing had a path column

4108465
inherited	subclassing
single table inherited where subclassing inherited both behavior and table persistence

4108521
children	parent
parent is a type with two children childa and childb

4108556
pull	push
i am doing push and pull of the concerned registers before going and after coming from these c functions

4108569

if i have a typedef of a struct

4108594
draggable	droppable
i have a draggable that is being dropped on an isometric grid of droppable that overlap

4108604
comparator	comparable
java what is the difference between implementing comparable and comparator

4108604
comparator	comparable
what are the keys differences between comparable and comparator

4108684
getter	setter
i can t see any other reason it would throw nullreferenceexception - although it would really help you could clarify whether you were calling the getter or the setter at the time it threw the exception

4108688
pull	push
as some answers already pointed out branches named or anonymous are usually more convenient than two clones because you don t have to pull push

4108696
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in firefox google-chrome and safari the behavior works as expected the div overlays all the html elements below it

4108764
comparator	comparable
when your class implements comparable the comparator method of the class is defining the natural ordering of that object

4108764
comparator	comparable
in general implement comparable for natural order natural order definition is obviously open to interpretation and write a comparator for other sorting or comparison needs

4108816
postgresql	mysql
supports postgresql mysql

4108844
yslow	pagespeed
pagespeed extension and yslow extension are both very helpful to understand what should be optimized

4108899
apache	nginx
are they running a http server in front of resin apache nginx

4108906
min	max
the isindeterminate property just means that the progressbar doesn t have a min or max value but continually scrolls

4108948
getter	setter
i have setter getter on one of my class properties i noticed that i must add set in front of the setter name else the compiler says that there is no setter

4108949
min	max
using the min and max of the sample you can then create another array to count how many sampled elements are in each bins a reasonable rule of thumb is that you should have sqrt n bins if you have n samples

4108970
int	double
i want to create a very generic utility method to take any collection and convert it into a collection of a user selectable class that extends from number long double float int etc.

4108976
range	infinity
a random variable following normal distribution can theoretically take values in the range -infinity infinity

4108981

4108983
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox and opera render the image button ok but in google-chrome and safari i get that grey border around it

4109027
post	get
i ve been using these two post to try and get the encryption of the key right but i m still having trouble

4109037
accessor	properties
according to the rules defined around attribute targets there doesn t appear to be any reason that the obsolete attribute would not be valid on a properties get or set accessor

4109037
accessor	properties
in order to apply an attribute to a properties set accessor that attribute must be applicable to either a method parameter or return value target

4109037
accessor	properties
in fact you can define your own attribute with the same valid targets as the obsolete attribute with the attributeusage attribute and you ll find that you can apply it to a properties get or set accessor whereas you cannot apply the obsolete attribute

4109037
accessor	properties
if you try creating your own attribute that is not valid on a properties set accessor and you apply it there then you may notice the error message is slightly different

4109074
post	get	post	put	put	get
i see it s possible to implement index get post put delete for the api then implement new and edit actions for the web in the same controller

4109079
hash	md5
md5 is designed to uniformaly spread the input over all the output bytes so it s as good as any other general hash function - sounds like a bit of overkill if you only want 256 values

4109102
hash	md5
i m not certain specifically how expensive md5 is relative to others but there are plenty of better ways to create a small hash see this article for some algorithm ideas

4109107
int	double
read the int and double directly from it using

4109130
post	get
if the number of fields on the view is dynamic and you get an x number of employees back then you would have to iterate through the post collection to bind them to your viewmodel

4109136
pull	push
when i do git pull it automatically fetches and merges changes from test to myname_test but for git push i need to specify the repo and branch name

4109184
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
about the only thing i would definitely say to do is to make sure to use try catch finally try finally or wrap sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader within using s

4109284
gridview	formview
i have a gridview object and a formview object

4109284
gridview	formview
when the gridview is clicked the formview is populated

4109304
google-chrome	firefox
use firefox with the firebug extension or google-chrome to debug dynamic pages using the right-click inspect element feature

4109305
profiling	instrumentation
you then instrumentation and overwrite your app using build in the profiling - also fine

4109309
width	height
i often find that i need to find the width or height of a part of a non-client area sizeable tool window border width for instance and i have never come across a complete diagram of what part is what

4109323
jtextpane	jeditorpane
is there an easy way to display xml data to a user via an jeditorpane or jtextpane in colored highlighted way

4109340
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and ie are aligned while firefox will have a 2 pixel variance between .buttonl and .buttonr

4109348
division	multiplication
mod is a division operation not a multiplication operation

4109348
division	multiplication
division is more expensive than multiplication

4109368
division	multiplication
yes mod is more expensive than multiplication as it is implemented through division

4109390
google-chrome	firefox
this code works perfectly in ie7 ie8 firefox and google-chrome

4109423
inherited	subclassing
2 the major reason why people use protected inherited is that the expected subclassing is not a subclassing of the base for example car is not a subclassing of engine

4109424
cdr	cons
so now to explain the behaviour you see in the lisp family of languages cons a b creates a pair containing a as it s car and b as its cdr

4109449
implements	extends
then you would use a partial file class to extends the category class to implements the comparison logic

4109454
width	height
when i call it on an img element that has a specific width and height that is not the actual width and height of the source image . the rotation is applied accurately however it resets the width and height to match the source image

4109473
public	protected
- the major reason people want this is to hide public protected members of base from clients of subclass

4109473
inherited	subclassing
contrast this with private inherited which hides base completely from subclassing and clients of subclassing - this would also meet your criteria in the last sentence of 2 but disallow any other external use of base via subclassing

4109483
google-chrome	firefox
as i stated i want to use firefox or google-chrome and i m on linux

4109505
width	height
the png specification doesn t appear to place any limits on the width and height of an image

4109559
versioning	upgrade
it s for any type of settings but it s better to put local settings in a separate file so that versioning upgrade don t clobber them

4109606
getter	setter
i have debbuged and see that the getter and the setter of the atribute are accesed twice why i dont know

4109616
division	multiplication
algorithms processors execute the division and the multiplication by algorithms implemented in gates for division are more costly than for multiplication

4109616
division	multiplication
as a matter of fact some algorithms for division which have a good complexity are using the multiplication as a basic step

4109625
width	height
now i can understand why this is happening the lines actually go one unit beyond the width and height of the grid causing the grid to expand by one unit then there s a relayout the data binding causes the lines to redraw ad infinitum

4109625
put	get	width	height
so to try and deal with this i decided to put a in the grid but then no matter what i do with horizontalalignment and verticalalignment i end up with both the canvas and the grid having zero width and height which means i don t get my cross which is massively irritating

4109625
actualheight	actualwidth
if i bind to the actualwidth and actualheight properties of the button i just end up with an x that has the top-left corner centred on the centre of the button

4109668
apache	nginx
i currently have one server with nginx that reverse_proxy to apache same server for processing php requests

4109668
apache	nginx
i m wondering if i drop apache so i d run nginx fastcgi to php if i d see any sort of performance increases

4109675
range	max
is there a way to get the max number of user filled cells in an excel sheet without passing a range or iterating through max cells per excel spreadsheet

4109713
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
even if the alert is present the sample doesn t work in google-chrome safari opera

4109716
apache	lighttpd
you could try looking into the documentation of the various web servers apache iis lighttpd nginx.

4109724
firefox	safari
why the following script work on ie and safari but not in firefox

4109743
hgrc	hgignore
you can use a different file name for hgignore or more accurately have no hgignore and then use an line in your hg hgrc file to reference an additional ignore file with whatever name you want

4109764
post	get
for http this is usually a get or post request which is responded to by the server appropriately

4109767
width	height
you need to get the size of your object first and then set the width and height that you wish to use with something like this at the beginning of the plugin

4109782
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the innertext property does not work on firefox that property is ie-specific although iirc is supported by opera google-chrome

4109853
int	double
note that tselapsed.totalseconds is a double not an int

4109864
agile	sprint
if i had 36 months of development time to spend i would spend 3-6 months writing a wrapper api and then replace each unit tested i o pair with new code every 7-10 days utilizing sprint scrum agile

4109895
udp	tcp
when people refer to socket communication these days they re typically using tcp or udp

4109895
udp	tcp
if you d like to learn more of the fine details on socket communication i would start with udp because it s a simpler protocol and then move on to tcp

4109965
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
after all you used an autoresetevent not a manualresetevent

4109994
rss	feed
i browsed through my rss feed and grabbed out this selection

4109998
apache	nginx
nginx will definitely work faster than apache

4110031
google-chrome	safari
the issue came up with google-chrome safari and ie where the header which i was checking in php via wasn t matching

4110072
x86	64bit
currently compiling for x86 32-bit cpu with thought that 64bit system would use wow64 to use it

4110138
folder	directory
if you try to hit the maven2 folder on your project website sourceforge kindly tell you that directory listing is off by default and how to fix it

4110189
submit	submission
a web browser will never submit form data as utf-16 even if the form that generated the submission was on a utf-16-encoded page

4110216
many-to-one	one-to-many
if you need some sort of constraint many-to-one one-to-many then change your index types to unique etc

4110217
int	double
here the original class contains an int and double

4110292
allocator	stl
however after reading a bit i found this little bomb about the stl c++ standard see references saying that all allocator instances of a given type should be equivalent that is that should return true for any two instances and most terminal

4110306
xslt	xquery
how can i pass the resulting xml page from xquery call to xslt for templating

4110306
xslt	xquery
-- update i understand now that difference between xquery and xslt is a difference in point of view since two different working groups are maintaining them both will do the job though in different approaches

4110317
rss	feed
the reason for the structure of these classes is that i am building a rss reader and i intend to have these two classes hold data on the feed

4110329
int	double
basically i need to read a text file that contains string int and double datatypes

4110329
spaces	delimiter
the decimal number are the sales of that product in millions of dollars delimiter by a white spaces

4110329
int	double
i know how to read in all int all double or all strings but what is the best way to go about it if they are all different

4110400
rss	feed
if you finish this project too soon and don t know what to do with your time you can implement a pop3 proxy so that you can access arbitrary sources of data like it were an email account for example news sites rss feed

4110428
client-side	server-side
i suggest you to generate your client-side control on the server-side under such conditions

4110437
width	height
is there a standard set for the number of rows and columns width and height that are displayed in a standard console window

4110443
freebsd	linux
the answer is epoll if you re using linux kqueue if you re using freebsd or mac os x and i o completion ports if you re on windows

4110443
udp	tcp
additionally it is important to note that udp does not have connections as opposed to tcp

4110449
folder	directory
an easy way to pack up your lib jars into your project so that subversion just handles it so you can grab it out with all the attached libraries ready to compile and go is to include them all under your project directory via the shared libraries option by managing the libraries folder

4110463
qlist	qvector
just a brief qlist intro qlist is similar to qvector and stl vector but in addition it also reserves some space at the beginning

4110463
boost	stl
i am looking for something similar in stl if not atleast boost

4110487
folder	directory
every time i rebuild my project which is huge i have to drill down into the windows ms.net framework v4 temp root random directory...wherein i must open up each of the 50-some randomly named directory in there that hold the built dll s and i must copy the pdb files from my project s bin debug directory to each respective dll folder

4110531
apache	nginx
this may have been corrected recently but all my research says that nginx and apache can t host websockets at the moment

4110536
mvp	presenter
it s my belief that the presenter is the one responsible for handling the navigation aspect of a mvp application

4110601
.htaccess	httpd.conf
on apache you can do this in an httpd.conf section or .htaccess using mod_headers and this syntax

4110616
post	get
i d suggest making a single script file that includes the standard classes sets any standard constants paths sanitize get post etc

4110668
uitableview	nsindexpath
void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

4110696
getter	setter
so much of what you re doing can be handled with real getter setter

4110713
uitableview	reloaddata
when the user taps the done button on the keyboard call -resignfirstresponder on the text field to dismiss the keyboard then update your table view s data source object this is the object you ve assigned to the uitableview s datasource property with the string from the text field s text property and remove the uitextfield from your table cell and reload the table s data by calling its reloaddata method

4110715
hide	show
if i am working with php and i am iterating through few items and each item has his content to show hide i cannot set static ids to my divs because script just won t work

4110728
allocator	stl
looking at the source gcc s vector implementation which i think is based eventually on sgi s original stl implementation does sort-of store a copy of the allocator object passed into that constructor so there s some hope that this won t happen

4110740
post	get
if you call the facebook graph api to get your news feed how do you get the list of photos for a post of type photo

4110740
post	get
i d like to know how to get an array of urls for all the photos in the post

4110745
getter	setter
they are not a substitute for proper getter and setter

4110767
free	malloc
can you use the free function without having to prior call a malloc

4110794
mouseleave	mouseenter
for previous question since the popup is over top of the element use the mouseenter on the trigger mouseleave on the popup like this

4110837
free	malloc
but bad things will happen if the pointer wasn t originally returned by malloc 3 and never previously given back to free 3

4110935
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu i m sure has packages called debhelp and dhtml which presents a web-based search interface including boolean search and can be used to index all of the documents in usr share doc -- pdfs html ps and more as well as man pages texinfo documents etc

4110964
strcpy	strncpy
is there any golden rule like the one with buffer overflow ie use the n version of functions strncpy instead strcpy

4110979
calloc	malloc
if the memory pointed to was not allocated by a heap allocation function such as malloc or calloc then the data preceeding the block will be meaningless as heap management data

4110979
free	malloc
all it knows is that malloc returns a void and that free accepts a void

4110999
getter	setter
ditto for private variables with no getter or setter

4111015
fortran	ada	ada	pascal
ada pascal assembly fortran etc etc

4111049
button	checkbox
button sliders checkbox radiobox etc clear this global variable

4111055
children	parent
you could iterate over all the children of the parent control compare their name to the name you want to find the control you want

4111069
oncreate	setcontentview
now to make you understand why your imageview wasn t displayed when declaring it the way you initially tired by creating a new object because you most likely had the setcontentview methods parameter in your oncreate method set to r.layout.main your main.xml file containing your layout

4111075
hash	salt
the salt you use is supposed to be a random value stored alongside the hash result

4111141
width	height
if you don t set the width and height of the ellipse and border they will size with the window automatically

4111141
width	height
instead use a grid to set the relative size of the controls using row height and column width percentages eg

4111160
put	get
specifically for a c# windows forms application where would it be appropriate to put my icon resources and what is the path for referencing them once i get them in the correct place

4111167
hide	show
i m using jquery script to show hide some content

4111167
hide	show
since i m using php i am iterating through few items and each of them has a button to show hide its content

4111180
mvp	presenter
if you follow the mvp model i think this validation logic would live in your presenter

4111196
idictionary	ilist
system.web.mvc.controlleractioninvoker.invokeactionmethodwithfilters controllercontext controllercontext ilist 1 filters actiondescriptor actiondescriptor idictionary 2 parameters +305

4111200
mouseleave	mouseenter
you need to use the mouseenter and mouseleave events which .hover uses directly when binding with an object like this

4111200
mouseleave	mouseenter
.hover is defined specially here in the jquery event code...it simply isn t supported like other events in places like .bind since it s not an event it s just a function to help you bind the mouseenter and mouseleave events

4111201
post	get
im in the exact same situation...i came across this post with in interesting comment further down although i couldn t quite get it to work

4111202
int	chars
types bool chars char16_t char32_t wchar_t and the signed and unsigned int types are collectively called integral types

4111216
webrat	cucumber
if your image is identifiable on the page by a css id you should be able to accomplish this using cucumber webrat and or cucumber selenium the latter if you also want to test javascript in the page

4111339
post	get
using ssl to post the data through your own domain and you proxying to the other seems like a better option if it s possible so you re not providing data using get at any point

4111356
uitableview	uisearchbar
i had my uisearchbar side-by-side with my uitableview in my xib file and was adding it as a subview of the table view in code

4111358
codeigniter	cakephp
i already have a method which is just to implode the route and use the array for the function arguments but i would really like to know how to do it like in codeigniter or cakephp

4111369
implements	extends
aside from the rare case of classes which provide the same method but aren t related nor do implements a common interface for example the close method -- source for one does not extends closeable i find no use for structural types with their present restriction

4111406
config	ini
after proper config of ini

4111470
pull	push
i m successfully using mongomapper s built-in support for atomic push and set but can t figure out pull

4111509
width	height
so the problem with your example seems to be the min height width

4111509
width	height
if you can t just use height width i d suggest something like the following

4111530
min	max
i know this is a simple min max type thing that you do a thousand times in lower programming classes

4111538
hide	show
if you need another element above this say a that hide and show appropriately when there are aren t errors add a errorcontainer #somediv option as well

4111563
cpu	processors
and these tests have been run on my machine running the latest gcc and an amd athlon tm 64 x2 dual core processors 4000+ cpu

4111572
nfa	dfa
as constantin says dfa and nfa can be represented as dags

4111574
rdiff-backup	unison
unison doesn t preserve history so if you want that you should schedule rdiff-backup to run every day on one of your hosts preferably whichever one has the largest most reliable hard drive

4111574
pull	push
in my head i ve designed a little python or ruby system tray process to watch your repo for changes nag you when it s dirty have options for autocommit after a period of no changes and also do auto push pull

4111614
spaces	delimiter
how can i formulate this so that it will pick up and delimiter with potential spaces but also properly encoded urls without delimiter

4111633
typedef	struct
you can simulate a class with private members by defining a struct inside the source file and providing only a typedef and a set of functions to your users

4111636
sorting	filtering
also for more complicated sorting and filtering try

4111645
maven	pom.xml
the only artifact i had thought was being produced by the pom.xml i was working with was a .war but you ll notice in the log that the artifact which maven is attempting to deploy to the release is actually a .jar

4111654
pull	push
they will need to pull from the main repos make changes and then resolve conflict if they want to push

4111676
google-chrome	firefox
it it supported by all major browsers firefox 3.6 ie8 google-chrome other webkit-based browsers but i d still highly suggest to use a library which handles the event for you - by using a timer in browsers not supporting the html5 event and using the event otherwise

4111694
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
my current application consists of a uitabbarcontroller with 4 different tabs and a uiviewcontroller

4111695
width	height
this could happen if your fft size is much larger than the height of the drawing area or the number of spectral lines is a lot more than its width

getter	setter
if you don t synthesize the object it won t make getter and setter for you so that may be why setting the rightbarbuttonitem isn t working as there is no getter for the toggle barbuttonitem so you re setting it to nil

4111721
pull	push
one is a pull one is a push

4111743
post	get
i get a proper response but it doesn t send me to the post data page just redirects back to the top of the page due to the anchor

4111743
post	get
right now probably going to go with a hidden field and then do a .submit but wondering if there s an easier way to get the page since the post could be done properly

4111756
post	get	post	put	put	get
when i really thought about that there are only 4 i know there are some more http verbs - post get put delete - i felt it couldn t create powerful restful apis cause they are limiting the api to basic crud operations

4111756
put	get
cause get and put are verbs that could be replaced with create a read and create a change

4111756
post	get	post	put	put	get
but if that is correct then this mean that http restful api could be used to create anything in the right way not by hacking it with modified versions putting the verbs in the uri request body etc but only using post get put delete

radgrid	linqdatasource
hi i m using a linqdatasource with a radgrid

4111772
post	get	post	put	put	get
get post put and delete do not directly relate to create read update and delete

4111772
post	put
they often can but it is important to note that post and put can both perform update and create functionality

4111772
post	get	post	put	put	get
this means that post should be used for any function that changes server data state and get put and delete should be used for any functions that do not change server state

4111787
pull	push
you can always push and pull a single revision and all of it ancestors using

4111801
post	get
you can create any system using only two methods get and post by equating get read and post write

4111806
width	height
what tricks can i use to make it easy for someone reading the output to quickly figure out if the coordinates are a x y width height vs

4111806
width	height
a format i ve seen before is something like +100 +300 500 500 on x11 where the + - are meant to imply that the first two digits are x y since width height cannot be negative values where as with left top right bottoms any of the values can be either positive or negative

4111810
punctuation	words
it reads two words from command line ignores spaces and punctuation and determines if they are anagrams

4111904
width	height
my workaround is to set the iframe the height width well over any anticipated source page size in css the background property to transparent

4111904
firefox	safari
it works in ie8 firefox 3 safari

4111931
put	get
the php works fine when i access it directly and put the get parameters in the url but for some reason it won t validate properly and thus won t let the form submit

4111981
post	get	post	put	put	get
this means that you really don t need custom verbs standard interfaces are usually better anyway because you can get everything done using get put post and delete

4111990
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in firefox and google-chrome and i ve had two other people test this on different pcs running ie8 and they have the same problem

4112022

instead of making it private public or protected

4112151
centos	linux
i m fairly new to linux centos in this case

4112155
stdout	stderr
you can read from stdout or stderr synchronously or asynchronously

4112198
int	chars
ord returns the int ordinal of a one chars string

4112198
ord	chr
so you can t do a chr sequence or an ord sequence

unix	bsd
and then there s always the option of running bsd unix linux-based tools in os x as well as windows programs if you have an intel-based mac

4112316
int	double
i ve been working on a class assignment for c++ and we re required to acquire input from a text file and assign those values to an array....one is a string the second an int and the third a double

4112320
getter	setter
have a look at com.thornglatch.pingo.usercontroller line 25 and check that the name you re accessing has a setter and getter or it is a public field in com.thornglatch.pingo.user

4112324

4112347
oncreate	ondestroy
put some log.i created destroyed in your oncreate and ondestroy to see this

4112361
int	double
if i understand correctly you merely have three values in a file a string an int and a double

4112393
google-chrome	firefox
greasemonkey is a firefox plugin but google-chrome also has native support for user scripts the language is slightly different but most greasemonkey user scripts will work in google-chrome

i m writing an sdl opengl program in gentoo linux nvidia drivers 195.36.31 on geforce go 6150

4112446
wadl	wsdl
the web application description language wadl is basically the equivalent to wsdl for restful services but there s been an ongoing controversy whether something like this is needed at all

4112448
width	height
isn t there a constant width and height for a4 size for printing

4112456
width	height
off course a4 size has fixed width and height

4112464
mouse	keyboard
in this state i m unable to move the mouse the system just steals the cursor back and i m unable to quit instruments since when i hit cmd+q i m prompted to save the document which i can t do because i have no control of the keyboard or mouse

4112470
stdout	stderr
i need to start a process and receive 2 or 3 handles for stdin stdout and stderr so i can write input to the process and receive its output the same way command line pipes behave grep

4112483
folder	directory
my solution that is not working was to add 2 subdirectories to my classes folder in my project directory - one for each target

4112520
gif	png
prefered formats for output would be png gif would be acceptable jpg will probably not work due to compression and lack of transparency as in png and gif

4112526
post	get
if you want to do it using post run a few with get and then this article is useful

4112582
opera	firefox
other browsers at least opera and firefox do not show such a behavior

4112619
integer	unsigned
consider the following array of bytes that is intended to be converted into a single unsigned integer

4112631
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if you test the above-stated code in browsers other than opera tested on v9.62 it works like a charm i have tested in safari firefox google-chrome

4112633
getter	setter
you are using self.bannerisvisible but i can t see neither a synthesize for this nor setter and getter

4112663
google-chrome	firefox
in every browser i tested google-chrome firefox and ie no not even when wrapped in a parent element that has the cursor property

4112707
post	get
if you use the post method in the form you get the name of the button in the form collection otherwise you get it in the querystring collection

4112714
jdk1.6	jdk1.5
also you may have changed the location of your jdk which could be leading to incompatibilities between jdk1.5 and jdk1.6 at compile time

4112723
libpcap	wireshark
see this q a from wireshark which is essentially a gui to libpcap for possible workarounds

4112742
getter	setter
you should not be using the names in the getter and setter attributes on the property declaration with dot syntax

4112856
udp	tcp
pluvius ident-scan by dave goldsmith and the satan tcp udp scanners by

4112863
post	get
here is the checkboxes i want to get checkbox values base on name as businesstype in controller using post menthod

4112864
inherited	properties
the whole point of objects is that they can inherited from parent objects implement interfaces and be passed as arguments - static members have none of these properties so they aren t truly object-oriented they re little more than a namespace

4112896
stdout	stderr
can i redirect from within r stderr to stdout

4112904
pop-up	dialog
i also have who of these did you mean and i want a pop-up dialog for this too where you can select one of the names you ment

4112918

test resources aren t packaged in the final package be it jar war ear

4112931
stdout	stderr
i would like to invoke a script from my perl code and capture its stderr and stdout combined together

4112944
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stderr file descriptor 2 to stdout file descriptor 1 with

4112978
google-chrome	firefox
i find that there is an annoying horizontal scrollbar that appears only on firefox not ie or google-chrome when i use iframes and content that is too big to fit within the width of the iframe

4113012
put	get
now my question what is the best place to put my groupheaderstyle and how to get it via

4113020
button	checkbox
if only one of these checkbox can be selected at a time you should use a group of radio button instead

4113020
button	checkbox
to get the value of the checkbox or radio button group use

4113036
getter	setter
i don t think there is a way to express this concept using native syntax even using rhino spidermonkey proprietary extensions like getter and setter

4113049
int	chars
because string isn t a primitive type it s a class which has methods whereas int short chars etc

4113066
folder	directory
i created a django project and as it was recommended in django tutorial i placed static files like .js in separate folder as well as template directory

4113103
versioning	upgrade
be warned once your databases are upgrade they can not be restored on an install of an older versioning

4113140
put	get
just put it in a folder in your project it will get deployed with your application

4113154
width	height
ie7 for some reason does not respect my width and height set to 16px and instead makes all rows and columns to take the average size

4113155
webstorm	aptana
i ve tried some of the editors ides regularly recommended for coding javascript aptana webstorm ... but none of them has a satisfying autocomplete functionality

4113197
oncreate	onstart
you should only create things in oncreate and start them in onstart or onresume

4113210
maven	m2e
i performed import existing maven project in eclipse using m2e plugin

4113258
jboss	glassfish
or when you re not on a servlet 3.0 compatible container yet tomcat 7 glassfish 3 jboss 6 etc or newer then map it in web.xml the old fashioned way see also our servlets wiki page

4113273
width	height
i don t have ie7 nor ie6 here so this is just a guess try setting the width and height of .m to auto

4113299
apache	nginx	passenger	webrick
there are webrick mongrel passenger apache nginx and many more i am sure and i don t really understand the different roles they play

4113338
public	protected
non-nested classes in c# can be public or internal but not protected

4113359
maven	pom.xml
you should also add the groovy maven plugin to your pom.xml like this see this page for details

4113399
fadein	fadeout
i m looking for a light-weight low bandwidth cross-browser solution to show some alternating texts in a div on webpage with fadein fadeout

4113439
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if you test the above-stated code in browsers other than opera tested on v9.62 it works like a charm i have tested in safari firefox google-chrome

4113485
put	get
sure you can map read to get and put to create but what about delete

4113485
put	get
sure the text editor can mask in with get and out with put as in save as but what about delete

4113546
google-chrome	firefox
try jetbrains webstorm and its css xfire plug-in for firefox and google-chrome

4113553
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
should work in all ie 7 8 firefox google-chrome safari

4113570
apache	nginx
you are also confusing the roles of apache nginx with the roles of other components

4113570
apache	nginx
apache vs nginx

4113570
apache	nginx
apache is more popular and has more features nginx is smaller and faster and has less features

4113570
apache	nginx
neither apache nor nginx can serve ruby web apps out-of-the-box to do that you need to use apache nginx in combination with some kind of add-on described later

4113570
apache	nginx
apache and nginx can also act as reverse proxies meaning that they can take an incoming http request and forward it to another server which also speaks http

4113570
apache	nginx
when that server responds with an http response apache nginx will forward the response back to the client

4113570
thin	webrick
they were using thin before so i have no idea why they switched to webrick

4113570
puma	thin	puma	unicorn	thin	unicorn
app servers that may not be directly exposed to the internet mongrel unicorn thin puma

4113570
apache	nginx
these app servers must be put behind a reverse proxy web server like apache and nginx

4113570
apache	nginx
you must then setup apache or nginx to reverse proxy to this cluster

4113570
apache	nginx
apache nginx will take care of distributing requests between the instances in the cluster more on this in section i o concurrency models

4113570
apache	nginx
apache and nginx are very good at doing many things at the same time because they re either multithreaded or evented

4113570
apache	nginx
apache and nginx can do it faster

4113570
apache	nginx
people typically set up apache nginx to serve static files directly but forward requests that don t correspond with static files to the app server it s good security practice

4113570
apache	nginx
apache and nginx are very mature and can shield the app server from perhaps maliciously corrupted requests

4113570
puma	unicorn
puma was also forked from mongrel but unlike unicorn puma is designed to be purely multi-threaded

4113570
apache	nginx
phusion passenger integrates directly into apache or nginx and so can be compared to mod_php for apache

4113570
apache	nginx
just like mod_php allows apache to serve php apps almost magically phusion passenger allows apache and also nginx

4113570
apache	nginx
instead of starting a process or cluster for your app and configuring apache nginx to serve static files and or reverse proxying requests to the process cluster with phusion passenger you only need to

4113570
jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius	mri	rubinius
phusion passenger supports many mri ruby jruby and rubinius

4113570
thin	unicorn
mongrel unicorn and thin only support mri

4113570
flask	django
it also supports python wsgi so it can for example also run django and flask apps

4113570
passenger	unicorn
unicorn also has a similar feature but phusion passenger s version is more flexible because

4113570
passenger	unicorn
2 phusion passenger s version works well with multithreaded apps while unicorn s does not

4113570
apache	nginx
you should refer to the comprehensive phusion passenger manual apache version nginx version or the phusion passenger website for information

4113570
jruby	rubinius
jruby and rubinius have no gil so they can fully leverage multiple cores in a single process

4113575
serializable	deserialization
i faced in a problem with unicode characters serializable and deserialization

4113604
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
and the next to zip it i suggest sharpziplib but also the dotnetzip

4113605
getter	setter
i might approach it by reducing the visibility of the one-to-many relationship and create a getter setter as such

4113618
google-chrome	firefox
i have this html that shows up fine in firefox except in ie and google-chrome

4113638
client-side	server-side
i would like both the server-side and client-side validation to be set accordingly

4113717
hash	salt
also you don t want to double hash things like your salt and username because this will only limit the possibilities of the hash and the username values although this is probably purely a theoretical problem since it s not common use to hash your salt

4113720
inherited	subclassing
this is when you design your class for inherited and you want to provide hooks for subclassing

4113728
setinterval	settimeout
the exception is when you run code that is asynchronous like a settimeout setinterval or an asynchronous ajax request

4113752
gridbaglayout	springlayout
then you might use a gridbaglayout or springlayout for the other components

4113766
width	height
but in internet explorer and firefox it is not the table stretches to the width but ignores the height property and its height is determined by its contents

4113798
stdout	stderr
ft popen cli_parts stdin pipe stderr pipe stdout pipe file

4113821
portrait	landscape
for example when you create a layout you can choose the orientation so that you will have one layout for the landscape view and one for the portrait view

4113821
portrait	landscape
the layout will be automatically chosen whether you are holding the phone in portrait or landscape mode

4113823
getter	setter
i intentionally missed setter getter and some other things for code clarity

4113835
multiplying	add
but we can t just add multiplying the two statements

4113845
public	protected
you can also replace public with protected if you don t like this example

4113845
system.in	system.out
in real life you have something simillar in java when it comes to system.in or system.out

4113846
itunes	apple-id
in other words once you have created that app and then uploaded it to itunes connect then both app and your itunes connect account are locked together by the same apple-id and the same pw

4113849
public	protected
the solutions using a public constructor are fine too but as the constructor cannot be called directly on thr interface i think protected is better

4113873
getter	setter
explicit getter and setter can be overly-bureaucratic

4113873
getter	setter
the main cited reason for having getter and setter functions is that it isolates the clients of your class from potential changes in implementation in the future for instance consider what would happen if you decide to generate an engine object on demand rather than using a member variable or decide to hide it behind a smart pointer or some other container

4113873
getter	setter
if your class if very simple close to being a pod and unlikely to change then it may not be worth the faff of having to implement the getter and setter

4113880
getter	setter
i read an interesting java article why getter and setter methods are evil which applies just as much to c++ as it does to java

4113882
folder	directory
i can find out where the working directory of the windows service is by outputting to a the log the working directory in this case c windows system32 and copy over nginx directory into that folder but this is not great for when it comes to bundling the application into a setup.exe file which may be installed in any arbitrary location - plus it clutters the system32 folder

4113951
division	addition
in addition whether integer division by zero raises sigfpe is also cpu + os dependant

4113958
ubuntu	debian
if you are on debian ubuntu apache.apache would be www-data www-data

4113959
m2e	groovy-eclipse
in addition to gmaven and groovy-eclipse there is m2e support for groovy-eclipse that should be installed separately

4114008
opera	firefox
for in-browser generation it s a combination of using the form element introduced by netscape for this - works on firefox and opera for example activex for msie or the mozilla javascript extensions

4114033
codeigniter	kohana
edit if you are looking for simpler frameworks try codeigniter or kohana which is a fork of codeigniter

4114033
cakephp	yii
like with symfony zend cakephp yii etc

4114055
int	chars
for example i want to have a method that depending on the first argument passed can take either an int or a chars as the second argument

4114081
difftime	mktime
compute the time_t for a chosen epoch using mktime then use difftime to compute the difference in seconds

4114083
merb	ruby-on-rails
i proposed that we merge icuke frank similar to how merb ruby-on-rails merged since they have the same common goal cucumber for ios

4114159
udp	tcp
however peer authentication happens when a tcp connection is established between peers so there is still plenty of security beyond the udp broadcast but i just don t want to be too easily intercepted and interpreted by a 3rd party

4114173
getter	setter
as i happened to get educated on recently getter and setter smell of bad design

4114191
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
it even works with auto-completion if you have the git-completion in place for bash tcsh zsh

4114198
jar	war
i ve had similar issues before and it usually boiled down to the jar missing from the built war

4114198
jar	war
can you open up the war you are using and check that the webflow jar is in the web-inf lib directory

4114199
portrait	landscape
starting it in portrait works fine also after pushing my ipad to landscape after starting in portrait

4114199
portrait	landscape
starting in portrait switching to landscape

4114214
for-loop	loops
get a pen and a sheet of paper and manually loops through your for-loop to see that this must be wrong

4114265
for-loop	loops
hey guys m running into a problem i have a for-loop n in that i call a function and in that function i have a if condition i want to skip 1 loops if condition gets true for this problm i was thinkin to use goto statement but as i read in many forums that goto statement is an evil.

4114268
fadein	fadeout
with this i want to display data 0 .user for a few seconds and after that smoothly change it into data 1 .user by using fadeout and fadein and so on until it runs out of users

4114356
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox doesn t in google-chrome

4114365
hide	show
now try something on what i say have two buttons hide and show

4114383
getter	setter
the tpropinfo record that you get back from getproplist has information on the address of the getter and setter methods associated with a property you can use them to call the getter or setter respectively

4114386
distance	polygons
geographic distance bounding box polygons and custom score scripts in various languages are supported

4114395
width	height
you have your width and height parameters swapped on the imagecopyresampled call

4114395
width	height
try swapping width and height

4114417
pull	push
i d like to restrict write access for the master branch to only several developers while allowing others to pull everything and push to other non-master branches

4114426
inherited	subclassing
assuming you want to use inherited to be able to use the same mapped fields in each of the subclassing i ve approached this by using a trait for those fields

4114477
lxml	libxml2
lxml s documentation says the support for parsing broken html depends entirely on libxml2 s recovery algorithm

4114477
lxml	html5lib
so i recommend swapping lxml for html5lib which handles baidu s invalid html with no problems

4114508
hide	show
i have a pesky link that calls a javascript function to show and hide the div layer

4114508
hide	show
however instead of performing this javascript show hide in the webapp view it closes and loads the page and javascript in safari

4114582
width	height
you seem to misunderstand the box model - in css you provide points for the top and left and then width and height - these are all that are needed for a box to be placed with exact measurements

4114621
width	height
there is a nice example of using accelerator and stage width and height for obtaining device orientation

4114636
expression-blend	silverlight
my personal recommendation for developers using silverlight is to use expression-blend

4114665
post	get
different from get however post data will not be stored in the browser s url history nor in proxy logs etc

4114674
scheme	racket
i am attempting to create a simple language interpreter for a homework assignment in plt scheme racket

4114698
post	get
if the question is using post vs get

4114698
post	get
then no post does not add any further significant security benefits over using get

4114702
jar	manifest.mf
in my library it is necessary to read manifest.mf from jar in case of a desktop application which is the end application run from not from any other on a classpath

4114702
jar	manifest.mf
is there a better generic solution which gives a name location manifest.mf of from jar which is a desktop application run from

4114716
debian	linux
if it s helpful i m transferring from osx to linux debian

4114782
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to only happen in google-chrome i m using mac but in firefox the element is always on top like in the first example

4114829
persistent	transient
once nh persistent an entity in a single session and that session is closed i need to fetch it again in a new session in order to reference it in some other transient entities

4114829
instances	transient
or i can call session.lock on the new session instances and let nh know this entity is not transient

4114856
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the lytebox script works until the show only one is invoked from that point on it s broken in ie firefox and opera google-chrome and safari do not throw an error with this error

4114874
stdout	stderr
however if you want to distinguish stderr lines from stdout lines maybe you need to use ipc open3 or the mis-named ipc open3 util

4114918
inherited	properties
every object you create in js inherited its properties from the prototype

4114929
rss	feed
i have a project that i need to make a service that we will add to it about 500 rss for different sites and we want this service to collect new rss feed from these sources and save title url in my sql server database .

4114954

4114999
switching	screens
then if the person touched the screens in the second view it would switching back to the first view and stop playing i assume the best way to do this would be to have some kind of stop playing method in the viewdidload section of the first view

4115149
hide	show
if you want the user be able to switch between different views and this is data that can simply be included on page load then just include onload then hide show or load as json and then populate as needed

4115198
hide	show
i ve had a look through your demo code and all is working as intended - the tab event handlers are being bound correctly to the list elements which when clicked are applying the correct css classes to the div elements to show the corresponding one and hide the others respectively

glut	sdl
glut is much more easier while many of people use sdl or sfml they re more flexible and feature-full than glut

4116156
post	put	submit	submission
my strategy is to put a live binding to the submit event on my form which then prevents the default submission and does a jquery post using the form values as parameters for processing at my site

4116156
submit	submission
if the form passes validation and its determined that the user needs to be redirected the form submission is triggered again but this time the submit handler returns true which should enable the default right

google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome however use dom order

if i have a property that is declared as dynamic where do i normally implement the setter and getter

4116368
put	get
however although i have successfully created a dll and put it in the extensions folder and told php.ini about it now i get this

getter	setter
assuming you are talking about a subclass of nsmanagedobject here the setter getter are provided by coredata

4116387
for-loop	loops
i have tried to change the while loops into a for-loop but i don t think that has to do with anything with the error

4116413
width	height
if the div elements you re using have a fixed width and height you can simply make them all float right and they will naturally layout right to left and top to bottom

4116422
oncreate	onstart
so put the above code example in the oncreate or onstart of your launcher activity to have it play on startup and place it in a button s onclick method to respond to a button press

4116445
getter	setter
dynamic as used in classes you define not core data means that your are going to type in the getter and setter for the property

4116445
getter	setter
generally you would only do this if you are not going to store the value for the property in a variable are going to somehow transform it first or need to hook some other processing into the getter setter concept

4116459
post	get
for each iteration over post then you are hitting the database at to get p.by which i assume to be a foreignkey to an auth.user

4116459
post	get
in addition to that with an invalid cache first run you are hitting the db again at to get the list of that post s images

4116520

4116843
width	height
i have created image viewer control that provide zoom in out the image and when the image zoomed and be larger than it s viewer you can t see all the image i provided the ability to drag the image like windows photo viewer using translatetransform but i wanna the image to stop dragging when it s border left or right or left or down is appeared i have done some calculations of the width and height of the fourth sides and it s work fine but when you speedy drag the image it stop after it s border pass it s container border and the distance increased by greater drag speed

division	modulo
i know how to do this for decimal integers by using modulo and division

4116879
debian	linux
debian gnu linux 5.0.6

4116883
division	modulo
you can use modulo and division by 2 exactly like you would in base 10

4116883
division	modulo
you can also use binary operators but if you already know how to do that in base 10 it would be easier if you just used division and modulo

4116913
super	self
if you re inheriting from uitableviewcontroller your view should be a uitableview not a plain uiview then when you want to create a view programmatically you should allocate it initialize it set its properties and assign it as your controller s view i haven t tried super loadview before but it s creating the tableview for you and assigning datasource and delegate to self so you don t have to do that

4116931
division	modulo
expanding on frã dã ric and gabi s answers all you need to do is realise that the rules in base 2 are no different to in base 10 - you just need to do your division and modulo with a divisor 2 instead of 10

4116955
unsigned	short
represents an unsigned short grayscale image non-indexed

4116966
free	malloc
so malloc free or is what you should use to create and destroy an array of that size

is it possible to put all these tables in a directory folder

4117101
nsapplication	nsmenuitem
i ve inspected the xib file associated to the main menu and that nsmenuitem is sending a openpreferences id sender ibaction to the firstresponder which sould be the nsapplication

4117117
mvp	presenter
in mvp i see the presenter as the orchestrators of activity

4117117
mvp	presenter
exposing the view of a presenter to other presenter breaks the idea of encapsulation within the mvp pattern

4117117
mvp	presenter
the only code i have in the view are the notifications to its presenter of what a user has done also known as user gestures in some mvp discussions

4117137
ubuntu	linux
for compatibility on both mac os x and ubuntu linux i used

4117208
getter	setter
is it good practice to use mutable getter and setter for spring or hibernate framework and using immutable setter and getter for my custom coding

4117208
getter	setter
can i use immutable getter and setter for spring hibernate as well

4117217
getter	setter
edit the exception is occurring in the setter because you re always trying to access the underlying dictionary s getter

4117218
getter	setter
note that if you provide a mutable setter and getter it will eventually be used by people

4117256
width	height
what i am trying to do is get the height and width of the image so that the new window is created with the same height and width as the stored image

4117256
width	height
create a height and width column in my database and store the values when the image is inserted into the database

4117256
width	height
retrieve the image from the database and calculate somehow the height and width just before displaying it and then resize the browser window to the right size

4117256
width	height
i already have over 150 images in the database so that makes option 1 difficult because i would have to go back over my db and calculate height and width for images that are already in the db

4117268
put	get
secondly when i get the values of the parameter it put all values in one record

4117278
textview	imageview
i have a basic file browser within my app that for each row of the list outputs an imageview and a textview

4117282
firefox	safari
this is easily doable with such tools as firebug on firefox or equally good really inspector on safari

4117282
client-side	server-side
most server providers don t let users do this but if you can - and want security - do it - don t use any known protocol but rather something that suits just your need - after all you control both server-side and client-side so the communication can be done anyhow

4117294
post	get
to get parameters not to be in the url you need to use post

post	get
an api will tell you how you can do things with the site without having to reverse engineer all pages post ... and the format of every output resulting from post get operations

4117385
getter	setter
i now understand that i can receive this object as a parameter in my controller method and that spring will bind the form parameters to the getter setter of my person object

4117403
ssms	sqlcmd

4117484
put	get
i ve been trying to get opengl-es to do something roughly like the following to see if glpushmatrix and glpopmatrix could be used to put things such as blending states back how they were before glpushmatrix was called

4117492
g++	gcc
now set full path for gcc or g++ as follows

4117501
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
you must call free on pointers you obtain from malloc and realloc

4117501
realloc	malloc
there is no reason to cast the result of malloc or realloc in c

4117501
free	realloc
if realloc is unable to reallocate enough memory it returns null but the original pointer is not free

4117509
move	drag
i ve had this problem several times now and never found a satisfactory solution if i want to move a group of items with a view all together in interface builder and these items are all on top of a larger background item i can t put a selection rectangle around the items in the view because any click and drag in the view initiates a move of the background item

serializable	deserialization
but i don t know how to do serializable or deserialization

4117561
width	height
in flex the width can be set to 100 but in flash it seems i can only set the width height in unit of px

4117565

my question is if you can dynamically set the id string r.id.btn7 to put in a can get the buttons for and for example change the color ..

4117580

4117621
post	get
when evaluating that a form was submitted i check that the method was post not get

4117630
post	get
html only supports post and get as form methods even though http has others

4117630
post	put
even outside the context of an html form the answer is still no as put and post are very different

4117630
post	put
post is a generic here is some data do something with it method while put means replace the resource at this uri with this data

4117633
width	text-align
also because the ul s width is 100 it doesn t help to wrap the ul in a div and give the div a rule of text-align center

4117648
apache	nginx
but one of my partners suggested that we use a standard server like iis apache or nginx

4117655
post	get
if you re doing it for security reasons get or post doesn t matter

4117672
min	max
a more intutive but slightliy slower variant would be to use min max on each axis

4117685
post	put
there is no different between put and post in security ..

4117691
portrait	landscape
as usual in android each time the screen is flipped to portrait landscape mode an activity runs through life-cycle from onsaveinstancestate to ondestroy and then is recreated

yacc	bison
you will probably be best to use bison or yacc to generate your parser code

4117748
ftp	telnet
server side software could mean lots of different things for example this could be a trivial app which echoes everything back on a specific port to a telnet ftp server to a webserver running lots of services

4117748
post	get
simple web site - slightly different to the above respods to html get post requests and serves up static or dymanic content i m guessing this is not what you re after

4117801
jms	jta
the xasession interface extends the capability of session by adding access to a jms provider s support for the java transaction api jta optional

4117801
jms	jta
a jta aware jms provider must fully implement this functionality

4117801
jms	jta
in other words the provider may require that you specify an xa or non-xa jms resource or as would seem to be in your case the provider may perform all the jta plumbing transparently with what appears to be a regular jms session

4117862
vorbis	webm
h264 vorbis and webm .

opera	firefox
the only cases where theora webm would be important are firefox and opera

i don t know of a tool to analyze the heap dumps but jvisualvm that comes with the jdk distribution has a rather nice memory profiling that i ve used to debugging similar issues

4117938
put	get
step #3 call getstring on the bundle passed to your implementation of onrestoreinstancestate or in oncreate if the bundle is not null if you wish to get your caption back then call settext on your button to put the caption back in

you should consider a skip-lists which is an ordered linked-list with o log n access times

4118254
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
the reason i want to stick to just using svg in tags rather than using some more ambitious solution is that afaik google-chrome opera and safari all support it and ff4 seems like it may finally get it as well combined with the fact that the entire site is built on a custom cms which would have to be partially rewritten to start changing the output html currently it supports custom design images custom css and custom js includes for each theme

darcs	fossil
fossil looks as interesting option although we don t like its use of non-standard wiki markup considering it s very light in regard to hosting requirements and incorporates distributed bug tracker which eliminates the need for some public hosting solution as in the scenario with darcs monotone

4119444

there is a simpler way to get the single latest post

4120432
hash	md5
you could use a md5 or better a sha-1 hash

4120435
free	malloc
the only real danger i know of with returning a pointer to allocated memory is this if your library is compiled on windows and linked to one instance of the visual c++ runtime library msvcrt for example it is statically linked to it and a client program is linked to another instance for example it is linked to the dll then they each have a different malloc arena and pointers returned by the library cannot be free by the program

4120841
width	height
i have done some rudimentary debugging by logging the width and the height of the canvas element at the time the asynctask completes but it is returning 0 for them so i m guessing that the canvas object is no longer available to the code running in asynctask s onpostexecute after the draw method has completed

4120862
mouseevent	mouselistener
i create a mouselistener for the table so it gets the mouseevent at the click and shows the popup menu at the correct place

every column needs to be in the group_by or needs an aggregate max min whatever

4120906

using jquery textarea .scrollheight 99999 works great on firefox and google-chrome but not on ie

4121113
free	malloc

4121335
hex	binary
when for example you have signed hex 0x80 which will be converted to binary 1000 0000 however in order to compute the decimal value for this binary representation it is signed so we have to invert 7 bits so we get 1111111 and add 1 which gives us 10000000 which is -128

4121353
min	max
note if the number of rows in prices is not exactly divisible by 20 both sam s and my solution will return the first min max and last prices for one group with fewer than 20 items - that group contains the most recent items

4121590
slideup	slidedown
when the mouse pointer leaves a the slideup effect should also be delayed by the same amount - my hope with this last requirement is that if you move down from one to the next the slidedown and slideup effects will occur at the same time so it just appears that the title row between them is moving up i hope this makes some sort of sense

4121634
inherited	subclassing
in languages that support multiple inherited the key ambiguity that is arguably unsatisfactorily resolved is what happens when you subclassing from two types that both define a method with the same signature

4121708
int	chars
forgot to mention assumed you would deduce the following ch is your pointer to the currently read in chars while count is an int initialized to all zeros with a size of 26 2 52 to cater for both upper and lowercase

4121708
tolower	ctype
if upper and lower-case should be treated the same you can use the tolower int c function also included in the ctype library

4121759
spoofing	traffic
by looking at the network traffic or looking in your database i can spoofing your website and send it the md5

4121759
hash	salt
most of all though you can t salt the hash client side without sending the salt over the net unencrypted therefore making the salting pointless

4121759
hash	salt
without a salt or with a known salt i can brute force attack the hash and figure out what the password is

4121759
salt	md5
the client encrypts using your public key then you decrypt on your end with your private key then you md5 the password using a user unique salt and store it in your database

cpython	ironpython
fair warning if your getlist.py script uses parts of the cpython standard library that haven t been implemented in ironpython you might have to change the script

4122073
hide	show

4122084
folder	directory
the one in xcode was outside the classes folder and had the correct attributes but even though xcode did not have a reference to the old file in the classes directory it was still using it.

4122137
width	height
s are inline elements like and therefore they cannot accept rules like width height and others

4122174

is there a fix workaround so that i can get it working in google-chrome 7 and or safari 5 as well

4125074
division	multiplication
yes many cpus can perform multiplication in 1 or 2 clock cycles but division always takes longer although fp division is sometimes faster than integer division

4125074
division	multiplication
why does division take so much longer than multiplication

4125074
division	subtraction
division requires iterative subtraction that cannot be performed simultaneously so it takes longer

4125074
multiplying	division
in fact some fp units speed up division by performing a reciprocal approximation and multiplying by that

4125087
put	get
the problem is that another slave may have assigned the job to itself between the get and put

4125092
subtract	add
it would be easier to just grab the month and year of the current date add subtract the number of months difference then generate a date from those new values

4125094
g++	gcc
you can try adding the -pthread command-line option to g++ this options means in gcc parlance do everything required for posix threading support

4125094
g++	gcc

children	parent
if you add a parent on the client and add some children to it s entitycollection when you submit all the entities will show up on the server

4125154
division	multiplication
division is inherently a much slower operation than multiplication

4125154
division	multiplication
are not semantically identical - 0.1 cannot be exactly represented as a double so a slightly different value will end up being used - substituting the multiplication for the division in this case would yield a different result

4125161
onclick	onsubmit
you need to run onsubmit not onclick

4125188
content-disposition	content-type
setting the content-type and content-disposition enables a browser to do the right thing ie open the file-save dialog but custom clients httpwebclient web service proxy etc don t have those behaviors built-in so you will need to add whatever is missing

4125192
division	multiplication
for example doing lots of multiplication on an array on x86 should be much faster then doing division because the compiler should create the assembler code which uses simd instructions

4125192
division	multiplication
since there are no division in the simd instructions then you would see great improvements using multiplication then division

4125199
equals	gethashcode
equals and gethashcode and none of them are being called when the value

4126983
nsbezierpath	nsimage
i should note that i want to save this before the nsbezierpath is displayed - so solutions that draw an existing view to an nsimage are not useful

4126983
nsbezierpath	nsimage
can someone point me in the right direction for converting nsbezierpath to an nsimage

4127000
mouseup	mousedown
my only beef with this sample code and i stress that it is sample code is that the action is being done at mousedown and not at mouseup

4127020
width	height
i have an image which width is 213 and height is 200 when i echo the image from my database and i resize it the image was not as clear as when it was 213 200

4127031
int	double
replace double with whatever data type you desire int string object .

4127043
width	height
as a general rule don t set both the width and the height explicitly for the image

4127045
width	height
the best way is to keep the images aspect ration so basically if the image was 800 x 1200 instead of resizing it to a certain pixel size do it by percent and make sure the width and height are being changed by the same percent

4127084
stdout	stderr
under unix stdout and stderr go to the string list

4127177
prepare	execute
execute test prepare

4127202
hash	salt
something not mentioned in here is you should salt your hash

4127202
hash	salt
if they hash with no salt then breaking passwords would be as easy as downloading a large pre-hashed dataset of a crap-ton of strings

4127202
hash	salt
if you add a salt aka pre-determined random string to a password before it is hash then you can t just pre-hash a ton of strings

4127202
hash	salt
each password has a different salt so you can t use one pre-computer hash lookup table you d have to re-compute the hash for every password

4127202
hash	salt
even if you store the salt in the same table it would be incredibly hard for anyone to make a hash lookup to try to reverse any one person s password

4127247
folder	directory
create matching directory and files that you want modified in the local folder for the module

4127250
hide	show	slideup	slidedown
i need to hide show actually slidedown slideup an add to cart button underneath each table column

4127250
hide	show
my markup is a pretty basic table and the buttons positioning isn t causing any trouble either but what i cannot figure out is how to attach an event handler to the hover event of a table column that will show the button inside that column then when hovering a different column hide the currently showing and reveal the next one currently being hovered

4127297
memcpy	strcpy
you have to assign the elements individually or use a function such as strcpy or memcpy

4127339
put	get
ideally you would want everything in the same table with something in your query to get the correct version however you should be careful how you do this as an inefficient query will put extra load on your server

4127362
pop-up	dialog
i pop-up a dialog which explains that the license check failed and presents them with two buttons

4127386

if you have two subclasses of nsmanagedobject where the parent class implements a dynamic property and its subclass the grandchild of nsmanagedobject overrides the methods for the property those overrides cannot call super

4127491
gridview	sqldatasource
the search button fires the gridview row command and changes the underlying sqldatasource s select command and adds the text value from the text box as a parameter

4127506
jobs	cron
it has cron based interface or a more dynamic way to generate jobs that are relative from a specific event if your use case calls for it quartz can do it

4127524
mongodb	bson
mongodb stores the data on the disk as bson in your data path directory which is usually data db

4127527

post	put
sql server has never put indexes onto foreign key columns automatically - check out kim tripp s excellent blog post on the background and history of this urban myth

4127623
uiapplication	uiwindow
you could do this by creating a subclass of uiapplication for your app which returns the uiwindow object from a custom method

4127625
mouse	keyboard
i keep finding vaguely related postings that talk about input messages mouse and keyboard but i don t know what i can do to verify that

4127625
mouse	keyboard
i ve already tried butchering the code to remove every mouse keyboard operation i could

4127694
mouseup	mousedown
to avoid using threads you can add a timer component on your form control and simply enable it on mousedown and disable it on mouseup

4127731
post	get
it turns out that i get this every time i try to post or update now

4127731

4127764
asp.net-mvc	openrasta
i m testing out the feasibility of using openrasta as a viable alternative to asp.net asp.net-mvc

4127769
postgresql	informix
implementable in other dbms such as informix and probably postgresql but i m not confident of that

4127817
width	height
1 start more basically and give your elements height and width

4127859
hide	show
if you want to show the same form again create another instance or just hide it instead of closing

4127871
spaces	delimiter
split the string using the delimiter of your choice - i m assuming you want it to be whitespace then loop through the string tokens printing each one until you can t fit it in the remaining spaces then go to the next line and keep going

4127873
viewdidload	viewdidappear
so i started printing an nslog at each step of the launch process application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions applicationdidbecomeactive viewdidload viewdidappear and discovered to my surprise that does not mean that the view will load before application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions is complete

4127938
int	chars
even though isdigit receives an int as its only parameter it expects a chars value a byte number representing an ascii letter not a pure int as you are now using it

4127946
int	chars
although isdigit takes an int as an argument it checks the chars value of your variable

4127946
int	chars
gives you an int value not a chars value

4127951
cout	cin
try not to mix c libraries printf scanf etc. with c++ libraries cout and cin

4127960
int	chars
you re using scanf with d which will convert the digit s to an int but isdigit is intended to work with raw chars that have not been converted yet

4127960
int	chars
if you use it you d probably want to read a string then check whether all the chars entered were digits with isdigit and only after you ve done that would you try to convert to an int

4127980
cvs	svn
cvs svn i hate the differences showing 100 s of changes when there are only a handful due to the update in the comments for cvs info like log or id

4127981
int	chars
so you could use this on each chars of the the string representation of your int but your a is already an int as set by scanf_s

4127981
int	chars
once you have the string you can loop over every chars in it checking if it is a digit or you can use a library function like strtol to do this for you and return the int value checking afterwards that it consumed all the input when it did so to reject things like 123x

4127987
uilabel	uifont
for instance instantiating anything that attempts to use uifont uilabel for instance will explode messily segmentation fault or similar outside a running uiapplication

4128007

4128036
post	get
name is used during form submission to post get the values

4128049
jar	war
having the dom.jar in your classpath helps only eclipse in managing classpaths of class files when doing development but building your jar war ear files you have to manage your libraries which you can configure in eclipse too

4128061
typedef	struct
is this recursive - so suppose struct typedef a contains a field of typedef struct b

4128078
post	put
so i could create a method name postmessage so in that method i would call the model post and also the model postcomment so my question is should i put the method postmessage in the controller post or postcomments

4128098
put	get
the next thing you have to look at is where does the backing object get put into the request scope

4128099

many-to-many	one-to-many
you have mapped the customer- address as a one-to-many relationship customer hasmany address in your fluent mapping but address- customer as a many-to-many

4128327
accessor	properties
when you use generated properties accessor they manage all the memory for you

4128327
accessor	properties
so in your code this would result in releasing the properties s previous object twice once directly by you and again by the properties accessor when setting it to nil

4128327
accessor	properties
you must either manage the properties directly or let the accessor manage the properties

4128327
accessor	properties
since you re using properties and generated accessor you should probably just stick with that and rewrite your delegate method

4128367
min	max
from a practical point of view the main problem is in windows programming where microsoft s windows.h header defines zillions of non-uppercase macros including by default min and max which conflict with the c++ standard library

4128441

int	chars
the idea is that 4 6 bit int require 24 bits or 3 chars

4128517
mouseup	mousedown
or you can do it your way and start a timer on mousedown then on mouseup end the timer and then see if it s more or less than 5 seconds

4128518
mouseleave	mouseenter
you don t want to use .hover because it will fire once for mouseenter and once for mouseleave

4128522
mouseup	mousedown
sure handle both the mousedown event and the mouseup event

4128522
mouseup	mousedown
start a timer on the mousedown and see how long it has run on the mouseup

4128548
post	get	post	put	put	get
if you pass the index to the form validation rule it works fine but to get the data into another var you need to first put the post array into a temp variable and then access that index

4128579
post	get
are you meaning that you want the 3rd-party site to make the request for you either get or post

4128579
post	get
if you want to see the results of any given form post get request files you can point a form to

mef	prism
so the learning curve has been tremendous to say the least â learning wpf xaml c# unity prism mef .net mvvm etcâ fun but very challenging

4128659
uitableview	uisearchbar
you must have a containing view - it should be a subview of your detail-view and it should contain the uisearchbar and likely your uitableview

4128721
int	double
assuming that inta intb and intc are typed as int int32 then convert.todouble is basically the same as a simple cast to double

4128749
factors	matrix
this even factors in the possibility of a jagged array a matrix with an inconsistent number of rows in the column

4128764
actionscript	mxml
i m trying to set a specific list item in a mx combobox to have a custom item renderer the problem is that i cannot do this via mxml it needs to be done via actionscript at a later stage eg combobox gets created combobox gets populated user does other tasks combobox needs to set one or more items in the combobox to have icons via item renderer

4128773
google-chrome	safari
i was trying my script in google-chrome safari and ie8

4128829
mouse	keyboard
beside of this there re much better ways to simulate keyboard mouse events

4128877
textview	imageview
the way i try to do this is to put the two textview in a linearlayout then place the imageview and the linearlayout containing the text in a tablelayout with one row and two columns

4128897
keydown	keyup
therefore the keyup event sent by your code above will be sent at least 2.638 seconds later than the keydown event and not a millisecond sooner

4128913
cvs	svn
cvs svn

4128967
ant	maven
i would pick one of the more configurable build tools like ant or maven as a starting point

you may be able to get at the data before the browser tries to parse the script by attaching onload and onreadystatechange events to the script element

4129036
pop-up	dialog
i started using visual studio 2010 and am missing the dialog box that used pop-up in visual studio 2008 and earlier that would warn you if there are build errors

4129055
xsl-fo	xslt
you can use saxon to perform an xslt transform creating the xsl-fo but you will still need an xsl-fo processor to create the pdf from the xsl-fo

4129055
xsl-fo	xslt
xslt transform to create the xsl-fo

4129055
xsl-fo	xslt
learning the xsl-fo at the same time you re learning xslt is going to be tough but i will show you two ways to output an svg in a pdf

4129055
xsl-fo	xslt
xsl-fo created by saxon from svg input and xslt stylesheet

4129062
vsto	add-in
you could write a little vsto add-in that hooks into the file save process and instead of saving the file via word saves whatever portion of the file you want into your own xml format

4129113
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox and google-chrome safari both default to tabbed browsing even without that property set

4129116
int	double
of course as mentioned by many if the values are just int then a double cast will suffice

4129116
int	double
assuming the inputs are int and not huge then if you premultiply inta by intc before doing the divide you can eliminate one double operation as int intc can be safely done at int precision

4129116
int	double
it s not a lot different from the accepted answer but on some platforms could perform slightly better by using an int multiply instead of a double one

4129147
min	max
for less memory but more processing time you could simply sum the deltas computing the min and max as you go

4129147
min	max
that has the potential of throwing off your results but if you are primarily concerned with the statistics generated based on the invidivual iteration measurements then you can just do the min and max calculation outside of the time delta check

4129148
int	double
the other converts can t fail as any int can be represented as a double

4129148
int	double
so you could write it using casts with no change in meaning and exploit the fact that in an expression involving int and double the int are cast to double automatically

4129160
mongodb	bson

libcurl	typhoeus
you might want to look at ntlm authentication for ruby with typhoeus and libcurl then look into using typhoeus instead of rest-client

4129328
min	max
to this end you can compute the min max or k outliers and standard deviation

4129328
for-loop	loops
if the operation is so tiny that the overhead of a for-loop matters measuring the speed of multiplication then use manual loops unrolling

4129328
min	max
for myself i wrote a little class for gathering min max mean and standard deviation which could be used for benchmarks or other statistics

4129347
maven	pom.xml
once the artifact has a pom.xml maven shouldn t need to check anymore

chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

4129552
spaces	delimiter
words within phrases are delimiter by spaces

4129561
width	height	screens	tablet
it is quite possible that those large devices tablet have much larger screens width and height than a typical phone

4129561
width	height
anyways i ll share a function i wrote that will resize a bitmap to your desired width and height so you can calculate this based off of the screen size then have it re-scaled

4129561
mdpi	hdpi
of course all this is doing is scaling it so make sure you have appropriate mdpi hdpi versions

4129588

i was wondering if there is a way to move the .hg folder to another location than the working directory and still monitor changes

4129802
pull	push
i use push and pull to keep them in sync and if i lose one it s likely i ve not lost any of the changes in it

4129866
nsurl	nsstring
in the code i originally posted i generated an nsurl from an nsstring and stored that in a property

4129866
nsurl	nsstring
by storing my file location as an nsstring instance variable and then creating a new nsurl each time from that string and passing this fresh nsurl to my newly allocated avaudiorecorder it works and does not produce these leaks

4129889
profiling	debugging
which seems to indicate i ve mis-identified the problem - it s not that the profiling is improving things it s that debugging in the ide is killing it.

4129903
getter	setter
for more information on private members and getter and setter

4129945
oncreate	ondestroy
i would think i need to load all bitmaps and sounds outside the actual game activity to prevent from having to unload and reload them everytime ondestroy and oncreate is called for example like when the phone goes to sleep or everytime a new level is chose from the level select screen

4129972
google-chrome	firefox
you could look at the source of web browsers like google-chrome or firefox

4129986
integer	unsigned
on your implementation evidently unsigned int is a 32 bit integer occupying 4 bytes

i m trying to display the less-than sign using mathjax to render mathml input.

4130071
width	height
it does seem to support rotation on tags like div p or h1 but i noticed that when i first tried doing this the symbol disappeared because you need to define a height and width large enough so that the rotated element will fit inside

4130071
width	height
you might be able to find another html text tag that rotates properly in webkit or do some javascript to determine the height and width of the text you need to rotate.

4130078
opera	firefox
this should work in all webkit based browsers firefox ie and opera

but qmainwindow parentwidget returns a pointer to a qwidget not a qmainwindow so i of course get an error

4130237
overlay	z-order
i ve tried to overlay it as a div outside of the map but i haven t managed to get it to display on top of the map -- it seems to get trumped in a z-order showdown

post	get
when do you use post and when do you use get

4130646
post	get
i know the basic difference between get and post methods

4130646
post	get
that is we can see the url parameters in case of get and can t see the url parameters in case of post

4130646
post	get
of course we can pass huge amounts of data by post which is not possible through get

4130655
post	get
if i get to it i will post it for you but the article might have enough information for you to figure out

4130657
button	checkbox
with radio button and checkbox it will return them to their default checked state

4130699
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown

4130703
int	double
why does c# math.floor return double instead of int

4130703
floating-point	integer
returns the largest integer less than or equal to the specified double-precision floating-point number

4130703
int	double
its ok to return a double i can always cast it to an int but its just quite strange isn t it

4130717
post	get
other implementation differences in get and post

4130727
int	double
not really considering that a double can be a much higher magnitude than an int

4130727
int	double
you wouldn t want to overflow an int with the large value that a double could be

4130727
int	double
so you could have a double that is 3 000 000 000.50 and floor it which would overflow the max value of an int

4130816
atomic	interlocked
you can perform some operations interlocked causing the read and write to be one atomic operation but i don t believe that bitwise logic falls into the set of operations that can be performed in this manner

4130823
post	get
1 get the html.actionlink to act like a post back and post all the current form values into a specific controller action

4130824
vb.net	vb6
if this indeed is the case then my suggestion would be to recompile the vb6 code as a vb.net and you might have to make some changes to the code as the two platforms are not absolutely identical and expose it using comvisible as a com object and use p invoke to consume the current c++ code which is fairly similar to the way currently your vb6 code consumes it

4130825

4131272
post	get
you can get a good idea of how to go about it using the above post

4131272
post	get
if you scope out those post you can get a general idea about how to go about it

4131292
put	get
mainly nsanimationcontext doesn t have a callback completion mechanism like catransaction does so i had to put the thing there to explicitly get the view s animation and set the delegate so a callback gets triggered

4131438
mouseup	mousedown
i bet they actually use window to capture all the mouse gestures they care about i assume mousedown and mouseup

4131438
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
if you re absolute-positioning the elements you could detect mousedown mousemove and mouseup figure out the span elements mouse is over or nearest to and fill in a textarea with the contents of all content between those two elements

4131438
mouseup	mousedown
it only does mousedown and mouseup and it doesn t work in ie i don t feel like debugging it

4131726
fink	macports
it would be safest to remove all of the fink packages and install macports versions

4131728
inherited	properties	children	parent
after all that you ll still need to check for inherited - go through each of the parent of the element in question and look for properties that can be inherited and add them to this list if they re not already set on the children

inherited	properties
this also means that you ll need to maintain a set of properties that inherited

4132545
jar	war
i have multiple web-apps running on an app server and each web-app war file contains a copy of the same jar file

4132545
jar	war
does this mean that a class in that jar file will be loaded multiple times in the jvm once for each war file it exists in

4132545
jar	war
following on from that if i have a static synchronized method in such a class is it only synchronized among threads within the web-app it exists in but not synchronized against the same method in the same class in a different jar file in a different war file

4132545
jar	war
if this is the case i presume the best solution is to remove the jar file from each war file and deploy it to a shared classpath folder on the server

you re using a salt excellent idea and you re making it extremely difficult to decrypt the information the md5 key is good

expander	togglebutton
the solution which i have got so far does that by binding the expander s isexpanded state to the togglebutton s ischecked state

4132893
width	height
also i noticed that video.google uses only and inline css for width height

4132932
expander	togglebutton
this works by setting up a onewaytosource binding between the ischecked property of the togglebutton the binding will be set against the source when the target value changes and uses an imultivalueconverter to translate the single value into one for each of the expander s

portrait	landscape
i want the second view to always be open in portrait view.in my case when i launch in landscape the view is in portrait but the device is in landscape mode

4133280

there are also other controls you can use like detailsview and formview but honestly i never use them because by the time you add in complexity like transactions and custom validations and all that it can be a pain and i think it is just easier to handle all the code manually for the edit and insert unless it is a really simple situation

4134391
hash	salt
the attacker can no longer share cracking efforts because any precomputed table would have to use a specific salt and would be useless against a password hash with a distinct salt

4139444
portrait	landscape
resize scale your image to 20x20 and your image should look correct in both portrait and landscape

4139449
google-chrome	firefox
another solution i can think of is to have an ajax call that checks to see if a session variable called do_refresh has been set every second and if it has refresh the browser and then writing a script that appends |do_refresh onto the end of all the php session files when you want to reload but that doesn t raise the browser to the foreground which is what i wanted because i have 4 monitors so having code on the first google-chrome on the second ie 8 9 on the third and firefox on the fourth and having them all come up when i make a change to my code is really nice but if you re running with 1 or 2 monitors you may not actually want the windows to come into focus

of course the width here 0.4 linewidth and the needed vertical space here 3 baselineskip you need to determine yourself based on the width of your table cell and the height of the image so this solution doesn t really generalize to something you could just macro away

4143267
int	chars
0 an int represents the number of chars assuming string is or decayed into a chars to advance from the beginning of the object string

4143267

show and hide a semi-transparent black over the top of the image

4143272
min	max

4143507
post	get	post	put	put	get

4143806
queue	fifo
his technique implements a fifo queue that is on delay -- it holds what we just sent to the buffer

4143806
queue	fifo
the delayed fifo queue does not hold pixel data it holds shape primitives which might be pixels in your application but it could also be lines rectangles easy-to-draw things because they are just shapes no unnecessary data is allowed

4143806
queue	fifo
based on the contents of the fifo queue i know what the monitor looks like at the moment

4143806
queue	fifo
i compare my desired output to erase or draw new primitives with the fifo queue and only change values that need to be changed updated

4143806
queue	fifo
the fifo queue contains a lot of information the previous state or the current stuff on monitor or time-based polling device

4143806
queue	fifo
a conditional bit is added to every slot that can hold a primitive in the fifo queue

4143806
mouse	keyboard
only instead of installing it to your hdd and running it through your processor you buy a brand-new board that holds the entirety of the game and takes as input mouse keyboard and takes as output monitor

4143817
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the externalinterface works on ie6 7 8 firefox google-chrome safari etc

4143824
post	get	post	put	put	get
my understanding if i got you correct is you want your http get post put delete to call your doservice method

4143824
implements	extends
if you extends httpservlet you don t have to override doget and dopost as it s already implements by httpservlet

4143958
post	get
i m afraid there is no simple answer to this but the simplest way to do this that i can think of is write a simple script that will make get post requests maybe even using wget and run it on a farm on amazon ec2 or something like that so you can truly reach the max capacity of your infrastructure

4144033
put	get	mp3	flv

4144230
public	protected
but i needed that variable and its uses in the game for some functionality of the game.so that time i declared the variable in public previously it was a protected variable and every thing worked perfectly fine

4144230
public	protected
i am very surprised to see this unusual behavior whenever i declare the variable as protected there is problem but if i copy and paste in public the problem is solved. the variable is only being used in the class where it is declared so there should not be any problem

4144236
button	checkbox
what i m looking to happen is for the user to be able to select certain items from the repeater using the checkbox and process them perform some data operations on those items on clicking a button which is outside the repeater

4144282
min	max
max length of list is min m-i+1 n-j+1 min m n

4144494
pop-up	dialog
i would expect the click event of div1 below to pop-up a dialog stating div1 but it pop-up s div2

4144514
innodb	myisam
don t worry if these figures don t match the myisam example as innodb estimates the cardinalities so they wont be exactly the same

4144514
innodb	myisam
the stored procedure is exactly the same as the myisam example above but selects data from the innodb table instead

4144514
innodb	myisam
based on the cursor example above i would expect the innodb version to out-perform the myisam one

4144514
innodb	myisam
in my simplified system the myisam table doesnt perform too badly so it might not be worth migrating to innodb

4144527
multiplying	division
you can first divide a by c and also get the reminder of the division and multiplying the reminder with b before dividing it by c

4144527
multiplying	subtraction	multiplying	addition	subtraction	addition
another approach would be to loop addition and subtraction instead of multiplying and dividing but that is of course a lot more work

4144528
nullpointerexception	classcastexception
i have succesfully recovered my existing workspace from a totally messed up situation all kinds of core components giving nullpointerexception s and classcastexception and the like by using this procedure

4144528
cvs	svn
if your projects are in cvs svn etc synchronize them

4144541
post	put
also if it s wordpress you probably rewrite post s urls somehow - if the script is in your domain s root directory you should put before filename if it s in a template directory try what nick pyett proposed

4144547
post	get
however as soon as i change the type from get to post i receive a 405 method not allowed error

4144600
windows	wow64
what i ve found however is that my 32-bit app in windows 7 running under wow64 thread a calling suspendthread on thread b can pause it while it s running 64-bit code which i would expect is not user-mode code

4144600
put	get
if i put a breakpoint at the instruction which the above returns to and then get the thread to resume i found that the esp changes back to the value before the x86switchto64bitmode call which is the correct stack pointer

4144620
opera	firefox
if you go to view - developer tools and check opera dragonfly you will see dragonfly open in the bottom of the browser which appears to have similar capabilities to firebug for firefox dom browser network monitor script debugger etc

4144625

i ve tried various different image formats png jpg gif bmp and none of them display correctly

4144637
managed	loaderlock
the loaderlock managed debugging assistant mda detects attempts to execute managed code on a thread that holds the microsoft windows operating system loader lock

i m having the same issue - keyup and keydown events are being fired twice though their handlers are bound only once and i m definitely attaching them to only one element

4144780
innodb	myisam
so far optimization has included adding indexes switching between myisam and innodb but no luck

4144781
post	get
instead to process post and get parameters and generate html i want to receive soap messages to process it and to return response as soap message again

4144956
division	multiplication
the algorithm is basically ancient egyptian multiplication of a with the fraction floor b c + b c c with the slash denoting real division here

4144970
hide	show
the show and hide methods are handy and easy but in my opinion managing state appearance by class name is really a much more powerful and maintainable way to do things

4144975
min	max
you need the 3 images for the min max normal close buttons referenced in the images as images min.png images max.png images normal.png images close.png

4144980
move	drag
when user move drag change the position of the 1st page window mainwindow.xaml then user click on next button to proceed to 2nd page process.xaml the window process.xaml is not at the same position as the mainwindow.xaml that the user move to earlier on

4144983
hide	show
- show the element restoring the display from before hide or restoring the default display for the element type

4144994
jobs	cron
if you have many deletes run two cron jobs one ascending and one descending

4144994
jobs	cron
better yet have the purge jobs running in an endless loop started once per day by cron

4145000
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the real catch is it does not work in google-chrome and firefox but it does work in ie8 and opera

4145000
google-chrome	firefox
when we right-click on the textbox or calendar elements in google-chrome or firefox nothing happens

4145000
google-chrome	firefox
hence it seems as if a right-click action on a disabled form does not work in google-chrome and firefox

4145000
google-chrome	firefox
the real issue seems to be the oncontextmenu attribute of the div around it not reacting properly when clicking on a disabled form element in firefox google-chrome

4145004
width	height
the funny thing is width and height are getting set in the style property of the iframe

4145021
maven	pom.xml
the maven pom.xml schema is version 4.0.0

4145030
calloc	malloc
malloc the closest is calloc which will initialize all your allocated memory to zero

4145036
google-chrome	firefox
so the behaviour shown by google-chrome and firefox kind of makes sense imo

4145062
int	chars
fno int 4 fname chars 30 ftype int 4

4145123
ssl	https
is there a way for a python twisted program to cleanly make use of the list of root certificates that internet explorer uses to validate an ssl connection to an https server

4145132
int	chars
the trick is to convert each digit of the int into a chars

4145153
innodb	myisam
cache table is using myisam engine and master table is using innodb engine

4145297
http.sys	httplistener
i ve been trying to do some testing with the http.sys httplistener on my workstation and it seems that there is some limit in place that prevents more that 1000 concurrent connections

4145297
http.sys	httplistener
i seem to have missed that using http.sys httplistener begingetcontext isn t very good for concurrent connections as the new begingetcontext will only fire after the response stream from the prior request has closed

4145331
folder	directory
spath and npath are absolute paths to folder so being in another directory should not matter

4145342
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval are exactly the same speed they are different statements though

4145342
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout will run your function after the timeout setinterval will run it continuously after a set amount of time between each run

4145387
folder	directory
however i get an error when i try to run it on cron saying that no file is in the directory referring to the code within mypythonfile that refers to the other files in the folder

4145393
content-length	content-type
however remember to send the correct content-type and content-length headers

4145398
getter	setter
as a rule of thumb use always the setter and getter provided by cocoa with one exception dealloc

4145398
subclass	accessor
the reason to avoid accessor in dealloc is that if there are observers or an override in a subclass that triggers behavior it ll be triggered from dealloc which is pretty much never what you want because the state of the object will be inconsistent

4145398
accessor	properties
if you are only targeting 64bit macs you can use properties to generate both accessor methods and the instance variable itself

4145400
factors	matrix
is there a direct way to use these loadings to create a matrix data.frame of factors

4145402

4145457
googletest	cppunit
you might want to take a look at cppunit or googletest for unit testing with c++

4145463
width	height
you shouldn t be moving self.view you should be moving the frame of the menu and you only need to move the center since that will effect the frame position i m assuming your width height of the frame isn t supposed to change

4145467
gif	png
with php how can i test that an uploaded file is a valid gif jpg or png image

4145472

tiff	bmp
a number of formats is supported including bmp tiff and psd

4145598
folder	directory
example if your web root is var www html you might make a separate directory for the xml file s like var www xml now this folder is not assessable from the url but you can link the file s to be called from your php script on successful session authentication

4145609
width	height
so basicelly each rectangle can be defined by center-x center-y width height and angle

4145610
width	height
they currently use a pricing matrix in the form of a two way table with height and width along each axis in a spreadsheet that lets you look up price

4145610
width	height
since the pricing grids they use are up to 19x17 i realise that i would need a 3 column table width height price with 323 19x17 rows for every permutation of the available height and widths and it s corresponding price but is there a less longwinded way to achieve this without manually entering each possible width and height combination

4145668
webclient	webrequest
webclient uses webrequest.create to obtain the request response implementation that will ultimately supply the stream and that s an extensible mechanism - .net has 5 built-in implementations of webrequest and it offers an extensibility mechanism that lets you register additional handlers

4145699
versioning	upgrade
a while later comes up a question do i want to also upgrade to the versioning 4 of .net framework

4145699
versioning	upgrade
so my question should there be a difference between the versioning where i said yes upgrade the -net framework to versioning 4 for this project and the versioning where i said no or does asp run with the old versioning anyway

4145717
vsto	add-in
a vsto add-in

4145729

4145758
powerpc	i386
the architecture is set to standard 32 64-bit valid architectures include i386 powerpc ppc64 ppc7400 ppc970 x86_64 and build active architecture only is turned off

4145762
width	height
price table - foreign keys to both width and height table keys and corresponding price

4145762
width	height
now to insert your data into the database directly without manually entering each width and height combination by importing data from an excel sheet to a temporary table and writing appropriate sql scripts to insert data to height width and price tables

4145769
innodb	myisam
the solution should work on the latest version of mysql and may use either the innodb or myisam engine

4145871
mouseover	mousedown
the reason i want to get rid of it is that every so often i will move my mousedown toward the bottom of the screen and when i mouseover this area the mouse jumps all the way to the top-left of my screen

4145894
buttonclick	linkbutton
there you do an entirely new pageload but your original buttonclick that generates the link never happened now so the linkbutton is never made and the event can not be thrown

4145918
memcmp	strcmp
memcmp isn t intended to compare strings that would be strcmp

4145918
strlen	strcmp
strcmp and strlen can cause weird behaviour with bad c-style strings not ending with 0 or null

4145979
onclick	onchange
you may want to use the onchange event instead of onclick

4145980

queue	fifo
queue - fifo used for sequntial processing of data

4146126
freemarker	velocity
velocity and freemarker are both quite capable

4146126
freemarker	velocity
velocity s syntax is simpler and more distinct freemarker s heavier syntax allows them to support jsp libs

4146126
freemarker	velocity
freemarker provides much better native whitespace handling recent velocity releases provide more interesting content controls #define #evaluate # literal block #

4146126
freemarker	velocity
stringtemplate is also respectable though they are mvc nazis and can t match velocity or freemarker for features

4146131
factors	matrix
these are hence not the same factors as one would obtain by using f ml with f the factors matrix m the original matrix and l the loading matrix

4146141
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
if you already use a a vs setup project you can deploy the new versioning of this project and it will upgrade existing installation

why are you not just using show and hide

4149171
put	get
how do i get the jquery ui accordion to work when i need to put a wrapper around each element

4149201

the mongoid documentation says that each model includes activemodel validation which i thought would allow them to work with my custom validations

4149257
superclass	subclassing
it will be difficult to maintain if you do require different behaviour for each subclassing so you should think about whether you can move some logic into the carn classes or the car superclass and remove the dependency

4149277
cassini	iis
it works just fine while using cassini but when i deploy the site to a server running iis 7 static files are just returning a 404 and not even getting routed through the assemblypathprovider the class i wrote

4149380
irc	xmpp
i m comparing between irc xmpp and a third proprietary server i have

4149457
google-chrome	firefox
i m wondering if something is wrong with this svg file since i can not view it in firefox or google-chrome map of texas highlighting tarrant county

4149465

i would expect the first class would be one class and the second would be an inherited class which keeps track of which class it s instancing and if it s own properties is not set queries the parent object

4149469
width	height
i end up getting it to expand in width to 100 but in terms of height it is just 3 pixels high and there is a scrollbar to scroll to the bottom

i know very little about wordpress- is there an easy way to get the raw text of a post

4149533
super	extends
if you want pagecenter to access a protected attribute from pageindex using the super keyword then you should extends from pageindex

4149543
super	extends
super in your pagecenter class is referring to flowpanel because that is what it is extends

4149549
width	height
i decided how many pixels in width the border would be based on the screen width and height passed in on onsizechanged

4149549
width	height
then with columns and rows set to 10 that would leave 10 pixels left for both height and width

4149549
width	height
no matter what screen size is passed in i store exactly how many pixels in width the boarder is and the height width of each square on the board

4149549
screens	tablet
meaning if i create 3 different background bitmaps once for each density won t they still be resized to fit each devices screens resolution because from what i read there were not just 3 screens resolutions but 5 and now with tablet - even more

4149549
width	height
so far the examples i have looked at just show how to scale the overall bitmap and get the overall bitmaps width and height

4149549
width	height
i might not be able to find the exact width height and location of each playable square within a single scaled bitmap but by looking at the snake example in the sdk i see it doesn t create 1 bitmap for the entire board and scale it based on the screen dimensions - instead it creates a bitmap for each tile and then scales the tile based on the screen resolution and the number of tiles wanted on the screen - just like i do when i draw the board manually

4149549
width	height
i probably will have to do a similar approach for the borders so i can detect their width height as well after scaling

4149549
width	height
i detected the width and height of the screen through onsizechanged

4149549
width	height
now in order to detect how many pixels wide the border was scaled to and how many pixels in height width the squares were scaled to i first calculated how much the over all image was scaled

4149552
width	height
then you can give it 100 width and or height inside the body using css

4149600
post	get	rss	feed
best i can think of is get an rss plugin and read the post data using the feed that it generates

4149657
width	height
it gets the inner window width rather reliably and then sets the image width height

4149660
for-loop	loops
imagine the scenario where a starts the for-loop and gets to the first line in loops before getting interrupted

4149671

4149704
httphandler	httpmodule
if it does then check to see if it is setting a system.web httpmodule or httphandler or system.web identity impersonate or something like that and the application pool is running in integrated mode

4149704
httphandler	httpmodule
so what you need to do is either remove the offending httpmodule httphandler impersonate setting or change the application pool to run as classic or add the same configuration your site includes which is validation validateintegratedmodeconfiguration false

4149707
uiview	subviews
i have a subviews loaded into an uiview

4149717
portrait	landscape
the main one or at least the one on launch is in on landscape mode then if you go to any other view is in portrait

4149717
portrait	landscape
the problem comes when you try to go back to the first one landscape the view appears in portrait therefore all view is wrong displayed

4149729
margin	height
try setting the margin to the window s height minus the div s height all divided by two

4149795
stdout	stderr
if your application is built with the use multi-byte character set configuration option you can use cstdiofile to write to either stdout or stderr

4149815
width	height
then set the size of your iframe in pixels based on the height and width

4149815
width	height
you may have to add a bit to the height and width to account for margins

4149866
portrait	landscape
if you want to rotate to portrait and then back to landscape just return yes

4150026
inherited	properties
the object.create new date .getdate case is different the problem there is that the implementation of the getdate method relies on the internal time properties of the object it s called on which it cannot access because that particular properties is not inherited along the prototype chain

4150030
width	height
change the width and height of the element by twice the amount of the border-width change live demo

4150097
recv	epoll
just because epoll returns pollin doesn t mean there will be data available to read since recv may just return the error from the non-blocking connect call

4150097
recv	epoll
i think epoll returns all the registered events with pollerr to make sure the program calls send recv etc

4150155
hide	show

children	parent
i m assuming that you already have these nodes created and they were created with children but without the parent

4155172
children	parent
when creating the children set the parent i would think you don t really have control over this because you are asking this question so.

4155181

4156401
inherited	properties
instead on the data binding area of the crosstab properties set it to inherited from container

4156423
min	max
the reason why your example fails is that it will try to evaluate the data source and call the dates function and min and max operators when you define the query but the data source doesn t contain any data at that point

4156428
min	max
a workaround would be to have your dates method actually receive the observablecollection and call min max itself

4156448
put	get
datastore can get put serializable just fine

4156498
int	chars
istream get is not the right method to use as it reads chars not int

keep in mind that textures width and height needs to be a power of 2 on iphone ipad platform

4156680
google-chrome	firefox

i strongly suggest you utilise ant with ivy s dependency managment or use maven or any otehr build tool that has dependency management

4156717
nexus	artifactory
with either of those i d use a artifact repository maanger such as nexus or artifactory as well so you have the one true source for your internally built artifacts

4156722

put	get
normally during my build process i use adsiedit to navigate to that object and then go through all the security tabs to get down to put a checkmark next to

4156760

you need to be using trigonometry to determine the correct width height using transparency to prevent the black area and i think the transform is wrong which is making it off center

4156800

4156845
getter	setter
in java using a getter and setter is usually considered best practice

4156845
getter	setter
this is because if you ever need to change your code to do something else when a property is accessed or modified you can just change it in the existing getter or setter

4156845
getter	setter
i tend to think it causes a bit of clutter for simple objects but if you have ever had to refactor a public property to a getter and setter to add additional functionality you will see that it can be a pain

4156848
getter	setter
expression languages support setter and getter

4156848
getter	setter
if we are pedantic setter and getter for all fields also breaks encapsulation though

4156848
getter	setter
you may want to perform some extra logic inside the setter or getter but that is rarely advisable since consumers expect this to follow the convention - being a simple getter setter

4156848
getter	setter
you can specify only a setter or only a getter thus achieving read-only or write-only access

4156852
getter	setter
i suspect most will say to always use getter setter to access private members

4156856
getter	setter
using getter setter vs using fields

4156856
getter	setter
use the variables directly from the same class actually from the same .java file so inner classes are ok too use getter setter from other classes

4156873
children	parent
dest will be our parent table with children dest_one and dest_two which will contain information on things of type one or two respectively

4156876
getter	setter
getter and setter allow you to change the implementation later do something more complex allow you to implement validation rules setname throws an exception if the name is not more than 5 characters whatever.

4156876
getter	setter
you could also choose to add a getter but not a setter so that the variable is like read-only

4156876
getter	setter
in some companies i ve worked at it s been mandatory to write getter and setter for all attributes

4156950
getter	setter
in general you d want to use setter and getter to give the opportunity to developers reusing your code by modifying it or extending it to add layers of processing and control when accessing and modifying your internal data

4156950
getter	setter
in practice multiple people working on a class might not know what everyone s doing and those lines of integrity checking in your getter and setter might be useful in most cases while the micro-optimization may not

4157036
ubuntu	linux
i ve installed eclipse pdt helios sr1 gtk for 64bit linux ubuntu maverick clean install

4157103
maven	pom.xml

chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked r n

4157106
fast-forward	merge
however if the merge is one that would be fast-forward you don t need to check out the target branch because you don t actually need to merge anything - all you have to do is update the branch to point to the new head ref

4157106
fast-forward	merge
don t use it unless you are sure you the merge will be fast-forward

4157178
opera	firefox
you re trying to implement http push or http streaming or whatever the issue is that not all browsers will support this correctly for browsers such as firefox opera etc you could try the mime-type multipart x-mixed-replace so as long as you keep the connection live and send stuff down firefox should read but this will not work in ie.

4157240
voip	sip
the most common case for sip is voip

4157240
voip	sip
the same applies to documentation sip documentation will tend to be geared around voip

i ve placed a sqldatasource control on the page and then tried putting a formview control there and an image control within that

4157435
fast-forward	merge
as amber said fast-forward merge are the only case in which you could conceivably do this

4157435
fast-forward	merge
i happen to have a script around i use for exactly this doing fast-forward merge without touching the work tree unless you re merging into head

4157435
fast-forward	merge
it s a little long because it s at least a bit robust - it checks to make sure that the merge would be a fast-forward then performs it without checking out the branch but producing the same results as if you had - you see the diff --stat summary of changes and the entry in the reflog is exactly like a fast forward merge instead of the reset one you get if you use branch -f

4157437
hash	md5
a hash function such as md5 or a simpler one usually including a modulo operator can be used for this

4157442
min	max
since speed seems to be dependent on the min and max scroll speeds i kept them close to the min and max zooms every time it actually zooms using the uiscroll delegate

4157451
dictionary	map
the immutable dictionary implementation is faster but no less pure in usage than the map implementation

for-loop	arrays
if both the arrays are of the same size you can use a for-loop as

4157893
post	get
i can t help with the coding side of your question but if you re passing in a non-url input then the post method would be more appropriate than get

4157895
post	get
when the user clicks on a link when the http server receives a new get post request a function gets called on the object tight to the user session in a nice signal slot way which can remove add change the widgets thus changing the page the user will see

4157896
yslow	pagespeed
i have yslow and showslow and pagespeed integrated into our continuous build in a way that when tests are run yslow will pass metrics like pageload time pageweight etc to the showslow server which in turn displays the result graphically

that answer also links to an apple doc that advises creating a custom directory in app home library something like private documents make sure the folder name is unique since library is maintained in backups and upgrades and hidden from the user

4159460
hide	show
so i want to show the home view controller though the unzipping process is not completed for that i have to hide the button on the navigation bar when the unzipping starts on backround thread and after completion of the upzipping again i have to show the button on navigation bar

free	malloc
make sure if the memory allocated by your application using new or malloc or any other memory allocation library call are released back using delete or free or any equivalent library call

4159500
post	get
many times i can get around the based authentication with html and javascript that post the right credentials

4159505
super	extends
i m using the google maps v3 library with the multi-marker library which extends the functionality of google maps for super fast adding of map marker icons to a map

4159643
pull	push
i d like to somehow add that file to another repo keeping the link to the old one so i can push pull to keep up to date with it while keeping all the other files out

4159648
versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade to a versioning that is

4159657
allocator	stl
stl containers use an allocator they are given at construction time with a default allocator that uses operator new and operator delete

4159665
google-chrome	safari
i noticed that in google-chrome and safari my courier text is tiny

4159733
hash	md5
another point to avoid collisions in addition to the executable name and directory use an md5 hash of the executable file

4159779
coalesce	isnull
in a similar vein i had a dba suggest that i should replace coalesce xyz 0 with isnull xyz 0

4159803
stdout	fflush
you need to fflush stdout after the printf to be sure of seing the prompt before the scanf

4159899
hide	show
by the way all the show and hide effects are all working

4159900
put	get
lastly circumstances depending if you find you are starting to get a lot of if else logic in your view sometimes it is cleaner to put that into a html helper

profiling	debugging
it s possible that the debugging profiling api lets you get at this obviously only the as-yet-uncollected instances but not in normal code

4159923
hex	binary
as far as i know there is no difference between a hex number and a decimal number they are all constants and have equal performance since they are all represented as binary numbers in the computer

4159993
des	rsa	rsa	3des
cryptographic algorithms that such cards can use include des 3des triple des rsa and sha1

4159994
boost	stl
however the practice of stl containers and boost numeric ublas vector is to return stored values via const reference

4159997
ocl	uml
i would say that generally best way to express constraints on uml models when the semantics are not easily modeled by uml model elements is to use ocl constraints

4160000
width	height
setting width height in css only corresponds to the content area

4160000
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
is there a way to set the offset width height dimensions including padding margin borders of an element in css

4160023
pull	push
instead of guessing what server is available to push jobs to based on stale data queue the jobs and let the servers pull them when they re actually available to work

4160040
hide	show
we tell that onclick that on a click hide all elements with the class hidable and then show the div with the id of the rel attribute value in this link

please give me version of your ubuntu uname -a cat etc lsb-release exact release svn revision number of clang and llvm and gcc -v output

4160375
profiling	debugging
i can compile and profiling with amd tools and sleepy in debugging mode

4160403
profiling	instrumentation
profiling is only really meaningful on optimized builds so tools are designed to work with them -- thus if you re getting meaningless results it s probably due to the profiling not finding the right symbols or needing to instrumentation the build

4160407
slideup	slidedown
you should call slidedown on the selected div and slideup on the other two

4160492
width	height
dialog.setsize width height should work

4160499
width	height
for a project i am storing my board as a 2d vector and the user will enter the height and width of it as well as perhaps the starting configuration

4160504
mediarecorder	videoview
i can record video from the on board camera using mediarecorder and i can receive an rtsp stream using mediaplayer or videoview but i don t know how to combine the two

4160505
width	height
php crop image to fix width and height without losing dimension ratio

4160555
width	height
then you would scan the first row to find the width check each row for valid characters and the same width and count the rows to find the height

4160576
erd	diagram
each time i approach a problem and attempt to come up with a design following oo strategies my diagram uml classes for example come out looking like an erd

4160583
inherited	subclassing
i would argue that the subclassing examples you suggest could just as easily be implemented as wrapper classes around a templated container favouring code reuse through composition over inherited something advocated by the gang of four amongst others

4160592
int	chars
the value representation could then be a int or chars and is easily accessible

4160601
textarea	textbox
i ve used some textbox and textarea for that

4160650
zipoutputstream	zipfile
and on the other side zipoutputstream is used if your have the contents and need to combine them into a zipfile

4160657
multiplication	modulo
the solution below uses a multiplication to space the lower 4 bits into higher bits and then the modulo of a 2 n-1 number to roll the bits back down

4160679
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
so far it works fine in firefox but not in safari or google-chrome

4160679
google-chrome	safari
in safari and google-chrome the .content divs appear beneath their respective accordion panes rather than retaining their position and exhibiting the width animation

4160693
tcplistener	tcpclient
i am working on a network project which uses tcplistener and tcpclient

4160733
range	max

4160743
getter	setter
however if i don t want to bind to hibernate is there a way to do it in pure jpa without using getter setter

4160748
getter	setter
what is the point of setter and getter in java

4160788
getter	setter
in object oriented programming a good practice is to expose getter and setter to allow other class to interact with a class content instead of making member variables public

4160859
postgresql	mysql
what you are trying to do is somehow valid in mysql but invalid in standard sql postgresql and common sense

4160859
filtering	grouping
you can also put additional having clause after grouping that contains aggregate function expression that can also be used as post-group filtering

4160870
fink	macports
zeroth question have you considered using a package manager like fink or macports rather than compiling yourself

4160873
int	chars
how to convert to such that every two chars becomes an int using c++

4160901
public	protected
the idea is that functions can be disabled by changing them from public to protected rather than renaming them or removing them

4160901
public	protected
i currently do this but it doesn t matter if the command is public or protected

4160943
imperative	declarative
though this seems to be only a declarative statement but indeed the compiler will generate many imperative instructions for it

4161012
maven	m2e
i m just starting to explore maven and i use m2e as to use maven in eclipse

4161022
folder	directory
i have a folder in my local directory that is untracked

4161060
getter	setter
there are two main reasons for coding setter and getter

4161060
getter	setter
there are several libraries apis like freemarker that absolutly depend on haveing getter and setter methods in your class

4161060
getter	setter
so by building in getter and setter from the start you are building in both the flexibilty to do more exotic things within your class while at the same time providing a stable interface to your class users which wont rquire them to change thier code every time there is a small change in functionality

4161087
children	parent
another difference is that fork ed children can outlive their parent where as all threads die when the process terminates

4161095
inherited	properties
your usercontrol will inherited the datacontext from the window so you can bind properties on the listbox as though it were declared in the window

4161130
int	double
if the values in in are int don t use double quotation marks like this

4161209
width	height
new_x and new_y should be divided by the images height width not the container s height width which is wider

4161209
mousemove	mouseenter
no need to bind mousemove on mouseenter which rebinds the mousemove will only occur when you re inside anyway

4161244
octal	binary
you can easily format numbers in octal hexadecimal or binary without the clutter of running them through a function storing the result in a temporary variable and passing it through echo

4161258
octal	hex
you can convert numbers to octal hex

4161265
post	get
hi in order to get around your issues with your constraints please read this blog post i wrote on the subject

4161276
udp	tcp
sockets read write if tcp and other functions for udp if you will use it etc.

4161277
hide	show
the idea is to have the div show or hide via animation either on click or hover of that link

4161363
post	get
my problem is when i post and enter the post version of the customize method i only get a value for thing3 the one that i typed into the textbox. is there any way to get the values i populated in the get version of the customize method to carry over

4161392

i m binding a grid view inside a for-loop which executes more than once.now when loops ends the data in grid view is the data binded at the last run of for-loop i.e all previous binds in the for-loop over overwritten.i dont want this .i want new rows to be inserted at each run of the for-loop ..plz help somebody

4161468
folder	directory
there are about 12-13 files that must be in the directory of the folder some .dlls some .xml files etc. for the application to run and i want to make my application as compact as possible meaning i want as fewer files to go with the application

4161468
folder	directory
i was thinking to make a folder for all those files but i don t think my application will run if a .dll file isn t placed in the same directory as the application

4161485
listener	eventhandler
as such you much attach a listener to the downloadcompleted event handler and move all processing to that eventhandler

would i be better off creating callbacks for each of the types i need mouse keyboard gamepad etc

4161589
pull	push
i prefer websites so i went with asp.net s mvc 2 then started writing all the parts of those books namely a data repository services to pull data and control to push it

4161593
post	get
i will tell you one last time but if you do not post it we can not help you even the opposite your post get downvoted

4161619
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox still apply all styles with no problem

4161640
int	double
if possible i would like to solve this problem because i ve got a project that doesn t use double to deal with prices it converts to int after treat the string just like that but in javascript i understand some parts of the code but i don t know how to implement in groovy java but i ll paste it anyway

4161717
int	chars
i m assuming that your chars array contains bytes instead of actual ascii chars which you want to convert into 16-bit signed int

4161848
cvs	svn
think svn cvs git all these versioning control system help u to branch trunk tag for your code to each clients projects

4161951
int	chars
access through char_buf when dealing with chars access through int_buf when dealing with int

4161970
ant	maven
for automated builds you might want to consider looking into ant maven or ivy but for getting started an ide has a smaller learning curve with a lot of extra benefits code completion debugging a ui for reviewing junit test failures...

4161975
yslow	pagespeed
i do not want to load javascripts in as i am trying to optimize my site per pagespeed yahoo yslow recommendations

4161981
rss	feed
if you have an rss feed for each forum you could grab this feed and based on the feed then email your cell phone say at t you send to number txt.att.net

4161989
children	parent
what kind of restrictions would you put on kids or do you let the parent do the login for their respective children

4162005
hide	show
if you want to show and hide an existing element then can do something like

4162008
fflush	gets
the problem is when i retrive the user by username using a criteria query and fflush the session all the security roles attached to the retrieved user gets deleted and re-inserted again although i do not make any modifications to the retrived object

4162038
i2c	spi
you might also consider this usb-spi i2c adapter if you have an available i2c or spi interface and you can handle the wiring

4162038
i2c	spi
it says it can go to 400 khz i2c or 200 khz spi which is still not quite enough by itself but you could split the data between the spi i2c and the serial link you already have

4162054
versioning	upgrade
it has a freeware versioning with upgrade available

4162068
elementname	datagrid
all you need to do is change the value of elementname to the actual name of the datagrid ie datagrid1 instead of datagrid

4162090
vim	emacs
i m told that facebook generally uses vim or emacs for development but i m hoping for a more full-blown ide that supports this syntax

4162131
scatter	graphing
i then processed my log with a script which extracted the times per url and did scatter plot graphing and trend graphing based on load

4162176
onclick	onfocus
the first onclick i want to use to populate the list and the second onfocus i am using on select a value to make an ajax call to other jsp script

4162225
onchange	onfocus
why don t you try something like calling second method on onchange event instead of onfocus like

4162232
cos	sin
i have already defined sin cos but i am having a lot of trouble with atain2

4162259
google-chrome	firefox
the behaviour is exactly as expected in both firefox and google-chrome but good old ie issues a postback when the row that is not selected is clicked in the button column

4162270
google-chrome	firefox
my questions are what s special about the page and why does google-chrome and firefox throw an exception

4162280
coldfusion	railo
if i wanted to set up load balancing for my railo coldfusion application with the least fail points which of the following two setups would be most optimal and why

4162327
width	height
width 560 height 345 flashvars i 130553 allowfullscreen true width 560 height 345 pluginspage

4162336
folder	directory
- one thing i failed to mention is that all of the build servers have the same installation structure for cruisecontrol.net on them and the installation directory is directly accessible through a folder share

4162382
cos	sin	cos	atan2	atan2	sin
depending on your required precision you might consider precalculating a table of the cos sin atan2 etc values and just use a simple lookup of the closest value

4162428
google-chrome	firefox
but if the height is changed to 1px or 0 then the shadow doesn t have a good blur and is uniform in color and is lighter too on both firefox and google-chrome

4162465
int	chars
there are hash functions that will map a byte chars short or int to a unique int but a hash function that maps long values to unique int values is impossible

4162480
jdk1.6	jdk1.5
previously with jdk1.5 we used hpjmeter it worked fine but now with jdk1.6 it doesn t

4162513
post	get
in your python code parse the json post in my example is where you get your post data in your cgi script

4162520
mef	prism
i am looking to build an application using prism mef where i can offer new plug-ins for the application from time to time

4162525
post	get
when i post a link all i get is the link people can click

4162537
prng	random
the proper way to generate unbiased random numbers between 0 inclusive and k exclusive is this first get a proper prng that gives you a large-enough random number say 32 random bits

4162546
for-loop	loops
the basic structure for-loop commands is where n is the number of times loops will execute

4162567
std	ostream
the in std ostream that are defined as member functions aren t virtual

4162604
google-chrome	firefox
in ie firefox and google-chrome the browser offers to remember the login credentials but our client is using some built in lotus notes browser and it doesn t seem to offer this service

4162622
button	checkbox
why images of asp.net toggle button created with checkbox doesn t show inside updatepanel in webusercontrol

4162666
voip	sip
however you need to install another sip server for voip services

4162726
ubuntu	linux
today i installed ubuntu and lazarus ide delphi style cross platform ide i don t know nothing about the structure of linux operating systems.do u know some tutorials that can get me started specially with lazarus does linux have modules and api s or how it works

4162740
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i am able to create textbox dropdownlistfor and checkbox in property panel but found no way to create button and other controls

4162775
post	get
if the post get data with any key is not defined then instead of raising an exception the fallback value second argument of .get will be used

4162824
width	height
thus the amount of memory gd will need to work with the image is directly proportional to its size width x height whereas the image you re uploading is probably compressed and thus may be much smaller on your own disk

4162839
for-loop	loops	lapply	grepl
in the above function we use x instead of the list name spamdata because when lapply and sapply loops over the spamdata list the individual components referenced by in the for-loop get passed to our function as argument x so we only need to refer to x in the grepl call

4162859
uiview	subviews
in this app i did the following i add two uiview s as subviews to the window of the application

4162859
portrait	landscape
now comes the problem i wanted to add the option to rotate the device from portrait to landscape and back

4162867
int	double
60 and 23 are int literals so you are doing int division and then assigning to a double

4162871
width	height
but i need to use percentages rather than px values for the left top width and height parameters

4162920
serializable	deserialization
assuming your function objects are stateless which is usually the case you could skip the serializable deserialization step

4162930
portrait	landscape
i want to do orientation from portrait to landscape but the issue is it is not changing on orientation

4162947
strcpy	strncpy
you need to either pass the length as an additional parameter like strncpy does or zero-terminate the array like strcpy does

4162967
gridview	calendarextender
i have a gridview where one of the cells holds a textbox with a calendarextender attached to it

4162985
post	get
this call will need to pass the query variables to the server via post or get

4162992
jar	war
and this log4j.xml will be packaged into jar-module.jar file however i would like to make it into web-inf classes directory in the war package rather than in the jar file so that users will be easy to find this configuration file and modify it if necessary it is very hard for them to find it if this file is in the web-inf lib jar-module.jar because there are many other jars under that directory

4162998
puts	gets
edit i should mention that i have checked that the parameter gets set correctly in around_recognize - a puts of the params collection here does indeed contain the correct shop object

4163012
udp	tcp
it would be more to the point to get rid of udp at the sender rather than try to shoehorn it somehow into your tcp design at the receiver where it is already too late

4163042
metaclass	subclassing
first because in your comments you said that subs was a bunch of classes in a list some of which might be its subclassing and more importantly because that is not the case with the code in my update which only works for base subclassing since they are effectively registered automatically via the metaclass -- but leave anything other in the list alone

4163042
metaclass	subclassing
exactly the same thing can also be done using a metaclass -- which has the advantage that it eliminates the need to explicitly decorate each subclassing as shown in the accepted answer above and instead makes it happen automagically

4163042
metaclass	subclassing
note that even though the metaclass s __init__ is called for the creation of every subclassing it only updates the subs list if that subclassing s name appears in it -- so the initial base class definition of the contents of subs still controls what gets put in it and in what order

4163049
int	double
the reason the fixed-decimal solution using __int64 as underlying type is even discussed is that someone claimed that double performance is still significantly worse than processing float s and that we might see significant performance benefits using a native int type to store our numbers

4163079
children	parent
if i have two entities parent and child parent needs to know about all of its child children and every child instance needs to know about its parent parent instance how do i do this properly in terms of ddd etc

4163088
int	double
so double will probably be significantly slower than floats but comparing with int is difficult and i d prefer float double over fixedpoint is most scenarios

4163111
ant	maven
i have been tasked with getting these ant scripts to run from maven using antrun and i ve gotten some of the way but not all.

4163136
cos	sin	cos	exp
divisions square roots and transcendental functions exp log sin cos etc. are usually notably slower with double arguments since their runtime is dependent on the desired accuracy

4163136
int	double
if you go fixed point multiplies and divisions need to be implemented with long int multiply divide instructions which are usually slower than arithmetic on double s since processors aren t optimized as much for it

4163136
128bit	64bit
even more so if you re running in 32 bit mode where a long 64bit multiply with 128bit results needs to be synthesized from several 32-bit long multiplies

4163136
int	double
64-bit int and double are the same size - if you need more than 32 bits you re gonna eat that penalty no matter what

4163163
hide	show
but i won t use this to hide show items instead wrap the content with another div and slidetoggle it like this

4163197
udp	tcp
your tcp clients are not picking up the packets quickly enough causing the buffer to fill up which forces the server to block which causes it to miss udp packets

4163203
google-chrome	firefox
on my machine and many others using a mixture of google-chrome ie 7 8 9b and firefox this is working as expected

4163230
getter	setter
this means that i have a component class with setter and getter for attribute type

4167952
range	min	range	max	min	max
for an enumeration where e min is the smallest enumerator and e max is the largest the values of the enumeration are the values of the underlying type in the range b min to b max where b min and b max are respectively the smallest and largest values of the smallest bit-field that can store e min and e max

4167952

i can reproduce this problem with a minimal maven project created with the maven-archetype-plugin and adding the following to the pom.xml

4167966
typemock	moles
you could try using an isolator like typemock or maybe moles to simulate the firing of the created event

4167970
range	min	range	max	min	max
otherwise for an enumeration where e min is the smallest enumerator and e max is the largest the values of the enumeration are the values in the range b min to b min defined as follows

4167970
min	max
b max is the smallest value greater than or equal to max | e min | âˆ k | e max | and equal to 2 m âˆ 1 where m is a non-negative integer

4167970
min	max
b min is zero if e min is non-negative and âˆ b max + k otherwise

4167970
min	max
e min -10 e max 1000000

4167970
min	max
e min -6 e max unspecified

4167970
min	max
if that unspecified is indeed less than 5 then b max must be 7 and b min is -8

4167987
post	get
all payloads are json and we ve written a little wrapper around httpwebrequest to do all our get post requests

4167997
stdout	stderr

width	height
you could give this class some variable properties like width height x etc

4168043

int	double
there are casts where you are giving a hint to the compiler about reality - hey this thing of type object is actually of type customer - and there are casts where you are telling the compiler to perform a mapping from one type to another - hey i need the int that corresponds to this double

4168672
int	double
if you need a result in int then why are you holding a double in the first place

4168682

getter	setter
you could use a function to set the property though â the same sort of a getter setter arrangement you might use in a language that supported private data in classes

4169595
width	height
technically you don t need to wait till the whole image is downloaded you can poll the image in a timer until width and height are non-zero

4169607

put	get
you can try simple sorting algorithms and it works sometimes but there can be little stragglers and strays pieces of text that don t get put in the order you thought they would.

4169684
put	get
otherwise the query will be very inefficient - you will have to get a the whole hierarchy sorted by left number that will put very first child be first join it to itself to make sure that for each next node left number is equal to previous node right number + 1

4169697
stdout	stderr
replacing stdin stdout and stderr before executing external programs - but it s not clear to me whether posix requires freopen to reuse the same file descriptor number as the original file had or not so i m not sure this is guaranteed to work

gtk	gdk
if you want to consider other windows than the ones from your application then you could try gtk.gdk.screen_get_default .get_toplevel_windows but this will only get you gdk windows and not gtk windows because you have no way of knowing whether those gdk windows are actually associated with gtk windows

4169980
lisp	scheme
scheme has been defined before common lisp by almost a decade

4169980
cdr	cons
scheme still had legacy like s-expressions cons cells symbols car cdr cons and more

4169980
lisp	scheme
that scheme has legacy makes it a member of the family of lisp languages which has its roots in the first lisp from 1958

4169980
lisp	scheme
scheme s initial goal was to be a small clean language that is closer to lambda calculus than traditional lisp

that is tell the compiler that ptr refers to a chars then get that chars value which is promoted to an int in an argument list and subsequently output correctly by the d specifier

4170128
int	chars
the parsing will end at the dash as that can t be a part of an int except as the first chars

4170254
daemons	launchd
that code is all being launchd from a daemons thread created earlier

4170274
int	chars
without the typecast the compiler doesn t know if you want to read a chars usually 1 byte a short usually 2 bytes or an int usually 4 bytes

4170274
int	double
and this will compile but won t look up customer 69 a double is not an int

4170409
bash	zsh
in bash and ksh zsh dash etc. you can use parameter expansion with which will remove characters from the end of the string or # which will remove characters from the beginning of the string

4170416

if you are running a software package like wordpress or phpbb you could google around to find a plugin that did it for you

4170482
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
for example a hash consisting of 32 hex digits might well be one or more repetitions of md5 and if you can get a single input output pair then it is quite easy to confirm or refute this although see salt below

4170498
client-side	server-side
you need a server-side proxy anyways and it will keep the client-side code simpler

i was hoping that i could get the dev_appserver.py application to display the post data in the request line but i can t seem to find a way to do that

4170741
background-image	background-position
you might also be able to fix the issue by making a single sprite image and have your hover class change the background-position instead of changing the background-image

4170787
width	height
i wouldn t scale the image every single time in the paintcomponent method but do it once if the width and height have been changed since the last call and in that case recreate a bufferedimage containing the image which you blit every single time before calling the superclass paintcomponent scaled up to the right size use something like image scaling does not work when original image height width is smaller the scaling height width

4170794
folder	directory
im having trouble converting a working solution that takes a directory folder as an input and outputs the filenames and other file attributes of files container in the folder into an excel spreadsheet to a recursive solution that also outputs the files contained in subfolders

if you really need a random permutation you generate a full filtered sequence in advance with this same algorithm shuffle it and consume the values one by one

4171073
subtract	add
to that number we add or subtract our interval and then cast the new number back to an nsdate

4171128
width	height
the negative margins are there to offset the positive margins to prevent the width and height of the anchor from changing affecting the surrounding elements

4171144
hash	md5
if you really want to use an md5 hash in this way i would suggest precomputing the hash value of questionid and storing it in a column of the questions table

4171144
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
you may also wish to use a salt so that your md5 hash are not easily converted to their original value

4171279
google-chrome	firefox
any ideas what cause firefox and google-chrome to render the css in one way and ie in another way

4171309
versioning	upgrade
while i also use versioning control to do this another approach you might consider is to package up the source using whatever package management your host systems use for example rpms or dpkgs and set up the systems to use a custom repository then an apt-get upgrade or yum update will update the software on the systems

4171310
public	protected
to me this helps preserve encapsulation and abstraction because i am not modifying the public or protected interface of the class

most of the things can be done using the api of cfstring and nsstring which supports unicode out of the box

4171536
cfstring	nsstring
so please do learn cfstring and nsstring methods

4171573
pow	sqrt
2-norm or euclidean distance distance sqrt pow r1-r2 2 + pow g1-g2 2 + pow b1-b2 2 you compute the square of this which is fine - you can avoid the sqrt if you re just checking against a threshold by squaring the threshold too

4171683
post	get
post your code and expand on your question to get a better response

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	background-color	transparency
i can accomplish this in safari firefox and google-chrome by having my toolbar sit on top of everything on a transparency background height 100 and background-color transparency for both the div and iframe

4171766

4171854
datamapper	activerecord
using datamapper instead of activerecord

4171859
hash	salt
i just looked at the implementation of password hashing in django and noticed that it prepends the salt so the hash is created like sha1 salt + password for example

4171859
hash	salt
with a prepended salt one must calculate hash salt store the hash algorithm s state and then go on from that point for each permutation

4171859
hash	salt
as copying the hash algorithm s state is freakin fast the salt hardly adds any complexity here no matter how long it is

4171859
hash	salt
but with an appended salt the attacker must calculate for each permutation leading to 26 10 hash operations

4171925
tostring	string.format
so the various tostring string and string.format overloads that don t take a culture will use the thread s current culture system.globalization.cultureinfo.currentculture to format

put	get
i guess if you allocate a buffer large enough it ll have to get another few pages and then it ll put the buffer at the start of the first page

4173971

i m working on a game and want the freedom to choose between udp and tcp connections in the future when i decide to add multiplayer

4174670
udp	tcp
the first is that a player becomes the host of the game in the browser and thus would need to communicate with other players directly via tcp or udp

4174670
udp	tcp
the second scenario would be to have the web server host the game and pass messages back and forth to the clients again via tcp or udp

4174672

width	height
i tried messing around with the avmutablecomposition naturalsize changing the width and height around but that just made my people look short and fat

4175127
fread	atof
also from reading the docs it seems like i could just use fread to load all of the contents of the file into a string and then use atof to parse out each double

4175153
width	height
you should rather look at view lifecycle generally you should not know width and height for sure until your activity comes to onresume state

4175210
firefox	safari
hi people when you fill a form in safari and submit to a preview page when you click back it takes you to the original form and still shows the selected item against asking you yo select anything fresh for some reasons what soever firefox does not do this it there a way to make it do this so that one can have a uniform experience on different platform

4175231
for-loop	arrays

4175536
rss	feed
i switched to nokogiri several years ago because i had some html and rss feed that caused hpricot to explode

4175550
g++	gcc

4175789
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
by default htpasswd uses the standard crypt function and thus passwords are already salt - note in this example that both users have the same password yet the hash are different

4175789
hash	salt
the first two characters of the hash are the salt

4175915
hash	md5
very simple method generate an md5 hash using the source files as input

4175951
multiplying	modulo
i think multiplying hashes together modulo a prime might work if the underlying hash function had an unrealistically strong guarantee such as n-independence

4175958
free	malloc
of course feel free to continue using malloc and free instead of and if the data is being handed off to code that assume that malloc was used

4175962
versioning	upgrade
if your app is truly good then people will pay again for the upgrade versioning

4175974
int	chars
the method setmnemonic chars mnemonic is obsolete you should use setmnemonic int mnemonic with the appropriate vk_e instead

4176042
int	double
in general when passing data to and from an unmanaged dll via a p invoke call unless the data being passed is a vanilla type int double string - with appropriate marshal decoration i pass data as an intptr

4176044
folder	directory
etc -- the file exists is in the images folder which is one level up -- i can even say ls .. images backbutton.png from the directory this script sits in and it outputs backbutton.png as i d expect

4176109
mkplacemark	mkreversegeocoder
fwiw if you are using mapkit you can also use the mkreversegeocoder to obtain an mkplacemark

4176116
mouseup	mousedown
so you should simulate mousedown click and mouseup which by the way is what the iphone ipod touch and ipad do on tap events

4176156
jobs	cron
cron jobs are automatic and cannot rely on any human interaction

4176159
textview	listactivity
i have two textview a listview this is a listactivity by the way and a datepicker

4176168
post	get
and since you can t dynamically tell the client that the input is wrong via javascript you ll have to go through a post validate get page reload cycle to tell the client the input was invalid

4176177
minimum	max
i tried to find the minimum execution time for each pk and then find the max but i doubt my solution is dynamic programming since there is no recursive formula

4176185
put	get
i m struggling to get a design like i put in this image in css

4176208
sorting	filtering
1 since i am filtering only on the top-level children i would have to re-implement whatever method was actually doing the sorting so that it would leave all the grandchildren alone right

4176292
post	get
i have re-done the 2 date pickers but still cant get the post to function

4176292
post	get
no matter how i write the get or post function it does not work.

4176294
width	height
you will need to complete the code for instance you have to give a width and height to the relativelayout tag put your textviews etc.

4176302
hide	show
only other way that i can think of is to re-write all three of your pages and combine them into one then you can use javascript to show and hide part of the page and you can use media print css stylesheet to show all of them when the document is being printed

4176308
min	max
the values are strings and i need them to be decimals 2 decimal points and also the min and the max for price and low accross all the rows

4176332
min	max
try to figure out max min yourself

4176361
width	height
an application can build scroll bars for a certain height or width and not actually render anything to the surface until the user actual drags the scroll bar

4176366
x86	mips
you can cross-compile the gcc so that it generates mips code instead of x86

4176375
keydown	keyup
you need to implement keyup and keydown events

4176390
getter	setter
a poco is simply a class that represents your data however it s not just bags of getter and setter

4176390
getter	setter
they are only bags of getter and setter

4176456
serializable	deserialization
don t spend all your time fretting about serializable and deserialization

4176534
strlen	strcpy
i ran some tests of it against strcpy + strlen and your custom algorithm and in my environment it beat both

4176534
strlen	strcpy
i don t know how well it will work in yours though since for me your algorithm runs much faster than you saw and strcpy + strlen much slower 14.4s for the former vs

4176550
google-chrome	firefox
couldn t believe it at first but tested in google-chrome and firefox

4176566
fossil	git
interestingly enough but recently after i ve asked this question fossil got import export commands so that now it s possible to use git s fast-import export protocol

4176574
openssl	libcrypto
i am looking for a js crypto lib similar to say openssl s libcrypto that facilitates digital signing of data in the browser

4176581
shadowing	named
as for named shadowing - i think it s generally good to avoid if you can - seeing map in the middle of some code will lead most haskellers to expect the standard library fn

4176617
post	get
looks like you actually want to get not to post the params

4176706
put	get
you don t want to put them in the webapp tree because they will get clobbered if your webapp is redeployed

4176707
children	parent
how can i dynamically list all children under their respective parent such as.

4176710
uiview	subviews
generally we use empty uiview at the top of hierarchy and put the subviews inside which is uilabel in your case

4176715
cout	ofstream
like cout your instance of ofstream shares the behaviour of ostream which already has a suitable operator for strings and can be used exactly as cout

4176715
std	ostream
if you need to stream an object that doesn t have overloaded for std ostream then you you will need to overload the operator like this

4176728
median	minimum
and i ve only seen it be able to plot a minimum and a maximum together with a data point in between presumably for an average and i see no good way of fitting the median and deviation into that model

4176743
width	height
alternatively if you actually want to know what those width and height values were for example to populate tag attributes

4176761
getter	setter
changing the getter and the setter to use an integer object does the trick

4176762
typedef	struct
i m new to cuda c and am trying to pass a typedef d struct into a kernel

4176764
trie	tree
auto-suggest is usually done using the data-structures trie or radix-tree .here is a good implementation of radix tree .for zk frame work check this link

4176843
x86	64bit
also if you are using 64bit os you will need to change both paths to use program files x86

4176847
ati	nvidia
it s difficult to know the exact details of everything that s going on because nvidia and ati are relatively tight-lipped but the key thing is that gpus are made for massively parallel execution

4176849
cvs	svn
the tool cvs2hg might also help to convert to mercurial if you can convert from svn to cvs without information loss

4176871
post	get

i ve created a .net wrapper that simplifies using exchange push pull notifications in your own applications

4176945
maya	blender
remember that that the representation of a model in max maya or blender is very different than the run time version

4177005
width	height
if you use absolute positioning you will need to listen to the resize event and then start calculating the height width x y of each element

4177053
median	minimum
a standard way to display median statistics is the box-and-whisker -plot which shows minimum first quartile median third quartile and maximum

4177053
median	minimum
this assumes that your data file has the columns x-value minimum first quartile median third quartile maximum in that order

4177069
post	get
when my facebook app post to the users stream those post do not get links for like and comment

4177095
folder	directory
select your source folder and click add tree to add the whole directory structure to the project

4177097

so basically i want the mouseover mouseout functionality to be disabled when the input box has focus and then when it doesn t have focus anymore re-enable the mouseover mouseout functionality

4177138
put	get
if top is neither put sentinel in top get value from result put result - next in top delete result

4177186
bluetooth	usb
that is given a local machine with a standard usb keyboard plugged into it other devices could discover this machine and use it as a bluetooth keyboard

4177214
onfocus	onblur
more generally to detect whether an element has focus you might want to flag it somehow in its onfocus handler and clear the flag in its onblur handler

4177272
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
for zips you can use public libraries like sharpziplib or dotnetzip

4177325

will create a new folder called myproject inside your current working directory with a default skeleton structure

4177361
int	double
try not to think of a union as a variant type that can be either a byte or a double or an int depending on which member you happened to write most recently

4177399
serializable	deserialization
in that case it s usually better to create a dedicated serializable deserialization function rather than relying on any particular memory layout

4177410
getter	setter
to best understand these things you should study the use of property s assign and retain and the code behind the synthesized setter and getter

4177418
cublas	magma
for dense matrix operations you could consider cublas provided with the cuda toolkit magma and culatools

4177429
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
it can t be interface inherited subtyping since by only inheriting a subset of attributes a subclassing instance would not be substitutable for a superclass instance

4177429
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
for example assume the superclass exposed properties a that the subclassing didn t inherited

4177429
superclass	subclassing
at run time a variable v declared as the superclass type gets bound to an instance of the subclassing

4177452
uiview	subviews
the easiest way to fix this is to set the view of photoviewcontroller to a regular uiview and add the scrollview as a subviews of this uiview

4177482
tabcontrol	tabitem
if i set the path stretch property to fill it will stretch so much that each tabitem header will be the same width as the tabcontrol - which mean only one very wide tabitem header per line.

i think the slightly more proper modern way it way is to put a non hidden file under a folder with your apps name under the the config directory directory

4177991
public	protected
my classes are event driven so for example the public mouseclick calls the protected onmouseclick

4178001

these two values could be used to represent a position as well as a width and height

4178041
post	get
being very new to jsp i was wondering if there was any possibility to get only get or only post parameters from the http request

4178041
post	get
i have seen servletrequest.getparameter and alikes but it seems that those methods get both get and post parameters

4178041
post	get
and if not is there any precedence rule which values overwrite which like post parameters always overwriting get parameters

4178053
post	get
it would return get or post

4178055

stupid i know but i had assumed the order of operations was viewdidload viewwillappear and then viewdidappear

4178300
width	height
you d need to hardcode the initial values might replace an unintended similar string the code doesn t really communicate your intention to change height width not to manipulate strings

4178329
width	height
you would have to know which instances of vector2 are representing a starting point and which ones are representing a width height

4178931
hash	salt
to mitigate this you could hash your password preferably with a salt

4178931
hash	salt
well in order to mitigate a rainbow attack you can use a salt in other words another value added to the password that will create a different hash

4178931
hash	salt
a simple salt can be the username store hash username + password instead of hash password

4178931
hash	salt
now since hash are fast to compute the salt should be hidden somehow

4178931
hash	salt
well evil eve will have a tough time penetrating your login screen by now hash passwords with salt and iterations and all

4178948
children	parent
you ll need to get the children first and the parent of the parent control and then add the children back to the parent of the parent control

4178981
terminate	timeout
i ideally would like to have a separate processes handle the locking and releasing of a particular lock the idea being that i can use the timeout argument in gen_server to terminate the process if no one has requested it after n amount time so that only currently relevant locks will stay in memory

4179387
profiling	benchmarking
ruby s benchmarking and profiling tools are certainly not the most advanced in the programming ecosystem but they get the job done

4179646
stdout	fflush
i still don t know why it was doing that but fflush stdout before it loops again solves the problem

4179659
ienumerable	ilist
so you re definitely going to need to have some code in your viewmodel to do this transformation and at the same time you can populate an observablecollection instead of an ilist or ienumerable

4179666
mouseover	mouseout
you re really close here but it s only detecting the mouseover and mouseout right as you cross the borders of the circles because they re not filled in

however the problem are the backspace and arrow keys - they will also expand the text-box on keydown and only on keyup the text-box size will be corrected

4179717
int	chars
note that c is declared int not chars because eof has a value that is distinct from all chars that can be stored in a chars

multiplying	add
that last line will allow you to re-use the same code for the movements multiplying the values you have to add to the current position to get to the new one by the variable

4179818
width	height
nsimage has a size method returning an nssize struct containing the width and height of the image or if the size couldn t be determined

4179818
width	height
i have placed explicit casts to double because on some systems 64-bit especially the width and height members may not be float types but double and we would be providing the wrong types to nslog

4179827
filesystems	ntfs
they will not transfer off of the ntfs filesystems well

4179856
try-catch	exception-handling
window.parent.location window.frameelement in try-catch statement which you can use to handle the exception-handling yourself

i just migrated from centos to ubuntu so i m not sure if this is an os environment issue i m not familiar with or another issue

4180023
int	double
as a side note if you d prefer that end up being an int instead of an int and be a rational instead of a double you can use a default declaration to override the default defaulting rules

4180056
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
in all other browsers i ve tried google-chrome firefox opera in that context - and helpfully as well

4180071

you can t get it server-side you have to get it client-side with javascript with innerwidth

4180167
valgrind	glibc
profiling my code however with valgrind i see thousands of calls to the actual memcpy function in glibc

4180193
realloc	malloc
glibc is telling you you re passing in an address that couldn t have been returned from malloc realloc

4180193

that way if the realloc fails you still free the original value

4180225
equals	gethashcode
i even tried overriding equals and gethashcode in the model

4180280
rss	feed
i am using python s feedparser module to parse an rss feed

4180281
cdr	cons
this can be done by writing a simple recursive function that uses cons to prepend the item to the first list using car to get the first list and then uses cons again to prepend the extended list to the result of calling the function on the other lists on the cdr of the list of lists

4180289
width	height
where size is height or width depending on what is bigger

4180307
width	height
i have noticed that i tend to removed the width and height attributes because they are a pain when i tweak an image so best to only use if necessary

4180315
width	height
i d say it s good practice to leave the width and height attributes in so that the page doesn t keep shifting around as the images load

4180315
width	height
i suppose you could do it with css instead or put the width height on some container element.

4180324
onclick	onmousedown
use onmousedown insted of onclick

4180324
onclick	onmousedown
in spite of using wmode transparent some browsers still wont call the onclick but they do call onmousedown

i have a fairly simple flex swc module that is compiled via the maven flexmojos plugin

hex	binary
how can i get this data formatted to either binary 1 s and 0 s or even better hex 0-f s

4180442
hex	binary
beg1 and beg2 correspond to the binary values of the hex values i am looking for but they are not really relevant to the rest of the code i have at the moment

4180472
boost	stl
3 use stl and boost as much as you can

versioning	upgrade
if so how do i upgrade to 64 bit versioning

4180500
getter	setter
alternatively if they are referring to the same object in memory why not hold them as a single public variable or getter setter in a seperate class which both main.media and this one refer to

4180533
rss	feed
jeff lamarche s opengl es from the ground up series is great for opengl es 1.1 i also highly recommend subscribing to his blog s rss feed

vbscript	jscript
this lib provides me with functions to define the type of scripting language such as jscript and vbscript and i can supply it with script code and have that executed with passing arguments in and back

4180599
portrait	landscape
instead the behavior is exactly the same in landscape as in portrait with a uibarbuttonitem on the left side of a uitoolbar at the top of the screen bringing up a uipopovercontroller with the master view controller s view

4180599
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the problem is that none of the uiviewcontroller lifecycle methods ever get called besides viewdidload viewwillappear viewdidunload etc.

4180599
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
it seems that the only times a uiviewcontroller -derived class acts like a uiviewcontroller is when it is added as a subview of the app s uiwindow or to a container class like uinavigationcontroller or uisplitviewcontroller

4180619
put	get
put framebuffer and renderbuffer somewhere you can get to them again at the relevant moment and you should also

4180661
uiview	subviews
if doing this with uiview probably not the high-performance choice you are probably going to define one big view that can handle all the tiles and tile them onto the view add and remove subviews setting the large view s frame to define your camera position

4180672
pop-up	dialog
i have a issue with a jquery datepicker pop-up dialog being clipped by an iframe as shown in this image

4180695
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
for debugging or trying out quick javascript i find safari s and google-chrome s built-in development tools handy but on firefox it s firebug all the way

4180715
keydown	keyup
the thing you have to remember is that you can t reliably tell anything at all about any character that may be typed in a keydown or keyup event that all has to be done in a keypress handler

4180715
opera	firefox
you will need to have separate paste event handler although this event isn t supported in firefox 3.0 opera and very old webkit browsers

4180723
post	get
usually you want to execute a post and not a get when you are sending a form back

4180746
rss	feed
all the information i could find regarding generating rss feed gives examples where an indeterminate number of items is returned

4180767
ienumerable	ilist
s the difference between ienumerable and array ilist and list

4180794
folder	directory
so the url - - might correspond to a service file called myservice.svc that is in folder c which is in folder b which is in folder a which is in the root directory of the web site that is listening at port 80 this is the default value and can be left out on the server called mywebserver which resides on the domain mydomain

4180799
ienumerable	ilist
and list it implement many interface like ienumerable ilist etc

4180815
listview	gridview
however using a listview with a gridview isn t what i want

4180816
sorting	grouping
i don t see a way to have the items ordered in a particular way that they can be grouping since i m already ordering sorting them by date because the date order is messed up by the first grouping

4180850
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i can confirm that it works in firefox opera google-chrome

4180863
width	margin
the css box model defines width as the width of the content excluding border padding and margin

4180912
folder	directory
i don t like virtual subdomain mechanism to create subdomain because it willl mess up the folder structure belongs to virtual directory

4180916
imagemagick	magick++
unfortunately i need to be using magick++ the c++ interface api for imagemagick but i can t seem to get the equivalent operation in magick++

4180945
post	get
you can either pass your post parameters via get along with the pagination data and look for them in either or or if you re feeling saucy or create your pagination control as a postable form

4180952
post	get
looks to me like when you click on a link you no longer have the post data being sent it becomes a simple get request

4180970
tinyint	boolean
tinyint 1 - it looks like a boolean so make it one

4180982
tinyint	boolean
boolean is an alias for tinyint 1 and is stored as one byte of data

4180985
postgresql	mysql
i don t think either of these situations is supported by common databases like mysql postgresql sqlite etc

4181003
lxml	beautifulsoup
i use lxml for xml parsing but i use beautifulsoup for html

4181040
mouse	keyboard
in the first it says that in version 4.9.5.5 they added an option for mouse hints disabling - maybe it will work for keyboard too

4181081
servicepoint	httpwebrequest
a quick look at httpwebrequest with reflector shows that it doesn t differentiate servicepoint objects based on the proxy credentials

4181136
google-chrome	safari
this will work with the current versions of safari and google-chrome

4181155
uiview	calayer
when you commit an animation the properties on the uiview or calayer are set straight away

4181156
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
currently we are using internet explorer on windows phone 7 instead can we use google-chrome mozilla firefox or safari

4181173
int	chars
no it s generally wrong because a chars is only 1 byte while an int is typically 4 bytes

4181173
int	chars
the correct way to do it would be to get the chars value first and then cast it to an int

4181173
int	chars
of course in this case an explicit cast may not be necessary at all as the chars value will implicitly get promoted to an int

4181176
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
since microsoft only expose apis in c# silverlight and firefox safari google-chrome are coded by c c++

4181251
foldable	traversable
traversable and foldable supply useful methods for running computations over collections

4181258

after adding a uiimageview to interface builder and assigning a png filename to it is there a shortcut key to use the png s dimension width and height as the uiimageview s dimension

4181287
post	get
ps i know there is a better actual objective-c way of getting an objects properties i even found a post with this get an object properties list in objective-c

4181291
put	get
i would log print the key val you put in and then log print the key val you try to get out

4181309
put	get
i think this would not be very hard to get this behavior out of edit texts that i put into my own application but i am wanting to add this option to any edit text inside any application on my phone

4181324
centos	linux
webserver is xampp for linux centos 5.5

4181334
hash	salt
perhaps using a session id and token a hash based on the ip a salt and the session id that is regenerated every request use a fast hashing algorithm would be a good approach

4181360
identifier	ambiguous
in mysql it s used to surround identifier when they might otherwise be ambiguous such as using a reserved word as a table or column name

4181363
gridview	objectdatasource
i ve researched and see there are default paging for gridview which is not very efficient my report table may have thousands of records and custom paging but this requires using objectdatasource which i don t use

4181424
google-chrome	safari
is it necessary to test the rendering of my website in both google-chrome and safari despite the fact that both browsers implement the webkit rendering engine underneath

4181446
google-chrome	safari
by default safari has 3rd-party cookies disabled but google-chrome has them enabled by default

4181446
google-chrome	safari
safari does not store content in the dom google-chrome does

4181446
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses the v8 javascript engine safari uses nitro

4181451
google-chrome	safari
they use different javascript engine google-chrome v8 safari nitro

4181480
google-chrome	safari
even different versions of google-chrome will behave differently same for different versions of safari

4181545
touchescancelled	touchesended
are you watching both touchesended and touchescancelled

4181568
realloc	malloc
for example a struct inside a struct when you need to malloc both of them and realloc both of them

4181578
width	height	hide	show
you should use height or width transition in order to show and hide second level menu

4181578
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
works perfect in opera 10.7 without transitions in firefox 3.6.12 and doesn t at all in google-chrome 7.0.517.41

4181618
width	height
here i have defined a relative layout the layout will occupy the full screen s width and height

4181621
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i m still not getting any errors other than the undefined in the second sample when trying the sample code so i can t say for certain what will fix it but here s an approach that simplifies things and gets rid of the arrays indexing operation use a foreach loops rather than a for-loop

4181738
int	chars
fgetc returns an int and not a chars

4181768
getter	setter
if you hover over the corresponding control in ib you can see the declaration and brief documentation on the method that it triggers usually the getter rather than the setter but it s easy enough to infer one from the other

4181909
getter	setter
but you ll have to define the getter and setter yourself

4181920
setinterval	settimeout
if you want to change the period after generating each number use settimeout rather than setinterval

4181923
folder	directory
i ve tried deleting the talent folder and recreating it just mkdir talent but i still can t get is_dir to accept that it is a directory

4181942
int	double
what is the best way to convert a double to an int

4181954
int	double
don t forget that the range of int is much smaller than the range of double

4181954
int	double
a cast from double to int won t throw an exception if the value is outside the range of int in an unchecked context whereas a call to convert.toint32 double will

4181966
post	get	post	put	put	get
i don t care about the verb types get post put delete because for example if somebody wants to delete a record i want them to be able to simply type in a url into their browser to delete

4181994
textview	imageview
each row has a mix of imageview and textview

4182017
idictionary	ilist
it will be a ilist of idictionary s so it should be in this form

4182024
lua	scheme
however i have heard that android also supports scheme python lua and others but never could find it verified or an actual list

4182033
typedef	struct
it s pretty rare in c++ but common in c where struct foo does not automatically alias to just foo . you might see it in a library that has different classes for different platforms a canvas class which is very implementation-specific. the library would use the typedef to let its users simplify their code

4182054
min	max
i need to select all numbers n integers between min and max

4182054
min	max
let s say min 5 max 9

4182079
restrict	shared
but if one shared hosting client will be given an exception then there will be another respectively with access to common system restrict functionalities and areas

4182112
min	max
and if you know min and max then directly put those instead of nested query

4182124
width	height
now consider the textview if you make layout_height wrap_content it will take the height of the text and the width will be limited to whatever you provided..........

4182131
udp	tcp
by the way please stop suggesting tcp over udp

4182146
octal	decimal
in these lines you have used a decimal constant 666 where you should have used an octal constant 0666

which will get rid of all the cr characters in your file 15 octal is 13 decimal

4182306
children	parent
in other words because the parent ul has a gray background i want its children to be on top of that gray background

4182325
int	boolean
if you convert the int into a string it shouldn t be any difficult all you need is an operator that the std string class provides and an array of boolean for recording which element has already been checked

4182354
hash	md5
however it should be noted that the md5 hash is not really an integer in any useful sense

4182354
hash	md5
i guess you are just doing this so that you can print or order the md5 hash

4182411
h.264	webm
i know about h.264 ogg and some webm never heart about it

4182423
svg	vml
afaik they now use svg for non-ie browsers mozilla svg and ie uses vml up to and including ie9 beta vml on wikipedia

4182423
svg	vml
using firebug or the ie developer tools you can see the svg svg tags vml shape tags markup

4182423
svg	vml
i expect its a combination of normally rendered svg vml markup with the live changes eg

4182424
getter	setter
just rename it to relatedproducts and the respective setter getter

4182433

pop-up	dialog
right-click on the start group and select add dialog from the pop-up menu

4182456
post	get
but for your case when you post form a and controller a processes post you might get into validation problems and that s when you return view on a post action and that s why form b is rendered via its post method

4182464
fadein	fadeout
i want to override jquery s fadein and fadeout effects when page loads

i have a linear layout which consists of imageview and textview one below another in a linear layout

4182541
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

4182614
fadein	fadeout
you can override fadein and fadeout ..

4182634

you can put data in intent with intent.putextra .. and get data with intent.getxyzextra .. where xyz dependt on the type can be string int array etc

4182664
pull	push
i will be needing to both pull data and push data to and from the server

4182700
ceil	floor
methods floor and ceil can be easily implemented based on this solution

4182788
min	max
the first two arrays known_xx to the second two min max

4182821
inherited	subclassing
sourcetype and destinationtype are slightly suspect -- this might be a case where subclassing class inherited might be suitable later on

4182862
post	get
you could set either a target _blank or a javascript popup link to that action and submit the blog via get or post

4182880
udp	tcp
i want to develop a chat application with a server client model opening tcp or udp sockets in visual basic 2008

4182892
int	chars
the problem in your code is that you already convert the int value to a chars and test the chars

4182904
int	chars
type mismatch cannot convert from int to chars

4182937
ssl	https
if you want to see what is send received by your application but https hides it then you can use normal http query with stunel which adds ssl to socket transmission

4182943
equals	gethashcode
or are you just trying to understand how gethashcode and equals relate to each other

4183007

width	height
how do i determine the picture size if it is a horizontal picture width is more than height width 300px and height 200 then insert into the database

4183120
width	height
else the picture is a vertical picture or width less than 300px and height less than 200px don t insert it into the database

4183143
post	get
at a glance i would say it has something to do with that you are using a get and not a post

4183244
int	boolean
public view getchildview int groupposition int childposition boolean islastchild

4183291
int	chars
int comparisons and arrays can be optimised to use register specific instructions so a lot of sort search may happen inside the cpu cache directly - with strings multiple method invocations may be needed to access chars check length etc

4183342
width	height
get coordinates is a custom function of mine to get left top width height zindex of an element

4183361
min	max
you d probably have to modify the control yourself to take in an array of acceptable dates which might not be that difficult as it seems as you could use the min max functionality as a starting point

4183377
onkeyup	onkeydown
i have overridden onkeydown onkeyup for one of my activities in order to capture the volume keys press events and manipulate the sound of the application

4183404
stdout	stderr
this background program can be given input command via stdin and use stdout and stderr to keep printing out output and error messages

instead of specifying the width and height of a raphael canvas i need it to be 100 the size of its container

4183444
hash	md5
what i am trying to do is hash md5 inside php the javascript variable

4183456
gprof	callgrind
you need to run some form of third-party tool against your binary something like quantify ibm or callgrind or as paul r mentioned above gprof

4183470
hash	md5
there are several md5 solutions out there for javascript but it s not the same if you want the variable hash before it reaches the user

4183471
getter	setter
the setter method has to have the same name as the getter

4183493
width	height
if you are using a div then you could use css to set that to 100 of the width and height

4183543
google-chrome	firefox
is not showing up when i inspect the element in firefox google-chrome

4183546
gtk	cairo
how can i draw image with rounded corners in cairo gtk

4183553
filtering	grouping
you can use jquery or a js framework of your choice to filtering grouping client side or if your getting the data from a database such as mysql you can grouping the data from the query before rendering it to the client

4183625
put	get
microsoft has a script debugger that is actually pretty good once you get it running but in this case a more primitive but simple and effective method is to put an alert into the source code until the point is reached where things crash

4183636
config	ini
the neat thing with this approach is that you can have different types in your config files and as long as they are formatted as ini files then this will work

4183683
uilabel	uitextview
find uicontrollers that draw nsattributedstring because uilabel uitextview do not support nsattributedstring

4183738
maven	pom.xml
if you d like it to maven add the following dependency to your pom.xml

you can do it yourself using a linearlayout an imageview and a textview

4183775
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup cannot be used reliably for this purpose

4183797
sorting	grouping
if this data comes from a database you might want to look at using a grouping by clause there and save yourself the trouble of sorting on the server

4183814
internationalization	localization
after that internationalization and localization see

4183828
cpu	processors
i having a high mysql cpu usage on server intel r xeon r cpu e5520 2.27ghz 16 core of processors and 16 g.b ram running on centos 5.4

for-loop	loops
replace your while loops with a for-loop with the same number of runs as you wish the original number has digits including leading zeros

4183894
cvs	svn
supports svn cvs git mercurial and archive

4183911
filtering	grouping
if it is in the grouping what you can try is to eliminate the filtering for the computer name on the filtering and iterate over the resultset in order to find out if your element is there

4183953
domxpath	domdocument
use domxpath for this along with domdocument or simplexml

4183978
protovis	infovis
i ve looked at infovis toolkit and protovis but i d have to implement a custom layout for them and a lot of custom code

4183982

4184086
superclass	subclassing
now threat this new subclassing as if it were a single but specialized version of its superclass

4184086
titlebar	window
for the case of a window s titlebar look with a pixmap background and buttons try a window with an image and a fixed container to hold the buttons

4184089
decoder	encoder
mostly tv tuner cards uses windows media encoder to encode the format that they are receiving from cable so that tv tuner software can decoder it and display in playable format

4184185
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby were implemented on top of the dlr as is c# 4 s dynamic feature

4184195
maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
my first attempt was to hook the maven-antrun-plugin which calls the createrepo command to the parent pom.xml s the super-pom deploy phase

4184206
width	height
you can validate image width height on the client side but that does not guarantee anything because it s easy to manipulate circumvent

4184233
ubuntu	linux
but by any chance are you using firefox under ubuntu not sure if it is general to linux and gifs

4184246
explode	implode
if it s not you should explode it mysql_real_escape_string each value and implode back

4184280
free	malloc
however the malloc s and free s don t add up

4184280
free	malloc
sometimes i see a free on a memory block that pass through didn t the malloc hook before

4184280
free	malloc
but i also see that malloc sometimes returns a pointer that it has returned before and there has been no free in meantime at least my free hook wasn t called

4184280
free	malloc
so my guess is that certain malloc s and free s are not passed through my hooks

4184280
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
implementing malloc realloc free and calling the libc versions using dlsym rtld_next malloc didn t work either

4184326
fpdf	fpdi
the following code shows how to use fpdf and fpdi to fill an existing gift coupon with the user data

4184351
children	parent
the parent class holds a list of children

4184408
centos	linux
server is linux centos 5 with dual core processor

4184411
std	ostream
i don t see any advantage into using this class versus simply using the std ostream interface

4184413
put	get
or is it necessary to put name new textbox name so that i can get all their values

4184430
innodb	myisam
however one could arrange things in such a way that myisam tables are only secondary data sets into which one dumps texts already existing in innodb tables such that the myisam tables could be rebuilt from scratch when needed

4184430
freebsd	solaris
a pretty good solution therefore seems to be mysql on solaris zfs or on freebsd ufs

4184478
mersenne-twister	random
i use mersenne-twister to generate pseudo random numbers

4184497
memcpy	memmove
for example memcpy memmove and the like usually implement some variation of this algorithm copy words halfwords bytes using gp registers until you hit 16 byte alignment then use sse to copy 4 words at a time that s 16 chars at a time provided sizeof char 1

4184497
memcpy	strcpy
then again you can also test the performance of your implementation vs memcpy strcpy and see what you get

4184515
pthreads	usleep
usleep is deprecated and has been deleted from the most recent pthreads standard

4184565
mayavi	matplotlib
i have successfully frozen a mayavi matplotlib traits app on mac using py2app and windows using py2exe starting from the enthought python distribution but it wasn t easy

4184594
onclick	onsubmit
you could disable it for all links forms on the page by removing the window.onbeforeunload handler in each link s onclick handler or onsubmit for forms

4184595
qmainwindow	qdockwidget	qgraphicsview	qmainwindow	qgraphicsview	qdockwidget
the game itself is displayed by qgraphicsview qdockwidget in a qmainwindow

4184595
qmainwindow	qpushbutton
but now i m trying to make a menu for it so i thought to make an extra qmainwindow with qpushbutton

4184595
qgraphicsview	qdockwidget
so when i click new game in the menu the game qgraphicsview qdockwidget is immediately and in the same window displayed without first shutting down the menu-window and then showing the game-window

4184688
versioning	upgrade
the recommended solution is to simply upgrade to a versioning not affected by the bug however if you absolutely need to support 9.6x you can easily detect the exception and fall back to using postmessage for cross-domain communication

4184754
width	height
considering the third approach it might simply work if you change width to height

4184793
for-loop	loops
you are using a for-loop where you are trying to loops through a variable row that is never defined

4184797
children	parent
inside the iterator i ve created a current node instance and iterate with a for-loop over all children and then get back to the parent

4184802
switching	screens
the thing is that it is buggyâ actually it doesnâ t seem to work at all when you click on it type a letter you get autocompletion you choose a value the text property gets filled with it alright but the keyboard never goes off either after taping elsewhere or switching the screens â

4184959
width	height
at runtime based on a condition i want to change the height and width properties to another value using code behind

4184975
post	get
i just wanted to update this post with this information so people get the whole story

4184980
children	parent
i m trying to implement hibernate mapping using annotations but during the saving of my parent object and its children i noticed that an update statement is being called instead of an insert statement

4184987
for-loop	arrays
to load the thumbnails i have created a for-loop for the arrays of thumbnails and the number of the image is recorded by the variable noofimage

4185032
aggregate-functions	sum
the example uses the sum aggregate-functions but you just need to reference the column name and it will duplicate it in your datatable

4185045
int	chars
as others said comparing int is a single sub instruction while to compare two strings they have to be pushed by reference on the stack the function called the function entry code performed then a loop over the chars performed the function exit code performed then the return followed by a single sub instruction

4185181
hash	salt
store salt+hash in one column or store salt and hash in two columns

4185181
hash	salt
personally i would store it as a single column because it is unlikely you will ever be retrieving just salt or just the hash

4185181
hash	salt
also if you update the salt then hash needs to be updated also and when updating the hash you might as well update the salt

4185209
integer	unsigned
vhdl is strongly-typed so if count is representing a number and with a name like that it better had be use either a signed or unsigned vector or an integer

4185218
inherited	subclassing
otherwise if you can t change the schema you could try creating a view that does the join and use table_per_class inherited and map the subclassing to the view

4185240
folder	directory
directory to the folder where the file

4185272
post	get
i m planning to get the return values in array field. does this need a post back

4185273
post	get
i m trying to get all the html content inside the post div but excluding the title byline submissions buttons and tags sections

4185273
post	get
i get back the entire content of the post div including the unwanted headers divs

4185302
width	height
i think the easiest way to achieve this is probably to bind the width and height of the image to two properties

4185302
width	height
if you want to change the width and height of all images you can use two properties in code behind and if you want to be able to do it individually then just do the same but bind against properties in the collection items

4185302
width	height
this way the listboxitems will increase decrease in size with the width height of the images

4185365
folder	directory
that path is just an empty folder in xcode that i use to house the projects from the other directory

4185392
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval and settimeout it will do what you want in conjunction with jquery

4185465
sorting	filtering
in particular it says in the examples area there is a demonstration of a sorting algorithm making use of exactly this technique to interpose yet another coordinate system where the order of the rows is changed rather than the order of the columns. you might compare what you re doing with the relevant example in sorting and filtering

4185493
inherited	properties
length is a properties inherited from javascript

4185523
client-side	server-side
i did a bunch of research and stumbled across things like httpresponses and httpservletresponses in java but have no idea how to bridge the gap between the client-side and server-side to use that effectively

4185534
rss	feed
i use nutch 1.1 not trunk to parse rss feed

4185535
pbkdf2	salt
obviously you shouldn t use the source straight as the salt instead use a key derivation function like pbkdf2

4185556
google-chrome	firefox
it currently only works in firefox or google-chrome since it uses javascript filereader and html canvas to generate the sprites inside the web browser without uploads

4185558
inherited	properties
-for each view object get all properties each view in fact will inherited from a special base one specialview for example

4185582
google-chrome	firefox
you can t even develop in google-chrome firefox

4185640
put	get
when i put this command in firebug i get this element

4185679
serializable	deserialization
the basics of deserialization are simple just like the basics of serializable are simple--once you know the trick

4185705
google-chrome	firefox
however with ecmascript 5th edition implementations ie 9 google-chrome 7 firefox 4 you can use object.getownpropertynames to get an array of property names for a specific object

4185720
pbkdf2	salt
if you use a derived salt as opposed to random salt the salt source should be strengthened by using a key derivation function like pbkdf2

4185720
pbkdf2	salt
thus if your username is theunhandledexception pass that through pbkdf2 for x iterations to generate a 32 bit or whatever length salt you need value

4185720
pbkdf2	salt
make x pseudo random as opposed to even numbers like 1 000 and pass in a static site specific salt to the pbkdf2 and you make it highly improbable that your username salt will match any other site s username salt

4185722
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar	nsdatecomponents	nsdateformatter	nsdateformatter	nscalendar
i have been trying to wrap my head around nsdate nscalendar nsdatecomponents nstimezone and nsdateformatter

4185785
free	malloc
i don t know to what extend you control this code and how you try to detect if malloc free match up

4185785
free	malloc
this one can with certain types of arguments have the same effect as a malloc initial pointer is 0 or as free new size is 0 iirc

4185785
free	malloc
another possibility is that your malloc free happen in order but your printf for your debug output get out of order

4185799
strcpy	strncpy
if you want to be portable you can not rely on anything else but strcpy strncpy or the standard wide character string handling functions

4185829
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
now this will work with firefox however other browsers ie7+ safari google-chrome act like mentioned above

4185848
puts	gets
i would like to create a freestyle hudson job that gets the latest sourcecode out of my svn-repository and puts it into my var www mywebapp folder

4185854
implements	extends
that s why abstract classes can have method bodys because you can only extends one class but interfaces can t because you can implements multiple interfaces

4185867
valgrind	callgrind
as far as linked-in port driver is .so library that is dynamically loaded into erl process on linux you can run valgrind --tool callgrind --callgrind-out-file file.out erl see other options in docs for callgrind then execute some tests from erl shell exit from shell and load file.out in some tool like kcachegrind

4185875
hide	show
if you have a container div the easiest way to do this would be to apply a secondary class to it and show hide elements trough that class

4185937
hide	show
if you really want to add hide some logic inside an interface you may consider adding an inner class note never do it this just show what is possible from a pure technical perspective

4185951
many-to-one	one-to-many
in the case of bidirectional many-to-one one-to-many relationship many side should be the owning side and joincolumn is specified at the owning side whereas one side should have mappedby poiniting to the owning side

4186380
min	max	minimum	max
min and max are for getting the minimum or maximum value in a column for a group of same values in another column

4186380

4186701
pdfbox	itextsharp
one alternative to itextsharp is pdfbox

4186747
public	protected
the way to avoid this problem is to have the base type support cloning using a protected method and allow derived types to implement a public cloning interface as they see fit

4186773
google-chrome	firefox
worked for me in firefox ie7 8 and google-chrome

4187218
int	double
as many people have said a 64bit int is probably not worth it if double is an option

4187218
int	double
if you need additional precision in long sums of floats you should keep in mind that this operation is sometimes problematic with floats and double and would be more exact on int

4187236

4190011
symfony	kohana	codeigniter	kohana
look at symfony kohana zend framework codeigniter

4190023

if i was implementing this with nested for loops i would be trying to manipulate the for-loop indexes inside loops and that would not be very nice .

4191040

portrait	landscape
what i would like to know is how to programmatically choose which landscape surface.rotation_90 surface.rotation_270 or portrait surface.rotation_0 surface.rotation_180 orientation i wish the user to see but more importantly allow them to do so in the app s settings activity

4195037
folder	directory
and i don t think it s a good idea to put all django application like you did you can put related application in the some folder but not all of them and for the template i think you have the choice to put one template directory in the some level as settings.py where you can have the same structure as your apps or to put a template directory in each application but i prefer the first one like this

4195100
getter	setter
i am not familiar with templates but i wonder if it is possible to use them for setter and getter methods

4195100
getter	setter
another question i would ask is how should getter and setter be properly declared

4195100
getter	setter
i mean should getter be always const and setter take as argument reference to an object rather than copy it which would be probably a little bit slower

4195116
hash	salt
if you really need a fast way to do this you should consider emailing them a hash of some salt and their username and then logging them in that way

4195178
getter	setter
design your programs in a way that there is less need for getter and setter

4195240
backgrounding	multitasking
part of the multitasking features in 4.0+ require extra coding to support keeping connections alive and performing tasks in the backgrounding

4195325
post	get
unfortunately i can t seem to get post working

4195328
getter	setter
i can t see a way for templating to directly help you compactify your getter setter pairs unless you want to wrap your members inside templated accessor classes like this

4195335
hide	show
i have next and previous buttons which allow the user to go back and forth by using show and hide commands for the different forms

4195349
width	height
yes thats possible make your fullview a scrollview with its contentsize having the same width as your screen and its height being the combined height of its subviews put at least two or 3 imageviews in the scrollview as subviews

4195378
getter	setter
not all of this need be done by hand have a look at the active record design pattern and tools like php-ar that will do most of the basic getter and setter methods for you

4195388
post	get
you also might want to add some additional conditions to only change the protocol on get and head requests but not on post requests

4195395
hide	show
the button actionlistener checks if the dialog isvisible hide it if true show it if false

4195494

this problem is not present in google-chrome firefox

4195870
equals	gethashcode
if i understand you correctly you just need to override the gethashcode and equals methods in your datapointcollection class and use the method in this question to generate the hash code

4195882
equals	gethashcode
you need to override both gethashcode and equals - it s the combination of the two which will be used by the hashset

4195886

the form is post but not able to get the files

4195896
ienumerable	iqueryable
also i m not sure if your example binding is pseudocode or not but you have to bind a grid to an ilistsource ienumerable or idatasource so you need a collection list iqueryable etc

4195928
gridview	rowdatabound
then you could use findcontrol in the rowdatabound event of the gridview to store the id value

4196183
min	max
you can fix the problem by using either min timesent or max timesent in your sub-query in place of timesent whichever is appropriate

4196191
x86	64bit
a possible cause is a x86 dll in a 64bit app pool the solution is to enable 32 bits apps in the application pool settings

something simple like multiplication or division is not much different between c++ and c# - the c++ compiler has an optimizer and the clr runtime has the on-demand jiter that does optimizations

4196237
cos	sin
just write a loop in c# and c++ having a few multiplication sin cos .

4196251
cos	sin
suppose a cpu had a tan math function but no sin or cos and a programming language implemented sin and cos in terms of tan but did not expose tan itself

4196251
cos	sin
a programmer using that language would be forced to implement tan in terms of sin and cos which themselves are implemented in terms of tan therefore characterizing abstraction inversion

4196299
gdal	proj	gdal	ogr	proj	ogr
many users will find the gdal ogr library and utilities another osgeo open source proj a useful way of leveraging proj.4 s capabilities on common data formats eg

4196312
innodb	myisam
however you are left with not having an engine that can do transactions and full-text search at the same time between myisam and innodb

4196312
innodb	myisam
and 4 myisam vs innodb and datatypes

4196312
innodb	myisam
however as i said with mysql myisam innodb you don t have an engine that can do full-text search and transactions fks

4196312
innodb	myisam
a simple option is to have a 2nd copy in myisam of the innodb tables that need full-text search capability

4196346
hide	show
rather create a separate thread you start upon starting your app that initializes show some splash screen before it and once the init is done hide the splashscreen

4196352
cllocationmanager	mkreversegeocoder
callbacks methods of mkreversegeocoder and cllocationmanager

4196390
put	get
put it all together and you get

4196404
int	boolean
the textbook example of your second point is integer.valueof int similar for boolean short long byte

4196405
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop instead of a foreach loops and start at where you left off instead of at the beginning

4196409
put	get
when i actually put in the code i get the following error failure system.configuration.configurationerrorsexception the configuration is read only

4196425
opera	safari
here are some default layout widths safari iphone uses 980px opera 850px android webkit 800px and ie 974px

4196472
google-chrome	safari
both of these work fine in safari and google-chrome

4196480
put	get
you would need to get a range of ip addresses and put them in a while list

4196505
move	drag
interact with nodes links to drag move select

4196559
post	get
an http redirect instructs the browser to issue an http get for the url specified as opposed to the http post that is used to submit the form

4196561
public	protected
since immutablelist doesn t expose any public or protected constructors it can be subclassed within the package while not allowing users to subclass it and potentially break its immutability guarantee

4196568
post	get
you need to implement the post redirect get pattern

4196626
pull	push
push and pull only exchange information about already recorded changed

4196676
mouseleave	mouseenter
you just have to handle this two events mouseenter mouseleave

4196696
hex	binary
you could use a plain hex string or base64 encoding - both are well-established methods of transporting binary data as a string

4196717
memset	malloc
make sure you can tell whether the malloc s worked or not at end of program hence the memset in this code

4196727
crypt	md5	crypt	salt	salt	md5
i ve gone for using the crypt function with the user s password as the salt via md5 like so

4196761
pop-up	dialog
i m using this code to pop-up a facebook dialog and to allow the user to make a wall post but the user name doesn t appear

4196768
put	get
how can i get emacs to not put buffer list there but instead show another one of my files

4196831
inherited	properties
well i m not sure from your description that inherited is actually the right solution to the problem but here s how you make it possible for a properties to be overridden

4196922
width	height
this gives you enough information to provide parameters x y width and height

4196923
addition	multiplication
primitive operations like addition multiplication etc work only on c primitive types like int short float etc

4196925
hash	salt
using the hash value with a salt is much safer if someone breaks into your db no password is there

4196925
crypt	hash
only the hash of the password is which they can t use to log in and crypt really isn t very secure

4196925
hash	md5
unfortunately md5 has issues too so i would suggest using sha512 as a hash

4196933
nunit	mstest
i had done a comparison of nunit and mstest unit testing frameworks in one of my blog

4196960
accessor	properties
optional if you want to enforce singleton instances you can create a module that acts as a singleton container - include a private instance variable and a public accessor properties

4196976
jstl	taglib
then declare the jstl core taglib in top of jsp page as per its documentation

4197009
pop-up	dialog
i have a delete button where on clicking the button i want a dialog box to pop-up and then on clicking ok it should do the ajax call else shouldnt do anything

4197012
internationalization	localization
and also internationalization and localization

4197034
google-chrome	safari
i ve tested this in safari and google-chrome on osx...same behavior

4197091
hex	binary
you will learn nothing trying to program in binary for a specific operating system and specific cpu type using a hex editor

4197100
public	protected
this is an obscure scenario but if you want to support inheritance across component boundaries you need this otherwise the addition of new public or protected members on a base class would invariably be a breaking change

4197118
rvm	bundler
i agree with maarons that bundler and or rvm gemsets are best practice but if you want to keep your gem code versioned as part of your applications repo then i think the solution you re looking for is to vendor your gems and then add them as submodules to your application s git repo

4197146
int	chars
the styles int hence the 32-character limit would be seen as a set of 32 1-bit fields with each one indicating whether a chars has its own style pointer or whether it should use the same style as the previous chars

4197201
folder	directory
this would change the packages folder for the configuration level you put the file in solution if you put it in the solution directory project in project directory and so on

4197212
put	get
put as much code as you can get away with in the diddecelerate method like loading in higher res images like vodkhang talks about rather than processing loads in didscroll

4197270
for-loop	loops
before trying it this way i tried having a while loops inside the 2nd for-loop to iterate through each list and use a binary search to see if the 2nd list contains each element but i think this takes the same amount of time or longer

4197287
ant	maven
it looks like maven is similair to ant

4197319
put	get
also of note the error you are getting is caused at the end of the method when you try to initalize a new freeze object from your runes array because when you put the object into the runes array you encapsulated it as a nsdata object first but when you get it out you don t dearchive it before setting it to newfreeze

4197336
pop-up	dialog	folder	directory
however i would like to be able to pop-up a folder selector dialog to let the user pick out a directory

4197353
width	height
it gives you the bounding box effectively width and height some text will occupy so you can determine where to place the text before writing it on the image

4197388
firefox	safari
there is no password when using firefox safari chrome.

4197427
getter	setter
all my attributes are public to avoid getter and setter and private business

4197528
jax-ws	jax-rs
jax-rs and jax-ws are great for producing an api

4197528
gson	jackson
some json libraries out there such as jackson and gson provide a feature where you can specify a different input output representation for a given object based on a runtime setting which seems like a suitable way to handle versioning for many cases

4197590
webclient	httpwebrequest
you might want to consider swapping your webclient for plain old httpwebrequest which hands you a stream out of the box

4197595
cobertura	checkstyle
i m not familiar but hoping that someone has used sonar checkstyle pmd findbugs clover and or cobertura that could tell me if any of those tools or other tools can do that

4197656
width	height
i am actually trying to compute the pixel width and height

4197687
inherited	properties
if it s not a bad idea to have these properties files in the scm should there be some kind of profile inherited for settings common between developer sandboxes

4197691
equals	gethashcode
oh and if you re overriding equals you should also override gethashcode

4197699
fontconfig	freetype
we updated freetype in osx 10.6.5 and fontconfig which links against freetype wants this newer version

4197744
pop-up	dialog
and in the dialog that pop-up i would choose to discard the changes from the merge target ie

4197758
equals	gethashcode
if you override equals you should get the behaviour you expect but note that if you override equals you should also override gethashcode to have a similar implementation

4197903
post	put
i will post an example url in the comments since i m a relatively new user and can t put more than one link in a post

4197911
children	parent
you would create a parent pom and have both a and b as children with a keeping its dependency on b

4197928
integer	fractions
all the operations in your expression are performed in integer arithmetic meaning that the fractions part of each intermediate result is truncated

4197956
post	get
when should use post vs get

4197962
int	chars
if you are dealing with a combination of fields with different types like numeric and timestamps then use any of the conversion commands decimal int chars substr ... at your disposal to convert to text equal and then match it up accordingly

4198038
submit	submission
and secondly how to wrap around submission i don t know maybe some ajaxsubmit event to evaluate the form and only when it s valid and then perform the submit itself so probably the function should return true etc

4198042
punctuation	words
there were no requirements such as ignoring punctuation so i ve allowed myself to write a version that only works for clearly separated words and thus inserted spaces in your sample text string

4198116
width	height
the alternative is to have something server side that will feed you the sizes of the images from the beginning but in the absence of that i suggest either dropping in my utility or modifying its logic to suit your need start a timer that monitors each image for having a width and height

4198145
trojan	virus
that would help in the eventuality that that local pc was infected with a worm trojan virus blended threat

4198187
filtering	grouping
so basically i need to figure out a way to filtering bind to my waves collection according to the id# property of the current element that is bound to grouping

4198210
subtract	add
now we have twice subtract the configurations where at least n1 + 1 x1 and n2 + 1 x2 are used hence we need to add ways v - n1 + 1 x1 - n2 + 1 x2 and etc

4198281
getter	setter
i do know that the declaration in the header file allows other classes to see its attributes the property specifier determines how its getter setter methods will be constructed

4198281
getter	setter
and the synthesize line actually builds those getter setter methods

4198297
ant	maven	put	get
the xml files get copied there by whatever you use to build with you can put them under src main resources in a maven project or copy them from your source directory into web-inf classes with ant

4198340
postgresql	mysql
lite is an ajax based and best viewed with any browser chat system that supports mysql sqlite postgresql databases

4198350
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception	nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception	illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
i think obvious runtimeexception mean here nullpointerexception arrayoutofboundsexception illegalargumentexception and so on so your code will run without obvious failures

4198367
post	get
i have the below page and i am racking my brain as to why when i have two update panels do they both get post backs

4198368
superclass	subclassing
i m sure i remember reading that there is a way to make any subclassing of the superclass define certain methods

4198368
superclass	subclassing
in my example the superclass is account and is abstract and the subclassing are savingsaccount and currentaccount

4198384
implements	extends
then any class that extends your abstract class will be forced to implements the withdraw method

4198394
hide	show
in a few words i m using two links to show and hide flash videos link1 show video1 and hide video2

4198394
hide	show
link2 show video2 and hide video1

4198398
profiler	yourkit
i ve used yjp yourkit java profiler to profile applications before

4198399
width	height
ensure that the content areas below the div with the scrollbars is not greater than 100 of that divs height or width at runtime

4198430
put	get
the class masterpriceitem is correctly analysed by hibernate if i put a field that is not in the table i get an error

4198458
getter	setter
obvious uses for this would be auto property getter and setter non obvious uses may be code generated by r# equals implementation or orm generated code

4198461
post	get
when invoking one of the endpoints with an http post and a valid payload i get the exception stack trace as you can see below

4198462
post	get
so show me how to do methods other than get post without it

4198478
versioning	upgrade
the down side will be having to very carefully maintain your messaging object versioning globally and having to keep a set of transformers on hands to accept and convert from different versioning if you plan to upgrade only a portion of your infrastructure

4198486
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
activexobject -- is not an option because it will not work for firefox safari google-chrome

4198488
width	height
use size width height

4198488
width	height
width and height are maximum width and height of drawing in inches.

4198519
implements	extends
if you declared you account class and method as abstract then compiler will give you an error if you don t implements abstract method in your subclasses that extends account class

4198525
int	chars
since this is memory mapped a simple copy the chars to a stack array and atoi to the another int array on top of a another memory mapped file would be the very efficient

4198530
margin	height
you can check if the css top + height value of the detail box is more than the container value and then add a negative top margin to offset it

4198537
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
now while this code works fine on google-chrome and opera on firefox it is behaving a little weird

4198537
google-chrome	firefox
update-just had a look at the request headers of firefox and i find no x-requested-with xmlhttprequest header but it is present in google-chrome

4198547
int	chars
chars is an actual 8 bit int value

4198547
int	chars
is a 32 or 64 bit value with information about where a 8 bit int chars can be found

4198567
pop-up	dialog
the issue i face with is when user hit on export a file save as confirm dialog pop-up and if user changed her mind click on cancel

4198580
int	double	int	chars
for primitives such as int double chars etc it works more as you might expect

4198585
subclass	abstract-class
i would go for a minimal fake subclass associating this with the abstract-class

4198586
onsubmit	onkeyup
from we have the following option properties onsubmit onfocusout and onkeyup

4198609
mouse	keyboard
i could select multiple characters with the mouse and keyboard and if i hit delete they would be deleted

4198614
submit	submission
when i place a submit button on the form and use that the ajax submission works fine

4198671
integer	fractions
in line 2 you are converting the input values to integers and then doing an integer divide because both operands for the divide are ints the divide is done in integer space - which means any fractions resiult will be truncated

4198679
post	get
there is another post here that describes a solution using jquery but unfortunately it doesn t include any code samples which is what i need because i m not very familiar with jquery and new to web development and i need to get this issue resolved as soon as i can

4198704
std	ostream
an std ostream s output needs to be flushed

4198753
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
in my app i used touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesend but i faced a big problem if the user drag 2 fingers just one finger handle the drag

4198787
put	get
note that the begin that the iterator is initialized with is not where the elements get put

4198804
unix	solaris
because weâ re running in a mixed unix environment solaris linux darwin with most desktops being macs we have quite a few annoying macroman files

4198822
implements	sealed
secondly make the class sealed the class is not implements the dispose pattern properly for inheritance and put gc.suppressfinalize this

4198926
width	height
instead of changing that img width and height i delete it and create a new one

4198969
post	get
in difference of get with post you are changing the state of the system most likely your trigger is doing something and changing data

4199051
public	protected
uint64 is not cls compatible and all classes in the bcl need to be at least on their public protected stuff

4199140
width	height
it won t create a height width on it until there s something inside the div

4199187
mouse	keyboard
the problem is with the wincombobox object if i use the scroll wheel on the mouse and scroll down past the bottom of the list really fast it has to be fast going slow or using the keyboard will not trigger this then i get this error

4199239
multiplying	add
the first way would be the easiest and most logical way and that is to store their offset if you already have it that is and multiplying that by 3600 1 hour in seconds and then add that value to the current unix timestamp to get their final time of running

4199268
min	max
where is the best place for hold custom settings on gwt mvp project eg loged user max amounts min price or similars y doubt if put them in gwt.xml config file but i not understand how acces these xml defined tags it s posible

4199273
valgrind	memcheck
when running valgrind memcheck tool i often get many hundreds of thousands or more since valgrind cuts off at 100k of small invalid read statements

4199294
integer	unsigned
the program deals with bitmap manipulation and as such much of the data in the app is represented as byte an unsigned 8-bit integer

4199294
integer	unsigned	unsigned	short
there are many suggestions to instead use the short data type in java in order to mimic as close as possible the unsigned 8-byte integer

4199299
width	height
the important thing is for margin-left and margin-top to be negative half the value of width and height to ensure that the popup is exactly in the middle of the screen

4199327
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
start with a very compliant browser then look at the page in other browsers i focus on google-chrome safari firefox ie6-7-8-9

4199327
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
ie6-7-8-9 tool is good enough for me because i tend to focus on all versions of ie but only the latest versions of google-chrome safari firefox

4199358
width	height
also the size of the board is variable...so it can have lots of squares or very few but the board has always the same height and width that is the same number of squares running from left to right as the number of squares running from top to bottom

4199363
min	max
the aggregate function min and max will return null if the lowest value is null

4199367
user-controls	tabcontrol
i am having a problem when attempting to host a user-controls as tab content within a tab item in a tabcontrol

4199392
min	max
min max sum avg and certain other aggregates will return null if a null exists in the data set

4199395
qlist	qmap
you aren t passing the correct arguments to qmap insert and qlist append

4199402
qstring	qmap
also you have a mismatch in parameters that is to say you have a list of qmap the maplist list and you are trying to append qmap qmap qstring qstring int the returnedlist map

4199406
pascal	delphi	activemq	rabbitmq	openmq	hornetq
note i am the author of delphi and free pascal client libraries for open source message queues message brokers activemq hornetq openmq rabbitmq

4199408
rsa	dsa
while not the only way to do this off the top of my head you could for example use a hmac with specific keys or just a public key algorithm such as rsa or dsa on their own it is probably the best way to achieve what you want to do with the minimum of effort

4199450
button	checkbox
i have a dialog box with a checkbox and a button

4199450
button	checkbox
i want to make the button enabled disabled depending on the state of the checkbox

4199450
button	checkbox
checking unchecking the checkbox does nothing to the button

4199455
persistent	transient
however if the real issue your facing is maintaining some sort of transient state specific to the connection i would reconsider the design and do something that persistent between connections tied to some sort of unique identifier from the user s session

4199460
postgresql	mysql
for the ones i tried mysql and postgresql min ignores null

4199469
arraylist	linkedhashmap	put	get
if you don t want to go through the arraylist searching for duplicates put everything in a linkedhashmap -- no duplicates and you still get the order-of-insertion that arraylist gives you

4199475
hash	salt
passwords should not be stored in plain text but should generally be salt and hash

4199499
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button aren t sent unless checked

4199548
getter	setter
so should it contain things like getter and setter

4199574
gridview	datalist
my problem is how to display this using a gridview or datalist control

4199574
gridview	datalist
if the data structure is dynamic how can i configure the gridview datalist control to bind to the data

4199577
google-chrome	firefox
i have a page link removed that works completely well in firefox and google-chrome but for some reason i am getting an object expected error in most if not all versions of ie

4199663
getter	setter
getter and setter are nothing to do with models but act as a great tool so i think your righti n a sence but you should understand that getter and setter having nothing to do with the model principle but are a way to construct your model classes to suite your framework

4199663
getter	setter
model is the layer between the view and the database storage and acts as getter + setter

4199675
for-loop	loops
for loops are quite simple to me and if it was nested for-loop my head starts to spin

4199685
gridview	datalist
use a datatable stored in the viewstate to carry the data and bind to a gridview datalist

4199691
keyup	mouseup
you can check the lastchild on keyup and mouseup to make sure it s a br element

4199691
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
tested on apple os x w google-chrome 7 mozilla firefox 3.6 apple safari 5

4199705
int	chars
first if a programmer passes in arbitrary int cast as pointers then they may actually be valid pointers within your address space -- they might even point to null terminated chars arrays in fact if they are within your address space they will point because the data there will be treated as chars and at some point there will be a 0 byte

4199706
vmware	virtualbox
if you re using virtualbox or vmware you can open a console window that essentially functions as the monitor on your vm

4199708
lisp	scheme
this is how gpus functional languages such as lisp scheme apl and some frameworks google s map reduce handle concurrency

4199758
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
how would i return to the topmost uiviewcontroller in each uinavigationcontroller whenever a tab bar button is pressed

4199762
min	max
the minutes and seconds have a max of 60 and a min of -1 and the hours one has a min of -1 and a max of 24

4199816
rel	src
i need to add add the rel 0 to the end of a end src tag from a youtube embed code

4199847
maven	pom.xml
set the necessary import in my maven pom.xml for felix by

4199896
for-loop	loops
i surrounded it for-loop and while loops several times but it causes eofexception

4199906
implements	extends
as such it might be required for your specific situation that you implements a gesturedetector and implements your own simpleongesturelistener class mygesturelistener extends simpleongesturelistener that manages the double and single tap events your looking for

4199917
ubuntu	debian
if you are using ubuntu or debian and you serve .json files through apache you might want to serve the files with the correct content type

4200065
hash	salt
putting it all together 64bit salt + sha1 hash 160 bit base64 encoded takes 40 characters so i store it as char 40

4200065
hash	md5
sha1 and md5 hash are insanely fast

4200065
hash	salt
a future proof method would be to include the number of iterations in the password field iterations + salt + hash

4200085
int	chars
based on your comments about how sql is not returning 5 chars use this updated query to go from int to varchar with leading zeros

4200095
min	max
when grouping every column in the display list that is not part of the group by expression must be passed through an aggregate function avg min max but you re just asking for day

4200101
fpdf	fpdi
last time i had to do this zend_pdf wasn t around and i ended up using fpdf fpdi which was ugly but worked fine

4200106
put	get
the easiest way to get this done is to put the empty view in the main.xml layout

4200130
scheme	racket	lisp	racket	lisp	scheme

the problem is that neither ie7 or 8 load the new content - latest versions of safari firefox opera and google-chrome are all ok

4200198
inherited	properties
queue implementations generally do not define element-based versions of methods equals and hashcode but instead inherited the identity based versions from class object because element-based equality is not always well-defined for queues with the same elements but different ordering properties

4200221
subtraction	addition
i ve already overloaded subtraction addition etc

i suppose that this topic is absolutely basics of fp for many of you but i ask for help here because i haven t found anything on the internet about signatures in ocaml there are some articles about signatures in haskell but not explanations

4200395
post	get
i think i should add that if you re using a server how to configure it and how to get the connections to your code will vary by server and j2ee level so post your environment

4200446
min	max
i ve got a form with two radio buttons buying renting and two select lists min price max price below

one thing i have found useful is a little function that takes a nsstring a uifont and a cgsize returning a cgfloat representing the largest font size for that string that will fit in the cgsize passed - it uses sizewithfont on successively smaller point sizes until the size returned fits within the cgsize argument

4200479
width	height
you can pass cgfloat_max as either x or y if you don t care about one dimension like when you are checking width of a line and will check height later on the whole string

4200479
min	max
you define max and min font sizes of course

4200483
post	get
i d like to get rid of the show link and make the entire postpreview link to the post

4200493
firefox	safari
i will have to check it out in all types of browsers but at the moment it is working in firefox and safari

4200605
migrate	upgrade
when the client wants to upgrade migrate their data to the later instance of the product and change the rewrite rule for their subdomain

4200608
ready	each
the effect is that you parse the tree of elements depth first and at the end of each branch you roll it back into the parent until you re left with a single object such as your connectionlist that contains all of the parsed data ready to be used

4200669
ubuntu	linux
i have an ubuntu server 10 virtualized with an amd64 architecture i used this machine to test the program under linux and everything works fine

4200700
width	height
respectively set the height and width of the a element according to your image size or better the surrounding div

4200705
int	double
in file2.c you decide that it would be a great idea to represent the number of chickens as a double instead of an int but you forget to update file.c

4200705
int	double
the linker will treat number_of_chickens as a name referencing a 4 bit int in file.c and an 8 bit double in file2.c

4200705
int	double
if you call the count_chickens function it will return garbage the high 32 bits of the double will be filled in with the contents of int number_of_chickens the low 32 bits will be undefined - whatever comes after number_of_chickens in memory

4200706
opensuse	debian	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	opensuse
i d recommend you just package a 32 and 64-bit binary for .deb and rpm that way you can hit most of the major distros debian fedora opensuse ubuntu

4200711
for-loop	loops
but generally the slowest big o algorithm would affect the program s efficiency the most - so a stand-alone for-loop that depends on n as its stop condition wouldn t slow down a program much more if it also had nested for loops that depend on n

4200719
french	hebrew
the program stores bible verses in 5 languages hebrew russion arabic english and french

4200734
maven-assembly-plugin	maven-jar-plugin
you need to use two plugins to accomplish this maven-jar-plugin and maven-assembly-plugin

4200743
opensuse	debian	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	opensuse
you should at least target debian ubuntu with dpkg packages redhad fedora mandriva with rpm and suse opensuse with rpm again i mention these two rpm cases separately because you might need to produce separate packages for these families of distributions

4200760
stdout	stderr
i have my stdout stderr signal slot s working just fine but i cannot seem to find a good solution for finished

4200784
centos	linux
i need to create an ssh connection between two linux machines running centos v5 but the latency could be as high as 30 seconds

4200797
freebsd	linux
i figured out what the issue was i was first getting a econnrefused which on linux i can just retry the connect after a short pause and all is well but on freebsd the following retry of connect fails with einval

4200803
post	get
i have tried the post how to get around dnsrecordlistfree error in .net framework 4.0

4200831
min	max
you have selected buy and selected min 100 and max 200

4200871

is it possible to put a magento site under an maintenance flag so that visitors will get a message that the site is under construction

4201099
width	height
i want a fixed top pane that has a fixed height and the width stretches and shrinks as the page is resized

4201105
stdout	fflush
if you fflush stdout after every output call that you want to see immediately that will solve the problem

4201105
stdout	fflush
alternatively you can use setvbuf before operating on stdout to set it to unbuffered and you won t have to worry about adding all those fflush lines to your code

4201131
put	get
ie the entire list dictionary is get and put

4201131
put	get
the examples i have come across appear to put individual item in the cache as opposed to entire collections with regions being used for bulk get operations

4201156
hide	show
it hide them when they aren t needed and show them when they are

4201174
put	get
trying to get full coverage from integration tests is a bad idea to put it mildly

4201238
apache-poi	docx4j
if its just a single word file why don t you convert it to docx and then use docx4j or apache-poi

4201315
integer	unsigned
you should also make it unsigned using the u suffix as i ve shown to avoid the issues of left shifting a signed integer

4201325
fflush	gets
so there are situations where printf won t fflush even if it gets a newline to send out such as

4201325
stdout	fflush
as to how to deal with that if you fflush stdout after every output call that you want to see immediately that will solve the problem

4201325
stdout	fflush
alternatively you can use setvbuf before operating on stdout to set it to unbuffered and you won t have to worry about adding all those fflush lines to your code

4201330
maven-assembly-plugin	pom.xml	maven-assembly-plugin	maven-jar-plugin	maven-jar-plugin	pom.xml
the pom.xml includes configuring the jar plugin maven-jar-plugin and configuring the assembly plugin maven-assembly-plugin

4201373
expander	grid
place a grid inside the dockpanel and put each expander into its own column

4201420
spaces	delimiter
if you are storing more than one email in a field you should add a delimiter like a spaces or a pipe

4201478
svg	vml
look into raphaeljs which uses svg w3c recommendation and vml as a base for creating graphics. it is completely browser-independent and allows image rotation by arbitrary degrees

4201539
int	double
if you try to read the first four bytes of that double as an int you are not going to get back what you think

4201543
cout	cin
and for that you can use the standard library s facilities like cin and cout

4201545
integer	unsigned
there are other minor exceptions like being able to reinterpret a signed integer as an unsigned integer. you can find more in both the c standard c99 6.5 6-7 and the c++ standard c++03 3.10 if i recall correctly

4201585
typedef	struct
1 when they have declared the typedef struct which is the tag name or the name of the

4201592
int	boolean
are we talking about boolean and int or larger complex types that take up many bytes of memory

4201597
typedef	struct
the struct type is struct channel_t and the new typedef is channel_t

4201597
typedef	struct
no typedef is required when defining a struct

4201606
equals	tostring	equals	gethashcode	tostring	gethashcode
you could always create a custom struct of course taking the integer value in the constuctor and maybe a custom conversion operator overriding the tostring method and probably equals gethashcode etc

4201609
typedef	struct
the typedef line is just a typedef it doesn t define the struct

4201612
integer	unsigned
you can simply use int or if it must not be negative uint unsigned integer

4201626
hide	show
just add hide show functionality to the tab bar controller where you need to

4201634
int	chars
you can use padleft int totalwidth chars paddingchar like

4201659
int	double
the new value may appear to be garbage but it s simply the result of interpreting the first sizeof int bytes of the double 3.1416 trusting there to be a useful int value there

4201659
int	double
if you want the two things to be independent - so setting the double doesn t affect the earlier-stored int - then you should use a struct class

4201673
int	chars
ed s answer describes the floating part but how about we examine how int and chars are stored first

4201673
int	chars
if an int is 32 bits and each of the chars is 8 bits then r should correspond to the to the left-most byte g the second one and so forth

4201684
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but i need this to work in all 5 major browsers firefox internet explorer 7 and 8 opera google-chrome and safari

4201693
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to figure out why the front page of my blog renders differently between google-chrome and firefox

4201693
google-chrome	firefox
it appears broken in google-chrome but renders without issues in firefox

4201741
google-chrome	firefox
this should fix most of your google-chrome related issues and firefox for me

4201744
post	get
use post instead of get if you have huge data

4201758
versioning	upgrade
when the ipad os versioning gets upgrade to 4.0 it will most likely support multisampling because the hardware is indeed capable of supporting multisampling

4201813
int	double
be careful to ensure that you aren t going to get int overflow there though - the max value of must be less than the maximum value you can store in a word or double word if your using longer int types

4201827
firefox	safari
this functionality currently works within firefox however in safari by pressing combinations such as command + + or command + 1 it does not do the intended functionality and instead does the functionality inherent to the browser

4201827
firefox	safari
i am currently using the preventdefault function which is why this works in firefox but i am not sure what this does not work in safari

4201833
inherited	subclassing

4201907
mp3	wav
for actually recording a beep from the pc s speaker to a wav mp3 -- i don t know if that s possible

4201954
getter	setter
i d like to see the class declarations properties with field access annotations without getter and setter will probably suffice

4201966
stdout	stderr
best practice imho is for a library to not print anything to stderr or stdout because they may not even be present

4202043
updatepanel	onclientclick
because of the button being within the updatepanel and provided the childrenastriggers updatemode properties are set correctly it is the buttons onclientclick event that will be fired on the server side when you click the button

4202048
ssl	https
cause your https servers are in tcp mode as they should be for ssl so a layer 7 rule wont work

4202073
qstring	qdir
for deleting you can call bool qdir remove const qstring filename

4202111
google-chrome	firefox
so i recommend that you first test in firefox or google-chrome

4202146

if the use of windows is not crucial i have successfully used tcpreplay on a linux machine run as root to read arbitrary packets from a pcap file and send them out on a network interface

4202289
implements	extends
the driver - which implements driver it doesn t extends drivermanager - simply registers an appropriate instance using drivermanager.registerdriver

4202323
mvp	presenter
the mvp architecture i m using has the presenter create listeners and define the view interface but view objects are singletons

4202359
google-chrome	firefox
i have checked and found the same behaviour across google-chrome 6.0 ie8 and and firefox 3.5

4202361

if there annotations are on a getter then only the getter are considered for persistence and the state is accessed via the getter setter

4202436
folder	directory
i have an wordpress setup into blog folder under my site directory

4202513
qtreeview	qmainwindow
when i resize the qmainwindow the two qtreeview s get resized with an 1 1 ratio between them

4202528
int	chars
i am trying to copy the memory value of int into the chars buffer

4202530
numericupdown	maskedtextbox
the easiest way would be to use a maskedtextbox use the mask property or a numericupdown control

4202545
int	chars
you are copying the byte representation of an int into a chars array

4202579
int	double
int double ... or something app-specific

4202627
g++	gcc
can anyone tell me how i can make the build process use g++ a not gcc

data binder will read such annotation and call the getter and setter methods to set the title of the north component for you

4202658
uiview	subviews
the subviews you add could be either plain old uiview or your own special subclass of uiview

4202700
ssl	https
this is why https and ssl was invented not only for encryption but also to verify that users are who they say they are

4202724
instances	transient
those are semantics of transient - each time a new instances is provided

4202744
mp3	ogg
looking at generated source of your page you load as first source an ogg file then a mp3 file in this exact order

4202843
onkeyup	onkeydown
for instance there is onkeydown and onkeyup for use when you are dealing with keyboard input. br so how can i find out when on fingureup happens

4202852
viewmodel	caliburn
in the previous example if your textbox was called ordernumber and your viewmodel property was called ordernumber caliburn assumes they must be the same thing and automatically binds them for you

4202895
junit	testng	ant	pom.xml
probably you have figured this out but when compiled and if using ant or mvn you can pass arguments to your junit or testng from inside the pom.xml file

4202919
folder	directory
i wrote this code it s supposed to be a clipart browser locked to klip folder under current directory

4202941
post	get
i would like to use powershell to look thru a textfile get all values and prefix and post fix these values with a character

4203005
atomic	compare-and-swap
and the compiler doesn t provide extra functions to wrap these operations c++11 standard has atomic operations including compare-and-swap has div ldiv et al for getting quotient and remainder efficiently

4203005
prepare	execute
you re artificially restricting its choices regarding register allocation cpu instructions etc. so it may take longer to prepare the cpu registers with the values needed to execute your hardcoded instruction then longer to get back to an optimal allocation for future instructions

4203019
postgresql	mysql
is there any tools which is equivalent to pgpool-ii which is for postgresql for mysql db

4203045
put	get
i can get the exact url select customername it is accessing and put it into a browser and it works without issue

4203075
trie	tree
find or implement a trie or prefix tree which will basically start at a root node and descend for each character the user has typed - the results are all valid endpoint nodes below the node reached at the end of descending the user input

4203216
trie	tree
use a radix tree wiki or trie wiki if you are concerned about performance.the radix tree is more memory efficient compared to a trie

4203237
fasta	blast
see fasta and blast

4203256
oncreate	setcontentview

google-chrome	safari
this causes trouble in some browsers google-chrome or safari which don t show the thumbnail inline

4203301
for-loop	arrays
i have a for-loop with one function in it which gets me only the latest value from the arrays

4203325
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
also note the for-loop change...you should never use a for...in loops to iterate an arrays use a normal for-loop for that

4203331
toolchain	binutils
cross-compiler toolchain are not an easy thing to setup though because you need way more than just the compiler binutils libraries etc

4203365
boost	stl
we use the stl and boost 1.39

4203417
post	get
using a next variable seems unellegant since i have to set it as a get variable on the originating page link and then set it as a hidden post variable in my form

4203442
for-loop	while-loop
when i have a simple program that computes squares from 1 to n implemented using for-loop and while-loop the behaviour is not the same

4203445
post	get
i need to send data by get method because by post it will get real messy as i have to show many pages of search results

4203452
operands	decrement
well the operands are evaluated from left to right and in each case the result of a postfix operation is the value of the variable before the increment decrement whereas the result of a prefix operation is the value of the variable after the increment decrement.

4203482
getter	setter
this is also a difference in actionscript 3 getter setter are functions in c# you define them inside the variable

4203496
post	get
passing the originating page withi post get

4203604
openfire	ejabberd
me and my team were working on the exact same problem - only that we use openfire instead of ejabberd mostly cause we have java skills but are not familiar with erlang

4203686
post	get
sure post will work but i really feel a search as a get and not a post

4203698
width	column-count
a good method would be to check for column-count support with modernizr then create two additional container elements each one-third the width of the parent then using javascript we can watch for expansions and pull the necessary number of elements to the other two to maintain even sizes

4203717
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works fine in firefox and ie but it doesn t work in google-chrome anyone have an idea of how to make it work

4203721

4203728
mouseup	mousedown
some are mousedown and mouseup or a variation on that

4203747
rss	feed
it looks like twitter has retired rss feed and now only exports data as json

4203755
post	get
even if you dislike to post when it is really a get it will work

4203755
post	get
if you will must stay with the standard definition of get post etc

4203755
post	get
than maybe consider to post a query that query will be stored on the server with a query id and request the query later with get by id

4203771
nettcpbinding	net.tcp
configure nettcpbinding in your iis site and set enabled protocol as http net.tcp using advanced setting .it should work

4203820
pull	push
see here for some more information on gwt and push which is actually pull

4203836
namedtuple	dictionary
some collective nouns are lists dictionary tuples sets or namedtuple and you don t need to do very much work

4203849
post	get
as petermmm previsouly said you could do this with a post create and store the query result and then use a get to retrive the query but it s more pratical do only a post and retrieve the result

4203864
textarea	textbox
it just needs to work on textarea and textbox no other checking is needed

4203906
union	distinct
you will have to use a union but if the tables are distinct consider using a union all which will be faster

4203916
rss	feed
i have created a rss feed for my blog it validates fine

4203918
versioning	upgrade
i have a old mac 10.5.6 installed ...since it is a p owerpc g4 i cannot upgrade it to snow leopard now i am not able to find it anywhere will xcode versioning 3.2 work on mac os 10.5 or not

4203940
glibc	tcmalloc
so what i want is basically to make glibc to use tcmalloc instead of glibc s malloc

4203946
superclass	subclassing
the superclass is account and i have two subclassing - currentaccount and savingsaccount

4203952
for-loop	while-loop
and now we know that for-loop is faster than while-loop

4203965
implements	extends
i don t want to keep any default implementation forcing all extends classes to implements this method

4203988
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
this will force all subclassing to implements it even if it is implements in a superclass of the abstract-class

4204059
post	get
how can i get the enter press to call a method or post back the page with keywords in url parameters

4204083

i had a similar problem with chrome i think i seem to remember using mouseover and mouseout instead

4204161
google-chrome	firefox
note google-chrome in this case refers to firefox s user interface

4204190
hide	show
when i then instead hide the #addform div on init and right after show it again it s the same problem

4204193
mouse	keyboard
an element can gain focus via keyboard commands such as the tab key or by mouse clicks on the element

4204249
uploadify	swfupload
so i have tried both swfupload and uploadify component

4204263
post	get
if you need to handle this originating page - form page - originating page then in reality it will look like this originating page -- get -- form page -- post submision -- form page 2 -- get redirect -- originating page

4204291
boost	stl
since you use stl and boost performance might be a pretty big deal

4204291
boost	stl
vc2010 supports rvalue references and move semantics which even if you don t use it in your own code speeds up boost and stl code significantly

4204291
versioning	upgrade
but if at some point you upgrade to a recent versioning of boost you ll get the benefit

4204302
superclass	subclassing
and i was wondering if it were possible to share functionality for some common functions between subclassing by implementing them in the superclass

4204322
pypdf	pdfminer
for splitting however you will have to stick with pypdf as pdfminer doesn t support that

4204331
postgresql	mysql
i don t know how to do this in postgresql but in mysql you could create database view pointing to a table in another database

4204427

4204642
switching	screens
is there like an id or something saying what s on screens at the moment of the switching

4204670
subclass	abstract-class
really it s not the best idea in the world the best idea is to make account as abstract-class but when you test the subclass of account and call the applyinterest this exception force you to implement this method in the subclass

4204691
google-chrome	firefox
the main problem is that my pages do not render properly in firefox and google-chrome but render perfectly in ie8

i had the choice of struts or spring mvc but opted for stripes as it was considerably easier to get to grips with

4204846
for-loop	loops
use a while when you don t know how many times you want to loops otherwise use a for-loop

4204852
realloc	malloc

there are also frameworks that extend cuda to enable a smoother development process like managed cuda which has features like debugging and profiling

4205020
waitpid	fork
similarly programs that know they re finished and just want to run another program don t need to fork exec and then wait waitpid for the child

4205046
int	double
clearly this makes using a long or double in your looping variable less efficient than an int in the java memory model but implementations may vary in performance

4205150
sorting	filtering
we php project data locally stored in a json-variable locally processed sorting filtering no paging up to 1000 records at once were faced with the same problem and did not find a solution yet

width	height
i figured that as i was checking the value of a single pixel width and height are 1 and giving it a gl_int as type gl_rgb as format a single pixel should take up a single int 4 bytes hence i passed a pointer to an int as the data argument

4205460

my code pauses the submission and returns validation result currently just a dummy function which returns result true but then the submit action is not performed

4205577
width	height
quick easy question why is 640x480 always the standard window width height when getting a webcam stream

4205641
submit	submission
would it not be better to just submit the form via the ajax call and return the result of the submission validation failed or succeeded

4205645
int	chars
you could analyze your current code by printing out the value of int ae1.charat 0 and seeing which unicode chars that is

4205725
mouse	keyboard
by using .keypress you ll be checking the value each time the key is pressed mouse or keyboard and it should work fine across most browsers

you can do it in the project manager and then adjusting the properties so that the file is published to the application folder copy to output directory copy always

4206073
nsmutablestring	nsstring
bear in mind that an nsstring could actually be pointing to an nsmutablestring

4206083
pull	push
however for your problem at hand i strongly recommend looking into git another nice version control system that does not require a centralized host all checkouts are treated equally so you make changes on your laptop and push them to the desktop or you make changes on your desktop and push them to the laptop or you pull changes from the laptop to the desktop and vice versa

4206169
google-chrome	firefox
xmlhttprequest should be easily support for extensions for both firefox and google-chrome

i use jquery plugins like flot and jqplot for plotting and charts in asp.net mvc web applications

4206612
int	double
i even tried changing the binding property s datatype to int string and double

4206616
width	height
if you didn t set width and height values for your images the browser would have to download the images first to discover their dimensions and it would slow page loading for people with crappy connections

4206616
width	height
for the past few years i ve been using css i always put a width and height declaration in my img tags in my html

4206616
width	height
my question is is setting width and height in the style sheet and no longer adding these html attributes just as good

4206665
width	height
image width height as an attribute or in css

4206723
width	height
css is parsed before the page is loaded so specifying the height width in css will work just as well as specifying it inline

4206723
width	height
one thing to keep in mind is that inline styles and that includes height and width declarations always trump css in specificity

4206859
intersect	contains
you basically want to check if the frame of the subviews inside the uiscrollview intersect the scrollview s frame if you only want to determine partial visibility or if the frame is contains in the other frame if you want to determine full visibility

4206859
intersect	contains
however in order to check if the subview s frame intersect and or is contains in the scrollview s frame you need to translate it from the local coords inside the scrollview to the global coordinates outside the scrollview

4206874
jobs	cron
this is why legitimate cron jobs were invented

4206956
post	get
you can get your custom post query and ordering using either one of the following functions techniques

4207209
accessor	ivar
since you d have to do that every time you want to assign the ivar it s normal to create an accessor

4207209
accessor	properties
if you use properties you can use synthesize to create the accessor

4207246
width	height
there are several images in the email which are arranged using width and height attributes of the img tag

4207246
width	height
but on outlook 2007 it gets messed up and the images shows up in random sizes even though height and width are given explicitly in the html code

4207261
pascal	delphi
is there a sax parser for delphi and free pascal

4207266
typedef	struct
typedef struct omp_lock_t lock

4207292
htmlcleaner	jsoup
use the jsoup htmlcleaner with a configuration specified by a whitelist

4207297
put	get
now the obvious solution is to just put the meta-inf services file in my application jar like it says but how do i do that yet still get it to use the user s jre default implementation of jaxp

4207306
concave	convex
if those points may not define a convex polygon you need a concave hull algorithm in step 1

4207330
width	height
outlook 2007 seems respects the actual width and height of the image over the declared width and height of the image in cases where the declared width or height of the image is close to or equal to 0

4207330
width	height
and outlook does not respect the width and height css attributes at all . your best bet is to re-size the images in question so that they actually have the height and width you declare rather than re-sizing them

4207333
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this will work for all modern browsers except ie firefox safari google-chrome etc... now to get ie to behave you will need the following

4207385
jquery	jqmodal
i have this little piece of jquery jqmodal code which works fine

4207386
subtract	add
i m trying to build a single query that can add subtract seconds from a datetime stamp

4207467
int	chars
the two valid mains are int main and int main int chars any thing else may or may not compile

4207485
post	get
for instance a function that executes a sql query is a sink and get post variables are sources of taint

4207498
google-chrome	firefox
i ve ran this code in firefox ie google-chrome and they all caught the error so i assume you mean catch the miss spelling

4207501
submit	submission
alternatively intercept the form submission using javascript and submit it using xhr iff the server-side validation succeeds

4207535
sys	subprocess
then there are the os sys subprocess and dircache modules

4207553
backgroundworker	dispatchertimer
however having a backgroundworker invoke partialemployees.clear on your ui thread will have the same effect as using the dispatchertimer so you need a different solution than the one you are going for

4207553
backgroundworker	dispatchertimer
the solution is to break your work into smaller portions and do them one at a time either from a dispatchertimer or a backgroundworker

4207565
children	parent
parent children siblings etc -

4207570
put	get
what is the proper way to convert from mysql s datetime to rfc 2822 or at least how do i convert to a format to put into php s date function to get the correct response

4207580

the bottom right adorner and the top right adorner seemed to appear about the width of the and height from the side of the canvas when ever moved

4207627
multiplying	add
both libs add and multiplying where compiled before and are present in the same directory

4207687
openbsd	freebsd	glibc	newlib	libc	newlib
if you really need a self contained c library i would consider newlib or uclibc or freebsd s openbsd s libc over glibc

4207693
keydown	keyup	textchanged	keyup
for instance a textbox is a control that is designed to capture and then visually represent text that was entered by using the keyboard and it uses keyup and keydown in its own logic to capture keystrokes then also raises its own textchanged event if the text actually changed

4207693
keydown	keyup
you can still generally add handlers for keyup and keydown to a textbox or any related control that is intended to process text input

4207693
onkeyup	onkeydown
custom controls can implement their own similar override behavior for key events by overriding onkeydown onkeyup

4207693
onkeyup	onkeydown
if your custom control processes specific accelerator keys or has control or focus behavior that is similar to the scenario described for textbox you should place this logic in your own onkeydown onkeyup overrides

4207713
jboss	glassfish
o servlet 3 is supported by glassfish 3 but not much else yet will be part of tomcat 7 probably jboss 6

4207733

4207740
innodb	myisam
innodb or myisam

4207780
button	checkbox
do you think it s a good idea to use svg instead of raster graphics for ui controls like checkbox button and such

4207844
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
i can t find anything to confirm whether properly constructed queries work faster on a case-sensitive vs case-insensitive database although i suspect the difference is negligible but a few things are clear to me

4207881
prepare	execute
to do that we need to work around two limitations of mysql a to execute dynamic sql inside a stored procedure it needs to be a prepare statement

4207914
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
use the developer tools in google-chrome and safari or firebug for firefox and check out the profiles section

4207985
put	get
isready yes by the time they get put in the operation queue then a serial

4208063
hide	show
hide the currently visible menu and show the one to be made visible

4208082
pop-up	dialog
so i want an intent to start an activity that simply brings up a dialog pop-up box telling the user how to use the app

4208108
hide	show
it is exactly the same as patrcikâ s code with the hide and show functions

4208128
margin	text-align
i don t know what an asp.net repeater is but in ie if you are centering a block level element using the margin rules margin 0 auto then the parent element needs to have text-align center

4208131
sharepoint	splist
since you re building a sharepoint web part you should access the list and its data via the splist class

4208136
children	parent
for another thing i may have gone overboard in saving references to both parent and children in these classes. but i hope it gives you ideas that you can start working with

4208157
dictionary	map
using attributes to model a map or dictionary whose keys are xml names and whose values can sensibly be represented as strings good

4208180
vbscript	vba
how to submit form data by using xmlhttp or serverxmlhttp object at which uses vbscript but is easily converted to vba

4208193
hide	show
how can i let the bullets show up in my text content but at the same time hide my navigation list-style-type

4208239
mouseleave	mouseenter
to be sure here independent of initial mouse position you have to split your .hover to explicitly call .slidedown on mouseenter and .slideup on mouseleave like this

4208303
wordpress	joomla
drupal has a pretty horrible security record see the cve numbers quoted in another comment as do the other two major php-based frameworks wordpress and joomla

4208326
mouseleave	mouseenter
the .hover method accepts 2 functions representing mouseenter and mouseleave

4208329
uilabel	uitextview
find uicontrollers that draw nsattribute string because uilabel uitextview doesnot support nsattributedstring.

4208362
sorting	grouping
sql is very powerfull at sorting and grouping so let sql do his job and dont move it to the client

4208367
stdout	stdio	stdout	fflush	stdio	fflush
the reason that the fflush stdout is needed is that since the process is duplicated by fork that means that the buffering done for stdout by stdio is duplicated as well

4208367
stdout	fflush
the n at the end of that first print statement may make it go ahead and fflush stdout but this isn t guaranteed

4208382
children	parent
to show child categories remove parent 0 and likewise change it to a category id if you just want to display that categories children

4208383
switching	screens
a qstackedwidget manages a number of same sized screens that you can switching between each having its own set of display widgets and buttons

4208387
post	get
let s pretend that you had the task of creating a url a single web page which receives input get and or post and must clean and safely store that input to a database

4208399
pull	push
supported platform s this will push or pull you toward different code structure if you abstract the different platforms differently

4208404
ostream	istream
it would appear that there is a lot of extra unneeded information here the crux of the issue is that there is no streaming operator to got from an istream to an ostream

4208426
for-loop	loops
if i use a for-loop inside the while loops i would just be lining up the same records x times for each while loops

4208456
bmp	png
when using the system.windows.controls.openfiledialog control to browse image folders windows 7 it will show preview thumbnails icons for jpg png or bmp image files

4208457
google-chrome	firefox
in ie the print button shows but in firefox and google-chrome the print button does not show

4208457
google-chrome	firefox
i need to be able to issue a print command to the reportviewer the same way it is done from within the control but only in firefox and google-chrome

4208486
folder	directory
i know there is a way to set if files directory can be seen and the folder that the file dialog looks in but haven t come across a way to set the file extension

4208580
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome firefox but when i try it in ie the text fades out but the background color remains the same and just disappears without fading out once the text fade has finished

4208617
put	get
one pattern is to put persisted objects directly under com.mysite.common and mashups of persisted items that get transferred over the wire in com.mysite.common.dto and of course the client gui code is in client

4208636
google-chrome	safari
it s worth noting that window.opener doesn t work if the file isn t loaded through an http connection in google-chrome though it works fine in safari

4208678
memcpy	malloc
if you can get say dozens of times improvement on heavily used functions like malloc or memcpy

4208708
width	height
how can i recognize the height and the width of a human body in an image

4208726
children	parent
i don t see why z-index affects ff but it has the following effect since .abs_znone has no z-index it has the same stacking context as its parent .fix_z0 and .fix_z1 would have a z-index in relation to any children of .fix_z0

4208789
portrait	landscape
the problem is i can only snap a pic in landscape mode in order for the bmp to be displayed right side up - is there a way i can rotate it to right side up if the pic is taken in portrait mode

4208793
width	height
if not then you re probably out of luck since forced perspective can trick even the best of algorithms that detect human height and width

4208820
post	get	pexpect	subprocess
from my old post i get to know there is pty and pexpect which could make the subprocess thought it is interacting with pseudo-tty

4208869
button	checkbox
what i would like to have happen is once a checkbox is clicked it makes that container visible then the next and back button when clicked only go to the next visible container

4208877
versioning	upgrade
unfortunately the team i am creating this for cannot upgrade to a newer versioning of outlook so if there is a 2003 quirk that may be affecting it

4208913
min	max
and even weirder when i try c min max ...

4208938
hide	show
and you can do the reverse hide panel a and show panel b by doing this

4208946
children	parent
these behave differently because #byidname div refers to any children of type div with parent #byidname

4208951
printf	fgets
alternatively you can convert your program to be unicode-aware but then you can no longer use a lot of standard library functions such as fgets and printf and you need to use wchar_t everywhere in place of char

4208966
width	height
if you add padding to an element you must decrease width and height accordingly

4208978
pop-up	dialog
is there a way for when the user hits the detect faces button for me to have the app delay for a few seconds and have a pop-up box with the dialog detecting... show up

4208983
hide	show
then make a function to navigate back forward through the array and show hide the containers they reference

4208983
button	checkbox
or have a button to start the wizard that loops through the checkbox and removes the containers from the view stack that are not checked

4208993
user-controls	tabcontrol	tabcontrol	tabitem
it has a tabcontrol where each tabitem is a user-controls and it does this by applying the mvvm pattern

4209015
public	protected
then on construction each class provides a protected constructor for use by subclasses and a public constructor for non-inherited instance creation

4209015
public	protected
the protected constructor in each class does not add this to the container of instances while the public constructor adds this to the container

4209050
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
so my first thought was that i was being blocked by the server with their clientaccesspolicy.xml or crossdomain.xml

4209060
webkit	gecko
i ve looked at web rendering engines like webkit and gecko that seem too complex latex doesn t seem to have a c++ api ghostscript looks the most promising so far

4209092
hash	salt
then for your mapping of business object to viewmodel it s straight forward except for the costhash you want to calculate the sha256 hash or other hash of cost + private key + predicable salt value such as the id of the receipt itself

4209092
hash	salt
this would allow a person to easily transpose both the cost value and the costhash value from a different receipt however if you add in the id to be part of the salt the hash for 10 for receipt 1 will be different than 10 for receipt 2

4209099
rsa	aes
while it may be interesting to roll your own it is unlikely anything you can come up with will be as well vetted as aes rsa or sha

4209099
post	get
post it on a public server and try to get as much publicity as possible

4209099
rsa	aes
people everyday are researching ways to break aes rsa and sha and that provides a level of assurance that is impossible with a homebrew cipher

4209121
maven	pom.xml
we are using maven can i somehow reuse the version as defined in pom.xml

4209136
stdout	stderr
if it is good for you to read a mixture of stdout and stderr use processbuilder as following

4209136
stdout	stderr
now read from the input stream that contains both stdout and stderr

4209138
post	get
it is very easy to request get post with invalid data

4209172
width	height
make height and width of the div auto so it gets the height and width of the image

4209291
rss	feed
try saving the contents of the rss feed in a local file and see if the problem persists when loading from a local drive

4209317
hash	salt
for example credit card information or american social dingsbums numbers fall under certain laws and must be stored securely within in the database passwords must be salt and hash so not even db admins can retrieve the user s personal password again etc etc

4209363
int	double
so you say int i double d float f string s etc

4209365
google-chrome	firefox
ie is significantly more fussy about code correctness than firefox and google-chrome for html xml received via ajax especially

4209365
google-chrome	firefox
if firefox and google-chrome are handling an ajax request that ie isn t it is usually due to a parse error in the returned html xml

4209414
udp	tcp
or use udp instead of tcp

4209465
google-chrome	firefox
firefox is slow but google-chrome dosent have firebug which i find almost a requirement when developing with javascript

4209480
google-chrome	firefox
this is what i got up with after some help from my original qustion here jquery in internet explorer find image problem works in firefox and google-chrome

4209482
put	get
whenever i try to put a breakpoint in i get an exclamation point over the breakpoint saying this breakpoint will not currently be hit

4209490
google-chrome	firefox
is there some way site google-chrome extension firefox extension whatever that will show exactly which are the resources that are unsecured

4209490
ssl	https
i ve never dealt with ssl https certificates but i need to fix this issue asap

4209545
post	get
they therefore specifically don t want a response body so don t need to provide the list of potential choices you would for 300 to a get or post request

4209549
jboss	glassfish	jboss	geronimo	glassfish	geronimo
interestingly though it appears most major app servers support some mechanism of turning off delegation to isolate the application from the app server if necessary because of conflicts or otherwise websphere - parent-last glassfish - jboss - geronimo -

4209564
int	chars
it assumes that the string will only contain valid chars and that the string won t represent a number that s too big to fit in an int variable

4209616
accessor	properties
self is used to access class instance properties an accessor

4209631
getter	setter
the difference is that 1 is guaranteed to be using the property named myobject and therefore will trigger the getter and setter functions

4209631
getter	setter
the second one accessed the the instance variable and is not guaranteed to use the getter and setter functions

4209631
getter	setter
if your ivar has the same name as the property it should use the setter and getter functions

4209669
children	parent
in my object graph i have a standard parent + children relationship

4209674
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
take a look at the system.threading.waithandle class derived classes of interest are manualresetevent and autoresetevent

4209689
ant	maven
usually most of the gui for ant or maven are part of the ide

4209689
ant	maven
i use intellij that has an excellent support for ant and maven

4209691
inherited	properties
it means that you can establish a parent-child relation between two objects and immediately the child inherited all parent properties

4209691

free	malloc
a brief answer would be that the msvs c c++ runtime implements functions like malloc free stdio iostream and some c++-stuff like dynamic_cast and exception handling

4209787
width	height
my grid s width height which as you see is set my listboxitem template dynamically expands and shrinks down but when it expands beyond the size of the window still no scroll bar

4209845
set	bag
if you go with this approach you will need to set ticket on your userdata objects when you add them to the userdata bag

4209863
post	get
i know that flash and some other clients have problems doing anything other than get and post but i d still like to offer the more restful interface to clients that can be that expressive

4209874
profiling	instrumentation
however you should use instrumentation to profiling your code and see if it s necessary

4209878
udp	tcp
in tcp sockets it is done by fd number but how it is in udp socket

4209937
dictionary	map
you could just add your objects to a dictionary using each of the left and right values as keys and the id as the value basically a reverse map

4209948
width	height
give this width 100 and let it take it s natural height

4209952
implements	extends
try implements a class extends handler in your activity class and send a message to it from the other thread

4209968
for-loop	loops
you can use a while loops or a for-loop to iterate over the function multiple times

4209998
pseudo-class	visited
in order to get the content nav to have the style you want just apply a border to to the li and apply the rollover effects using the link visited hover focus active pseudo-class

4210022
int	chars
this separates the string on the _ chars and converts the second part to an int

4210031
min	max
you could write a stored procedure that picks a random unique_id between min and max and just tries to fetch that product until it gets one

4210053
maven	pom.xml
maven s pom.xml

4210105
udp	tcp

4210126
cvs	svn
i did this a few years ago with cvs and jira then svn and jira

4210148
atexit	main
then register this on startup as an atexit function since you ll want it to be called if something calls exit rather than returning from main

4210148
stdout	stderr
i don t understand why vs s output window is so slow and i don t understand why it doesn t capture stdout stderr but since i ve settled on using the above i ve found it less bothersome

4210162
super	abstract	super	extends
if your app contains several activities why not put this method in an abstract super class extends activity and then have all you activities extends it

4210182
nsstring	nsdata
the problem i m having is that when i get the nsdata from the url there s no method to easily convert that data into an nsstring without knowing the encoding

4210219
udp	tcp
i don t think you can use udp to communicate with tcp

4210219
udp	tcp
udp is not a super set of tcp

4210225
width	height
you can change the gridlines by adjusting the viewport coordinates and the gridline width by adjusting the rectangle height and width currrently 0.03

4210231
kerberos	ntlm
windowsstreamsecuritybindingelement invokes an sspi handshake between the client and the server using the spnego security package in the nettcpbinding this will normally result in kerberos being selected as the underlying security provider if available but will choose ntlm if not

4210258
valgrind	gprof
is it better to use valgrind or gprof for profiling

4210265
post	get
so what i d like to do is write a test that post to my controller so i can get the controller setup

4210267

4210290
backgrounding	multitasking
your problem is that the app is multitasking on ios 4 and doesn t get called again when the app comes back into focus from the backgrounding

4210361
post	get
using get instead of post isn t always possible when the amount of data exceed the maximum url length

4210361
post	get
the advantage of this is that the user won t get those annoying warnings about resending any post data you described and that multiple submissions of the same data are less likely to occur which means for example fewer double postings

4210369
children	parent
i m having some trouble figuring out why i can only get the children of one parent in my treeview to be added

4210385
rss	feed
any rss feed advertised by your site will not show up in the address bar on browsers that support this

4210407
getter	setter
thus core data adds methods to use in getter just as methods exist for use in setter to act as kvo hooks

4210407
getter	setter
this is why the standard pattern for implementing core data getter and setter prior to the existence of property and dynamic looked like this

4210418
jobs	cron
i m currently running 5 identical cron jobs one for each weekday to back up my public_html folder on the cpanel-based webserver

4210514
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
problem in firefox safari google-chrome and ie

4210523
for-loop	loops
since this is a non-standard for-loop using a while loops might be more appropriate as there are fewer preconceived ideas about how they work people looking at your code are more likely to read a while statement than a for statement as there is usually a model of how a for-loop should work in their head

4210542
interbase	firebird
is there something in delphi or interbase firebird i can change to make the data visible

4210542
interbase	firebird
maybe it is something on the interbase firebird connector

4210556
width	height
is 8 191 pixels in width or height

4210576
nsmenu	nspopupbutton
nspopupbutton takes an nsmenu full of nsmenuitems

4210578
post	get
have you tried using get instead of post

4210631
spaces	delimiter
the default delimiter are spaces and tab

4210631
spaces	delimiter
if you override the default delimiter it should read the entire line with spaces in between

4210631
spaces	delimiter
i set it to and it ignores spaces as delimiter and reads the entire line

4210639
post	get
i just typed that off the top of my head in the middle of this post so don t assume it is 100 accurate but you get the concept

4210661
int	chars
yes you cannot cast chars to int

4210661
int	chars
parseint doesn t take chars as argument so you have to convert first into string and then to int

4210671
chunked	transfer-encoding
while this works i was also told the issue is that the response is coming back as transfer-encoding chunked

input type file name filedata so you can access your file if you get the filedata after the multipart post

4210740
pop-up	dialog
apparently the easiest way to do this is to use script to redefine the alert function to something that doesn t pop-up a dialog

4210812
hash	salt
that means they have access to the hash passwords and salt

4210822
hash	salt
you should use a separate pseudo-random salt for each user and then store that salt with the password hash for that user

4210822
pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt	hash	salt
i would also recommend using a system like pbkdf2 or bcrypt rather than a simple salt hash

4210834
int	chars
to find out loop through the string you get in and print out each chars s int value and then do the same with your string that s hardcoded and see if they are the same

rss	feed
i am only pulling in via an rss feed about 12 images but this results in slow scrolling - if i get rid of the images it moves smoothly

4211003
ant	maven
the easiest way would be to generate static html javadoc pages as part of your build both ant and maven can do that easily and you can also do it manually using your ide or the command line deploy those to your server and redirect to or include them from your help page

4211006
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome 8 and firefox 3.6

4211066
children	parent
my problem is that the children s attributes are still being validated despite the parent attribute validating as true

4211066
children	parent
is there a way to stop the children from validating if the parent says so

4211158
expander	grid
for instance opening an expander that contains a grid with maybe 6 label and textbox controls goes from near-instantaneous to 3-4 seconds and there s then a visible delay between the time it renders the grid s second column the editable controls and the first their labels

4211158
expander	grid
if i drop back to 3.5 everything goes back to the way it was there s virtually no lag between opening an expander and seeing its contents and the labels in the grid render so quickly that you can t see it happen

4211159
rss	feed
can you help me with creating an rss feed

4211205
google-chrome	firefox
what actually happens is both the inner div and the content div match the outerdiv div rule despite that one of them is clearly triple checked in an inspector firefox and google-chrome a child of the inner div not the outer

4211214
firefox	safari
in safari firefox

in firefox the onbeforeunload event fires but in google-chrome it doesn t and it seems to error out with an unsafe javascript attempt to access frame before any events are fired

4211237
jdom	xerces
the standard xml parser that comes with java does not allow you to set a feature to provide a canonical version or understand xml space if that is going to be a problem then you may need a replacement xml parser such as xerces or use jdom

4211345
freemarker	velocity
so my uninitiated curiosity wonders why have spring specific tag-libs and the equivelent velocity freemarker macros for binding form building and validation

4211348
sdl	soil
i had it working partially with the soil library but i ve moved a lot of code to sdl and i d prefer to use img_load instead

4211379
int	chars
if you convert each 4 text digit decimal number in the server response string to a c int then you can convert each chars to an nsstring using something like

4211381
portrait	landscape
oddly when i snap a photo in portrait mode it is displayed on the imageview sideways like it was snapped in landscape ...the only way it is displayed right side up is if i snap the pic in landscape mode

4211404
udp	tcp
as for alternatives not requiring special modules by which i guess you mean modules not in the perl distribution you could conceivably write a daemon for your tasks and have them communicate over tcp or udp

4211420
post	get
how do i accept passed get or post values case insensitively

4211438
alertdialog	datepickerdialog	alertdialog	progressdialog
built in dialogs are alertdialog datepickerdialog progressdialog timepickerdialog see developer.android.com reference android app alertdialog.html

4211483

if you re storing them in a database then in the code where you re generating the link you need select statements to get the min and max

4211525
qtoolbutton	qwidget
either way the qaction must be added to the qtoolbutton through qwidget addaction qaction the slot s method signature must match the signal s signature and the connect invocation must include the signal slot parameters not just the names of the signal and slot

4211560
superclass	subclassing
i should mention that when using subclassing a onetoonefield is automatically created from the subclassing to the superclass

4211595
int	chars	unsigned	short
this is often considered something of a wart because in many cases it causes unsigned chars and unsigned short values to be promoted to int

4211595
unsigned	short
this is exactly what you re seeing - u16_varlow and u16_varhigh and unsigned short 5 are all promoted to int before the subtraction and comparison which then happen using int

4211595
unsigned	short
if you wish to be certain that an expression will use unsigned arithmetic you must do it in unsigned int not unsigned short

4211601
width	height
is it possible to resize the bitmap width and height after adding all the dots

you can use integer.parseint with a radix of 2 binary to convert the binary string to an integer

4211739
hash	md5
then i was planning to store the md5 hash of the picture in the user object so that the iphone would know to download the picture only if the md5 hash had changed

4211771
children	parent
i still want to show the row of the parent with no children and allow a user to click on them but the expand collapse icon is confusing

4211855
inherited	subclassing
note the dictionary will check for an exact match on types so if you want to handle subclassing you ll have to write some additional code to see whether base types are listed in the dictionary hint if you match a base class or even if you don t go ahead and add the actual derived type to the dictionary so you won t have to recurse through the inherited tree again

4211883
post	get
i m thinking of having a separate file xhrhandler.py and route specific post get requests to xhr methodname and then delegate the views.py methods to return the view passing along the httprequest for view processing

versioning	upgrade
your changes will remain across framework versioning upgrade

4212283
hide	show
is there a way to hide or show a uibarbuttonitem

4212304

hash	salt
if salt is prepended attacker can make hash state database for salt assuming salt is long enough to make a hashing step and then run dictionary attack

4212704
hash	salt
but if salt is appended attacker can make such database for password dictionary and additionally compute only salt s hash

4212739
nsautoreleasepool	nsrunloop

converter	multibinding
unfortunately it seems as though silverlight 4 of which wp7 silverlight is a subset doesn t have multibinding converter

4212997
children	parent
for the parent element but no size which has the side effect that it will be sized to contain it s children

4213024

4213247
google-chrome	safari
what about other browsers such as google-chrome or safari

4213247

this dll depends on other dlls that are sadly not located in the same folder and hence will only load if the current working directory has been set correctly which the large application does prior to calling loadlibrary on the dll

4213392
google-chrome	safari
unless you are hired by the mozilla foundation i don t see why users with google-chrome and safari and similar browsers should be notified with this message

4213398
int	double
it depends on whether you are looking for an int or a double

4213401
post	get
instead of sending the resultset via get post to the page why dont you send only whatever variables you use to construct your initial criteria then on the php preview page use php to query the db get the results and show them

4213401
post	get
you should always try to refrain from sending a complete resultset via get post to another page you should aim to only send operators which help you either get or create the resultset

4213410
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox have html geolocation implemented

in any case in any language a getter setter is a sign of poor encapsulation

4215057
getter	setter
it is not oop to have a getter setter for each instance fields

4215057
getter	setter
if you really want an anemic object then skip the getter setter and go directly to pod full-public struct

4215057
getter	setter
there is almost no benefit of using getter setter over fully public struct except that it complicates code so it might give you a higher rating if your workplace uses lines of code as a productivity metric

4217085
strlen	substr
that explains why we need to strlen and substr the integer

4217136
inherited	properties
your dependency properties is not thread safe meaning that it doesn t inherited from system.windows.freezable

though in this simple case you might be better doing a straight for-loop and using the arrays iterator functions reset next cur to get the values out of each arrays - or if they are keyed identically them you can just perform a foreach and use the key from one for the other

4217711
websphere	ibm

4218091
post	get
basically post and get are two different way to pass variables to a script

4218091
post	get
while the post method can be submitted with forms or ajax calls and it is pretty safe at least more than the get

4218991
folder	directory
3 in the past with other projects i ve worked on we kept a separate directory next to the tags trunk and branches with svn called configurations that had a base directory that contained a template of what the configuration file s should look like and developers folder and a servers directory

i have been using mplot3d part of matplotlib for some various 3d plotting and it has been performing the job admirably

4219723
for-loop	arrays
my current approach is a very ugly brute-force do a for-loop then check if you re in an odd row or not that builds a new arrays out of the old one but i am hoping there is a more elegant way of doing this

4219750
justmock	typemock
i believe that you can replace the implementation of a class like random using tools such as justmock or typemock

4219753

if it s not a bad idea to have these properties files in the scm should there be some kind of profile inherited for settings common between developer sandboxes

4220090
post	put
update i realize i described this wrong - it doesn t have to actually post the status it can take them to twitter ask them to logged in if not skip and then put the status update inside the tweet box and require the user to press tweet to send it

hide	show
another way around is having the heavy code taking time to run asynchronously in separate thread then in the main thread show only the please wait and have the separate thread hide that message once done

cdr	cons
i m not allowed to use lets loops or whiles and can only use basic car cdr setq cond cons append progn list.

4220380
addition	multiplication
if you re doing a typical shift-and-add binary long multiplication you could build some 64-bit shift and addition primitives from 32-bit operations then use the same method

4220390
cos	sin
then you use sin or cos functions to calculate x y coordinates of your quad corners properly

4220427
getter	setter
if i have a synchronized getter setter method for each variable then this will basically lock the whole class instead of the individual field until that method is set

4220431
folder	directory
however it hasn t actually made a folder in the realprofessionals directory called footer

4220444

that is bind .hover to elements with the class .project and simply add and remove the .selected class when the mouseenter first argument and mouseleave second argument events are triggered

4220620
mouseover	mouseout
edit karim s hover solution is better than doing it via mouseout mouseover

hash	md5
i have a legacy schema that contains tables with primary keys of type binary 16 -- its a md5 hash of the other columns

4220951

4220996
typhoeus	httparty
many other http client gems are available including httparty and typhoeus

4221016
boost	eigen	eigen	ublas
one exception may be boost numeric ublas which is does its job but eigen does it remarkably better

4221031
postgresql	mysql
with that being said you could also use mysql postgresql or some other database back end to deal with the flow of data between scripts

4221034
scheme	racket
many shared web hosts allow you to build and run arbitrary programs on your account so you can compile racket guile whatever saving the binary in your home directory and then have all of your scheme files executed by the shell by putting something like #

4221058
put	get
a sneaky way that you might be able to get this to work is to load the pdf in google doc viewer and then put an invisible div over it to intercept interaction

4221065
free	malloc
because of this structures passed to threads are normally dynamically allocated say using malloc and the thread can free it once it has completed

4221111
nunit	mstest
option 2 - customise the default workflow template and replace the mstest testing activity with an invokeprocess activity that calls the nunit command line

4221161
setcontentview	findviewbyid
i m almost sure that your problem is using findviewbyid r.id.false_view without calling setcontentview r.layout.blabla_whatever where blabla_whatever.xml contains false_view

4221161
textview	imageview
unless you show a completely different layout you wouldn t need to use different imageview nor textview to show the result

4221161
setcontentview	findviewbyid
if you insist in having different layouts make sure to call the setcontentview r.layout.noface_layout before using the findviewbyid method

4221196
prepare	execute
i m updating an existing application which uses a factory to build prepare statements and then execute them later which works for the rest of the system but i ve been tasked with adding a call to a statement which uses an ntext and i cannot figure out how to properly prepare the statement

int	chars
i have a few questions about converting chars to int

4221251
post	get
i would after creation of the record redirect back to the same page after adding the new get variable except i would not be able to pass post vars thus making error and success messages a complete pain in the ass

4221265
int	chars
the conversion from chars a 2-byte type to int a 4-byte type is implicit in java because this is a widening conversion -- all of the possible values you can store in a chars you can also store in an int

4221272
int	chars
if c rules are anything to go by your chars can be automatically coerced into an int without a cast in your first example as the conversion does not involve a loss of information

4221272
int	chars
however an explicit cast is required in your second case where there is potential to lose information since a chars is smaller than an int

4221301
ggplot2	aesthetics
when you add an aesthetics mapping that creates a legend such as ggplot2 will use the variable name as the title of the legend---in this case que_id

4221301

4221342
multiplying	add
add the fixed value to the base price then multiplying by the percentages value

4221343

if it is a vga screen i have to multiple the x y width and height by 2 for each control added manually

4221380
width	margin
assuming the buttons are supposed to be next to each other on the same line they should not each be centered using the auto margin but placed inside a div with a defined width that has a margin 0 auto

4221395

on windows you can use pdcurses that is compatible with ncurses

4221410
pull	push
after doing that and activating version control on the project in idea idea allowed me to push and pull from the repository successfully

4221422
width	height
to calculate the width and height of the far plane based on the camera position the width height of the viewport and the fieldofview angle

this method works for both ntlm and kerberos authentication

4221889
kerberos	ntlm
what is the equivalent in wcf that works in both ntlm and kerberos environments

4221913
getter	setter
assuming that doesn t work i think the next best thing is probably to subclass listproperty and manually extend it with getter setter and iterators based on the get_value_for_datastore and make_value_from_datastore functions for lists with fuzzydateproperty members

4221953
getter	setter
i ve been working with getter and setter to avoid the prospect of using global variables

4222035
stdout	stderr
- call the batch script as a subprocess and then save stdout and stderr to a file

4222035
stdout	stderr
however the problem is that the stdout stderr file is not being actually written to until the entire batch script has finished running or errors out

getter	setter
you just negated your use of private variables with getter and setter by using you just made me a global variable by not using var

post	get
there are only two ways get send data back to the server the query-string and form post values

4222201
getter	setter
they re just a bit of syntactic sugar for the . access and the ability to have synthesized getter setter methods to save you the tedium of writing your own

4222248
width	height
instead of keeping multiple arrays of x y width height values keep an arraylist of ellipse2d object so you don t have to keep recreating those objects either

4222308

how with jquery can i alert the user if the file input file selected isn t a gif jpg png or bmp

4222504
implements	extends
public class loginserviceimpl extends remoteserviceservlet implements loginservice

4222537

the problem is that sqlparameter looks like it defaults to nvarchar if no sqldbtype is present

4222836
hash	md5
that said if you want to obscure the order that urls were added to the shortening service you could use the output of a cryptographic hash function such as md5 or sha1 which is considered irreversible infeasible to derive the input from the output base-64 encode that and take eight characters for example

4222849
post	get
i need to build a code where i have to make the content disposition automatically.means i need to fetch some text fields some image fields some sounds and all of the request i have to take with the post request i can not use the get request

4222901

4223477
hash	md5
you have to define the uniqueness you want and then you can do a md5 hash of the key values defining your user for instance ip

4223497
implements	extends
since that makes more sense to me in the context of this domain i should be able to monitor carriers whether or not they re timed but mc is richly implements class and i will have to copy-paste all the methods into classes which used to extends from mc

4223497
getter	setter
timedcarrier extends carrier with a bunch of member variables and getter setter methods

4223497
getter	setter
monitoredcarrier extends carrier with member variables getter setter methods and a bunch of methods which work with the monitor

4223508
hash	md5
the chance of clashes here would likely head towards the chance of an md5 hash collision the point at which it s acceptable

4223509
post	get

4223566
children	parent
event propagation in jquery so adding an event listener to a parent with children will also activate that event on the children

4223602
implements	extends
as for mixing in the functionality you could make monitoredtimedcarrier extends monitoredcarrier and implements timer and then proxy all the timer methods to an internal class which extends your abstract class with the functionality you need

4223609
getter	setter
no properties are just syntactic sugar for getter and setter methods

4223634
getter	setter
properties are tranlated into two or just one in case you provided only a getter or perhaps a setter method that is

4223640
children	parent
yet in another words for each node there is no other ancestor then parent and grandparent then you could even use relational model directly to store hierarchical data either through self join which is not so bad with such low maximum depth or by splitting the data into 3 entities - grandparents parent and children

4223647
width	height
be sure that you define the correct width height for the containers which have the scroll-pane class

4224501

can t use max min width height

4224515

4225585
width	height
drawback is that your element needs have a fixed size height and width

i have imagemagick and graphicsmagick both installed

4229233

4229233
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
edit i just compared the sample vbs scripts that are included with imagemagick and graphicsmagick both named simpletest.vbs

4229233
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
this in itself may not mean much after all gm was forked from im but i m starting to wonder whether graphicsmagick really has a com object at all or whether they are just including imagemagick s com object in their windows binary

4229253
comparator	comparable
let s say i want to override the comparator method for the above type t in the comparable interface

stdout	stderr
if your script reads input or writes output to stdout or stderr you need to handle this on separate threads using process.getinputstream ...getoutputstream and geterrorstream

4229508
stdout	stderr
the script does not produce a large amount of output on both stdout and stderr

4229508
stdout	stderr
if it does then since the program reads all of stdout before stderr the stderr buffer may fill up and block the process from completing

4229508
stdout	stderr
in a real implementation you would read stdout and stderr in separate threads hint wrap the loadstream method in a class that implements runnable

4229513

4229934
ienumerable	iqueryable

4229934
inherited	properties
inherited would be if you had specialised derivatives of product that have either extra properties or different behaviour

i have a pop-up dialog that pop-up after a user had saved a value

4232158
getter	setter
if you re deeply indoctrinated into getter setter dependency injection used by libraries like spring then you ll have to unlearn a lot of bad habits before you can properly deal with immutability - in this case prior java exposure is probably going to hinder you in learning scala

4232159
cpu	processors
for the processors on which windows and your program runs the executable contains x86 machine code which can be executed on any x86 cpu whether it is from intel amd via or whoever else have made compatible processors over the years

post	get
it looks like you re trying to get all post for thread_id 54 but you re not joining the two tables and you re not getting any data from the tf_threads table other than thread_id which i presume is also present in your tf_posts table

4232831
folder	directory
note also that you don t need to put int in system32 it s better is you put it in the rcurl directory ms no longer recommends putting libraries in system folder because of dll hell

4232841

4232920
postgresql	mysql
i must say that there are many features i have gotten used to in sql server that are not present in mysql and postgresql

4232962
translation	localization
i assume the main reason is that you don t have to care about translation or localization files during development as the main language is in the code itself

wordpress	joomla
bigger better than wordpress you re typically looking at joomla or drupal there are others these are just the most common ones

4233099
folder	directory
if you go to those directory listed you should see a folder named cache

4233121
sitecore	umbraco
you could try umbraco or sitecore too

4233138
int	chars
if i set the first chars within the b portion of an instance of mytype then i also am setting the first byte of the int to that same value

4233142
int	double
all c# types including primitive types such as int and double inherit from a single root object type

4233142
int	double
java also has several primitive types int long double byte etc - however they are special in that they are not object-oriented and they could not have been defined using the language itself

4233142
int	double
at the same time java also has object-oriented primitive wrapper types int long double byte etc often called boxed types

4233142
int	double
and the list above actually stores an array of pointers to boxed int objects which is double the size and substantially less performant than the c# version

4233192
trie	tree
pure speculation but quite likely that it tokenizes the page into words with their associated ranges then it puts those words into either a radix tree or a trie and does a prefix search within the tree

4233218
post	get
given the simplest http server how do i get post variables in a basehttprequesthandler

4233224
versioning	upgrade
if the database already exists and no versioning upgrade occured these methods won t be executed

4233273
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome this would work

4233295
hash	salt
the database answer is that the salt and the hash are different quantities and so you should ideally store them in different columns

4233295
hash	salt
however it is not uncommon to denormalize a database to improve access speed - concatenating the hash and salt in the same column would be an example of denormalization

4233295
hash	salt
one reason to keep the salt and hash separate would be that you envisage searching for one or other of them

4233326
accessor	properties
this is non-trivial as you ll need to learn enough about il emit to generate the properties accessor and there s a bit of a learning curve

4233332
put	get
if we put all of this together we get

4233339
width	height
the data is definitely a bitmap object and i am able to display get the height width etc and access some pixels using getpixel

4233339
width	height
by trail and error i have found i can only access a reduced number of pixels of the image for example with one image which returned a height and width value of 420 380 i could also access 200 100

4233350

google-chrome	firefox
in the future you can look up such things with tools such as firebug for firefox or inspect tool for google-chrome

4233433
abc	subclassing
in order to use an abc you must create a subclassing of it and implement each and every pure virtual member function in the derived class

4233433
public	protected
beyond the scope of this article but a better rule of thumb is a base class destructor should be either public and virtual or protected and nonvirtual

4233464
post	get
it seems that the default is get hwo to process post and other http actions

4233474
ready	each
it should be executed each time network is ready

for the fading action jquery s fadein and fadeout should work

4233735
google-chrome	firefox
all works fine in ie and google-chrome it gives the right div where is it hovering over but in firefox event.target returns a div that is not even close to the mouse it is a div behind that div that actually captures the first click it is set with a relative position

4233752
hide	show
you can create a div and hide in the html and then you can use settimout and cleartimeout of javascript to show for few seconds here is an example

4233760
ssl	https
since the ssl configuration is per context the only option to have the frontend use https seems to be installing a client certificate to the accessing browser that is listed in tomcat s truststore as well either that or discarding the use of https altogether

4233878
innodb	myisam
myisam and innodb are the most commonly used engines

4233878
innodb	myisam
myisam is slightly faster than innodb and implements the fulltext index which is quite useful for integrating search capabilities

4233899
put	get
the thread that receives the messages from the client like through a socket get the message and put it in the queue

4233922
profiling	debugging
edit i guess release is much faster than debugging but why is this profiling so time consuming

4233927
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
note that an unchecked-exception is one derived from runtimeexception and a checked exception is one derived from exception

4233931
post	get
post variables are never set in a get request so doing the foreach first time on a page is useless

4234022
min	max
defining max in a system header is an indication that the implementor was incompetent and it s possible that certain versions of the environment have incorrect macros for example ones which do not properly protect arguments with parentheses but i ve even seen a max macro that was incorrectly performing min instead of max at least once in my life

4234029
width	height
the value is based on the width of containing block if the containing block has a horizontal text mode otherwise the height

4234029

in visual c++ if you #define nominmax before including the standard headers you will not get a macro max or min

4234108
ienumerable	ilist
ilist implements ienumerable so you could modify your model like so

4234123
spaces	delimiter
since whitespace is used as a delimiter here you d also need to escape your spaces

4234129
width	height
these strings height and width are only ever used in this very piece of code

4234176

4234297
folder	directory
the -force flag is needed for the cases when the directory have hidden folder like .svn

4234362
client-side	server-side
you either need to add an auto-post-back to your control and a server-side event handler to the control to make it call your c# function on the server or make a client-side javascript function to handle the client-side event

4234394
client-side	server-side
i haven t a server-side so i have to evaluate them in my gwt client-side application

4234402

mvvm	delegatecommand
i think i need only wrap my methods with delegatecommand variable and create for these variable properties and this properties bind on ui controls but i am absolute beginner in mvvm

4234446
imperative	declarative
however its performance comes from the fact that it can be early bound during compile time but that is its biggest drawback as well this approach cannot for instance handle dynamically loaded assemblies and it is much more error-prone since it is imperative and not declarative

4234513
int	chars
the substring method is supposed to return a new ministring formed of the chars between the position in the target ministring specified by the int parameter and the end of the target ministring

4234541
free	malloc
if you are using c instead of c++ there is no new or and you have to use the functions malloc and free instead

4234646
opera	firefox
in opera and firefox the th has a height of 38px instead of 39px it seems that webkit has a bug here which reports the incorrect height on the th while still applying the same rules as the other two browsers

4234651
hide	show
what i did is to have my javascript hide the nojsdiv and show maindiv

4234658
division	multiplication
this assignment is meant to familiarize you with the idea of hooking up events to html objects with using some of the common operators multiplication division assignment etc and to declare functions with parameters return values and to use them all together

4234663
addition	multiplication
as addition to case 3 compiler may care about number of significant bits in and optimize further operations to lower-width ones like replacing 16x16 multiplication with 16x8 one as lower byte is always zero

4234674
folder	directory
this will copy the file s into your project directory and they will also appear in the resources folder in xcode

i don t know if it works in ie6 but it does work in the latest firefox safari opera google-chrome ie7 and ie8

4234786
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
it will likely answer a number of questions including what salt is how to prevent rainbow attacks why md5 isn t an ideal solution for a password hash it s too fast and no longer requires a significant crypto breakthrough what can happen if data is compromised why plain-text is not stored etc

4234816
min	max
a rotation of -10.0 should output 350.0 and not 0.0 as min max would do

jar	war
you can ensure the order of deployment if you bundle your webservice war and ejb jar into one single ear file

4234853
phong	shading
if you calculate phong shading per pixel you will need to send the camera position to the fragment shader with each vertex because the fragment shader has no clue about the screen being divided and you have 9 different camera positions

4234855
int	double
shouldn t t here be some type like int double or bool

4234876
int	double
your function prototype gets templated on and it looks like you re performing this call on an object with type and passing a and an int when it probably expects a and a double to correspond to the initial templated type of the data object

4234878
int	double
the templated type t in this case is double as is shown in the error message and yet you are trying to pass and int as the first and second argument respectively

draggable	droppable	move	drag
initially make all droppable disabled then during the drag start routine make droppable and add a revert invalid option to the draggable so that it move back when not put in a valid cell if that is what you want

4238476
move	drag
incidentally you would probably be better having the routine you have in the drag event under start and reverting on stop as the drag event fires continuously as you move

4238476
google-chrome	firefox
the css isn t working properly in google-chrome the grid does not show up works fine in firefox

4238531
post	put
finally i would agree with the other post that you should stay away from editing the designer files and instead put your code elsewhere

4238549
clang	llvm
32 bit and 64 bit windows both use clang llvm as do ios and android

4238549
clang	llvm
32 bit and 64 bit code now uses clang llvm for windows

4238549
clang	llvm
android and ios compiles use clang llvm

4238625
google-chrome	firefox
this issue happened in ie firefox google-chrome

4238631
int	chars
you are trying to read int into space allocated for chars - your malloc operations are in terms of and sizeof chars when you need to be using int

cdr	cons
if the current pair will have a cdr higher than the upper limit then return null empty list in order to close the cons issued by the previous invocation of sublist

4238764
floating-point	integer
what you probably mean is that the result it is getting is not what you expect and the most likely reason for this is that all your variables are int so it is doing integer arithmetic but you probably want to get floating-point results from your divisions

4238764
int	double
i suggest changing your local variables to float or double so the int will be automatically converted before doing the arithmetic

4238765
nunit	mstest
i really recommend looking into nunit it is very powerful and i tend to prefer it compared to mstest

4238780

4238988
uniq	grep
use recursive grep through sort and uniq to create a list of those mentioned in any source file make a copy of project without unused files or dispatch grep on a list of used ones of course commented out code will be an issue

4239061
children	parent
the best solution i found for something like this if they are all equal children of the parent view is to patch their views onto a uiscrollview with paging enabled you can add a page control at the bottom to make it clear and for navigation then add the views of the controllers to the page view as they come onscreen remove as they go offscreen

4239077
versioning	upgrade
clarification we want to develop and test pages on the staging system and when ready then move them over to the production as part of the versioning upgrade process

4239082
width	margin
you ll also be unable to center absolutely positioned elements using margin 0 auto but if you want it spanning the full width of the viewport that shouldn t be a concern...if you want to center the live sections of the menu of course you ll need some sort of descendant to center

4239095
int	chars
don t forget that pointer arithmetic is dependent on the size of the type of the pointer for chars pointers it is 1 for int its 4 depending on the platform and compiler used.

4239111
folder	directory
i have source folder test in what there is package resources.data that among others contains files that i want to reference in webpage it is acceptable that all files in that directory are visible

4239368
war	manifest.mf
i would like to read manifest.mf of my war application

4239418
put	get
regarding introducing names rather than using lambdas i think what i typically do is if i am tempted to put a short comment describing the intent of the code but a good identifier name may do the same then i may factor a one-time lambda into a named function in order to get the readability benefit of the identifier name

4239448
mouse	keyboard
i need to define an object oriented class hierarchy structure for the following entities computer processor celeron processor athlon processor hp dell mouse keyboard

4239469
ibatis	mybatis
mybatis is a successor of ibatis that s what they meant saying

4239479
mouse	keyboard
you re implementing mouse and keyboard and celeron and athlon as methods

4239479
implements	extends
and i don t see why would you want hp to extends processor and to implements computer

4239483
portrait	landscape
the standard interfaceorientation is portrait and if landscape mode is detected it will quickly rotate to that orientation

4239483

4239632
typedef	struct
this struct is supposed to typedef type depending on the value of size

4239673
getter	setter
all instance fields in ruby are private - and there s a short hand syntax for declaring getter and setter comparators etc

4239695
rss	feed
the file rss.xml is the rss feed for engadget.com

4239725
integer	unsigned
unless the string is the string representation of a 32 bit unsigned integer as tim points out but i think it s fair to say that a lot of javascript developers would say stick to using integers for clarity

4239736
haskell	ocaml
however both ocaml and haskell must rely upon fragile low-level bindings to opengl because they are standalone languages and nobody has ever managed to get any significant commercial software using them to work

4239738
int	chars
if you want to get an int representation of the code point you need to use ord u u4132 if you now want to convert that back to the unicode chars use unicode which will return a unicode string

4239748
int	chars
explanation your switch value is an int not a chars hence you need int constants for your case labels not chars constants

4239900
ready	each
2 split each element to an array also get ready to be grouped

4239930
gif	png
i have a bitmapdata object that i d like to encode as either gif jpg or png as a string in memory

getter	setter
a really cumbersome way involves creating magic getter setter methods but would it really be worth the effort note that the other methods have to be implemented too

4240026
django	web.py
up to now i ve mostly used the templating systems of django web.py and php

4240054
firefox	safari
programs that do their own thing are generally annoying because of it for example itunes safari quicktime for windows which try to con you into believing that you are running on a mac or firefox 4 with its bizarro menus

4240064
inherited	properties
the critical point is that i want all the derived instances to inherited properties from a single shared prototyperecipe but be able to make local modifications

4240168
gdi	direct2d
alternatives are direct2d gdi + or any platform abstraction library like glib which also provide simple drawing facilities

4240181
int	chars
q when casting an int to a chars in java it seems that the default result is the ascii chars corresponding to that int value

4240181
int	chars
background info i m working on a project in which i read in a string of binary chars convert it into chunks and convert the chunks into their values in decimal int which i then cast as chars

4240199
int	chars
the conversion between chars and int uses the unicode values of which ascii is a subset

4240199
int	chars
if you are handling binary data you should avoid chars and strings and instead use an int array - note that java doesn t have unsigned 8-bit int

4240202
int	chars
in java a chars is just a 16-bit int

4240202
int	chars
when casting int which are 32-bit int to chars the only thing you are doing is keeping the 16 least significant bits of the int and discarding the upper 16 bits

4240339
post	get	post	put	put	get
when you have this you can define an endpoint in your wcf service with a webhttpbinding and that basically should allow you to define get post put and delete operations

4240346
migrate	upgrade
essentially i want to migrate sqlite schemata and data accordingly as i upgrade iphone applications

i ve created a second submission form only admin can submit posts from wordpress site that uses the graph api to post directly to the fan page then run the importer so that when the post is first entered into the database it already has it s fb_post_id attached

4240402
post	get
new post bypass wordpress then get synced from facebook

4240427
pull	push
simple really whenever i try to push or pull via tortoisegit it asks me for the log in details once i enter them i get fatal the remote end hung up unexpectedly

4240472
onclick	onsubmit
in order for that to work you have to change the handler from onclick of the submit button to onsubmit of the form

4240484
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
in this example testsubview accesses the methods through either a touchesbegan or touchesmoved

4240488

having the calls above code triggered via setinterval settimeout doesn t seem to make any difference nor does any code that would normally be called by a timer get executed whilst the long call is taking place

4240520
memcpy	strncpy
copy the first part of the aa string into the buffer strncpy memcpy

4240520

i can t use onstart and onstop either because visibility is lost when i switching to another full screens activity

4240568
mouseleave	mouseenter
i building navigation menu where each button will have two images - one transited into another one using jquery mouseenter and mouseleave events

4240590
keydown	keyup
conceptually listen for keyboard events keydown keyup in the capture phrase and if the user presses either of those buttons stoppropogation

4240626
width	height
use display block for your spans so they take a height and width

4240663
equals	gethashcode
when you override gethashcode you also need to override equals and

4240687
width	height
after thinking about it for a bit it feels dirty to combine the check for a file being an image with the pulling out the width and height

4240733
entities	entitymanager
i am using hibernate to map objects to entities and i have started to use an entitymanager

4240733
pull	push
previously i would have used a hibernatesessionfactory to get a session and then use that session to pull push data

4240734
ostringstream	std
you would probably want to use std ostringstream to create a string like that one

4240751
datamodel	relational-model
the hierarchical datamodel lost traction as codd s relational-model became the de facto standard used by virtually all mainstream database management systems

4240763
hide	show
and based on whatever is returned by my php function show hide 2 divs

4240765
range	infinity
by marking the function inline we do better than dynamically typed infinity we get structurally typed infinite range works with int32 int64 bigint .

4240816
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i use uiviewcontroller for the uinavigationcontroller content

4240851
stdout	stderr
then stderr is redirected to the pipe stdout becomes the original stdout unpiped and the extra fd is closed

4240873
integer	unsigned	subtraction	addition
assuming two s complement signed integer arithmetic which is a reasonable assumption these days for addition and subtraction just cast to unsigned to do the calculation

4240873
division	multiplication
for multiplication and division ensure the operands are positive cast to unsigned calculate and adjust the signs

4240901
hash	salt
the point of salt is simply to make rainbow table attacks harder as you no longer have a 1-to-1 mapping between passwords and hash

4240915
firefox	safari
i m using adobe media encoder cs5 to encode a flv file to h.264 to present on the web via html5 and the video file plays just fine in safari in os x and in firefox encoded to ogg but on any ios device ipad iphone i get the play icon with the slash running through it

4240924
width	height
average value of all the pixels sum up all the brightnesses of all the pixels then divide by total amount of pixels width height

4240924
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
the easiest one to use from a shell script is probably imagemagick graphicsmagick - you can get both simple averages and do some more complex histogramming to check out percentiles if you want to

4240940
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
similarly but easier in firefox 4+ also in google-chrome 5+ and safari 5+ you can use the formdata interface that helps to construct such requests

4240956
udp	tcp
i know that opening a new connection so often like that is inefficient but i wanted to keep with tcp connections until i had it working and then go to udp

4240977
innodb	myisam
i inserted data from 5 myisam tables and now my innodb tables are myisam

4240981

in fact vbscript is the closest match to vba

4241009
opera	safari
for some reason this page won t work in opera + safari

4241014
width	height
so we set the width height first then the x y keeping width and height because we don t want to set it back to 0 0

4241030
google-chrome	safari
safari i cannot test but google-chrome 8 seems to work but then again we don t even know what s not working

4241035
width	height
the specified width and height apply

4241035

4241062
django	web2py
you should also checkout web2py instead of django

4241087
min	max
to complicate matters the canvas can be scaled using the layouttransform and i d like to include the view-area in the scrollbars so not only the min max bounds of the children are taken into account by the scrollbars but also the min max of the current view-area

4241121
mako	formencode
that means that you re learning many useful libraries that can be used in you other projects for example sqlalchemy webob formencode beaker mako and so on .

4241176
hash	salt
the passwords are salt and hash individually

4241176
hash	salt
i need to salt and hash them individually because of the way they are stored in the database

4241190
postgresql	mysql
there is pep 249 that defines an api that should be used by modules accessing db s and that afaik is used at least by the mysql and postgresql python modules here and here and that perhaps could be a starting point

4241207
avr	microcontroller
i want to program a microcontroller avr to control some leds through usb

4241207
avr	microcontroller
there are some avr microcontroller that support the usb protocol or i could implement the usb protocol in an another microcontroller myself but i wonder what to use to write your own drivers on the computer

4241219
django	turbogears	pylons	turbogears
turbogears as an attempt at a happy medium between django and pylons turbogears is based on pylons but comes ready made with certain component choices and the glue to hold it together

4241219
pylons	turbogears
paste is the http server base upon which pylons and in turn turbogears is based

4241225
superclass	subclassing
it then gets the mro of the class that s passed to it and traverses it in reverse order so that subclassing keys can overwrite superclass keys

4241228
mp4	h.264
i m using red5 newest 0.9.1 final for mac os x to stream the h.264 aac encoded mp4 file to my flash app

4241242
cout	cin
in which case you just need to use std cout in process1 and std cin in process2 to do the reading and possibly also write using std cout again if you want the output of process1 to be visible in the terminal

4241248
hide	show
and i m trying to show it and hide everything else in the page s constructor and hide it and show everything else in page.loaded handler

4241268
puts	gets
there is something definitely odd in the way viewwillappear gets cancelled when you puts views within views

4241293
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
works in ie 7 8 google-chrome firefox safari and probably in ie 6 and opera although haven t tested on them

4241297
cfstring	nsstring
using some clever magic apple can do this because they write both the cf and objc runtimes instances of types like nsstring nsarray and nsdictionary are by default really instances of cfstring cfarray and cfdictionary

4241311
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome ie8 firefox this works correctly

4241385
daemon	cron
a daemon like cron will write its process id to a file like var cron.pid and you can signal it with something like

4241396
padding	overlapping
note that i added padding to the backview just to make sure the two were actually overlapping

4241440
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
removes everything doctype also on firefox 3.6 google-chrome 3.195 and safari 4.0

4241474
scheme	racket
racket scheme

4241478
int	chars
also you ll know what the max length for the score chars array should be based on whatever you re using to store score int

4241513
subscript	superscript
from those for lines with no superscript or subscript just use ctlinedraw and forget about it

4241513
subscript	superscript
for those with superscript or subscript use ctlinegetglyphruns to get an array of ctrun objects describing the various glyphs on the line

4241513
subscript	superscript
if none that you want to superscript or subscript are included just use ctrundraw to draw the thing

4241513
subscript	superscript
use cgcontextshowglyphsatpoint as appropriate having tweaked the text matrix for those you want in superscript or subscript

4241513
subscript	superscript
i haven t yet found a way to query whether a font has the relevant hints for automatic superscript subscript generation which makes things a bit tricky

4241513
subscript	superscript
if you re desperate and don t have a solution to that it s probably easier just not to use coretext s stuff at all â in which case you should probably define your own attribute that s why ns cf attributedstring allow arbitrary attributes to be applied identified by string name and use the normal nsstring searching methods to identify regions that need to be printed in superscript or subscript from blind

4241548
post	get
i ll come back and post a follow-up if when i get that working

4241591
vbscript	jscript
is that something possible in vbscript or jscript

4241703
g++	gcc
currently cygwin version 3.4.4-999 is not supported since gcc and g++ commands cannot be launched from the windows native shell

4241743
mef	prism
on an application that i am currently working on we re using wpf with mvvm prism with mef and wcf data services

4241743
mef	prism
if you stick with prism 4 with mef modular design patterns and entity framework 4 you should be able to come up with a good solution that is modular without being tightly coupled

4241750
width	height
but then i realized that the problem is that because my svg scales due to changes in width of the page i can t set a good height percentage because height may or may not be affected when the window s width changes due to the svg s aspect ratio

4241764
g++	gcc
just using gcc with -lstdc++ won t help because the gcc and g++ frontends can use different linker commands

4241764
g++	gcc
on mine gcc adds --as-needed when calling the linker while g++ doesn t.

4241854
xlib	motif	fltk	motif
there is also qt which is used in kde wxwidgets tk fltk motif clones xt and you can even build applications on xlib itself without a toolkit

4241904
put	get
a better question is how much work am i willing to put into making it difficult for my client to get my code

4241921
automake	autotools
the current benefits of autotools â specifically when used with automake â is that they integrate very well with building linux distribution

4241957
haskell	scheme
some examples of scripting languages which are not loosely typed are python ruby mondrian javafxscript powershell haskell scala elisp scheme autolisp io ioke seph groovy fantom boo cobra guile slate smalltalk perl hellip

4241963
uiview	subviews
that view initializes another uiview as a subviews

4241963
uiview	subviews
edit peter mentioned assigning the delegate at the views creation which i like but how would i do that for the subviews since it is created in the uiview and not the view controller

4241975
retaincount	dealloc
removed my original text try adding an nslog of personlistarray retaincount to your dealloc to figure out which is the case.

4242007
std	ostream	ostream	istream
barring some outstanding reason to do otherwise you d typically use std ostream write and std istream read

4242018
ostream	istream
cast the array of int to and use istream read ostream write

4242020
postgresql	mysql
if you are doing this with open source i would seriously look at postgresql as mysql s future looks uncertain now its owned by the world largest comercial database vendor

4242023
int	double
i therefore need compare to return a double not an int

4242030
inherited	subclassing
if you don t want to inherited all the fields you re not designing a subclassing

4242053
iboutlet	ibaction
given that the view is built in interface builder with quite a few iboutlet and ibaction what is the best way to do this

4242087
superclass	subclassing
all you can do about that is to make that variable private to the superclass so subclassing do not see it

4242124
int	double
it would especially go up in flames if you started to use double s instead of int s on contemporary implementations. it may however point to one

4242144
firefox	safari
when i try to change the src attribute of embedded movie quicktime it strangely works locally in firefox but doesn t work on server in firefox doesn t work in safari either locally or on server and it doesn t work in ie

4242149
converter	multibinding
so i use a multibinding which passes the value converter the userid and a dictionary look up table which is exposed by the underlying viewmodel

4242163
hide	show
if you are just trying to toggle visibility you could probably just add the normal class for the div styling and toggle it using the jquery hide show methods

4242167
mouseleave	mouseenter
the .hover method binds handlers for both mouseenter and mouseleave events

4242172
getter	setter
you cannot remove these fields but you can override the getter and setter to do something other than the default this depends on their access modifiers but they will probably be protected or greater

4242175
folder	directory
the advanced and production installation instructions in the book describe how to topologically isolate the webroot directory so you can make folder containing php files readable only by you

4242185
pop-up	dialog
so it just pop-up on the phone screen in a dialog

4242192
put	get
get all the products features in category with one sql query and then iterate with php each feature and put it in product

4242216
int	chars
fundamental types are chars int bool and so on

4242224
filesystems	ntfs
at least on fatxx and ntfs filesystems case-insensivity is imposed

4242240
mouseup	mousedown
so i want to record the yposition of the mousedown and the mouseup and move a div accordingly

4242240
mouseup	mousedown
i tried recording the mouse positions using two variables one to be recorded on the mousedown event and one to be recorded on a mouseup event.

4242240
mouseup	mousedown
but right now the problem is that the variable value is not carried through so on the mouseup the value of the mousedown is back to 0

4242247
haskell	scheme
it is definitely nice to know a little bit about haskell or scheme because they are more radical in some ways

4242247
haskell	scheme
of course you can write some code in haskell or scheme but as a .net programmer you ll probably find writing f# code more fun.

4242252

4242385
uipagecontrol	subviews
in the case of uipagecontrol it relies on subviews that have been added to uipagecontrol

4242385
uipagecontrol	subviews
but because you know it has to be either drawrect or subview-based you can get away with simply removing the subviews of the uipagecontrol and then your drawrect override will work as you d expect mostly you have to do a little bit of extra work to make sure you redraw at the right times

in the c++ version it allocated some memory with calloc then used memset to initialize the memory again in what seemed to me a fairly transparent attempt at producing results that favored java

implement the array accessor methods plus addtracksobject and removetracksobject which are technically set accessor methods so kvo will ignore them for an array properties for your convenience

4242958
accessor	properties
as i mentioned kvo will ignore addfooobject and removefooobject when foo is an nsarray properties considering those only nsset-property accessor so you need to implement them on top of insertobject infooatindex and removeobjectfromfooatindex because those are array accessor which means kvo will react to them

4244284
int	double	int	chars
as i have so far learnt a pointer is a place in memory heap where a memory address is stored i really understand that and can deal with it so easily but the question is if it only stores an address then it s size is symmetric with the size of the memory of the computer and so all pointers have the same size then why pointers have types if a pointer x is defined int for example it has the same size as the poiter y which is defined chars why is there a compiler or runtime error when i assign an address of double - or any type diffrenet from int - to x and the same for y

4244294

margin	height
for example if you want the height to be 49px then the margin must be 90px -9 pixels because you added in the height

pyopengl	pyglet
you can do this using pyglet s opengl bindings or using pyopengl s

4246325
pyopengl	pyglet
transitioning your code from pyglet to pyopengl is fairly easy so this is not a decision you need to worry about too much upfront

4246325
pyopengl	pyglet
pyglet s opengl bindings are automatically generated and are not as friendly to use as pyopengl

4246325
pyopengl	pyglet
then when optimising replace just the small percentage of performance-critical pyopengl calls that lie within your inner render loop with the pyglet equivalents

4246384
put	get
if you put everything in one table and then use something like a datatable to hold the results from select from mytable then the entire thing would get replicated into ram removing any benefit

4246414

when it comes time to do complex layouts please use miglayout instead of trying to learn the gridbaglayout - you will thank me

it sounds perfectly reasonable to me to have a persistent cached attribute alongside a live-computed transient value that s only used when it needs to be updated

4246863
innodb	myisam

4246863
innodb	myisam
all of my tables are myisam so why should i switch to innodb

4246897
innodb	myisam
pros cons of innodb myisam -

4246897
innodb	myisam
unlike innodb myisam has built-in full-text search

4246897
innodb	myisam
myisam is still widely used in web applications as it has traditionally been perceived as faster than innodb in situations where most db access is reads

4246897
innodb	myisam
while writing updating data into a innodb table only that particular row is locked whereas in myisam the entire table is locked

4246900
innodb	myisam
there are some features that are only available using myisam like full text search but unless you need these i would go with innodb

4246902

4248974

4249103
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

4249137
equals	gethashcode
you can call gethashcode to determine if the items are not equals but if two objects return the same hash code that doesn t mean they are equals

equals	gethashcode
the only time you would call gethashcode inside of equals was if it was much cheaper to compute a hash value for an object say because you cache it than to check for equality

4249248
equals	gethashcode
in fact in my application i decided that having identical hashes was close enough to being equals that i didn t even bother to implement the equals overload causing the c# compiler to warn me that i was overloading gethashcode without overloading equals

mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
it looks like the best way to do this would be to register a mousedown event on the parent div that in turn registers a mousemove event on the div until a mouseup event is triggered

4249648
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
the mousedown and mouseup events will define the start and end of the time range and as i follow mousemove events i can dynamically change the size of the range so that the user can see what they are doing

4255257
post	get
apart from nathan s observation on the use of xhr to post the credentials it is quite possible that the use of the http get instead of the http post request is responsible for chrome s behavior in not offering to save the credentials

4255257

it should be noted that using http get instead of post to submit credentials is often considered a bad practice in itself notwithstanding the annoyance encountered in chrome

queue	fifo
2 we process the request from the server based on the fifo queue and create the setup file

your requirements on int accuracy from using a double representation means that c 60 30 is all but too big being around 1e17 so that assuming you want to have c m n for all m up to some limit and all n m your table would only have around 1800 entries

4257318
maven	m2e
for completeness being an advocate of dependency management with maven i would of course suggest to manage project dependencies with maven and m2e instead of with user libraries

4258615
mouseout	mouseleave
what is the difference between jquery s mouseout and mouseleave

4258639
packets	multicast
one trick you can do especially with udp multicast or broadcast is have several programs listen on the same port via so_reuseport so that when anyone sends out a udp packets to that port all of the programs receive it

4258641
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseleave event differs from mouseout in the way it handles event bubbling

4258658
lxml	beautifulsoup
i have searched high and low for a decent explanation of how beautifulsoup or lxml work

4258658
rss	feed
anyways as my first project i am using python to parse an rss feed for post links - i have accomplished this with feedparser

4258775
ant	maven
given your commitment to the ant build process and there s nothing wrong with that except for the goodies you re missing out on i d suggest that you mirror the maven approach but do it within ant

4258775
maven	pom.xml
essentially you perform a full build including functional tests if you ve got em to verify your artifact then maven tags your subversion repo and finally it runs over your project pom.xml files and re-versions them to the next level up as snapshots

4258775
maven	pom.xml
in terms of a build process hudson works merrily with maven and will build and test the artifacts your jars wars ears etc in the sequence you specify in the maven pom.xml

4258938
versioning	upgrade
i have a c# program that we constantly update and it gets reinstalled and it seems that since i ve upgrade the project from vs2005 to vs2010 and .net from 2.0 to 4.0 i m getting this strange error where its trying to reference the old versioning of the dll from the last install

4258951
width	height
there are a number of possible methods but here s one start by rendering the full string in a div that has width that you are looking for then measure the div s height

4258993
hex	binary
at this point i m guessing i would have to convert the mac or ip address to either hex or binary and to a comparison that way

4259000
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox google-chrome safari opera and does ie have an alternative

well i renamed the new mysql s data directory to data.backup and then i created a symlink from where the new mysql s data folder was to var mysql where the old data file is and so far so good.

4259092
mp3	flv
i am trying to figure the best way to login via php command to a remote server and run a command to convert a flv file into an mp3 and then possibly moving it to the local server

4259109

if you upgrade to the current versioning of jscrollpane then you will be able to style the arrows so that they disappear when they are disabled or otherwise unnecessary

4259124
put	get
however if i put the dictionary lock in front of the entire loop i get a deadlock because the call

4259158
google-chrome	firefox
internet explorer google-chrome and firefox all have good debuggers javascript consoles available to show this information

4259207
hide	show
i assume you have to show and hide the text field dynamically based on changing conditions in the form otherwise you d just make it an to begin with

4259207
hide	show
keep your code that show and hide the field as it is but also catch the onsubmit event

4259216
width	text-align
is it possible to center a multiline horizontally while its contents remain aligned to the left text-align left without specifying display table and without having to know the pixel width of the it should become as wide as needed

4259216
google-chrome	firefox
it has to work in firefox 3 and google-chrome

4259238
google-chrome	firefox
should work fine in firefox and google-chrome

4259290
disk	ram
blockquote ram disk is not an option for security reasons - we don t want that anyone with access to the machine would be able to view the data blockquote

4259295
width	height
does anyone know how i can set the height and width of these so they will adjust themselves to different screen sizes

4259296
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
however apple only supports this on quicktime x on osx and even then only in safari or standalone not in the quicktime plugin used by google-chrome or firefox

4259359
width	height
set the height and width using dp instead of px

4259384
accessor	superclass	superclass	subclassing
no because it isn t only subclassing behavior you need to take into account â superclass implementations and even the behavior of code generated by the framework synthesized accessor and the black magic used to implement kvo can also cause trouble

4259404
post	get
i found a lot of post and tried to implement the delegate methods regarding authentication but they won t get called and after 6 hours in google i don t get what i ve done wrong

4259434
width	height
note that the application has 100 for both width and height

4259450
qtcore	qtgui
also usually qtgui is within the qt include directory where you ve got others like qtcore and such

4259462
move	drag
that is click the widget to move release the mouse button drag the widget and click to drop

4259513
strdup	strncpy	strdup	malloc	strcpy	strdup	strcpy	strncpy	strcpy	malloc	strncpy	malloc
instead of strncpy use strdup which is like doing a malloc then a strcpy

4259518
google-chrome	firefox
i m using firefox with firebug or google-chrome

4259535
rss	feed
i want to send a notification out every time the rss feed is updated with a new post

4259547
put	get
but i can t get my head round where i put this in the iqueryable or iqueryprovider

4259549
strdup	malloc	strcpy	strdup	strcpy	malloc
what s happening is that this code allocates and copies in one go using strdup rather than malloc followed by strcpy

4259582
min	max
there are also 2 nested if statements to prevent it from ever going over the max number or pictures or under the min number of pictures

4259626
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you re mixing two different contexts in your calls to setcontentview and findviewbyid

4259639
webclient	httpwebrequest
i originally tried using the webclient class but i switched to the httpwebrequest to try some of the suggestions i found while researching the issue such as setting keepalive to false preauthenticate true

4259685
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
edit since you re using the ftpwebrequest response library you ll want to have your ftpwebrequest object dump its results into the ftpwebresponse object and then read the entire stream with code something like this

4259691
post	get
to get the cookies to work i had to modify some code post snippet from httpconnection.java

kerberos	ldap	kerberos	ntlm
ldap kerberos ntlm sspi etc

4259803
google-chrome	safari
i was using google-chrome and it won t work outside safari apparently

4259835
google-chrome	firefox
with firefox 3.6 and google-chrome latest the layout behaves as supposed

4259849
google-chrome	firefox
i tested in firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 8 both on linux

4259857
google-chrome	firefox
hi i m trying to create a toolbar using ul and li elements everything works good on ie8 but when i render the page in google-chrome o firefox the elementos does not show in horizontal way

4259875
keydown	keyup
note that the keyup callback function fires after the input has been inserted into the input field while the keydown and keypress fires before the change is made

4259919
width	height
set the maximum width height of an image that can reside in the pixel cache memory

4259929
int	double
if i can pass an int into fnc taking double as an arg why cannot i do it with template

4259929
int	double
is there any way to bypass this i need this to make one template instead of two with different names which will allow me to either take double or int

4259940
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i believe the problem here is that you re adding the uitabbarcontroller as a subview of another uiviewcontroller

4259940
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uitabbarcontroller descends directly from uiviewcontroller

4259945
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox and ie8 on google-chrome and safari the labels are working as they

4259945
google-chrome	safari
as i said before it works great on google-chrome and safari but

4259964
google-chrome	firefox
here s an updated link which i tested in ie7 google-chrome 7 and firefox 3.6.1.2

4259964
google-chrome	firefox
another caveat with this approach google-chrome firefox will return rgb 255 0 0

4259967
int	double
what you re getting is whatever data happened to be on the stack in the place the compiler decided that variable should go interpreted as an int or a double

4259997
google-chrome	firefox
original actually works as expected on firefox and google-chrome for me

4260063
getter	setter
or using the magic spring approach - have the param1 property defined with getter setter

4260068
ant	maven
doing the build in a jvm language like ant or maven avoids all this

4260087
django-registration	django-mailer
this fork of django-registration integrates with django-mailer which uses background processes to send mail instead processing it during the http request

4260113
jsf	jspx
jspx and jsff refer to jsp fragment and jsf fragment respectively

4260154
jobs	cron
this often causes cron jobs to fail the first few times you run them see my law on cron jobs -

4260154
jobs	cron
simple debugging writing messages to some file in tmp is also often a way to get your cron jobs running

4260154
jobs	cron
in many cases it makes sense to run cron jobs as a special user

4260154
jobs	cron
don t run your cron jobs as root unless they absolutely must have root access it s better to run things as special users that only has limited permissions in the file system

4260194
screens	hdpi
what is the proper way of sizing the dimensions of an image in a hdpi screens vs a ldpi screens

4260263
g++	gcc
g++ gcc 4.4.3 20100127 red hat 4.4.3-4

4260267
jobs	cron
let s say i have 10 scripts that i want to run regularly as cron jobs

4260270
internationalization	localization
you might want to investigate using cakephp s internationalization localization features to abstract away the distinction between english and russian terms for top left right bottom and everything else

4260292
background-image	background-position
if not you can try to set the image as background-image and make use of the css-attribute background-position left center

4260303
min	max
the idea is to do a depth-first traversal and pass min and max values bottom-up instead of top-down

4260303
min	max
the tricky part of the implementation is taking care of how min and max values are passed bottom-up

4260303
min	max
please note that i did not initialize min and max values as they are initialized in the bottom of the tree

4260319
submit	submission
i m able to use this jquery code to prevent double submission of the submit button

4260377
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
you need to set up a custom stack of uinavigationitem objects and push them on to the uinavigationbar

4260389
tapestry	wicket
i would make the same argument of wicket tapestry over jsp why in the world would someone use jsp script-like style when you can declare components to use

4260395
google-chrome	firefox
the problem was seen in firefox 3.6.12 but the same code running on google-chrome was fine

4260427
screens	hdpi
for example if the current screens s density is high the platform loads resources that are tagged with the qualifier hdpi and uses them without scaling

4260432
nhibernate	automapper
i m using fluent nhibernate s automapper and automatically generating the database schema using schemaexport

4260458
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
jquery ajax .load not working in ie6 ie7 ie8 - working in firefox safari google-chrome

4260473
portrait	landscape
i have an app i would have two xibs one for portrait and one for landscape

4260483
boost	stl
if you want to store heap allocated objects in stl containers and have them be destructed upon removal wrap them in a smart pointer like boost shared_ptr

4260489
width	height
other downsides you d have to be careful to declare image height and width a good practice anyway but it may get cumbersome when you just want to get things done

4260531
jpanel	jdesktoppane
a jdesktoppane should sit inside a jframe s contentpane instead of a jpanel

4260543
range	max
the second key fails for too many elements in the in range apparently the max is 24

4260554
portrait	landscape
chapter 5 provides great information on supporting landscape and portrait mode

4260568
width	height
if the container for the listbox is a grid with fixed width and height then it will give the listbox a fixed size

4260583
goto	break
some see break and continue as a goto in disguise

4260586
submit	submission
when you submit the form the servlet would handle the form submission and call code in your business project jar

4260612
google-chrome	firefox
this issue is for both firefox 3.6.12 and google-chrome

4260613
rss	feed
my idea was to download the data somehow maybe rss feed and then format it to .ical and then use some sort of api on googles side to import it

4260635
post	get
like the down voted answer below you might not actually be sending post variables because you re passing the params in with a get format

4260704
width	height
you will also have to use match_parent for both width and height of your layout

4260726
junit	testng
i m familiar with junit and heard testng might be a solution to some of junit s annoyences - its insistence to create a separate instance of the test class per test thus forcing me to use static field for objects i want to reuse between tests

4260726
junit	testng
what i m asking here is what drawbacks does testng have compared to junit

4260740
mouse	keyboard
does anyone know where i can find a list of all default keyboard and perhaps mouse shortcuts supported by wpf listview

4260762
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
it has two sub-viewcontrollers one for the left panel and one for the detail right panel to which i need to send the appropriate messages viewwillappear viewdidappear viewwilldisapppear and viewdiddisappear

4260762
viewdidload	viewwillappear
my initial approach was to call them in the setter of the sub-viewcontrollers calling viewwilldisappear to uiviewcontroller about to be released and viewwillappear to the new uiviewcontroller set but this one is executed before viewdidload and therefore i presume is wrong

4260786
google-chrome	firefox
and screenpic of firefox ie google-chrome appearance

4260788
hide	show
instead you would put both of the visuals in the same template and show hide them based on the state

4260812
put	get
i m not sure where to put it or how to get it there

4260831
scheme	racket
if you install a scheme implementation i am using mit scheme edited to add that this also works with racket using mzscheme it may come with a symlink named scheme - this is what emacs looks for i think

4260843
portrait	landscape
i ran into a similar problem when i wanted to show an image fullscreen in landscape mode and it s default position in portrait mode

4260857
folder	directory
i think the good way would be to make the folder 2 either a level up or an external because if it s not used for the build it has nothing to do in the code directory

4260908
google-chrome	safari
if you would use css3 animations you are losing a lot of audience since only google-chrome and safari currently support css3 animations

4260913
junit	testng
some tools support junit but not testng

4260930
innodb	myisam
it could be related to having innodb and myisam tables together

4260930
innodb	myisam
if you copy the database files the myisam will be fine and the innodb will show up but fail to work

4260947
punctuation	words
the simplest answer is to remove characters that don t matter the apostrophes and punctuation in your example normalize other characters to words separators the slash in your example and downcase the lot

4260950
superclass	subclassing
however you cannot cast an instance of a superclass to a subclassing

4260952
folder	directory
i have several folder which contain simple text files and are at various depths within the directory

4260953
jobs	cron
they re like cron jobs except mysql handles the scheduling itself

4261003
typedef	struct
use typedef on your struct to shorten simplify your declarations

4261007
inherited	properties
this is definitely doable just make sure that the object owns the properties and it s not inherited from higher up in the prototype chain

4261013
onresume	onpause
i d like to add for the sake of completeness is that you should set things up so you register for changes in your preferenceactivity s onresume method and unregister in the onpause method

4261035
inherited	properties
now you have access to that properties in any controller that inherited from your base controller

4261055
junit	testng
you know like slf4j is to log4j so x is to testng and junit

4261069
inherited	properties
however the main change is that i was trying to have my repository inherited from nhibernatecontext as well as access the linq properties off a isession object

4261096
inherited	properties
this statement will go up in the prototype chain also enumerating over inherited properties a thing that sometimes is not desired

4261096
inherited	properties
also speaking about inherited properties if you for example extend the array.prototype object like some libraries as mootools do that properties will be also enumerated

4261096
inherited	properties
when you want to enumerate only the own properties of an object the ones that aren t inherited you can use the hasownproperty method

4261162
hide	show
if i hide the modaldialogform snapshotdialogview in the code before calling the fontdialog.showdialog the font dialog show ok

4261277
ubuntu	linux
i rather doubt there s something similar available for ubuntu linux

4261282
ant	maven
if you have a decent build tool ant maven that can automate this renaming for you both at the jar and tag level the better

4261293
junit	testng
the spring testcontext framework located in the org.springframework.test.context package provides generic annotation-driven unit and integration testing support that is agnostic of the testing framework in use whether junit 3.8.2 junit 4.5+ testng 5.10 and so on

4261302
getter	setter
it think tween requires public variables or getter setter in order to change them

4261352
floating-point	fixed-point	floating-point	fractions	fixed-point	fractions
maybe this sounds complicated but if the probabilities are stored as fixed-point fractions you won t have to deal with floating-point so it may be not much code

4261431
listview	gridview
if you use a listview with listview.view set to a gridview then you get a pretty similar look as windows 7 explorer

4261431
listview	gridview
listview with gridview to the right

4261431
listview	gridview
listview with gridview to the right

4261465
integer	fractions
see i want to write a function that takes a float number parameter and rounds the float to the nearest currency value a float with two decimal places but if the float parameter has a zero fractions that is all zeroes behind the decimal place then it returns the float as an integer or truncates the decimal part since they re all zeroes anyways.

4261470
viewdidload	viewwillappear
as for your current problem of the ordering of viewwilldisappear viewwillappear and viewdidload just do

4261503
ienumerable	iqueryable
this causes the subsequent filtering operations to use the where extension method on ienumerable not iqueryable

4261507
width	height
width height alt filename.jpg

4261513
ienumerable	iqueryable
use iqueryable instead of ienumerable

4261527
width	height
but as far as i can see the only result of modifying the width or height of either picker in a negative direction results in a cropped view rather than a scaled stretched view of the widget

4261528
hide	show
i don t really want to create multiple panels and show hide and populate form fields based on the state...i would rather set a single property on the page...lets just call it

4261532
google-chrome	firefox
i am having a coding issue with google-chrome and firefox

4261532
google-chrome	firefox
the page i m building has a menu that is placed with an anchor and it shows fine in ie but not google-chrome or firefox

4261542
int	double
if you are inputing strings in the textbox and parsing it as int or a double you ll get such error

4261553
mouse	keyboard
but i want something that does not include the separator at the end because i will end with notebook computer keyboard mouse that 2 last characters should not be there

4261596
min	max
run through some tests have a totally random player as a foil look at short-term gain loss max min operators try mutating the agent s strategies using a genetic algorithm download an xcs classifier and see if it is useful to derive strategies.

4261641
int	double
i am not sure if you can pass float double as a template param its supposed to be a int only

4261695
opera	firefox
my navigation bar is off in firefox and opera

4261695
google-chrome	safari
it looks fine in safari and google-chrome

4261754
hide	show
how do you hide the empty table or show a none found message if that foo is null

4261770
yacc	bison
you should look into using lex and yacc also known as flex and bison respectively

4261784
google-chrome	firefox
in ie firefox it works fine but in google-chrome the popup appears over on top of the parent window

4261818
google-chrome	safari
ie only dose it on first page view google-chrome and safari doesn t do it at all

4261819
folder	directory
if i run the tests from any other folder it fails because it is searching the include_path directory and home myname php is not one of those paths

4261827
pop-up	dialog
it successfuly makes the browser to pop-up a download dialog also giving the option to open it with the associated application if it s installed

4261829
int	double
or you can find some common interface or supertype that these element must have in for example - and you can store various objects that have common number superclass bigdecimal biginteger byte double float int long short

4261829
super	extends
extends is generally used when you re going to consume read from the object in your method super is used when you re going to produce write

4261838
width	height
the images are a collection of screenshots some are full screen some about 2 3rds width and height and others are small search boxes

4261866
versioning	upgrade
as for the delta pack i manually downloaded it from website and added the directory in the target definition file which in my opinion is tedious when i want to upgrade the delta pack versioning next time

4261905
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
additionally you can set the user agent used by uiwebview by swizzling - nsmutableurlrequest setvalue forhttpheaderfield or probably overriding - nsurlrequest valueforhttpheaderfield

4261943
quicksort	mergesort
if you need to write your own implementation for homework say then you should use one of the standard sorting algorithms like mergesort or quicksort

4261944
jsf	jspx
jspx is used for regular jsf pages

4261959
querypath	phpquery
or better yet use querypath or phpquery which are easier on the eyes

4261963
free	malloc
the closest thing i can think of is malloc hooks unfortunately free does not take the cell size as a parameter

4261985
qstring	qbytearray
fromascii fromutf8 fromlocal8bit qstring qbytearray the works

4262002
min	max
you could easily evaluate min max mean std deviation w o needing to store any significant amount of memory

4262007
japplet	jdialog
like jframe and jdialog japplet is a top-level container

4262045
hide	show
can anyone think of another way to implement that would allow me to dynamically show hide columns with razor

4262063
comparator	comparable
the comparator method of the comparable interface typically offers the default comparison if you want to provide another you should write a comparator object

4262064
equals	gethashcode
yes if you override equals and gethashcode methods your custom key comparison will start working

4262064
equals	gethashcode
overriding equals and gethashcode

4262094
comparator	comparable
instead of implementing comparable in song pass a custom comparator to your collection of choice

4262158
integer	unsigned
sometimes i have to convert from an unsigned integer value to a float

4262201
folder	directory
maybe the .obj file is in the wrong directory it s in the root project folder along with the .cpp files

4262215
hide	show
you could run the algorithm each time with all nodes past present future show and just hide the ones that are not extant at the particular instant

4262297
hide	show
hello i have site where i show hide divisions that are loaded by default at start

4262322
getter	setter
a getter on thing1.a which touches the prototype chain followed by a setter of .a

4262339
button	checkbox
today i tried to write a program which checks some checkbox for me on a webpage and then clicks on a button

4262341
nginx	lighttpd
i am replacing lighttpd with nginx on my development server

button	checkbox
one approach would be to write a bookmarklet where you create a bookmark that runs javascript code and the other would be to avoid the web browser altogether and instead just send a request directly to the web server that looks like it would if you had checked the checkbox and clicked the button

getter	setter
method never used inspection is good in plain java programming but is annoying for getter setter methods required by application containers jsf jpa etc

4262416
floating-point	integer
in your specific example you can see that c# unlike vb overloads the operator to mean either integer or floating-point division

4262416
floating-point	integer
this means that the compiler works out whether to do integer or floating-point arithmetic based on the type of the numbers used

peer	p2p
in structured p2p networks dht you have to take the filename and creates a key by passing it through an hash checksum function - now you got the key the next step is finding the peer that stores this key the network is organized the routing process is based on the key

4262537
free	malloc
to catch malloc free you have to do linux-specific things as in other answers but the same trick could solve your problem that you don t have the size in the free hook assuming that you don t want to hunt around for the size that was stored by the real malloc

4262544
hide	show
so i m designing a website using wordpress and i want to use jquery to hide show a certain element when another element is moused over

profiling	instrumentation
profiling cprof cover eprof fprof instrumentation + a couple of distributed systems for doing the same

4262794
innodb	myisam
to do this you need to use mysql not sqlite with the innodb engine not myisam and the field in question needs an index on it

4262803

gdal	ogr
gdal ogr s bindings do tend to segfault occasionally when objects go out of scope and are garbage collected

4262805
gdal	ogr
i can t reproduce this segfault with another shapefile on windows xp and the following version of gdal ogr

4262825
hide	show
has anyone figured out how to hide show the tableviewcontroller that is locked down on the left hand side - when in landscape orientation - stubbornly hogging precious screen real estate

4262825
hide	show
if you take a look at the ipad dropbox app it has a nifty show hide arrow that is exactly what i am after

4262847
hash-collision	key
by placing hash-collision into buckets and keeping separate arrays in the bucket for key and values you can both reduce the size of the table proper and take advantage of cpu cache speedup when searching a bucket

4262871
uiview	subviews
i m adding a subviews to the uiview of my mainviewcontroller that is presented in a similar way as a uimodalviewcontroller with the formsheet-style

4262934
submit	submission
additionally its generally considered better practice to have the event bind to the tag s id using submit rather than click since submit will catch non-clicked submission ie using the keyboard enter button etc

4262956
serializable	deserialization
you need to solve this problem in two parts serializable deserialization and the atomic writing

4262967
inherited	properties
i was facing scenario where i created a custom control that inherited from selector which is meant to have two itemssource properties horizontalitemssource and verticalitemssource

i have successfully got them all lazy loading nicely and appearing when downloaded in the custom uitableviewcell i created which has a uiimageview cellimageview width 320 height 100 inside it

4263022
cpu	processors
if the application is cpu intensive however you d benefit much more from getting a better processors

4263044
nginx	lighttpd
you can arrange iis and tomcat in 2 different ip addresses or you can setup reverse-proxy nginx lighttpd mod_proxy etc. to port 80 and then set iis to use port 8080 and for tomcat port 9090

4263070
post	get
when i try to insert to the file though i get the error at the end of this post

4263088
openlayers	proj4js
actually openlayers uses proj4js to transform between different coordinate systems

4263101
hid	keyboard
my first fear is that there is the hid protocol to be spoken to the keyboard and it will not divulge its secrets until i utter the proper incantation

4263109
trie	tree
write or use an open source implementation of something like b-tree trie suffix tree prefix tree

4263118
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but is there a solution that can run on all platforms firefox google-chrome and safari

4263124
google-chrome	firefox
ex firefox use multi-threading for their tabs while google-chrome use multi-processes .

4263128
cpu	processors
profiling indicates that almost all of this cpu time is spent calling the various initializecomponent methods of all the different usercontrols - no one control appears to be vastly worse than any other they all seem to take between 0.2 and 0.5 seconds on my dev machine with a fast processors and good graphics card

4263173
stdout	stderr
in stevens unix network programming he mentions redirecting stdin stdout and stderr which is needed when setting up a daemon

4263174
folder	directory
as long as that attic folder is there cvs has memory of the directory

4263174
folder	directory
the only other thing i can think of is to restore that directory from cvs just delete the contents which puts them back in the attic and commit what you actually want in the folder in the head

4263179
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i solved this problem by adding a slight delay to the uialert the below is within my viewdidload method it also works fine within viewdidappear

4263199
stdout	stderr
and you should be careful about the terms used stdin stdout and stderr are actually file handles rather than file descriptors although there is a correlation between those and the file descriptors

4263212
width	height
seems like the core video s cvpixelbuffercreatewithbytes allows width and height to be 320 and 480

4263217
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox safari google-chrome ie cross-browser issues

4263217
google-chrome	safari
since safari is built on top of webkit just like google-chrome i expected it to work just as well

4263254
width	margin
i had a tab navigation with fixed widths on each tab and a right margin all totaling the width of the container div

4263294
google-chrome	firefox
it works well under ie 8 and firefox 3.6 but fails under google-chrome 7

4263357
google-chrome	firefox
here s the final code that appears to work as expected in ie 8 firefox 3 and google-chrome

4263418
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the following code works on windows ie7 ie8 google-chrome firefox 3.6 and on mac firefox safari

4263427
google-chrome	firefox
with no doctype specified the heights are perfect in google-chrome and surprisingly even ie6 but not in firefox

4263460
eazfuscator	dotfuscator
how close would this be to what a c# obfuscator like dotfuscator or eazfuscator would do to my app and what else could i manually do on a reasonable amount of time to make my code as obfuscated as possible

4263477
memcpy	memmove
either create your object s at that location or memcpy memmove them to that location

4263481
ienumerable	iqueryable
list supports adding an ienumerable collection and an iqueryable collection is also an ienumerable collection so you should be able to use addrange here

4263520
division	multiplication
so what would be some strategies for performing multiplication and division on numbers this large

4263523
executable	upx
everything worked fine i tried to compile them with vs 6.00 and vs 2010 both them gave me a big size exe 75 kb and 65 kb i am sure that the pre compiled executable are not used other tools to compress except upx for one of them according to the help inside the zip why these size are different for me

4263528
button	checkbox
checkbox are meant for multiple selections whereas radio button are meant for single selections

any ideas how i can get the root of a website from an nsstring or an nsurl

4263589
hide	show
i have an image processing application that is able to getpixel anyone know how can i hide or show the rgb channel of my image

4263589
hide	show
for example when i click a button call red it will hide red channel and show only blue and green

4263591
google-chrome	firefox
if you use a recent doctype such as html 4.01 or xhtml 1.0 or 1.1 then consistently in firefox google-chrome and ie 8 the button is actually 2 pixels shorter than the text box

4263591
google-chrome	firefox
you probably would want to use a standard compliant doctype because without them the box models between firefox google-chrome and ie can be quite different

4263659
multiplying	add
to multiplying two large integers in this form simply add the exponents element-by-element

4263660
children	parent
i d like to have a gtktreeview that has parent with no checkbox and all of the children have checkboxes

if i try to subclass the abstract-class its asking to implement the argument constructor and not allowing a no-arg constructor to be written

4263936
filesystems	fat
are you running on a fat filesystems

4263980
put	get
so i put my code in this forum and hope to get an answer for it

4263985
client-side	server-side
but if you know it happens at an exact time i would pass a variable from a server-side scripting language that contains the server time to javascript as you can t rely on the the client-side clock

4264017

4264082
uitableview	nsindexpath
uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

4264109
submit	submission
then on the submit event just cancel the form submission and run your ajax code

4264112
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
functions like max min sum and count are aggregate-functions meaning that they take a scalar argument but execute once for each row accumulating results every iteration

4264141
disk	ram
to this end how do i figure out if i should invest in more cpu more ram a better hard disk or whether the process is being bound by some other resource

4264154
int	double
c99 â 6.5.2.2 6 if the expression that denotes the called function has a type that does not include a prototype the int promotions are performed on each argument and arguments that have type float are promoted to double

4264237
subclass	abstract-class
one way to test abstract-class is to implement a concreate subclass of it only for testing

4264245
width	height
i had tired loading an image form a url below is my sample code when tried to load a large image which is greater than 8191 pixel in width or height the event.complete is not dispatched i am aware of the flash player 10 bitmapdata limit so cant we load an image greater than this 8191 pixel limit

4264268
cvs	svn
i used svn cvs for a long time just as a place where my code stored is

4264314
free	malloc
since you mentioned c++ i ll go with and operators but it s the same with malloc free

4264369
nullreferenceexception	argumentexception
if you throw an argumentexception within the catch of nullreferenceexception it will not be caught by the argumentexception block here at all

4264414
move	drag
then trigger their corresponding drag drop events when the bars are move around

4264429
128bit	64bit
on intel 64bit chips that will mean it is aligned to a 128bit double

4264429
int	chars
the way you did it was to offset the chars ptr so by 1 byte rather than the int ptr by 4 bytes

4264474
equals	gethashcode	equals	icomparable	icomparable	gethashcode
to compare 2 instances you can implement system icomparable of t interface but i think in your case since you going to map instances probably in hashtable or dictionaly containers you need overrride gethashcode and equals methods

4264496
mouse	keyboard
pressed means either by mouse button pointer still within button regions or by space button on keyboard

4264497
width	height
steinberg s algorithm denoted as m in the paper estimates an upper bound of the height h required to pack all the items such that it is proved that the input items can be packed into a rectangle of width w and height h

4264549
portrait	landscape
for example i ve got one landscape view that i push a portrait view on top of

4264549
portrait	landscape
but when i pop the view the view underneath it which was in landscape is now in portrait which it shouldn t be

4264551
bash	zsh
for zsh you d probably want to set null_glob option -g switch so it doesn t report errors if there are no hidden dirs in bash it works by default

4264572
post	put
you can read the http request body via fgets stdin if your requests will accept xml as a post put format

4264575
for-loop	arrays
what i would like to be able to do is pass 5 and 6 via an arrays let s say and have a for-loop that runs through the arrays

4264659
post	get
now don t quote me on this but i m pretty sure u cant because when you download the program threw a website its not registered with the market and that s where the update come from and again i m not to sure but i m pretty sure you ll have to contact android market and email them and see if u can get it on the market or post the program with the update every time you want it to update the program

4264676
post	get
and you will be able to get the result inside the success event of the ajax post as json_data.result

4264679
stdout	fflush
to fflush the buffer call fflush stdout

4264707
for-loop	arrays
you may put some additional checks in the for-loop to be sure that your index is in bounds of your arrays but it is not necessary if you form set correctly

4264808
udp	tcp
i m currently using the pcap library for c# and was wondering if there were any built in functions to remove the ip headers and the tcp udp ect headers

4264865
width	height
in order to overcome this problem set the width height to 0 in its css property

4264868
implements	extends
the trick is to implements a contentprovider which extends searchrecentsuggestionsprovider

4264900
sudo	passwd
note that sudo will ask for a passwd unless you configure it otherwise

4264913
firefox	safari
works as expected note i tried only on safari and firefox or remove overflow hidden from container if you defined for clearing purpose just change clearing method

4264937
try-catch	exception-handling
if it must-run do it before the try-catch block away from something that could throw an exception-handling as your intention is almost certainly functionally the same

4264969
stdout	stderr
unless the stream you re using is stderr or sometimes stdout it will be block buffered by default which means that no writes will happen until the buffer is full typically 4096 bytes or more

4264987
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
most browsers in current use support an iframe onload attribute including ie5.5+ firefox safari opera

4264990
textview	imageview
here the returnedbitmap should contain the image of imageview and textview but this bitmap contains only bacground bitmap of relativeview bgblack

4265014
int	double	int	chars
eg chars a double b chars c int d could be reordered to double b int d chars a chars c thus saving 10 bytes

4265047
width	height
as far as suggestions for change go 1st thing to change is the width height of the applet

4265058
hide	show
my only suggestion is - is it possible to initialise all potential controls from the outset and then show hide them when needed using the visibility property

4265061
post	get
jsonp is strictly a get request made by creating a tag you cannot post cross-domain and get the result back...it just doesn t work that way

4265069
bash	zsh
with bash 4 or zsh you can use globstar to match recursively

4265119
google-chrome	firefox
so far it works in firefox google-chrome ie7 but not ie8 or ie9

4265154
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort and mergesort is longer and seems more complicated but it is o n log n

4265193
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
void qgraphicsscene removeitem qgraphicsitem item

4265214
translation	localization
then i would take care of the localization as part of the normal localization process the time zones would be translation with the rest of the ui

4265221
hide	show
i have iframe elements in my page when the page is loaded the iframes will be re-sized and i have a button for each one to hide show it

4265221
google-chrome	firefox
it only happens in firefox and works fine in ie and google-chrome does anyone know why

4265229
perl	tcl
any script language should work lua tcl perl

4265234
config	ini
look at short tag config in the php ini you use in those situations and also see if processing .phtml is set up

4265244
super	abstract	super	extends
so i ve created an abstract super class with two constructors and every entity except organization extends this class

4265285
ostringstream	std
check out std ostringstream

4265293
innodb	myisam
i recommend you set innodb as your default storage engine because it is important that you don t mix operations on tables with different storage engines within a single transaction innodb and myisam tables for example

4265360
folder	dir
note2 i am ok also with another folder target dir in program files

4265364
onclick	onfocus
note between onclick and onfocus the latter is the best event to handle because it is device-independent

4265369
folder	directory
you need to create a placeholder.txt file in each empty directory if you want the precompilation tool to generate these empty folder

4265376
google-chrome	firefox
this piece of code works well in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie version 8 no other version tested

4265440
hide	show
now there s no visible property to use in order to show one and hide the other

4265502
x86	64bit
the problem is that there will possibly be both x86 apps and x64 apps and x86 apps cannot access 64bit registry

4265512
svg	vml
use svg vml graphics

4265515
codeigniter	cakephp
both sound very promising but i d also like to hear the advise from their users hopefully this would get a decent feature comparison like the thread about cakephp vs codeigniter on so

4265544
disk	ram
i think we want to keep the entire recordset in ram so that the query doesnt touch the disk if we keep the entire database in the mysql cache does that eliminate the need for memcachedb

4265544
innodb	myisam
should we switch from innodb to myisam as its good for read heavy data where as innodb is good for write heavy 11

4265548
xom	axiom	jibx	axiom	jibx	xom
ideal for efficient conversion of a xom tree to soap axiom jaxb 2 jibx or xmlbeans for example when incrementally converting xquery results via an unmarshaller perhaps in combination with a streamingpathfilter

4265606
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the problem occurs in google-chrome and firefox ie doesn t support rotate and opera i haven t tested

4265620
post	get
when i get value in vm from view to controller post some value is null only some value that is shown on view is not null

4265693
for-loop	loops
so assuming 2 does send its data before 1 for example the receiving loops in 0 shown above won t initiate until the source tag proc in the mpi_recv command is matched to the processor 1 because the outer for-loop forces this ordering

4265710
google-chrome	safari
however if you run this code in google-chrome or safari you get an interesting bug

4265710
google-chrome	safari
i have done this in google-chrome and safari on 3 different computers one on a completely different network altogether

4265710
google-chrome	firefox
if you still can t see the error then run it in google-chrome and firefox side by side

4265710
google-chrome	firefox
if google-chrome seems to finish earlier than firefox then that is the freezing glitch in action

4265776
opera	firefox
the following code brings up the alert in firefox opera desktop browsers

4265777
hide	show
i would like to create a tab view just by hide and show div element with mootools.i am stucked by using mootools and got confused

4265784
uiview	subviews
i can get the animation working fine however the issue is the subviews of the uiview are expanding past the bounds of the uiview

4265804
width	height
is there a way to have the image fill up the whole height that is possible and then adjust the width of the view to enable scaling the image without changing the ascpect ratio

4265815
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
there i implemented methods touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended in order to rotate my circle when user drags it left or right

4265815
touchesbegan	touchesended
everything works fine but when you try to drag it with one finger very fast from one side to another and in opposite direction methods touchesbegan and touchesended are called different number of times

4265815
touchesbegan	touchesended
for example touchesbegan was called 1 time and touchesended 2 - 3 times

4265875
put	get
lastly you could use modify instead of a get put pairs

4265957
jar	war
and i want that when war is building the jar will be moved to another directory not in war web-inf lib but to war web-inf servicejars

4265961
int	double
it s good to start with a default choice of int for int double for floating-point numbers and decimal for decimal-precise numbers

4265961
int	double
then make changes to that choice either as an optimisation float takes up less space than double so if you are storing a very large number of them that might be a reasonable choice to better match some outside-imposed criteria or because it won t suffice when you need to use long rather than int

4265980
stdout	stderr
this means that both stdout stderr 1 and 2 and the new file descriptor returned from open can be used interchangeable which will cause all output going to stdout and stderr to go to the file you opened

4265989
rss	feed
update program is a rss reader that just checks a twitter feed and parses the data into a list box with some additional information based on the hash tag

4266014
persistent	transient
i have a ejb timer thats persistent by the container and would like to know if the transient timerservice it s not serializable will be injected again when the ejb is deserialized

4266038
onkeyup	onkeydown
override onkeydown or onkeyup and when back button is pressed if isclicked is true set it to false i assumed that pressing back with isclicked true means closing the dropdown view

4266107
post	get
using graph api how to do like unlike a post as in graph api we get a link

4266193
int	double
imho there was a change between tr1 and c++0x with regard to adaptors between random number generation and consumption of random numbers -- mt19937 produces int normal_distribution consumes double

4266243
ibatis	mybatis
and while you are at it why not just use a simple dao framework like ibatis now mybatis which is a pleasure to use for both simple and complex projects

4266244
rss	feed
one guess is that your constantly creating new objects when polling your rss feed and even though you not end up using most of them they still reside in memory until the garbage collector comes around to collect them

4266287
width	height
the width of the div is fixed but the height can vary

4266330
filesystems	xfs
some modern filesystems xfs for one allocate inodes dynamically as needed

4266342
filesystems	xfs
if you are actually designing a new filesystems rather than just creating a volume you should consider the idea of allocating inodes dynamically like some other common unix filesystems jfs xfs reiserfs

4266351
outputstream	inputstream
just obtain an inputstream of the blob using resultset#getbinarystream and write it immediately to the outputstream of the http response along a correct set of headers

4266359
division	modulo
integer division and modulo

4266359
min	max
comparison throughput of compare min max is 8 operations per clock

4266362
hide	show
you have to first show the box and on second click you have to hide it if is it so

4266392
jar	war
i built a war archive with the jar command and put it in the webapps folder of tomcat and it s working in this way

4266436
min	max
i was originally using percentage heights but these led to large gaps at points and using max and min heights proved tricky for dragging elements out of context

4266437
pull	push
dev b has taken a couple of snapshots of dev a s code during development and when dev a published his final code to the central repository dev b was able to pull the extra changes merge with them and push all of his changes back to the central repo too

4266529
s-function	simulink
i have a c++ routine that i would like to pack in a simulink s-function

4266560
put	get
i now create an int buffer and copy the pixels to it then use get and put to extract the pixels

4266560
put	get
it s also much quicker to use get and put instead of the get setpixel from the bitmap class

4266579
children	parent
i have a maven multi-module project one parent project with three children

4266608
portrait	landscape
incorrect image size landscape portrait the img has the width property set to 480 so in case the user wants the landscape mode the image fills the whole available width

4266629
children	parent
rule the xml is invalid if any child node - children of parent has iner text length more then 256

4266668
children	parent
or if the parent can contain other things as well as the children then having a container for the children is useful

4266677
inherited	subclassing
it is not inherited by subclassing

4266698
getter	setter
if that turns out to be the case you assign the proper access possibly via getter setter and accept that changes to it will be difficult

4266726
getter	setter
the question is asking do you really understand what the modifiers give you and how they can be accessed and not to blindly make everything private and create setter and getter because that is what your lecturer book manual taught you

4266727
public	protected
any private can be changed to public or protected and so on and the program will compile and run just as it did before

4266759
installation	upgrade
i have a straightforward installation of sql server 2005 express with a named instance sense and a single database sense on which i wish to perform an in-place upgrade to 2005 standard edition

4266843
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
the 2-complement representation just works for addition subtraction and multiplication

4266869
rational-numbers	floating-point
python uses floating-point representation rather than rational-numbers

4266869
rational-numbers	fractions
take a look at the standard library fractions module for some details about rational-numbers

4266881
integer	unsigned
i just tried this and for byte -12 signed value it returned integer 244 equivalent to unsigned byte value but typed as an int

4266900
min	max
agregates min max count.... on other fields

4266903
gif	png
for me it just made the file size bigger when used on png s and gif s

4266903
gif	png
i have done this to my png and gif files to reduce their size

4266903
gif	png
-colors 50 reduces the number of colors in the image to 50 this is the only way to really reduce the size of a image stored in a lossless format like png or gif

4266918
ord	chr
is it referring to ord chr

4266927
opentype	woff
well woff is a new font standard as you know like truetype opentype but which is designed specifically for use on the web to be embedded in html

4266927
opentype	woff
woff is compressed - smaller download sizes compared with raw truetype or opentype fonts

4266945
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
edit i ve tested this working on firefox safari and opera except for the innerheight check

4266945
mp3	ogg	mp3	wav	wav	ogg
chrome doesn t support playing wav audio files only the mp3 aac or ogg vorbis formats.

4266999
floating-point	fractions
the nature of floating-point numbers means that it makes no sense to check if a floating-point number is rational since all floating-point numbers are really fractions of the form n 2 e

4266999
floating-point	fractions
however you might well want to know whether there is a simple fractions one with a small denominator rather than a big power of 2 that closely approximates a given floating-point number

4267003
width	height
note the limitations mentioned in the top of that page - the mousewheel no longer works and the calculation of the width and height seemed a little strange

4267030
children	parent
in this case you can either use the sender to get the instance or on your form you can refer to the other form via the parent property and its children if the other form is another child

4267048
hide	show
i tried my hand at a very simple hide show accordion type plugin for faqs and was successful at getting it to do what i wanted

4267082
google-chrome	firefox
i m developing a small-business oriented online app and decided to support only ie8 firefox and google-chrome

4267090
tax	shipping
my problem is to show the tax and grand total including tax fields to appear in the cart because the tax is calculated once we know the shipping address

4267154
getter	setter
the only real difference is that it decorates the property getter and setter with the attribute

4267163
getter	setter
in the second case the c# compiler will generate a field for you and generate a getter and setter to access it

4267175
getter	setter
the difference is that you have control over the getter and setter

4267192
put	get
if you want to put some logic in the set or get part you won t be able to do it automatic properties

4267193
hash	md5
also i dont think you should store password in session depends on your program logic but usually password should only be used to compute its md5 hash and never be used afterwards

4267205
int	chars
but chars - int is an integral promotion whereas unsigned int - int is a conversion

4267251
google-chrome	firefox
in ie firefox i can do this if i use blur but for google-chrome i need to use change

4267251
google-chrome	safari
since google-chrome and i believe safari don t trigger the blur event is there a property in the jquery.supports object to check for this or do i have to use the deprecated .browser object

4267255
google-chrome	firefox
i m programming a web site in asp.net using vb and i need to upgrade it so all of the functions will be active for google-chrome and firefox as well

4267255
google-chrome	firefox
sending mails when using the website with internet explorer works perfectly fine but in google-chrome and firefox the mails are not sent the to list remains empty

4267258
int	chars	unsigned	short
unsigned chars short int or unsigned

4267281
post	get
works great and i got get graph api working so that i m able to post stuff to ppl s walls using the facebook.api me feed function

4267289
performanceanalytics	chron
the functions in performanceanalytics only fail when using chron as the index

4267289
zoo	chron	zoo	xts	xts	chron
i ve suggested to you before that you should not rely on chron for your zoo xts index values

4267305
width	height
fitstart scales the image proportionally but neither the width nor height will exceed the size of the view and the image will as you said have a top|left gravity

4267327
copying	overwrite
i want to create an assignment operator that will copy the contents of array m but not to overwrite it when i change it after the copy i think this is accomplished by not copying the actual pointer but only the content don t know if i m right

4267336
mvp	presenter
if you want to be adventurous you can play with django which is the python framework for building web apps though they prescribe to the mvp model view presenter pattern

4267366
for-loop	loops
when i run this code however notice the nslog statement in the for-loop all it ever does is say that the current loops value is 0

4267374
firefox	safari
edit i just tested it in safari and it is fine so far it only seems to be firefox

4267379
google-chrome	firefox
the same exact setup works perfectly with google-chrome suggesting perhaps a bug in firefox

4267402
getter	setter
instead your class needs to force the user to call a getter setter by forbidding direct access to the variable and offering appropriate public getter setter methods in its place

4267410
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
at the moment i ve been stuck with an issue for 3 days where my ria renders fine in google-chrome firefox 3.6 opera and internet explorer 8 but fails when running internet explorer 8 in ie7-mode or with a real ie-7

4267410
google-chrome	firefox
this is the sort of thing severly lacking in the js-world in my opinion not so much for firefox or google-chrome obviously as their debuggers are a bit more helpful

4267441
submit	submission
and you need to prevent the default behavior of your form submit action submission the form via post

4267484
submit	submission
the submit event doesn t happen instead of submission but before it thus your form submit normally after the javascript is executed

4267506
google-chrome	firefox
this would probably explain why google-chrome allows the xhr but not firefox

4267506
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome considers the subdomain part of the same origin but firefox does not

4267511
initializer	class-method
when python initializer a class it essentially carries out the above procedure for each of the class-method

4267517
folder	directory
i d like to list all files from a remote folder let s say www.mysite.com folder and this folder is already configured through .htaccess for directory listing

4267550
postgresql	mysql
due to using postgresql it seems like the queries have been made unnecessarily complex when compared to mysql due to the need to include all the columns for the count columns grouping

4267708
maven	pom.xml
i m all done except that i m still looking for a way to write a maven goal in theapp s pom.xml that can put common s xml files in config

4267761
viewdidload	dealloc
a lot less to maintain and you don t have to worry about the mechanics of memory management either other than implementing init dealloc viewdidload viewdidunload

4267767
width	height
ticket size height 4 width 10

4267769
versioning	upgrade
also don t forget that if you upgrade a project certain behavior of the newer versioning will be suppressed by means of property sheets

4267846
hide	show
another workaround would have been to render them all to the page and just show hide each form through jquery

4267868
rtp	sip
i am using the pjproject1.6 and i could send the sip packets through the sip packets to the proxy server and the rtp packets or not pass through the server

4267868
rtp	sdp
i have checked in proxy server rtp proxy is running and when proxy server sends 200 ok the sdp packets from pjsip includes the ip address of the proxy server

4267885
google-chrome	firefox
while it is running fine on firefox and google-chrome

4267892
addition	multiplication
since the easiest way is to convert the integer to a string for manipulation operations and back to an integer for addition multiplication operations i used the following approach

4267892
int	chars
since a string can be construed as an array of chars 1 the operations that work on a string also need to be aware of the fact that converting a chars to an int is different than converting a string to an int

4267918
children	parent
so as long as your widget has a parent and that you destroy that parent you don t have to worry about the children

4268019
affinity	processors
i am wondering whether it is possible to set the processors affinity of a thread obtained from a thread pool

4268019
affinity	processors
the first one is related to processors affinity of pooled threads

4268068
put	get
to put it plain and simple here s what i get

4268086
hide	show
i would like to set its visibility dynamically show and hide the whole menu

4268094
persistent	transient
i have a many-to-many relationship between a persistent object retrieved by a query and a newly created transient object created with new not yet persistent

4268094
persistent	transient
however if i manually persistent the transient object before doing the association it seems to work

4268131
affinity	processors
it s very very rare to need to set processors affinity

4268131
affinity	processors
what i would call processors affinity where a thread needs to be run consistently on a the same processors

4268169
width	height
in short to make your job as a developer easier because you don t have to go through all the children and re-adjust their width height x y thus answering your 4th question too

4268181
cpu	processors
i know it depends on both the graphics card and the cpu but say one of the fastest gpus of nvidia and a single core of a intel i7 processors

4268194
haskell	scheme	haskell	ocaml	lisp	scheme	ocaml	scheme
like haskell miranda lisp scheme ocaml javascript and so forth

4268211
cublas	cula
i also know that the middle-range gpus cannot compete with high-range cpus in double-precision computation - mkl on a 8-core xeon will be faster than cula or cublas on an 300 gpu

4268216
tax	shipping
this is doubly beneficial when an address is supplied by the shipping and tax estimate form then the cart can still go back to the 3-line output automatically which is smooth

4268262
cos	sin
don t i have to do some sin cos kung-fu

4268285
division	multiplication	division	modulo	multiplication	modulo
modulo is evaluated at the same precedence as multiplication and division

4268297
addition	modulo
the modulo has precedence over the addition operator and hence 2 5 gets calculated first resulting in 2 and then 3 + 2 is calculated resulting in your answer 5

4268324
filtering	grouping
add indexes for columns you are frequently filtering or grouping for

4268327
cairngorm	flex	flexunit	cairngorm
flex libraries frameworks flex 4 sdk core library for flex flexunit flexmonkey blazeds spring blazeds integration cairngorm 3

4268376
jobs	cron
there is no cron function in php but you can run php scripts as cron jobs

4268414
removeclass	fadeout
afaik i dont think you can add a fadeout to a removeclass

4268427
google-chrome	safari
i m trying to align an input button with a link class button but in safari and google-chrome there is like 1 pixel difference at the top and i can t figure out why

4268433
for-loop	loops
to answer your question you need to loops over every bit using a simple a for-loop and check to see whether the i th bit is set

4268446
public	protected
as you know php class has private public and protected keywords

4268473
getter	setter
i m not sure of any disadvantages other than declaring something protected or private may mean a little more work writing a getter and a setter method

4268524
folder	directory
i deleted a common folder from the root directory of my svn store and it turns out i need it.

4268530
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i want to create my own container view controller something like uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller

4268557
public	protected	implements	modifiers
obviously you don t need modifiers like private protected or public to implements this behavior but it leads to better structured code and clearer interfaces

4268557
public	protected
public members can be accessed from outside code protected members can be accessed form inheriting classes and private members only from the class

4268570
implements	extends
the above is used with the built-in lime test suite but i m sure you can extends implements it appropriately in your bdd bootstrap

4268576
entitydatasource	detailsview
i have a page with a detailsview control is connected with entitydatasource

4268623
google-chrome	firefox
to both elements fixes this problem in google-chrome and firefox

4268667
int	double
the following code can t be compiled because there are two double get_item int methods in the class

4268683
submit	submission
i am trying to disable the form on my site when the user click the submit button to stop duplicate submission

4268707
post	put
according to the rest ideology what should be in the response body for a put post delete requests

4268707
post	put
i ve found a good post describing post put differences post vs put

4268717
rss	feed
then whenever you are refreshing the rss feed you loop through all entities and call updateshoulddisplay

4268723
mongoid	mongomapper
that line would pass your time object as a string take off the to_s to send it to the type parsing layer in your orm mongomapper or mongoid as a time object

4268739
squash	branch	pull	push
the only other course of action after such a special push followed by a squash on the remote side would be to rename your current branch and to pull the remote branch in order to reset the local version of said branch to what is on the remote side

4268776
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari

4268786
put	get
for a put i d return the same view that you d get if you did a get immediately after

4268791
hide	show
then add a link just above or below that div to show the div and hide the add comment link using js like jquery

4268816
hash	md5
i am trying to make a multi user login system for my java program at the moment i am compairing the username and password to md5 hash stored in a text file

4268823
google-chrome	firefox
i ve built a site in ci and have a login system which works fine in firefox but not google-chrome or ie

4268823
google-chrome	firefox
i ve noticed that it doesn t seem to be setting a cookie in google-chrome but it does in firefox

4268888
put	get
if you don t put it under scm how is it going to get deployed correctly on your production systems

4268890
hash	md5
md5 is a one way hash algorithmic you cant decrypt it back best way is to compare the encrypted string to validate things

4268894
boost	allocator
boost interprocess containers are standard containers with custom allocator

4268894
boost	allocator
so the allocator classes relevant to boost interprocess involve extra arithmetic at dereferenciation

4268926
inherited	properties
i have inherited some existing projects where the developer was using dependency properties rather that inotifypropertychanged for wpf change notification

4268964
datediff	difference
you may also tell the datediff tsql function to consider the difference in days in month in hours in minutes in seconds etc

4268975
post	get	post	put	put	get
forgive the flippancy but if you are doing rest over http then rfc7231 describes exactly what behaviour is expected from get put post and delete

4268988
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
subclassing uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller is an excellent way to handle device rotation issues but i wouldn t recommend doing that specifically to share subviews from multiple view controllers

4269007
width	height
what i would like to know is if the user changes the size too much will the text start to wrap around in the div s incorrectly and should i be using em s to specify my div width height to avoid this issue

4269019
ant	maven
the code generation should run from maven or ant and take the java source code as input

4269061
superclass	subclassing
anyway i recommend you to subclassing writerappender and create your own jtextareaappender that would pass in your custom outputstream to superclass

4269069
pow	math.h
pow is from visual c++ 2010 math.h library

4269076
puts	gets
to do that i m using a customized uitableview which gets data from an array and puts cells with pair indexpath on the right and with odd indexpath on the left

4269094
int	chars
values int 169 chars â

4269156
int	double
it wouldn t be practical for pow to check for special cases like int roots and besides 1 3 as a double is not exactly 1 3

4269184
move	drag
the problem is when i move on h2 i want to see a little hand to show this can drag and drop i guess it could implement directly use jquery

4269195
updatepanel	scriptmanager
criticism tinymce will not interoperate 100 smoothly with the asp.net scriptmanager and updatepanel controls at no fault of the tinymce script

4269205
versioning	upgrade
if this is an oracle bug does anyone know when it was fixed and so which oracle versioning is likely to cause cowboy queries to blow up if our database is upgrade

4269237
filepath	unc
i gave iusr_machine_name full rights to the unc share and as i step through my asp.net page s code behind onto the file.openread filepath method it throws an exception access to path 10.32.16.24 repositories repository0001 vol00001 ktappb01_024655001_0.pdf is denied

4269273
hash	salt
i m trying to figure out if it is alright to store passwords that are encrypted using the aes algorithm rather than storing passwords that are salt and hash with sha1

4269273
hash	salt
i get the impression that most people think that hashing salt passwords is the more secure way of handling passwords but i can t figure out a way to comply with current company operations when using hash passwords

4269319
fileoutputstream	filewriter
note that filewriter isn t generally a great class to use - i prefer to use fileoutputstream wrapped in outputstreamwriter as that lets you specify the character encoding to use rather than using your operating system default

4269334
nsstring	nsdata
note that a defaultâ s value can be only property list objects nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary

4269340
post	get
yes each computer as long as their on the same network can establish a server instance with inbound and outbound post get

4269369
onclick	onmousedown
it will work if you use onmousedown instead of onclick

4269540
jinternalframe	jlayeredpane
i have a jlayeredpane and inside the jlayeredpane is a jinternalframe

4269540
width	height
what i need are the bounds x position y position width height of the content pane in the jinternalframe

4269562
mdpi	hdpi
i did place a small icon in ldpi a medium one in mdpi and a high one in hdpi - could that be what triggered the issue

4269565
post	get
how to get muti file using python when post

4269572
try-catch	exception-handling
suppose i want to wrap code that can throw exception-handling with a try-catch block that logs the exception-handling and continues

4269601
udp	tcp
basically i want to send and receive data using socket connection through tcp udp protocol between two emulator and the two emulator are running on the same pc

4269613
udp	tcp
what would be the most effective way that is best ratio of effort vs readability and maintainability to establish tcp connection or send udp datagrams on mac and iphone

4269613
udp	tcp
my current aim is to stream device status accelerometer over the network over udp while also maintaining signaling and delivery-guaranteed-event button pressed connection over tcp

4269670
put	get
this creates really bad code and if i put this as a member of the class i will get a circular reference because the data table bean has to inject the calendar and the calendar has to inject the data table

4269708
post	get
correction to roy s post the day from the function will always get the month value

4269826
post	get	post	put	put	get
plus wcf data services and odata supports all crud operations using the http verbs get post put and delete and merge which is new for this protocol i believe

4269826
post	put
if in your iphone app you can create http requests using post put and delete verbs methods then your service will support that

4269892
postgresql	mysql
sorry but oracle sql server mysql postgresql are all good databases

4269897
put	get
if the state changes after you put them into the map you won t be able to get them out again at least not by their original values

4269934
put	get
so i need to check the partners-certi for the issuer get this from the internet put it into my trusted certi dir in openssl etc....

4269994
do-while	break
the do-while false loop is a way of making a block that you can break out of in languages that will not tolerate an anonymous block

4269994
try-catch	exception-handling
it could just as easily be a function and use returns or a try-catch with exception-handling

4270002
matlab	simulink
i do not see any sense anyway starting today a new project in matlab except if you are using simulink

4270019
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
is there a clear abstraction to represent mixed fractions so that you can perform addition subtraction multiplication operations on it

4270070
post	put
you should try jquery.ajax with async false if you want to wait for the result or put other code inside the function given to post

4270073
icu	gettext
however if you want to solve this problem because this is extra challenging and you are looking for creative cross inspiring ways to do that you might want to look into something called choiceformat example would be one from icu project or you can look up gettext s solution for plural forms problem

4270079
integer	fractions
well i think you can turn it into an improper fractions by adding the fractions part with the integer do the operations using the methods mentioned in the page you linked to and transform it back to a mixed fractions by doing this

4270094
youtube	vimeo
also it only works with youtube it does not affect vimeo flash embeds for example

4270111
put	get
i ve put calls in the actual markdown function and they never get called

4270118
put	get
so i just created dummy implementations of the assignment and copy constructor put them in the private of the class but it still warns me about assignment operator not able to get generated

4270129
for-loop	loops
the continue within the for-loop will skip within the for-loop not the foreach loops

4270167
loops	while-loop
use a while-loop only to loops forever and that means probably never

4270180
folder	directory
the public folder is used to publish static resources but just for that so that every requests that points to a static source under root of the url eg yoursite.com static_img.jpg is forwarded to the real file residing in that directory this is not true for normal ror views

4270185
int	chars
sourcepacket is just a small class which takes a const chars and an int during construction

4270186
width	height
what i would like to do is check the dimensions of every picture and load only bigger ones certain width height in the browser

4270216
width	height
you can get image sizes with the php function getimagesize which will return an array containing the height and width along with some other meta information

4270216
width	height
if the height and width match your criteria you can add them to an output array that you can convert to json and send back to your jquery script

4270216
width	height
you can check their width by using the method and their height by using the method

4270245
width	height
you definitely need to load them all first there s no way to get the width height without doing so

4270258
width	height
i think after getting the images you can loop on them and get width and height of each one and by that you can get which is bigger than others

4270258
width	height
get the real width and height of an image with javascript

4270258
google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome

4270258
width	height
how to get image size height width using javascript

4270296
google-chrome	firefox
no content-type is set in the response and google-chrome defaults it to text while firefox and ie render it as html

4270309
cpu	affinity
you can use the taskset command to set the cpu affinity of a process which will limit which cpus it is allowed to run on

4270309
cpu	affinity
to fetch the cpu affinity of a process run

4270311
for-loop	arrays
tried to pseudo-code the solution to the problem went as far as store each listbox item in an arrays with a for-loop

4270331
subtraction	addition
then when you want to do addition and subtraction you can find the lcd faster and you can work in one representation

4270331
division	subtract
or you can save the value you get from floor numerator denominator and subtract it from the raw division which will give you the fractional component 0 x 1

4270337
google-chrome	firefox
it would not work in firefox or google-chrome etc

4270337
google-chrome	firefox
when you do retest in google-chrome and firefox and ie and the tinymce suddenly appears

4270343
virus	botnet
wouldn t the best way to dismantle a botnet come from writing your own virus

4270343
trojan	botnet	trojan	virus	virus	botnet
i m not seriously advocating vigilantism of course but in theory you could wage a war against any botnet using the same tactics that a virus worm trojan uses

4270362
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
when uinavigationcontroller pushes a new uiviewcontroller on to its stack it will ask that controller for whatever buttons should be displayed

4270471
width	height
the answer is simple if you set the layout width or layout height of your listview to wrap_content the listview will try to measure every single view that is attached to it - which is definitely not what you want

4270471
listview	gridview
generally speaking avoid setting wrap_content for listview or gridview at all times

4270571

i had a situation where i needed to do more than just show or hide the one element

4270579
post	get
your choice of using get and post depends on the data sent

4270581
post	get
it s almost trivially easy to inspect the contents of both post and get values

4270582
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but that would work in safari firefox google-chrome and opera

4270584
post	get
see this is either get or post more secure than the other

4270611
post	get
there are no security differences between post and get used in ajax

4270611
post	get
the only difference is that post payload is in the body of the request and get payload is in the query params of the url

4270663
width	height
you have both layout_width and layout_height set to wrap_content in addition to setting explicit values for width and height

4270667

ocr tools often show the bit-map to hide the text they get wrong

4270669

4270768
width	height
preset height width affects

4270768

and as far as i remember mean variance skew and kurtosis are just functions of the first 4 momenta

4271249
public	protected
you limit the manipulation of the class s private internals to what s allowed by legal usage of the class s public or protected members

4271257
draggable	droppable
just because an element is draggable does not mean it can not be droppable as well

4271259

4271669
post	get
but it allows you to do additional gymnastics like adding a form wizard to the admin site or splitting everything into multiple forms and rendering them in a single html form element in the templates doing custom handling of get post requests etc

4271680
accessor	properties
if you re already using properties to access your instance variable then you can just edit the accessor method and everything should just work

4271710
lisp	scheme
just like writing in lisp means writing in some dialect like common lisp or scheme actually writing straight-up ecmascript might not only be pointless but unusable in the dialects although i think actionscript 3 and recent javascript apply the whole ecmascript standard

4271712
fast-forward	merge
seeing your edit your merge back into trunk must have been a fast-forward

4271779
width	height
since that didn t work for you what you will have to do is create a 1px width 1px height .png of color #000 and opacity at 50

4271867
getter	setter
you almost always want to access variables using the synthesized setter getter even if you aren t doing anything special with them at the moment

4271867
getter	setter
if as your application develops you find that you need to be doing further validation formatting of variables then you can just implement the required setter getter method and if you have used the synthesised methods this code will get called

4272263
firefox	safari
i ve a problem with a lightbox i ve done in safari and firefox

4272281
mouseover	mouseout
i imagine you could use getcomputedstyle to figure out what the value of a property was on an element and change it with an external stylesheet defining different rules for #foo and #foo hover but you are probably better off writing logic that does the right thing whatever that might be when the mouseover and mouseout events fire

4272295
tarfile	zipfile

4272302
listbox	icollectionview
by using a custom icollectionview implementation the article derives listcollectionview for convenience you don t have to do anything to the listbox except set the itemssource to be a collectionviewsource object bound to your dataset

4272311
qscrollarea	qwidget
firstly you probably should create the qwidget and qscrollarea somewhere else and keep a member variable pointing to them for reference

4272313
min	max
i guess if your comparator for the avl tree built on the interval list was f length-of-interval you could get it in o logn or maybe faster if your avl implementation has fast max min

4272322
getter	setter
as donnie suggests in the comments getter and setter are just like any other methods

4272322
getter	setter

how would i pass the attachment on to carrierwave paperclip not fussed about which i ll use whichever one handles this best

4272488
getter	setter
one fact i don t like in struts 2 in comparison with spring-mvc is that you have to add getter and setter for every property you want to get in the actions

4272506
width	height
if i re-size the window bigger the x y positions from either mouse events seem to be restricted to the original window width and height

4272561
stdout	stderr
if you want to enable this globally you ll want a terminal feature not a process that you pipe output into because a pipe would be disruptive to some command two problems are that stdout and stderr would appear out-of-order and buffered and that some commands just behave differently when outputting to a terminal

4272576
capitalize	capitalization
i know there are use cases where having the correct capitalization of place names would be valuable and lowercasing strings is easy enough if you have to do that so we re considering how to provide capitalize names without impacting current customers who might be relying on the data in its current format

perforce	svn
perhaps if i could actually make an exact distinction between a head a ref a commit a branch a stem a gnargel and a whizpoo some of this might be a little easier but to an ordinary mortal with only 10 years experience of svn perforce and rcs it all looks like rather cranky black magic

4273187

4273372
comparator	comparable
be careful though- any two prioritizedrule-s will have to be comparable to each other which is why i m recommending prioritizedrule be an abstract base instead of an interface because that s where the comparator implementation needs to live for consistency

4273372
equals	compareto
your compareto does not need to be consistent with equals unless you try to keep your collection in a sorted set which can never end well prioritizedrule can t be aware of enough to make itself consistent with equals

anyway you could use radio button checkbox with the tag and style the label to look like a button

4273746

as long as you are letting the content decide the height and width you are going to run into problems

4273962
maven	m2e
the dependency resolver in m2e is not using the external maven installation it has to use the embedded maven version

4273962
maven	m2e
so i d recommend to get the latest version of m2e as well as maven 3.x version to minimize the difference in dependency resolution

4273972

you can get a pretty good guesstimate by taking the width and height of the image and then parsing the file extension of the src attribute

int	double
as you see my x field and y field has double type but when i print those points their value will be int how can i keep their value and use them in my functions with double type

4274372
int	double
your double values are being cast back to int

4274395
int	double
if you store an int into a floating point type like a double then it gets stored as the floating point equivalent of that int which is the same as putting .0 at the end

4274395
int	double
because the value you are storing into it will always be an int you re always going to end up with a whole number in your double unless you do some other mathematical processing on them which causes them to change

4275333
devise	cancan
using devise for authentication and cancan for authorization on a new rails 3 app

4275397
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
if it has to be a running total than you could use a gridview repeater or a listview to create the table and sign up to the control s onitemdatabound onrowdatabound event to calculate it

4275466
maven	m2e
especially m2e which does use maven 3 internally seems to be affected with it update-snapshots does not work when the snapshots are not unique

4275466
nexus	artifactory
i also did test various other configurations first replace nexus with artifactory - same behaviour

4275467
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
that s the easy part but i want the player to work for i.e versions 6 firefox safari and google-chrome

4275483
nodevalue	innerhtml
it s nothing to do with the standards-compliance or otherwise of innerhtml or that only a single text node is legal within a element you get exactly the same behaviour if you try to change the nodevalue property of a text node contained within the element

4275517
children	parent
i know that inheritancetype.joined works without defining discriminator column but it s quite ineffective because then hibernate needs to create joins between parent and all children instead of just parent and one child when using information in discriminator column

4275579
opera	firefox
opera mobile and the mobile version of firefox for android also supports svg

4275581
public	protected
assume that i have a public class a and an abstract class b such that b only contains protected methods

4275599
put	get
put simply i have 2010-11-24 and i want to get just 24 from that

4275610
public	protected
those public methods will simply call the protected methods you are trying to test

4275624
hex	binary	octal	decimal	octal	binary	octal	hex
it s just a convention used in c and c-like languages to distinguish between different bases 0x10 hex versus 10 decimal versus 010 octal versus 0b10 binary

4275634
many-to-many	one-to-many
personally i doubt the extra table model would be helpful unless you think that one-to-many will become many-to-many in the future

4275694
treemap	treeset
but you know if i were you i would instead use either treeset or treemap which are perfect implementations provided you give them a valid comparator which you already have written in one form or one another

4275713
disk	ram
1 quite heavy needs lots of disk space around 5+ gb and good amount of ram

4275718
children	parent
the getchildren .add internally adds the current component as parent of the children

4275731
put	get
so when i try to run my app i get force close but when i put manually

4275741
google-chrome	firefox
why is it only apparent in ie and google-chrome and not firefox

4275746
udp	rtp
since the rtp packets are contained in udp my socket is initalized with the following parameters

4275746
udp	rtp	packets	multicast
something goes wrong while i can receive standard udp packets addressed to the multicast group 224.1.0.1 the rtp packets are not received the first time but sending them again makes the trick

4275746
udp	rtp
the code is exactly the same read same executable for the rtp scenario and the udp scenario

4275809
installation	downgrade	uninstall	downgrade
go to about eclipse - installation details - installed software and uninstall the plug-in you want to downgrade

4275811
gridview	rowdatabound
the index variable comes from the rowdatabound event of my gridview like so

4275832
int	boolean
the reason for this is because the boolean data type is stored as a 16-bit signed int

4275889
draggable	droppable
there s a good reason why i have the one datepicker tied to a div i need to be able to drag items onto it using draggable and droppable which turns out to be impossible using a popup datepicker

4275917
folder	directory
how can i get system display name of a file directory or folder as it would be displayed in a system file browser

4275927
postgresql	mysql
copied from mysql vs postgresql

4275931
superclass	subclassing
i d guess that it is down to the fact that the mapped superclass cannot have its own table and so is persisted into the table s of subclassing and if there are multiple subclassing of the mapped superclass then the relation back from the other side doesn t have a single fk to follow to get to the mapped superclass information

4275931
superclass	subclassing
in that way most jpa implementations will allow it but typically when there is a single subclassing of the mapped superclass

4275933
jstl	taglib
the use of scriptlets those things is indeed highly discouraged since the birth of taglib like jstl and el expression language those things over a decade ago

4276002
instances	transient
if i instantiate this class as a singleton in castle windsor in asp.net then presumably all attempts to access this class by transient web calls will read from the single instances of the reference data in memory

4276061
google-chrome	firefox
i wish to run my web application for translation in all the three browsers namely firefox google-chrome ie

4276065
post	get
you should write a small web service simple php asp page that handles authentication through http get post and only submits requests you permit avoid someone sniffing the username password and then drop the database or modify it

4276113
mef	prism
in a prism v4 mef mvvm app i got a view containing a tabcontrol

setting up upgrade versioning of a1 in iis6 this worked - so no compatibility issues between forms auth in different .net versioning in iis6

4276325
width	height
i want a table to have fixed width but dynamic height because content may be of various length

4276346
int	chars
when i check allocations in ddms i see that .tostring not totally unsurprising allocates a chars array on each conversion from an int to a string

4276377
children	parent
you can use simple observer pattern where you parent components are observing their children

4276386
client-side	server-side
you can use a customvalidator and perform the regex match server-side and also on the client-side as well if you want

4276402
int	boolean
expr can be a boolean expression a boolean literal variable or anything castable to a boolean an int

4276409

4276430
google-chrome	safari
got it on safari and google-chrome as well

4276477
splist	spsite	spweb	splist	spweb	spsite
i know that it is very important to dspose the spweb and spsite the splist object belongs to

4276479
filtering	grouping
you can always grouping table and other filtering components to one customcomponent for easier abstraction

4276483
versioning	upgrade
the solution was simple to upgrade grails to a more recent versioning such as 1.3.5

4276532
client-side	server-side
i create my proxy using a channelfactory object and found that in addition to specifying usedefaultwebproxy for the binding server-side it was also necessary to specify the option client-side

4276674
stdout	stderr
you in fact can scrape stdout and stderr

4276677
textview	imageview
here the text is written in a textview and remaining 5 boxes are 5 different imageview and the images should be clickable

4276683
mongodb	bson
mongodb stores everything in memory anyway and works in a similar vein being a key-value based system however i believe mongodb is more flexible as it allows for storing bson objects within themselves

4276683
mongodb	bson
just for clarification mongodb uses bson a specialised form of json for storing all its data which includes objects within objects.

4276686
pop-up	dialog
whenever the dialog appears the first fields gets focus automatically hence the datepicker pop-up

4276734
put	get
if i use phpmyadmin to put a â symbol into a row when i display it on a utf-8 charset page i get the good old question-mark-diamond

when someone goes to i create a model for the view with 2 objects - a list of all the messages to show in the proper order of parent and children

4276742
opera	firefox
this is not a cross browser solution but this worked in firefox and opera not in ie8 -

4276800
folder	directory	folder	dir
dir in visual basic returns a string representing the name of a file directory or folder that matches a specified pattern or file attribute or the volume label of a drive

4276819
jobs	cron
also if you have access to things like cron jobs they might be the solution you re looking for

4276860
for-loop	loops
so i need a for-loop to loops through each subcolumn in my multiple column field

4276884
post	get
please use http post instead of http get to send passwords to your website

4276998
public	protected
i understand what public protected private accessors mean in java or php for instance

4277046
folder	directory
pathtofile is correct becuase the variable is used in previous lines to move the video from the resources folder to the documents directory

4277065
webclient	httpwebrequest
while the example uses webclient this blocks on the ui thread when processing the completed thread so you will probably want to consider using httpwebrequest instead if your processing of the returned xml is anything but trivial

4277069
ubuntu	debian
i m looking for a cms running under mono framework this is needed to have it deployed on linux-based ubuntu debian machines

4277074
objectdatasource	detailsview
when issueing the update method using a detailsview with an objectdatasource i get the following error

4277076
easyhook	detours
maybe easyhook or detours

4277158
int	boolean
since php is a loosely typed language and you are using these variables in a boolean context the || they are silently converted to bool - and both are converted to false resulting in a int 1 as result of your expression - which is again silently converted to string 1 since echo is a string context

4277179
put	get
you are assuming that put actually succeeds in putting the data in the cache and that right after the blocking of the call to put that the data you put in is the data you get back with get

4277195
width	margin
one of the solutions is to give the a fixed width so that it can be centered to its parent by margin 0 auto

4277261
hash	salt
if you just want to verify data integrity you can use a salt hash with a secret salt that you store along with the data

4277261
hash	hmac
see for example the hash message authentication code hmac

4277285
width	height
is it possible to set height and width of tabs in android

4277285
width	height
i tried setting customized textview as the indicator of tabspec setting its height and width to different values but no matter what its height and width value is it s always set to the default height and width value

4277291
post	get
here is my implementation and it works for post and get

4277321
post	get
but then you may want to use post instead of get because of the url specifications which are limited in character usage and url length

4277349
x86	64bit
i was trying to run some drivers coded for 32-bit vista x86 on 64bit win7 amd64 and it was not running

4277358
put	get
in short when i get a queue-event onmessage imessage receivedmsg i put the message into an internal queue out of which x threads do their thing

4277453
serializable	deserialization
also test and measure serializable deserialization may be slower than the normal methods of object creation - note that you d probably be deserializing twice from session to string then string into object of that class

4277453
serializable	deserialization
if you want to go the serializable deserialization route try memcached instead

4277459
put	get
if you want to do it without ajax you can get the values when the user accesses the page and put them in a javascript array

4277548
maven	pom.xml
i have a similar situation with the assembly plugin where if assembly and jarsigner are in the same pom.xml the order is fine but if jarsigner is in the parent pom.xml then the order is bad maven 2.2.1

4277557
hide	show
most of the solution are based on preloading the div the contains the information you want to show against the button click hide the div itself and show it only when the user press the button

4277562
redhat	fedora
the problem at the moment im compiling on ubuntu but my server is running fedora redhat

4277562
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu uses boost 1.42 and linux latest at this very moment is 1.41

4277573
children	parent
so as you can see the problem is that nhib does not update child a composite-id after its parent was saved and the attempt to save children fails

4277746
children	parent
i ve been using a function i made when i first started programming or shortly thereafter at least to do the simple but extremely useful task of organizing an array based on parent and children

4277777
processors	hyperthreading
it s definately not the case that the number of hardware threads is twice the number of cores -- amd processors don t have any sort of hyperthreading yet and hyperthreading may be turned off in the bios as is usually was for pre-nehalem processors as it really didn t buy you very much in practice

4277806
rss	feed
they also have rss feed for each topic

4277807
put	get
if you get gcc 4.6 and build it with -std c++0x you can put it in a union

4277837
post	get
as you can see from the dtd fragment the action attribute is #required as is the method get or post

4277840
children	parent
what i was hoping i could do next is in a single query update the under_post_count fields for all those categories identified and all their parent with the number of distinct posts assigned to each category or any of it s children

4277843
postgresql	mysql
however when i changed the database from mysql to postgresql 8.4 i couldn t handle concurrent access anymore

4277855
google-chrome	firefox
clicked windows web browser google-chrome the other options of course were default ie firefox

4277884
realloc	malloc
furthermore i could realloc it woth another call to malloc and ask to dosome to process that datablock again

4277894
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
whereas i ve got the described behaviour in firefox and google-chrome ie and opera throw always false with the notable exception of the comparing the version which gave me true in ie although he couldn t retrieve the value of the select tag

4277982
google-chrome	firefox
all this works fine in firefox and google-chrome

4277982
post	get
silverlight makes the post http request receives a 302 response and automatically does a get http request of the specified redirect url and returns that to me i know this because i used fiddler to watch the http requests going on

4277985
google-chrome	firefox
hi i am beginner in js using linux firefox google-chrome is there any way by which i get what are the syntax errors are there in my js the way i get my c syntax error in gcc

which is the preferred text editor for python development vim emacs or any other

4278229
move	drag
howerver regardless of the user executing a copy action drag with ctrl press the action remains a move

4278265
post	get
you can see from this example serialize works well over the fields to be sent by post or get

4278283
opera	safari
i have few image backgrounds 1650x1050px and they are fading smooth only in safari opera

4278283
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and ie7 8 you can see frames of fade like taking pictures

4278331
free	malloc
now while the application is active this data is always persistant so i never free the malloc data

4278351
free	malloc
strictly following the c standard you should free everything you ve malloc d before the application terminates

4278403
opera	firefox
good browser + a debugger plugin both firefox and opera will suffice

4278444
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
my code in cdef class that doesn t inherit raw iobase rather reimplements it s functionality python code gets my object wrapped in bufferedreader bufferedwriter - this one seems to work and less messy than the previous option

4278470
action-filter	onactionexecuting
in action-filter onactionexecuting

4278470
opera	firefox
for example action logoff works well in opera ie but there is a problem in firefox

4278490
codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana	cakephp	kohana
i haven t come across an official name for that yet but most mvc frameworks for php kohana cakephp codeigniter fat free and etc. calls that routing

4278495
std	ostream
i m using a third party code which has its own implementation for std ostream operator to handle the third party s type

4278506
firefox	safari
and of course the website should be fully compatible with firefox safari internet explorer etc

4278571
jstl	taglib
in case of a basic jsp servlet webapplication the basic approach would be using jstl fmt taglib in combination with resource bundles

4278571
jstl	taglib
a theoretical alternative would be to supply a bundle with a custom control to load those files as utf-8 but that s unfortunately not supported by the basic jstl fmt taglib

4278624
folder	directory
when i try clean up my folder is marked as ok green circle but if i go to the parent directory and come back the red circle reappears

4278642
serializable	deserialization
however the exception is serializable into a soap fault element and regardless of the type of the exception thrown in the service the exception is converted into a soapexception while deserialization

4278665
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
ie6+ firefox2.0+ and newer safari google-chrome and opera

4278749
queue	fifo
it revolves around a fifo queue data structure which stores pending urls

4278779
easyhook	detours
i am trying to do some hooking in c# i d rather not use detours or c++ so i have been using easyhook

4278792
getter	setter
the first disadvantage of this approach is that it makes my domain model anemic - the majority of methods are just getter and setter and most of the business logic is in the service layer

4278821
google-chrome	firefox
they work fine in full ie as well as firefox and google-chrome so the items correctly hide but they never hide when viewed through the wpf webbrowser control

4278830
jstl	taglib
use the following with a little help of jstl functions taglib

4278875
int	chars
the only part of this that some people find counterintuitive is that ch must be defined as an int not a chars for the code to work correctly

4278882
integer	fractions	multiplying	subtract
for the fractions part repeatedly multiplying by ten and subtract off the integer parts to form the decimal string

4278889

apache	nginx
as far as i m aware the webserver apache nginx provides the based on the claimed location of the requesting user agent

4279048
onfocus	onblur
i know i can listen for window.onblur and window.onfocus but i m trying to figure out how to address users that open link in background tab window and the code starts running without either the onblur or onfocus events being called

4279052
subclass	accessor
basically a subclass could choose to override your accessor and then you d be sending a message to a subclass object that is not yet initialised

4279069
matplotlib	mplot3d
as for 3d - you could try matplotlib s mlab or mplot3d

4279108
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
what really matter is that selecting the same words of the same document must give the same result on google-chrome safari ie firefox

4279135
ready	each
i wrote this to avoid having to watch images load on the page i rather the page loaded then when each image is ready they fade in nicely

4279143
innodb	myisam
i have innodb myisam and memory tables mixed

4279213

you can only notice when it get or lost focus using onfocus and onblur as you said

4279319
opera	google-chrome
i m primarily interested in a solution that works with firebug but if there s something for the dev tools of google-chrome or opera i d like to hear about it as well

4279340
width	height
image width image height colour depth bits per byte

4279340
multiplying	add
multiplying this by the number of simultaneous users running the script and add the overhead of all your other php stuff and you ll find you re probably using a lot of memory

4279377
int	chars
string find returns a large positive int to indicate invalid positions the size_type is unsigned so you will always enter the loop unless a match is found starting at chars position 0 in which case you probably do want to enter the loop

4279404
spaces	delimiter
i was surprised git show-ref uses spaces as field delimiter while git ls-remote uses tabs for the same kind of output.

4279428
gridview	repeater	gridview	formview
formview gridview repeater etc.etc. and then bind your data to that control

4279499
required	placeholder
where the addfield function has a format where you can name the field define the label shown to the user which initially will be portuguese but we would like to be multilingual in the future and the type of input element and options for that input element such as required true or placeholder cereal waffles toast etc.

4279503
abstract-class	superclass	nsstream	nsoutputstream
most of this is in the abstract-class nsstream which is the superclass of both nsinputstream and nsoutputstream

4279507

4279516
chipmunk	pymunk
i took rabbyt as an opengl wrapper for rendering my sprites and using pymunk chipmunk for my physics

4279532
width	height
saving the x y width and height of the window when you close it and loading the data when you open the window

4279536
client-side	server-side
if you are a beginner then i would recommend learning more and more client-side and server-side in order to know what to debug

4279537
installation	upgrade
a cloud-based relational database sql azure with the azure platform is similar to a regular relational database such as sql server except that you don t have to worry about licenses installation hardware upgrade customizations disk allocations where to store your transaction logs etc

4279543
post	get
currently i m able to get the number of post in a category with the following query

4279543
post	get
and i can get the number of views for each post with the following query

4279546
sqldatasource	detailsview
one way to do this is to use a datasource control such as a sqldatasource and use it in conjunction with a data control that will bind to the previous datasource control like a detailsview

4279554
postgresql	mysql
postgresql timestamp is not unix timestamp and mysql s unix timestamp is not postgresql s or oracles timestamp

4279554
postgresql	mysql
but in mysql or postgresql comparing dates

4279554
subtraction	addition
you can do addition subtraction all with php date objects

4279563

int	chars
i am trying to get the int equivalent of these chars s that are in the buffer to compare

4279622
typedef	struct
typedef struct citizen

4279633
min	max
define r as a rectilinear region from x min y min to x max y max

4279633
width	height
the paper uses 21 as a heuristic meaning divide the height and width by 20

4279658
stdout	stderr
if you reassign with stderr stdout you get a warning while stderr.reopen nul w goes without saying

4279667
width	height
function newpopup url popupwindow window.open url popupwindow height 700 width 1200 left 1 top 1 resizable no scrollbars no toolbar no menubar no location no directories no status yes

4279685
int	chars
if you just want to convert single chars to int you can use c - 0 which is equivalent to c - 48

4279725
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that while firefox and explorer call as i want google-chrome makes a call to

4279762
google-chrome	firefox
in my opinion google-chrome is behaving correctly and ie firefox are not

4279830
public	protected
with protected you can redefine the functioning of a class by overriding it without making this method part of the public interface

4279830
public	protected
another thing - protected methods are common methods that can be reused by subclasses but again don t need to be part of the public interface

4279857
superclass	subclassing
the most frequent use i see is actually to let a superclass use a subclassing s internals

4279857
superclass	subclassing
if you want your superclass to access the logic of a subclassing but don t want it to be publicly exposed you have no choice but the protected modifier

4279882
width	height
yes you can specify the width and the height of your images

4279939
int	boolean
for regular list items you may just return false for the boolean isenabled int position method

udp	tcp
since you re using udp you re not really going to get a stream because udp is not a stream-oriented protocol like tcp

4279984
ravendb	couchdb
i m trying to see if a specific algorithm can be translated to the kind of map-reduce index ravendb couchdb uses ie pre-computed map-reduce which means the indexes are refreshed on insertion and updates not when performing the actual query

4279984
ravendb	couchdb
could this sort of algorithm be somehow pre-computed ã la ravendb couchdb map-reduce index

4279989
webclient	webrequest
update i have changed my code to use webclient class instead of webrequest upon suggestion

4280002
webclient	webrequest
by the way you should use the webclient class instead of webrequest

4280069
post	get
i get the general impression that the switch from the 1.1 template to the 2.0 template in xcode has caused some confusion for everyone so as a result there isn t much helpful on 2.0 if there is anything really good and informative out there like 71squared s videos on the 1.1 template except for 2.0 your welcome to post a link to it

4280069
width	height
wait that wouldn t show anything at the start cuz i ve not set the height and width of the image right

4280091
width	height
you can t inspect the width height of the graphics object

4280092
width	height
since the phone s resolution is at max pixel count 960x640 you can scale your image down maintaining aspect ratio so that width and height never go below the upper bounds on the 960 or 640 size so your image would be 1333x1333 scaled down which now reduces your memory footprint from 16 mb per image down to just over 7.1 mb per image

4280099
ostringstream	std
it would on flush data check some thread-local variable to see if the data came from the thread that calls the library then route it somewhere else into a std string std ostringstream instead of to the regular cout cerr streambufs

4280099
stdout	stderr
if it s using c s stdout stderr i think it d be harder to do properly but it might be doable still

4280133
post	get
my application would then post this data in order to simulate a login get the returned authentication cookie and be able to work on their site as if logged in

4280133
submit	submission
with example 1 submission the login form is a simple case of posting uname something passwd somethingelse to login.php however in asp.net because all inputs are wrapped in a global to submit the login inputs you have to submit the global form and therefore all the inputs

4280151
hide	show
when form inside guest_details section is submitted then hide the section guest_details and show first_start section

4280239
centos	linux
i don t know if centos has a recent enough version of the linux kernel for this to work though

4280245
int	chars
there is nothing built in to the standard library to turn a chars into an int

4280245
int	chars
this is because most int s don t fit in a chars

4280245
strtol	atoi
you can easily use these by copying each char into a the first element of length 2 array with the second char 0 and using this as input to either atoi sscanf or strtol

4280245
int	chars
best yet would be to change the interface so that your routine doesn t receive an array of chars but an array of int

4280256
innodb	myisam
decide whether you want your table engine search be innodb or myisam

4280302
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in modern browsers firefox google-chrome safari javascript create canvas element to create the font text

4280349
int	boolean
and even if it worked sequentially the first set would return a boolean which won t work against the int that follows

4280353
int	boolean
a b evaluates into a boolean so int int int would evaluate into int boolean and you cannot compare and int and a boolean

4280359
folder	directory
the problem is the .svn folder appears to have been accidentally deleted from users jack mysite.co.uk images png as such triggering the error svn users jack sites mysite.co.uk images png is not a working copy directory .

4280365
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in my appdelegate i create a uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller dynamically

4280430
public	protected
the fact that languages exist which do not have a protected access modifier and even languages that do not have access modifiers at all where all methods are public and those languages are generally considered to be some of the most pure oo languages shows that you do in fact not really need a protected access modifier

4280482
getter	setter
in my humble opinion having getter and setter methods is indicative of poor object-oriented design

4280508
put	get
but as you can see microsoft yet again are being incosiderate a oles in their role of service providers to bother explaining a little more or at least put link somewhere people are worring and get white hairs

4280512
dictionary	map
by map here i mean a programming map with keys and values like map in the stl or dictionary in python

4280512
children	parent
and 2 children each adding an element to the parent map

4280522
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
html link with padding and css style active does not work in google-chrome apple safari opera mozilla firefox

4280547
post	get
when listing post by tag in post-date order you need only get a handful of groups

4280555
google-chrome	firefox
to browsers firefox google-chrome etc a valid mouse click is one which is pressed and released on same element

4280600
minimum	max
the consecutive numbers must be from minimum length of 3 and a max of 5 numbers

4280612
inherited	properties
the only way for a value of a properties there to be assigned to an element inside is if that element has the rule whatever-property-it-is inherited which is buggy in older versions of ie

4280659
for-loop	arrays
is there a way to make this code cleaner by listing the names of the variables in a string arrays and perform the function with a for-loop

4280666
width	height
setting the width and height to 100 might solve your problem but it s difficult to guess

4280671
move	drag
select oldpath folder r-click drag and svn move to new location

4280796
mouseup	mousedown
the real problem here is that a click event only seems to fire if the mousedown event target matches the mouseup event target

4280796
mouseup	mousedown
with hover the text node moves away before you click so the mousedown event target is the anchor tag and the mouseup event is also the anchor tag so the link is followed

4280826
xml-rpc	json-rpc
try xml-rpc or json-rpc

4280851
width	margin
do not put any margin in between them and no border all having same width

4280885
openssl	m2crypto
importing m2crypto version 0.20.2 on python 2.6.5 fails when m2crypto was compiled against a recent openssl versions 0.9.8x or higher on mac os x 10.4.11

4280885
openssl	m2crypto
even though the compilation works against these openssl version m2crypto fails to import because a missing symbol _pem_read_bio_ec_pubkey

4280885
openssl	m2crypto
if i compile m2crypto against openssl version 0.9.7l or 0.9.7m it works just fine

4280927
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
i am loooking to know how to use a symbol table and add subtract multiplying divide and mod a list of elements and declare variables

4280932
onchange	keyup
example form has textbox intended to put an email address into it and onchange keyup events are attached to it

4280932
google-chrome	firefox
when user starts typing an email address if google-chrome or firefox autocomplete box pops up and user clicks one of the options the box gets filled with the value focus stays within the textbox so no change event firing and no key was pressed no keyup event

4280950
minimum	max
and your subset constraint consecutive numbers sets must be from minimum length of 3 and a max of 5 numbers

4280961
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
using the mentioned javascript extensions plugins the big sized table poses no threat to the google-chrome browser taking a few seconds to load however opera firefox and internet explorer have a hard time running the function or end up asking for user interaction to stop the script from running

4280988
int	double	int	chars
for my projects i usually define a lot of aliases for types like unsigned int chars and double as well as std string and others

4281016
uiview	subviews
once the uiview instance is released it wil also send a release message to all its subviews which includes the scrollview

4281022
gridview	sqldatasource
2 textboxes 1 button search 1 gridview 1 sqldatasource

4281022
gridview	sqldatasource
gridview should be hooked up to sqldatasource which in turn should take 2 parameters textbox values

4281050
addclass	removeclass
in the second loop you ll do the same logic you ve got although i d use addclass and removeclass referring back to the saved key row for each cell

4281082
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome

4281085
scheme	racket
i ve been working on learning racket scheme for a while

4281100
awt	swing
this probably won t work in new versions of the jdk that allow awt and swing components to be mixed

4281111
opera	google-chrome
of course i d have to implement the same for opera and google-chrome then assuming there are similar services for them instead of just reusing the user script

4281118
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome 8 firefox 3.6 and ie 9

4281149
udp	tcp
i m sending messages via tcp and udp from clients to the server while the server written in c++

4281163
scheme	racket
i ve been working on learning racket scheme for a while

4281164
udp	tcp
you want to send information via tcp or udp that includes sensitive information email address password and ip

4281164
udp	tcp
instead you should avoid udp because it is very hard to do crypto properly over udp and simply use ssl over tcp

4281186
folder	directory
you cannot open and read a directory use the isfile and isdirectory methods to distinguish between files and folder

4281192
post	get
i suggest you follow the tutorial at in a brand new project and try to get that working if you cannot you can post the specific errors and issues you re running into

yslow	pagespeed
analyze your page using pagespeed or yslow for more information

4281230
children	parent
when i create a new parent transient object and add new children and trying updated evict merge then logs show me this after flush hibernate session

4281230
children	parent
order is good but children doesn t have parent id in insert

4281230
children	parent
everything works fine when parent is persisted in database then children always have a good id

4281230
persistent	transient
any ideas what should i do to get id from transient object from persistent is ok

4281248
children	parent
as long as elements are part of the page flow a parent can t be in front of it s children

4281249
width	height
i m looking to tell the image to have a max height but fill out the width

4281289
codeigniter	cakephp
im just moving over to cakephp from codeigniter and i bet its right in front of me but i can for the love of god not figure out through the manual nor search the internet how to access relationship data

4281371
sorting	grouping
...but it didn t work because after grouping by week they re grouping by week but within the week they re no longer ordered. so you correctly added a sorting grouping thus

4281384
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization process

4281394
single-quotes	double-quotes
i find it interesting that the as.formula conversion made the single-quotes around the letters into double-quotes

uiview	subviews
add an iboutlet propertyfor your custom uiview to the uiviewcontroller and additional outlets for any subviews you wish to access

4281478
hide	show
create a div and show hide it with the message

4281489
queue	fifo
i understand that it s a problem when one of the rx queue runs over hw fifo sw buffer

4281507
public	protected
an interface is used to describe the public contract of your api so it s very strange that you want a a private setter and b a protected implementation

4281507
getter	setter
the private setter at the interface level does not make any sense see mark heaths answer if you want a property with only a getter on the interface

4281507
public	protected
the protected implementation is also weird since by implementing the interface the property is public anyway

4281532
width	height
in that case how would i calculate the initial width and height relative to the column-width of the center column in this layout span-12

4281542
width	height
if you are using em s or ex s as font size units then since it is a value based on height you can assume using a certain ratio that it is almost near the equivalent of a character s width

4281568
vb6	vba
i m not necessarily a c++ programmer but have primarily used win32 functions in the past in vba vb6 and most recently c# projects

4281583

super	implements
i don t know what have you implements in this custom preference but maybe the super class doesn t know how create a proper view to your preference

4281607
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
if you really need a sortedset you can also implement the inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged interfaces yourself

4281632
switching	screens
see iphone sdk how to switching from a login screens to a navigation interface

4281636
put	get
so you have to decide how much effort to put into tracking these changes and how much benefit you will get

4281652
post	get
the action link isn t going to trigger a http post nor will it pass in the values of your form fields just a http get and not passing through any form data - ideally you d use an input submit button to post the data

4281683
caliburn.micro	mef
i m using read learning caliburn.micro and trying to update the template project from mef to windsor which is where i ve come across the issue

4281686
google-chrome	firefox
this works neatly on my google-chrome but you will run into a couple of cross-browser issues for ie and firefox 2

4281738
nsobject	ivar
nsobject has one ivar the isa pointer

4281738
nsobject	ivar	superclass	subclassing	ivar	subclassing
so any subclassing of uiviewcontroller will take up as much memory as is needed to store all those ivars and all ivars of its superclass uiresponder no ivars and nsobject one ivar

4281871
aggregate-functions	sum
i don t see any aggregate-functions count sum avg etc being used in the query you posted

4281874
spweb	spsite
spsite spweb objects would be disposed of at the population stage using statements work well

4281912
for-loop	loops
the second clause in the for-loop in your case is a conditional that is evaluated prior to each entry of loops body

4281926
postgresql	mysql
in my mind this is a generic term which would include any sort of database including relational databases such as mysql oracle postgresql sql server etc hierarchical databases such as ims network example idms object-oriented nosql and others

4281926
postgresql	mysql
examples would be oracle mysql sql server postgresql

4281931
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i succesfully managed to get it in firefox google-chrome opera and even ie6 but fail on ie7 haven t tried ie8+ yet

4281935
width	height
iâ m also thinking of connecting cell height and width with my drawobject size too

4281942
inherited	properties
when you use the shorthand font properties and you leave off some of the values those values aren t inherited they are reset to their initial value

4281960
post	get
when you have posted the request the browser will get a response from the server and then the post is done

4281974
post	get
this was all working fine i can add get any type of post or comment and add get any type of location via one of these two repositories

4281990
ready	each
also it probably doesn t help that you ve nested two document ready handlers within each other

4281994
google-chrome	safari

vb.net	vb6
vb6 has been obsolete for quite some time now and superseded by vb.net

4282207
hash	md5
in my project i have a user table where password is md5 hash and stored as binary 16

4282209
vb.net	vb6
in addition to the syntax vb.net and vb6 share the idea of canned programming where the developer just combines existing building blocks to create small applications very easily

4282224
put	get
when i put a file over any area where there s not text i get a no cursor and the drop event does not get triggered

4282237

4282237
google-chrome	firefox
can someone tell me how to make ie send the same requests as firefox google-chrome

4282252
vb.net	vb6
vb6 has since been superseded by vb.net

4282265
folder	directory
the problem is that javah generates the header file on the directory that the command was executaded which you specified the bin folder

4282300
cpu	hyperthreading
the windows cpu scheduler as of windows xp is supposed to be able to distinguish hyperthreading virtual cores from real cores

4282300
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading was a good idea when were with single cpu systems but is now just a complication that can hurt performance in this multi-core world

4282300
cpu	hyperthreading
instead of completely disabling hyperthreading you can use programs like process lasso free to set default cpu affinities for critical processes so that their threads never get allocated to virtual cpus

4282314
portrait	landscape
when i run that application at the first time in portrait orientation of iphone simulator the custom alert view orientation is landscape but when i rotate the device into landscape left the custom alert view orientation is landscape

4282335
drawimage	putimagedata	drawimage	todataurl	putimagedata	todataurl
in firefox 3.6.8 i was able to workaround the slowness of putimagedata by using todataurl drawimage instead

4282348
drawimage	todataurl
instead i got it to work well using todataurl drawimage instead

4282359
portrait	landscape
in portrait mode instead of using the popover i have another table view thatâ s connected to the same controller that has the info for the view that appears in landscape

4282394
post	get
then you just pass the specification to your post repository and get back the result

4282403
gif	png
you can try to reduce inter-pixel noise to produce larger areas of the same color which will compress in gif png images very nicely

4282403
gif	png
saving a gif png is a lightweight operation

4282441
post	get
you might what to try some workaround use javascript to parse document.cookie and inject session cookie into flash with flashvars then send the session cookie via post get

key-value-coding kvc means accessing a property or value using a string

4282634
noexcept	throw
and for reasons of optimization opportunities nothrow-specifications are not deprecated in the upcoming standard they just don t look like throw any more but are called noexcept

4282643
ssl	https
the client can not be relied up to have a certificate to allow bilateral ssl authentication however unilateral authentication where the client checks to see he is hitting the correct server is possible so https connections can be established

4282643
cas	openam	cas	shibboleth	shibboleth	openam
research has been carried out on sso + saml implementation openam shibboleth cas all seem to provide a too complete solution which caters more for a portal type architecture like cas or from a system where the initial saml identity token is received from another sever altogether and then brought to the system like googles implementation of saml for some of its services

4282651
for-loop	arrays
release it after the for-loop that goes through that arrays where you currently have the second

jar	manifest.mf
use the class-path attribute of the manifest.mf in the ejb and web archives to refer to these jar files

4282732
atomic	compare-and-swap
and then of course for some purposes there are lock-free algorithms or data-structures which make do with just a few atomic instructions such as compare-and-swap but this isn t really a general-purpose replacement for locks

4282739
folder	directory
i navigate to the directory with the shell and it shows the empty folder also it doesnt strip away the clsid

4282741
post	get

hide	show
it goes into this show hide cycle because the mouse is entering leaving

4282843
pthreads	fork	stdout	stderr
i have this program that fork and creates three pthreads pipes for the child s stdin stdout stderr

4282843
stdout	stderr
after forking the child and parent closes the appropriate ends of their respective pipes such that the child can only read from the stdin pipe and only write to the stdout and stderr pipes and the opposite is true of the parent

4282843
stdout	stderr
next the child process closes and dups the child s stdin stdout and stderr to its open pipe ends and then uses execvp to execute the program whose name was passed in as the parent s program arguments

4282860
inherited	subclassing
extensionmethods let you define set of methods to a class without subclassing another benefit over inherited

4282868

so you need systematized serializable deserialization standards for example you serializable your array of person object into json strings and write it to the reponse and you deserialize them back at client side using some json utils

4282952
tax	shipping
if you are sending stuff there are a lot more considerations than just shipping costs you may need to fill in specific tax forms for some countries and depending on what your site is selling you may need special processing for some countries try sending coffee to thailand -- you need to obtain permission from thier ministry of agriculture

4282963
children	parent
you will also want to create an index on the parent column so that you can quickly do a reverse lookup find all children of a given user

4282991
unix	aix
i would like to create tables from some csv files in unix aix and send them as mail message body

4283040
superclass	subclassing
you have overridden mark this with override the function gl10 gl boolean useglutils boolean usemipmap method in the subclassing so each time this method is called on an instance of class b the overriding method will be invoked instead of the one in the superclass

4283042
vbscript	jscript
write wmi script in jscript or vbscript on your choice

4283056
superclass	subclassing
a subclassing simply has all of the instance variables of its superclass at the beginning plus its own at the end

since i started using tortoise svn i don t see it s icons on files and folders and also if i left click on them i don t see svn in context menu still see cvs

4283377
getter	setter
as we know scala generates getter and setter automatically for any public field and make the actual field variable private

4283381
cvs	svn
svn and cvs are both version control systems but are pretty apart and don t mix

4283381
cvs	svn
if you had a connection to a cvs it is not normal to show anything while using svn as is totally another system

there s a couple of ways to evaluate sproutcore versus cappuccino but perhaps some of the immediate caparisons that people look at are the following

4288519
folder	directory
then created a directory structure under the projects folder and copied whole bunch of files in the new directory tree

4288519
folder	directory
now i would like to use tortoisecvs from a windows machine and checkout the reports folder but when i try i get cannot open cvs entries for reading no such file or directory error

4288526
factors	matrix
i currently scale the graphicspath using the matrix object and the scaling works fine but the problem is getting the scale factors

4288557
gif	png
many people don t know about 8-bit png which is usually better than gif in size.

4288557
gif	png
note that png won t support animation like gif does

4288562
gif	png
usually jpeg gif and png

4288562
gif	png
png can support both jpeg and gif styles and has more transparency features but older browsers won t support it

4288573
google-chrome	firefox
this obviously has all the limitations of before no old ie support but it seems to work with ie8 firefox and google-chrome after some very limited testing

4288590
google-chrome	firefox
this obviously has all the limitations of before no old ie support but it seems to work with ie8 firefox and google-chrome after some very limited testing

4288605
onresume	onpause
in other words from running the functions called are onpause onstop onrestart onstart and onresume

4288607
sorting	filtering
instead you can require that your caller do any sorting or filtering and just provide you a prepared ienumerable

4288642
for-loop	loops
like already pointed out elsewhere when you do inside the for-loop you will overwrite the previous value for and putting return into it will end your script unless loops is inside a function

4288699
sse	avx
a fair comparison would evaluate a software implementation that uses best practices best available libraries intel mkl or ipp that used multithreading across multiple cores that used vector simd sse avx ... instead of scalar computation that used tools like profilers to eliminate easily fixed waste and like vtune to understand and tune the cache+memory hierarchy

4288716
fadein	fadeout
can someone figure out why the fadein and fadeout are not working

4288769
calendar	gcal
it does have a gcal function where it will get the data from a calendar feed but the calendar needs to be public to use this function

4288838
put	get
it took me a bit of fiddling to get it to work renaming targetname seemed sensible as i wanted it to apply to several text boxes but i had tried that when i put it in the grid.triggers section

4288959
sdl	xlib
looks like you are confusing window manager sdl and xlib with rendering library opengl

4288959
glut	sdl	sdl	xlib
just pick a window manager sdl glut or xlib if you like a challenge activate double buffer mode and make sure that you got direct rendering

4289008
inherited	properties
i think you can pass an instance of your settings object from one dll into another dll say at app startup and then access the setting using the item properties of this class setting classes are class inherited from applicationsettingsbase

4289024
quicksort	heapsort
as we know the quicksort performance is o n log n in average but the merge- and heapsort performance is o n log n in average too

4289070
hex	binary
if the hex values are from a mainframe then perhaps they are ebcdic extended binary coded decimal interchange code and not hex

4289157
querypath	phpquery
the simplest possible api is querypath or phpquery

4289160
width	height
i tried experimenting with width and height and position and overflow values but couldn t make it work

4289163
castle	common.logging
i would like to use common.logging to remove dependencies on a specific logging framework but i m not sure how to wire up the ilog interface using the castle castle ioc container

4289164
int	chars
my problem with this design is that value column in item_attributes table needs to use varchar data type since the value s data can be int chars varchar

4289164
int	chars
then i would add 3 more columns to item_attributes table int chars varchar

4289164
int	chars
itemid | attributeid | value | int | chars | varchar

4289173
post	get
if i understand the question correctly the only way to get to render the welcome template is via post

4289180
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
and now it looks good in ie6 and 7 also but the funny thing is that the line-height didn t change in google-chrome or firefox or opera or safari

4289196
width	height
my solutions was to use javascript code to get width and height of the page offsetheight and offsetwidth

4289209
mouseup	mousedown
first what it does correctly is fire mouse move observers starting from a mousedown and ending with a mouseup

4289209
titlebar	window	mouseup	mousedown
the particular test observer i have just puts the proper mousedown + mouseup coordinates in the titlebar of the window see code + xaml below

4289209
mousemove	mousedown
now if i release the mousebutton the mousemove event observers start up again and continue until i either generate a new mousedown or press and release alt again

4289209
keydown	keyup
or separate event streams for the keydown and keyup events and i ll figure out the interleaving in my code

4289225
post	get
as a response on a post or get request you get back what the server will send you

4289230
onstart	ondestroy
i ve got 2 buttons which call onstart and ondestroy on a service

4289251
entity-relationship	diagram
some people call data models entity-relationship diagram which is what you appear to be doing

4289251
entity-relationship	entities	entity-relationship	diagram
the entity relation diagram is a schematic of the entities and relations only that s why it is called an entity-relationship diagram and not a data model

4289271
implements	extends
turns out the trick is to extends layoutpanel and implements the acceptsonewidget interface

4289279
fadein	fadeout
at the moment it wont because the fadein wont start until the fadeout has finished

4289315
mouseup	mousedown
i have a little wpf app that draws some dots in a canvas and then tracks mouse moves after a mousedown happens inside any dot until a mouseup on the canvas

4289322
min	max
i m using a wpf slider control i m guessing the silverlight version is similar that s set to horizontal and has a min value of 0 and a max value of 5

4289336
allocator	stl
i ran your code in vs 2010 and i believe that the allocator you see are only visual studio stl debugging facilities as all the 8 bytes allocator are issued from _string_val constructor

4289348
spaces	delimiter
if you only want numbers delimiter by word boundaries spaces period comma you can use b

4289454
public	protected
when a class b inherits extends from class a an instance of class b inherits all the functionality from class a and has access to protected and of course public methods and attributes via parent

4289454
inherited	properties
inherited is often used when classes share certain properties

4289454
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
for example i can have a class person that holds information such as name and subclassing customer partner that inherited the properties name but add some custom functionality

4289463
children	parent
killing the parent process leaves the children alive so the whole process group should be killed

4289489
disk	ram
python s memory limits are determined by how much physical ram and virtual memory disk space your computer and operating system have available

4289503
free	malloc
that s not a problem on macos and linux because the malloc free system is multi-threaded

4289503
free	malloc
my concern is that the malloc free system in 3.4.5 is not multi-threaded

4289505
factors	mean
do some quick stats possibly by compressing lots of images with different jpeg compression factors to find out what the mean compressed size and its standard deviation is for a given quality level

4289512
sproutcore	cappuccino
sproutcore has a better data store api than the one cappuccino has

4289512
sproutcore	cappuccino
sproutcore makes use of bindings better than cappuccino currently does

4289512
sproutcore	cappuccino
for example in sproutcore you can implement incremental loading with bindings and arraycontroller very easily where on the other hand in cappuccino its not as straightforward

4289512
sproutcore	cappuccino
i have found more real world applications written on cappuccino than on sproutcore

4289512
sproutcore	cappuccino
despite the fact that i have no experience in objective-c and i much prefer the pure js syntax i will probably go with cappuccino on my current project and hope sproutcore comes out with a better table view in the future

4289525
int	chars
this converts each pair of hex chars into its int representation

4289539
margin	text-align
remove the absolute positioning add text-align center to the div add a top margin to the span to center it vertically

4289581
postgresql	mysql
i want to move from mysql to postgresql this is not a live site as yet going to launch soon and the schema is all ready in mysql but given the business model i want a better scalable db so to convert mysql to postgresql do i need to do it manually table by table or are there are gui tools i can use or scripts to automate this conversion for tables file values

4289617
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
but then i need to call so it makes sense to call this in the viewdidappear or viewwillappear method

4289617
put	get
but i put it in those methods and find out also via nslog that they never get called

4289622
hash	salt
using salt hash vs reversible encyrption presents its own challenges in implementation but you can be assured that stealing the password list is of little value if properly implemented with a strong algorithm multiple rounds min password standards and random per record salt

4289623
put	get
if i put an onmouseevent on #mapbox it triggers it but i can t get it to work for the #tile divs

4289641
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have noticed behavior where if a parent controller like uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller never get s viewwill didappear called on it it won t call it on the child controllers either

4289641
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
so make sure that in the code where you create the parent controller you call viewwillappear show it then call viewdidappear

4289673
folder	directory
they compile and run fine but however i find that each has its own folder in the war directory after compilation

4289688
hide	show
i ve created a baseactivity there is a member dialog activity context as member and two methods to show and to hide progess dialog

4289857
postgresql	mysql
usually you do this kind of thing in a query but mysql isn t very good with intervals it would be very easy with postgresql

4289879
post	get
i need to while in the artists sample post be able to get from wp the category

4289883
int	boolean
the method in question doesn t really play nicely with our expectations and fails the pols principle of least surprise because you can reasonably expect a boolean value being returned and get an int or a nil

4289901
many-to-many	one-to-many
some of these relationships will be one-to-one service to provider but most will be one-to-many or many-to-many multiple contacts at a company would have the same address

4289939
stringbuilder	stringwriter
i ve also tried calling inplacerenderview to try to get it to write to a stringwriter and the stringwriter also seems to get nothing back - the stringbuilder that returns is also empty

4289968
firefox	safari
there are no http html css or js errors reported by the browser and yet no vml is generated in ie 8 firefox 3.6 or safari 5

4289998
pecl	pear
to install a pear pecl package that is in a state other than stable you have to specify the full spec for the package

4290032
subtract	add
neither add nor subtract nor divison nor multiplication

4290046
google-chrome	firefox
the following needs to remove url portion of string previously returned from .css background-image on an element object in the dom which works perfectly well in firefox but not in google-chrome

4290046
google-chrome	firefox
i discovered this was because google-chrome removes the from url picture.jpg however removing from the regular expression causes firefox to then break because firefox replaced with but still understands the regular expression

4290064
folder	directory
one is under checking dependencies and says unable to create directory var folder zz string of letters more directory more letters. what is wrong with xcode my computer

4290086
width	height
or i want to change the contents in the table and also change the height and width of the table inside form

4290102
int	double
int xgeom sqlite3_rtree_geometry int ncoord double acoord int pres

4290195
punctuation	words
if it s only words without punctuation you can use a bit of regex magic

4290208
put	get
to put this all together you could have javascript upload the file within an iframe and get the result

4290212
post	get
here the get view model is a subset of the post view model so using one view model is fine but if the data for the get and the data for the post differed greatly you could use two different view models such as

4290261
folder	directory
additionally you will probably want to set up library directory to include mysql s lib folder as well so that later on your builds can find the mysql libraries to link against

4290275
yacc	bison
c++ is not parsable using a lalr 1 parser such as the parsers generated by bison and yacc but it is by all means parsable after all people use parsers which have no problem parsing c++ every day

4290277
implements	extends
this example implements actionlistener to extends abstractaction

4290286
hide	show
but the problem im having is on when it slides back it deosnt hide behind the list it still show the panel on the right

4290307
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to get a user interface to work and i need to have it scroll one way if they are using the mouse wheel and another way if they are using the scrollbar and another way if they are using a keyboard

4290347
mvp	presenter
mvp is the model view presenter pattern

4290375
x86	64bit
note that on a 64bit install you should look in program files x86

4290378
subtraction	addition
for example you can overload the addition and subtraction operators from within your something class like this

4290398
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome hence i assume safari too fires only mouse down events

4290413
put	get
type in your e-mail get the encoded version put it in your site and it will display your proper e-mail and bots won t be able to grab it as its just code although it echos out the real result

4290421
for-loop	loops
for this case you may want to use while loops instead of for-loop in python

4290439
yacc	bison
i don t know about vs2010 but i ve used this win32 port of lex yacc flex bison on vs2005 without problems wstreett lex-yacc lex-yacc.html

4290486
put	get
i put this together relatively quickly but hopefully you ll get the idea

4290507
haskell	scheme	haskell	ocaml	ocaml	scheme	erlang	scheme	erlang	ocaml
you ll find beautiful concepts and new ways to program in scheme haskell ocaml clojure erlang etc.

4290534
google-chrome	firefox
this code can be draggable on firefox but cant on google-chrome

4290546
post	get
how can i get access to the post parameters in guice

4290553
gnupg	gpgme
i recently used ruby s gpgme module to do some pretty cool stuff with gnupg

4290604
128bit	64bit
you can configure the processor to connect to either a 64bit or 128bit axi interconnect that provides flexibility to system designs

4290650
nsurl	nsdata
i store the nsdata object like this nsdata imgdata nsdata alloc initwithcontentsofurl nsurl urlwithstring imageurl

4290684
ubuntu	linux
using ubuntu 10.04 with linux 2.6.32-25-generic #45-ubuntu smp sat oct 16 19 52 42 utc 2010 x86_64 gnu linux

4290798
macports	homebrew
i would strongly recommend you try homebrew which is a great replacement for macports

4290843
int	double
yes you can store a 32-bit int number in a double 64-bit floating-point number without precision loss

4290843
int	double
these errors will likely be small enough so that they get rounded away when you cast your double value back to int mdash

4290843
floating-point	integer
how it s done see this document ieee standard 754 floating point numbers by steve hollasch for details on how an integer can be stored as a floating-point value

4290843
floating-point	fractions
to summarise somewhat inaccurately a floating-point value consists of three parts a sign bit a fractions part called the mantissa and an exponent part

4290843
int	double
you can store the int value in the fractions part of the double which is 52 bits wide which is more than wide enough for a 32-bit int

4290844
google-chrome	firefox
this code word-wrap in firefox but in google-chrome i cant word-wrap

4290849
gridview	checkboxlist
i have a gridview which i have a list bound to - i want to be able to allow filter of the data based on multiple checkboxlist

4290870
put	get
all they do is confuse me what do all these mean do and in what order am i suppose to put these in in order to get the stars.jpg to be my background

4290885
button	checkbox
but what i wanna do now is after i have selected one of the animals from the drop down can i display a checkbox button

4290885
button	checkbox
hide it initially and then after i have select one of the animals and click on it the checkbox button will be visible

4290922
int	double
can we perform arithmetic operations on 32-bit int values encoded in double type without precision loose

4290922
int	double
as long as your int value fits in 52 bits of a fractions part called mantissa see all calculations on int values using double will behave completely ok

4290922
int	double
back to int encoded in double - even division operation is precise as long as the result is int value

4290940
for-loop	loops
the problem is that you are doing fopen inside the for-loop so every time loops runs your file gets re-written

4290978
touchesmoved	touchesended
i am using a timer to check that a user is tapping and holding and invalidating the timer in the touchesmoved and touchesended events

4291048
int	chars
as i understand gcc maintains that chars will be byte-aligned and int 4-byte-aligned in a 32-bit environment

4291055
super	implements
in super trivial un-grouped result sets you could theoretically use an index for having but i ve never seen a query optimizer actually implements in this way

4291127
post	get
login.php takes get or post parameters username and password and return true if login successful and false otherwise

4291292
typedef	struct
note that unreal and still need to be in the file that includes your main function not in the header file which should contain only the struct definition and optionally the typedef if you plan to use that in other modules

4291297
post	get
if you can do the request with a get instead of a post you can use jsonp

4291315
getter	setter
create all the object that i need with all getter and setter

4291328
unix	bsd
strings.h comes from the bsd branch in the unix evolution

4291368
jar	war
i am not asking the same question here exclude files from jar or war in eclipse

4291381

i guess i should be able to inherited from the default view and define my properties there as described on stack

4291387
castle	common.logging
create your own facility for common.logging checkout how it s done for the existing logging facility in castle

4291422
daemons	systemd
and how to find out all runned processes including daemons and systemd ones

4291500
instances	transient
if company is transient rather than detached you will get object references an unsaved transient instances error

4291502
for-loop	loops
the for-loop loops over an iterable

4291511
viewdidload	viewwillappear
however one small note the first view controller from tabbar still will be loaded although for a very short time so its viewdidload and viewwillappear will be called after startup

4291528
google-chrome	firefox
that means i can install addons firefox google-chrome and run exes on the machine

4291588
struts	stripes
its not a standard practice or valid as per the j2ee spec i know using most of the java web development frameworks like struts spring mvc stripes you can do this

4291632
getter	setter
in the modelviewinterface i only have the getter methods no setter methods and my model implements this interface

4291668
boost	stl
stl doesn t boost does

4291686
quicksort	mergesort
for single-machine multiple cores example see see correctly multithreaded quicksort or mergesort algo in java

4291688
width	height
i replaced the relative size ont he viewstack with a static width 1200 height 800 size and that did the trick

4291725
openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd
readlink -f is available on gnu linux cygwin etc. netbsd â 4.0 openbsd â 2.2 busybox

4291725
solaris	aix	opensolaris	aix
it is not available unless you ve installed gnu tools and you ve made sure they re in your path on macâ osâ x as of 10.6.4 hp-ux as of 11.22 solaris as of opensolaris 200906 aix as of 7.1

4291785
int	chars
i think it is returning the ascii value of the chars 1 instead of the int value 1

4291841
versioning	upgrade
generally all your changes will probably be custom modules and each module has it s own versioning and set of applicable install upgrade scripts

4291841
versioning	upgrade
whenever you increase the versioning number in a module s config.xml file magento automatically finds and runs the corresponding upgrade script

4291864
int	chars
first of all if your main concern is about storing large amount of chars in a string as far as i know the only constraints for it are the string length method which returns an int so you are limited to max_int chars and you jvm memory which you can change as pointed by martin

4291870
draggable	droppable
i am having an issue related jquery draggable and droppable

4291870
draggable	droppable
container has 30 which are draggable and droppable into selected

4291882

also see secure hash and salt for php passwords

4291956
lan	localhost
the application is now tested on the localhost and accesed by any clients on the same lan

4291971
multiplying	transpose
long story short instead of mat3 gl_modelviewmatrix you have to multiplying by an inverse transpose of that

4291994
gdk	cairo
i have a canvas gdk drawing area which i can draw into it using cairo but i need to save contents of my canvas into a buffer which in my case is a gdk pixbuf

4292020
post	get
data sent from an correct form with the correct action-url - the params get serialized and send via jquery - i encounter an actioncontroller methodnotallowed with the additional info only get and post requests are allowed that re-routes to applicationcontroller#index with method options

4292026
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
have you tried firefox and google-chrome safari

4292055
ninject	spring.net
i have currently looked at spring.net ninject unity and structuremap i tend to have no preference in the configuration whether its xml or fluent interfaces

4292056
folder	directory
i created the indent folder in my .vim directory and pasted an html indentation-plugin into .vim indent

4292085
decltype	auto
is there some vendor-specific type inference mechanism in microsoft visual c++ 2008 similar to the standardized auto or decltype in c++0x

4292219
subclass	abstract-class
or you define a abstract-class handler and let the specific subclass to handle specific type or just pass the event to the chain

4292223
post	get
here is another so post showing how to get data from an sql server into an excel spreadsheet

4292240
post	get
maybe you should post a link to the original source so that you can get more specific advice on how to build it

4292257
mdpi	hdpi
however even after reading through what the android dev guide has to say on the issue i m unsure as to why i should provide different graphics for ldpi mdpi and hdpi

4292261
width	height
use the large image s width and height as your input

4292261
width	height
if your image dimensions do vary a little order them according to their most varying dimension either width or height

4292266
single-quotes	double-quotes
notice the single-quotes enclosing the double-quotes around

4292284
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if they are not in the ie 6.0+ firefox 2+ safari 3.0+ opera 9.0+ google-chrome range frankly i don t care

4292289
nsoperation	nsinvocationoperation
after reading the apple article linked to below i discovered that for my needs right now nsinvocationoperation does exactly what i need and saves me from having to create separate nsoperation objects for each process

4292351
lynxos	irix
hpux irix lynxos 3.0.1 usg-unix-v indicates some sort of unix system

4292368
free	malloc
my program should work 24 7 and it does a lot of malloc -s and free -s

4292392
mdpi	hdpi
but if you provide both a hdpi mdpi and ldpi graphic it would require a bit more space

4292392
mdpi	hdpi
first of all if you anyhow provide a hdpi graphic adding an mdpi and ldpi graphic which both are less than the hdpi graphic in size there is approximately 3 4 6 scaling ratio will increase the size but far from triple it more close to double

4292420
free	malloc
if your program has so many malloc and free calls that you get this kind of fragmentation using mmap for each allocation will be hopelessly slow

4292420
free	malloc
then to confirm that the cause of the problem is fragmentation i would wrap all calls to malloc and free with your own wrapper that increments and decrements a total allocated byte count variable so you can at any point compare the theoretical and actual memory consumption

4292420
free	malloc
each call to malloc or free incurs a good bit of overhead especially in a threaded environment where synchronization locking is necessary

4292427
decimal	ieee
the size of a float is platform-dependent although a maximum of 1.8e308 with a precision of roughly 14 decimal digits is a common value the 64 bit ieee format

4292507
qmainwindow	qvboxlayout
i tried to use the qvboxlayout but it tells me that i cannot change the layout of my qmainwindow since it already has a layout

4292507
qlayout	qwidget
qwidget setlayout attempting to set qlayout on hcgwindow which already has a layout

4292522
mp3	ogg
is there any way to encode it into mp3 ogg etc from flash and then upload it to the server

4292534
folder	directory
now all i want to do is to svn update my working directory only for the files in folder but not its subfolders

4292534
folder	directory
be aware that on the svn server repository folder now contains new files file3 file4 that i want to see in the working directory after the svn update

4292535
ubuntu	linux
as far as i can see there are only few viable as opposed to 5 ways to screencast your linux desktop alternatives for desktop capture in linux ubuntu note i typically use a laptop as target for desktop capturing

4292539
websphere	ibm
so i am reaching out to the group to get a feel as to is using ibm websphere portal worth the money - roi

4292539
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere portal otb will handle the basic security - user log in and the portlets that they can see spring security can do the same thing

websphere	ibm
ibm websphere portal otb can handle the theming or re-skinning the portlets based on what company the user is associated with

4292539
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere portal can provide re-use of portlets not sure i buy this since so far each customer has demanded their own screen layouts along with the data collected and how it is displayed

4292539
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere portal can help with time to market - that is start with a base reference implementation and then show them what can be changed in a 45 - 60 day turn around

gridview	objectdatasource
i am using a gridview and a objectdatasource

4292565
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
uinavigationcontroller is a subclassing of the standard uiviewcontroller class so it inherited the view properties of uiviewcontroller

quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	heapsort	mergesort	heapsort
worst case for quicksort is actually worse than heapsort and mergesort but quicksort is faster on average

4292700
quicksort	heapsort
a quote that summarizes the quicksort vs merge heapsort

4292700
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is implemented well it is typically 2-3 times faster than mergesort or

4292709
setinterval	settimeout
however you can use setinterval or settimeout to watch for element changes and use it to react accordingly

4292736
draggable	droppable
i would suggest to use sortables because its somehow the same like draggable and droppable on both div s

4292804
int	chars
the fgetc function shall obtain the next byte as an unsigned chars converted to an int

4292804
int	chars
as long as you store the return value in an int and not a chars it is sufficient to check for eof because it is guaranteed not to represent a valid chars value

4292830
draggable	droppable
i have some draggable and droppable divs that clone themselves when they are dragged over to there container

4292830
draggable	droppable
i am saving the position of the div s in a database however if i insert the exact same html dynamicly and reload the page the div is no longer draggable droppable etc

4292830
draggable	droppable
so my question how can i enable the dynamicly inserted div s to be draggable droppable again

4292873
post	put
when you use the local form rails will post the data but add the extra _method field to emulate a put

4292873
post	put
don t know if you are using jquery-rails but this takes care of setting the _method parameter and the put post verb translation for you in your ajax calls

4292898
hide	show
if i add a check to the site.master to show hide a menu item based on role there are no roles listed for the user anymore

4292982
hash	salt
the db s key would be a hash of the password salt with a nonce

4293004
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
works great in safari firefox and google-chrome but displays freak out boxes on ie8

4293041
hash	md5
another trick is to generate a md5 hash for your password

4293041
hash	md5
and for long phrases evolve your md5 hash by combining each 16-byte block with the previous hash -- making the entire xor key random and non-repetitive

4293142
versioning	upgrade
you can always have your versioning upgrade if something will feel more right to you at later time

4293142
versioning	upgrade
don t forget to upgrade versioning versioning also

4293151

4293197
rss	feed
i get this error trying to fetch my rss feed using wordpress syndication feedwordpress

4293265
typedef	struct
a matter of style really but you typedef a lot of struct to nice human-readable names and yet consequently add the struct keyword anyway

4293265
calloc	malloc
if you use calloc instead of malloc you get zeroed memory

4293280
alloca	malloc
a place where alloca is especially dangerous than malloc is the kernel - kernel of a typical operating system has a fixed sized stack space hard-coded into one of its header

4293283
x86	mips
just remember that assemblers are specific to their platforms and some of the concepts that apply to x86 don t apply to other platforms such as mips or ppc

4293288
getter	setter
so far i ve found the only way to do this is to explicitely ask for a getter setter of the object while it is still attached to the session ie

4293359
client-side	server-side
i am wondering here is that is it a bad idea to implement a legal payment system using javascript on the client-side and php on the server-side

4293380
profiling	debugging
aall java profiling i know have that ability since the java debugging interface jvmti is inherently network-capable

4293416
int	double
alternatively calculate everything in cents since an ieee double can accurately represent int up to 53 bits in length which is enough to hold even the entire us sovereign debt for at least another 10 years probably

4293535
dictionary	map
most dynamic languages provide a built-in hashtable or dictionary or map or table or whatever you want to call it

4293562
nsmutablestring	nsstring
in fact this is the entire point of using nsmutablestring instead of nsstring

4293582
children	parent
for example in a min heap if the parent node was 10 and its children was 8 and 3 what would be the better node to swap with

4293619
perforce	cvs
but thankfully it is supposed to work out-of-the-box with subversion cvs or even perforce -- not just visual source safe -- so there s a good chance you wouldn t have to write any perl yourself

4293630
nstimer	nsrunloop
it was created because of a memory cycle between nsrunloop and nstimer by design

4293664
client-side	server-side
you can t detect this server-side you can however present a message client-side with the tag like this

4293676
allocator	stl
the leak you are seeing is not actually a leak but pre-allocation which is basically where the crt or stl keeps around allocated memory incase you need it again for faster allocator time

4293736
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari firefox and ie display render fonts differently

4293741
postgresql	mysql
i only know of postgresql and mysql

4293748
gif	png
however they ve become less concerned with bandwidth over the past couple years as they ve increased their server capacity to god-like proportions hence the larger logo files for example their old logo here is a roughly 8.5kb gif file that looks like crap and their current one is a 25+kb png so i suspect they ll eventually come up with a more standards compliant and cleaner home page

4293760
google-chrome	firefox
ok this code works in firefox but doesn t work in ie and google-chrome

4293765
jquery	simplemodal
i have the login view showing up in a modal dialog using jquery simplemodal and when the user fails login - it works fine - the error goes back to the modal

jquery	scriptaculous
it also has full support for html css and javascript including code completion and integrated documentation for popular framworks like prototype scriptaculous or jquery

4293789
client-side	server-side
well netbeans comes with a client-side monitor to examine http messages and an ajax-ready environment to use with server-side scripting language you prefer

4293807
rss	feed
is it in a separate thread or do you just want something to happen periodically polling an rss feed or something

4293817
ssl	https
i m trying to create a link to a page that requires ssl and the routes are properly set up to require it to be https but i can t figure out how to get link_to to behave properly

4293861
portrait	landscape
as portrait not landscape

4293876
inherited	base-class
maybe let them all inherited one base-class

4293916
nsstring	nsdata
like nsstring nsarray and similar core classes nsdata is a class cluster instead of single class

4293922
width	height
elements have height and width properties that are automatically populated by the browser when it determines the dimensions of an image

4293922
width	height
accessing the height and width properties directly should allow your code to work correctly

4293961
freebsd	linux
posix does not provide a solution to this but at least linux and freebsd do if reads start failing open the fifo again while keeping the original descriptor open

4293961
freebsd	linux
this works because in linux and freebsd the hangup state is local to a particular open file description while in posix it is global to the fifo

4293979
int	double
they basically let you implement a generic class for any type and then when you initialise a variable of this class you specify what type string int double etc. it applies its stuff to

4293986
nsdateformatter	nsnumberformatter
allocating nsdateformatter or nsnumberformatter is relatively slow and

4294002
nsmutablestring	nsstring
an nsmutablestring is an nsstring so your code is perfectly correct except for some syntax errors you missed the on each nsstring and the on the if statement

4294022
division	modulo
you can use the modulo which returns the remainder after division

4294026
shadowing	named
i refuse to use the named dict since it shadows a builtin and shadowing builtins is stupid

4294031
chunked	transfer-encoding
seems to be official cassini does not support transfer-encoding chunked requests

4294051
fgets	strlen
if the strings are really humongous like 42 mega bytes worth you may be better off reading character by character and keeping count with num_chars than using fgets first and strlen later

4294070
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the code below should work with firefox and opera and google-chrome

4294099
inherited	properties
i ve worked with the camera before in smaller projects but what i d like to do this time around is write some generic attachable code and have each of these entities properties apartment and tenant inherited from the attachable class to have all of the necessary code out of the box

4294106
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
to populate your picker use pickerview titleforrow forcomponent from uipickerviewdelegate and numberofcomponentsinpickerview from uipickerviewdatasource

4294140
subtract	add
its a big plus if he can count add subtract and think in terms of hex instead of decimal

4294170
int	double
is for strings and pointers i and d are for int and f is used for floats and double

4294172
put	get
what will they want to learn from it and how much effort are they prepared to put in to get that information

4294255
ddms	adb
try to call reset adb menu item from ddms devices tab

4294282
put	get
i tried to put the xml file in the project direction java src pachage and inside the pachage of servlets but all of tese tries get the same result

4294287
button	checkbox
ok not just checkbox but also radio button

4294293
jar	war
if you include it in your jar war file you should be able to load it easily with class.getresourceasstream or classloader.getresourceasstream

4294303
np-hard	np-complete
it is not easier than the np-complete problem since it can be reduced to it in polynomial time which makes the problem np-hard

4294318
getter	setter
i needed to change the propety getter setter to return the correct enum type

4294338
put	get
to get rid of empty words we can put a filter on the explode so that empty entries are removed

4294338
explode	implode
the new words are added all at once by taking the list in and doing the opposite of explode which broke a line down in to individual words we implode the list of words in to a single piece of text each word separated with a newline n

4294348
button	checkbox
wouldn t a drop-down menu work to replace many checkbox radio button

4294348
post	get
in that case could you post some idea of what information you re trying to get from the user

4294349
profiler	yourkit	yourkit	jprofiler
i don t know netbeans but i know both yourkit profiler and jprofiler to be very powerful tools for these kinds of analyses

4294355
keydown	keyup
after switching to fullscreen not working keydown and keyup

4294375
equals	gethashcode
i need to implement equals and gethashcode for the instrumenttest class

4294375
equals	gethashcode
note if you define an iset of composite elements it is very important to implement equals and gethashcode correctly

4294430
nsstring	nsdata
i need to store some raw bytes from nsdata object into an nsstring basically a null encoding but i am not sure how to do this

4294433
width	height
so boundingrect returns a rectf that has a width and height of 11px although width and height claim it s 10 for both

4294435
sat	np-complete
this involves getting a known np-complete problem like sat the set of boolean expressions in the form

4294435
sat	np-complete
that is given some input x for sat or whatever np-complete problem you are using create some input y for your problem such that x is in sat if and only if y is in your problem

4294435
np-hard	np-complete
footnote in step 2 prove it is np-hard reducing another np-hard not necessarily np-complete problem to the current problem will do since np-complete problems are a subset of np-hard problems that are also in np

4294439
put	get
it s hard work - but if you re willing to put the effort in you will really get a tremendous amount out of it

4294468
hide	show
to show and some reason hide the title words

4294470
hash	md5
note that the resulting md5 hash of using this won t be the same as your sample code because it is at least partially independent of the particular image file format used to save the image

4294470
hash	md5
to use it you would need to store the md5 hash of the image data somewhere independent of any image file where it could be retrieved when needed -- as opposed to generating it by reading the entire file into memory as binary data like the code in your question does

4294486
aggregate-functions	sum
excluding the grouped column category_id and the evaluated columns columns returning results of aggregate-functions like sum max etc

4294498
maven	pom.xml
when i moved the dependencies from the parent pom.xml to the child s they stopped being put on the eclipse build path and so now none of the files will compile in eclipse though it did appear maven was working from the command line. and ideas what i might be doing wrong or tips for creating multi-module projects in eclipse

4294499
wav	caf
you can convert a wav to caf with the built in terminal utility

4294569
width	height
it has width and height 3 and the bottom left corner is at 3 3 is that right

4294578
post	get
all i would need to do to exploit this is to get a user to click a form that sends a tainted q post variable

4294578
post	get
if i can get a user to click that thinking that he s clicking some innocent link then i can post arbitrary data to the search that then gets echoed into his page and i can hijack his session or do whatever other nasty things i want

4294578
post	get
post data isn t inherently more secure than get data

4294614
put	get
i ve tried to do similar things before and i m starting the get the idea that you can t put expressions after an as statement

4294643
cos	sqrt
cos alpha x1 x2 + y1 y2 sqrt x1 x1 + y1 y1 sqrt x2 x2 + y2 y2

4294651
qtcpsocket	qtcpserver
we are using qt the client has a qtcpsocket and the server a qtcpserver and a pointer to a qtcpsocket

4294726
.htaccess	httpd.conf
your .htaccess or httpd.conf

4294753
super	self
super and self don t work here

4294758
for-loop	loops
i ve got a question about calculating big o running times for a series of loops that are nested in an outer for-loop

4294760
filtering	grouping
however linq is more about grouping filtering and converting data

4294827
post	get
ive tried using curl as well as file_get_contents so both as post and get requests

4294836
post	get
how stackoverflow doing this while the form is post not get

4294854
wordpress	joomla
i am new to joomla and don t have any developer experience with it i use wordpress

4294855
post	get
examine the form s returned get or post values

4294862
post	get
then otherwise it won t handle the requests coming from link_to as it is a get request not post

4294879
implements	extends
those lines would work fine inside an activity but it doesn t to complain as it is a thread it doesn t know about the activity class because it doesn t extends it but implements runnable

4294888
getter	setter
i would like to know the way to declare callback to reach its instance s setter or getter

4294897
put	get
put all the above together and you ll get something you can use like this

4294897
inherited	properties
if you do this then your component will inherited the mxmlcontent properties described above

4294901
getter	setter
if you declared a property for your instance variable and then synthesized it in your implementation file your getter and setter are automatically created for you

4294946
factors	matrix	factors	mean
scaling a vector in 3d space using a matrix would mean putting the scaling factors on the diagonal of the matrix

4294954
postgresql	mysql
based on selection variable my script chooses a sub routine for either sqlite mysql or postgresql

4294954
postgresql	mysql
but considering the mysql vars have nothing to do with postgresql or sqlite i wanted to set private vars in the sub routines

4294958
scheme	racket
racket emphasizes its large libraries as batteries included while ikarus scheme touts itself as compiling fast code

4294958
scheme	racket
if you re just learning scheme racket is a good choice with its friendly interface and specific environments for various scheme books

4294958
r5rs	r6rs
also you probably don t need to find a r6rs implementation when most implementations target r5rs and most textbooks were written for r5rs and earlier

4294995
hash	md5
md5 makes only one pass over the data so if two prefixes with the same hash can be constructed a common suffix can be added to both to make the collision more likely to be accepted as valid data by the application using it

4294996
uiview	calayer
attached to my avplayer there is a calayer that is used to display video on my uiview

4295013
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
this main layer handles touch events touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended

4295014
ant	maven
i m using ant but from the looks of it this was the approach maven took everything under src or test

4295052
getter	setter
it is supposed to be more efficient for the jpa provider to access the field directly rather than via getter and setter

4295073
post	get
i get post with regardless or vice-versa if in the if statement

4295080
post	get
based on your comments try the following sql where clauses and see if you get the correct post

4295089
hash	md5
md5 is a 128-bit hash so there are 2 128 possible hash

4295089
hash	md5
the attacks on md5 allow collisions to be found with significantly less than 2 64 hash and significantly less than 128 x 2 64 bits of storage

4295107
performselector	delegation
try casting the delegation to its class type first then invoke performselector withobject afterdelay

4295107
performselector	delegation
assuming that your delegation is of type id you need to tell the runtime that the object in fact does inherit from nsobject where the performselector withobject afterdelay method is defined by casting it to it s class type

4295115
aptitude	phpize
if you get an error saying the system canâ t find phpize then you may need to install the php dev package this is how you do if your os has aptitude you might need to use some other method to install the php dev packaes â

4295122
backgrounding	multitasking
it all works fine when the app is in the foreground or when the app is in the backgrounding but not completely closed from multitasking bar

4295152
toupper	uppercase
if you don t care about the case of the character being read that is s and s will do the same thing you can convert selection to uppercase before your if -block or switch -block using toupper

4295174
subtract	add
initially you set position and orientation both to 0 then add or subtract from position when a key is pressed and add or subtract from orientation.x and orientation.y when the mouse is moved.

4295177
udp	tcp
but yeah is there any way to broadcast via tcp like you can via udp

4295206
rtos	ecos
otoh rather than redo everything it may be useful to start with an embedded rtos such as ecos or l4 to draw some features from

4295224
post	get
i was told that after if i remove the protocols such as http get and http post from my web.config it should work

4295225
integer	unsigned	unsigned	short
in short size_t is never negative and it maximizes performance because it s typedef d to be the unsigned integer type that s big enough -- but not too big -- to represent the size of the largest possible object on the target platform

4295225
integer	unsigned
also because size_t is unsigned you can store numbers that are roughly twice as big as in the corresponding signed type because we can use the sign bit to represent magnitude like all the other bits in the unsigned integer

4295225
integer	unsigned
according to this fantastic article type size_t is a typedef that s an alias for some unsigned integer type typically unsigned int or unsigned long but possibly even unsigned long long

4295225
integer	unsigned
each standard c implementation is supposed to choose the unsigned integer that s big enough--but no bigger than needed--to represent the size of the largest possible object on the target platform.

4295293
subtraction	addition
the code below is a chunk from actual code of calculator.what it does is that user presses a number on the calculator then as he presses + the number on the text field gets stored and then he presses the next number and it gets stored when he presses .then in if condition the addition function is performed.now i want both addition and subtraction running at one time that is after doing addition user wants to do subtraction then how will i do it

4295357
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
then you ll be able to write it to an objectoutputstream and read from an objectinputstream

4295387
lxml	beautifulsoup
it s generally accepted that lxml is faster than beautifulsoup ref

4295400
g++	gcc
you need to compile with g++ not gcc

4295460
width	height
the problem is that when the user clicks the button the panel content shows but it resizes that portion of the screen to be the full width and height of the screen so other elements inside the table view are now shifted way off of the screen

4295492
xrange	enumerate
this should be near optimal with minimal memory usage thanks to the use of the enumerate and xrange generators

4295500
postgresql	mysql
php has support for connecting to oracle mysql postgresql ms-sql and various others

4295504
google-chrome	safari
in general it might take a bit more logic since for example the string safari is found in the user-agents provided by other browsers than safari including google-chrome

4295530
put	get
for my first couple of apps i just put in some random number to get past to the next screen

4295588
hex	binary	integer	unsigned
so -1 in a 16-bit integer which has the highest unsigned value of 65535 would be 65536-1 65535 0xffff in hex or 1111 1111 1111 1111 in binary

4295594
hide	show	mousehover	mouseleave
basically create a tooltip on your form give that to your control via a property show the tooltip when your control received a mousehover event and hide the tooltip when you receive a mouseleave event

4295630
put	get
just in your situation you should use the get and put methods for string and for integer

4295757
super	self
super foo self .__getattribute__ attr binds the __getattribute__ method of the nearest superclass formally the next class in the class s method resolution order or mro to the current object self and then calls it and lets that do the work

4295763
next	except
this will result in contents_chopped pointing to the same string except the first char will be the next after n

4295776
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
it is interesting to note that nsmanagedobject is effectively a root class in that it does some pretty seriously custom stuff but it is a subclass of nsobject so subclasses of nsmanagedobject are inter-operable with the rest of the system

4295800
switching	screens
this was the only way i could guarantee it would work if the program switching full screens to from windowed

4295806
min	max
q3 q4 note that the elements passed to min and max are already sorted

4295806
min	max
is it possible for me to make this hint to min and max so that it does not instantiate the whole list as a temporary and then iterate through the whole list to locate the min or max element

4295806
min	max
if not is there a module or custom function in existence that does not instantiate the whole list but given that the list passed to it is sorted returns the min or max element while inspecting the least number of elements

4295830
put	get
again it s really depend on what you really want to know about the user and how much fiction you are will to put in to the sign up process to get these info

4295997
hide	show
suppose i want to show hide elements based on values of properties from datacontext how can i acheive it

4295997
hide	show
in xaml i want to show hide elements based on the mode

4296015
wordpress	joomla
it is very easy to use having example for many programming languages as well as some modules for different content management systems wordpress drupal joomla

4296081
width	height
if u want to change height and width

4296110
fputcsv	fgetcsv
call fgetcsv to read the data from the file into an array and fputcsv to write one of these arrays modified if required to a csv file

4296121
shadowing	named
note that naming a local variable strlen thus shadowing the standard function of that named is going to more than a little confusing for someone who looks at your code later

4296174
width	height
do the same for location height width etc or any other property that you feel that will change on the original item

4296204
quicksort	bubble-sort
you may be able to do better than 13 by just hard-coding the tests that a common sort algorithm - but not an o n 2 algorithm such as bubble-sort or even i suspect quicksort

4296245
folder	directory
the non-default layouts go inside a folder named after the module so my directory structure looks like this

4296324
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

4296391
fast-forward	merge
that will make any subsequent merge after the initial rebase a fast-forward one

4296402
express	node.js
if you use express high-performance high-class web development for node.js you can do this

serializable	deserialization
a good way to speed up the serializable deserialization process would be to replace the internal default php serializable with something like igbinary

4296448
memcached	apc
there are a couple of notes about that in theses slides presented by ilia alshanetsky a couple of weeks ago at the forum php 2010 in paris apc memcached the high performance duo

4296471
rss	feed
the problem i have is that site with the rss feed of which i want to get images is of a type img src http......

4296503
hide	show
using tutorials i have managed to hide text and show it as captions but what i really want to do is show the full text and just highlight the current part

4296546
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in all browsers i tested in windows platform firefox opera safari google-chrome ie8 works fine but in internet explorer 7 it doesn t work

4296565
unsigned	short
how does borland cast short to unsigned int

4296565
unsigned	short
why i dont get 57000 in cast 1 short to unsigned int is there no implicit cast to unsigned short before the cast to unsigned int

4296606
symfony	lithium
however you might want to explore symfony 2 and lithium cake 3

4296606
symfony	lithium
i have done less with lithium but certainly in symfony 2 everything well nearly everything is a plugin making the framework modular and much easier to manage

4296606
symfony	lithium
neither symfony 2 or lithium are production ready at present

4296606
symfony	lithium
symfony is aiming at march 2011 not clear on lithium s 1 dot oh date

4296640
integer	unsigned
what you get stored is the integer -8536 which converted to an int and then to an unsigned int is 4294958760

4296640
unsigned	short
you need to either declare snum as an unsigned short so it can store the value you want or convert it to an int instead of an unsigned int

4296656
button	checkbox
then when the user wants to send mail he presses a button and than i need to access the checkbox and i m having problems with this the sub doesn t know the checkbox object

4296658
postgresql	mysql
i m creating a tiny activerecord library using pdo and i m planning to support mysql sqlite and postgresql

4296682
interpolation	splines
otherwise any decent spreadsheet software should be able to do splines interpolation and give you a nice smooth graph

4296731
cos	sin
when it switches from clockwise to anti clockwise it uses the same value in the sin and cos which is timer 1.5 .this causes the anti clockwise motion to begin from a different position on my planet

4296733
unsigned	short
no there is no implicit cast to unsigned short before the cast to unsigned int

4296733
unsigned	short
in cast 2 you first convert using an explicit cast from short -8536 to unsigned short 57000 since that is the same bit pattern as -8536 but interpreted as an unsigned number and then from unsigned short to unsigned int 57000

4296733
unsigned	short
in cast 1 you convert directly from short -8536 to unsigned int

4296740
free	malloc
what free does is not free the memory held by the pointer completely but actually makes it available for later use if we call a malloc after calling free

4296740
free	malloc
an evidence to this is you will be able to access the memory location after calling free and before setting the pointer to null assuming you haven t already called malloc

4296741
post	get
other possibility is to use post method instead of get

4296760
post	get	post	put	put	get
i think it s better to put them in the body post then the url get

4296777
matplotlib	scipy
numpy is a matplotlib dependency so you can import those two functions from there if you don t have scipy installed

4296805
client-side	server-side
you can t for instance do any scripting of the client s browser with any server-side language which is why you see so much client-side code around

4296822
post	get
but when i get to the post method for home index my selectlists and selectlistitems are null whereas the string for containing the button info contains the correct data

4296830
jobs	cron
is it possible to use the secure data connector sdc to access internal resources in tasks cron jobs on the google appengine

4296835
width	height
i could change the width height and the position of the dialog using getwindow .setattributes params

4296859
junit	mockito
of course if you have programmed to an interface and are planning to write junit tests for your code you can look into a mocking library like mockito to do that job for you though the job of creating the data would yours to lookout for

4296939
int	chars
is there any other kind of java implementation for pipedreaders writers that allows me to handle other kinds of data instead of chars int

4296945
uiview	subviews
then you would animate a uiview to replicate the opening of the folder tell the view to scale vertically or similar add the subviews title field current objects inside the folder etc -- then when you release the view being panned you would animate it to scale down into the folder

4296961
google-chrome	firefox
i have found that without exception firefox and google-chrome just don t render the font well regardless of format

4296965
getter	setter
getter and setter constructor destructor if possible

4296991
x86	mips
these may very different between x86 and mips

4297007
google-chrome	firefox
is it really compatible with firefox and google-chrome browsers or i will find my self in deep troubles

4297021
getter	setter
those are the usual setter and getter

4297027
implements	extends
for one it s usually preferable to implements runnable rather than extends thread but regardless i don t think that you ll want to have your filters or pipes extends thread or implements runnable but rather have each pipe be used in a new thread

4297035
put	get
but the default visibility for a class what you naturally get is private and particularly if i have inline-style methods i generally put any private data in front

4297084
aggregate-functions	sum
using sum which is an aggregate-functions within your derived table is going to give you exactely one row back - unless you start to group by another column

4297094
put	get
on all the videos on ted there is a widget thing with an inputfield that says tweet this we ll add the url later you put stuff in a box it get s a tiny-url and get s pushed to facebook

4297097
int	chars
int 5 does not do what you think it does it specifies an int field with a display width of 5 digits numbers shorter than 5 digits will be padded with space chars

4297111
persistent	transient	ivar	subclassing
the standard solution is to add the ivar which holds transient data which does not persistent in the database in the subclassing representing the entity directly as in

4297132
post	get
if i were you i will issue a get access using a browser to the exact url you are issuing your post request and see what you get

4297163
int	chars
you are comparing a signed chars with the value -86 256-0xaa to an int with the value 170 0xaa

4297176
iboutlet	ibaction
you ll need to add the mediaplayer framework to your project in xcode and open up mainwindow.xib in interface builder to add the uiview and uibutton iboutlet and hookup the ibaction to the uibutton

4297196
mouseover	mouseenter
in addition to this you should as mentioned by others use mouseenter instead of mouseover because the latter will fire when you hover over any element with the one you specify whereas the latter only fires once per element or children

4297235
spweb	spsite
you are trying to create a new site spweb using the createsite method which creates site collections spsite not sites

4297264
width	height
but i can t set the height of a row only width of a column

4297271
for-loop	loops
1 to explain what i meant by moving the line outside the while loops i m also changing to the more suitable for-loop at the same time

4297280
public	protected
... they are defined by using one of the keywords public protected or private followed by a normal variable declaration

4297288
getter	setter
i am not sure if i understand your question correctly but if you are trying to get some code executed every time the setter or getter is invoked there are basically two ways to do that

4297288
getter	setter
1 you can overwrite the synthesized getter and or setter like this

4297288
getter	setter
this of course only runs you code when the setter is invoked not the getter

4297326
addition	multiplication
this uses addition instead of multiplication to traverse the array

4297335
for-loop	loops
if you use a while or repeat loops instead of a for-loop the you can include another conjunct in your stopping condition that you set mid-loop

4297342
zoo	chron	zoo	xts	xts	chron
this is clearly documented --- xts and zoo objects are formed by supplying two arguments a vector or matrix carrying data and date posixct chron .

4297352
hide	show
an easy way out would be to simply hide your label in the applicationwillresignactive method of your app delegate and then update and show it again in your applicationwillenterforeground method

4297371
post	get
i am using the post redirect get pattern in my application

4297371
post	get
in case i want to display a message at the get stage i can store it as as session variable at the post stage when it is decided what message should be displayed for example

4297378
int	boolean
here are some problems findbugs finds which pmd doesn t equals method fails on subtypes clone method may return null reference comparison of boolean values impossible cast 32bit int shifted by an amount not in the range of 0-31 a collection which contains itself equals method always returns true an infinite loop etc

4297436
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
in this case viewdidappear behaves more like viewwillappear ..

4297456
unsigned	short
unless mentioned explicitely as unsigned both int and short are signed

4297459
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and opera have this problem except ie6

4297470
ferret	sphinx	xapian	sunspot
seems to me as if most of the known methods sunspot sphinx ferret xapian arenâ t yet ready for rails 3

4297470
xapian	sunspot
after some reading iâ m almost sure that iâ d like to use sunspot or xapian

4297485
inherited	properties
however instead of placing the ui in the vm where properties would propagate several layers manually i used an attached properties named showadvanced which propagates down via properties inherited

4297485
hide	show
you can t show them for one and hide them for another

4297501
folder	directory
i don t have include directory in my www folder

4297538
getter	setter
here is a pretty light way to define a class close to your c# definition it has a default constructor but uses public fields instead of getter and setter which might be a problem i don t know

4297542
int	chars
so the first line defines a general template the next group of lines specializes it for the type form type1 type2 which are parameterized on two types hence the specialization has a non-empty template parameter list and the main instantiates the template for the concrete type chars int a function taking an int and returning a chars

4297545
int	chars
the instantiation matches the specialization which extracts the component types chars and int of the compound type a function chars int as type1 and type2

4297560
jobs	cron
for people who are using shared hosting like me go look for cron jobs in your control panel and then set your automated task there

4297563
int	chars
type1 is chars and type2 is int

4297563
int	chars
for that reason obj var1 is member variable of type chars and obj var2 is member variable of type int

4297601
innodb	myisam
most popular storage engines are myisam and innodb

4297620
portrait	landscape
for example if they are landscape images they are ok but if they are portrait they are rotated 90 degrees and again shown as landscape

4297635
jquery	scriptaculous
you can achieve something similar using css and just about any library whether extjs or jquery + jquery ui prototype + scriptaculous yui closure or any of several others or even without a library if you want to work unnecessarily hard

4297666
width	height
the main image that the markers and hitboxes get overlaid on is 50 width and height of the page

4297670
width	height
the main image that the markers and hitboxes get overlaid on is 50 width and height of the page

4297670
width	height
this means you have to find out what the actual width height of the image is at runtime via javascript and then adjust the pixel values you use for absolutely positioning everything else to account for that

4297670
width	height
if you can t i d recommend using a library like jquery prototype yui closure or any of several others for discovering the actual computed width and height of the image

4297673
post	get
you ll need to query post to get the first child of the post in question

4297678
client-side	server-side
node.js is server side javascript that can run your client-side code on the server-side

4297678
client-side	server-side
you client-side code will run on server-side with little or no modification as per node.js folks

4297678
client-side	server-side
when you run your client-side ajax code on server-side and that ajax code contains a get request the node.js framework loads the requested data from the file system a file or db or xml or whatever and returns the data set normally as if the request actually came from a client-side call

4297685
inline	inlining
closure compiler is inlining a function but the code size is smaller if that function is not inline i only care about code size - this is for js1k

4297738
post	get
is there any way i could get the value of a html text field without using get or post or request

4297787
versioning	upgrade
in the case of a library the versioning number tells you about the level of compatibility between two releases and thus how difficult an upgrade will be

4297796
debian-based	ubuntu
i think it is debian-based so if you are used to ubuntu it should be an easy transition

4297811
haskell	scheme
in implementation terms tail recursion might cause a stack overflow where iteration would work but 1 some languages guarantee this will not happen scheme haskell and 2 many compilers will handle this as an optimisation anyway gcc for c or c++

4297814
put	get
create a resource model such that your applications can put and get messages where the uri contains the destination node and add a parameter for a reply address

4297828
width	height
you can also put in the linear layouts fill parent on both height and width and put layout weight to first 1 to second 0.5 and third 1 and it will put them in the percentage of height you show us in the picture..

4297843
udp	tcp
you run it on both sides of the connection and it can measure bandwidth either way with tcp or udp and has many tweakable parameters

4297851
oncreate	onstart
my app goes through the regular flow oncreate onstart and onresume

4297851
oncreate	onstart	oncreate	ondestroy	onstart	ondestroy
but immediately after ondestroy is called oncreate onstart and onresume are called restarting the app even though the screen is blank

4297873
serializable	deserialization
i m trying to do custom serializable deserialization of an object as well as compressing decompressing the serializable data with deflatestreams

4297882
subtraction	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
in this case jcomeau_ictx s won t work because it can only deal with subtraction not multiplication and division and these stack-based solutions are overkill

4297892
int	boolean
even just string boolean datetime and int would be fine

4297929
int	double
if the object returned was not an int if it is a float double byte etc it was boxed to an object and can only be cast back to its original type

4297962
stdout	stderr
2 1 will redirect stderr to stdout

4297965
rss	feed
it loads two rss feed and on each rss feed it contains two items with a title an image and a link

4297965
rss	feed
so two rss feed and 4 images downloading

4297965
rss	feed
so two asynctasks objects are called to load two rss feed and 4 asynctasks to load 4 images

4297967
versioning	upgrade
in the case of a library the versioning number tells you about the level of compatibility between two releases and thus how difficult an upgrade will be

4297975
post	put
post for create put for update

4297977
getter	setter
dot notation in objective-c is short-hand for calling an objects getter setter methods

4297993
accessor	properties
all of the properties of the item are protected and i ve created accessor and mutators for them

4297996
tapestry	wicket
since a jsp is just a servlet in disguise it s always possible to write web applications without jsp and there are options using frameworks like wicket and tapestry or template engines like velocity to make java web application development without jsp pretty easy

4298000
capitalize	uppercase
maybe you should replace it with the capitalize method which already changes the first letter of the string to uppercase

4298013
calloc	malloc
i m trying to avoid the use of the malloc calloc function as these require a dedicated heap

4298036
versioning	upgrade
in the case of a library the versioning number tells you about the level of compatibility between two releases and thus how difficult an upgrade will be

4298042
versioning	upgrade
in the case of a library the versioning number tells you about the level of compatibility between two releases and thus how difficult an upgrade will be

4298075
versioning	upgrade
in the case of a library the versioning number tells you about the level of compatibility between two releases and thus how difficult an upgrade will be

4298121
cucumber	autotest
i am using both cucumber and rspec but i want to disable autotest from running the stories while i m working on the spec examples

4298132
client-side	server-side
as mentioned by the other answers they are commonly used for server-side and client-side scripting respectively

4298137
mouse	keyboard
that is it executes in the client web browser in this instance and has access to resources on the client computer such as the actual keyboard and mouse inputs etc.

4298143
cucumber	autotest
this is what controls whether autotest includes the cucumber tests or not

4298176
java.util.date	simpledateformat
the reason i ask is that simpledateformat parse will convert a string to a java.util.date but if you re using this object with an sql database i suspect you ll need the latter the java.util.date

4298187
move	drag
for example if a user clicks on a and drag downward shortening segment ag point b would would down an equal amount shortening bc point f would move to the left shortening both af and fg finally point e would also shift to the left to stay in line with point f

4298193
listview	gridview
i need to be able to select a product from a gridview using the select link or alternatively using a listview and using my own button to then add the bookid to the array which will then be stored in a session variable and sent to a basket page where the bookid will be used again against a sql table to output the details of the book etc

4298205
jstl	taglib
this way any whitespace which is left by taglib jstl and so on will be trimmed

4298216
google-chrome	safari
this css effectively hides the spin-button for webkit browsers have tested it in google-chrome 7.0.517.44 and safari version 5.0.2 6533.18.5

4298219
children	parent
it has to do with parent-child relationships between objects and what happens to children when you delete the parent

4298219
children	parent
one scenario says that children have no life outside that of their parent so they should be deleted when the parent is deleted

4298219
children	parent
the other scenario says that children should persist beyond their parent so they should not be deleted when their parent is deleted

4298221
min	max
how can you use srand with a set seed with min and max values

4298230
integer	unsigned
the current code has undefined behavior if dd is a signed integer type and the condition in the if is never satisfied if d2 is unsigned or if dd and d2 are floating point types

4298255
folder	directory
on my website i ve got a directory folder with some images and html in it

edit just an update as i forgot to mention something that could be very important the target system is mips based although i m also testing my module on my x86 machine

4298324
postgresql	mysql
while i never actually used it with postgresql it just saved my sanity in a project that happened to be born with mysql and then migrated to sql server to sqlite and back to sql server

4298326
post	get
after that use a get or post method to carry your like or dislike vote to the server-side script

4298328
folder	directory
please try importing the api demo project from file- import then show the directory of the api demo folder

4298329
src	attr
i just need the jquery this attr src but in prototype this.readattribute doesn t work

4298336
width	height
if you avoid specifying the height or width on any element that you specify borders and padding you will avoid problems with inconsistencies in the browsers box model implementations

4298400
google-chrome	safari	mp4	webm
do you know which container mp4 avi webm ogv etc. and browser google-chrome safari etc. can play this

4298461
post	put
i ve put together a very simple static page which i m trying to population with forms and user-generated content from storify with the aim of showing readers what s going on with the recent snow but also a means of allowing readers to post their own pictures report problems

4298518
hide	show
if you want content to be initially hidden and then only show with javascript your best bet is to hide it with css and then alter it with javascript after page load

4298518
hide	show
there we use an inline style to hide the paragraph and then use jquery s show to show it show sets the display style property

4298539
keydown	keyup
the timer starts on keydown event and stops on keyup event

4298552
put	get
in cakephp to get base_url currently i put the following code on beforerender method in app_controller.php

4298569
stdout	stderr
you could redirect stdout stderr to a stringio in myfunc then send whatever gets written into that stringio back to the parent as suggested by unutbu

4298586
subtraction	addition
define operators for addition subtraction increment decrement comparison indexing conversion from arrays and so on

4298620

then use keypress instead of keydown and keyup

4298653
setinterval	settimeout
you can store a reference id to any setinterval or settimeout

4298686
int	boolean
in the documentation of reflection they only talk about primitive types like int float boolean etc. as far as i saw

4298691
nfa	dfa
to convert your regular expression to dfa generate nfa first see for example and then convert nfa to dfa

4298732
short	base
while there s a lot to be said for the philosophy that a great developer can pick up almost any language in short order there s a practical side that goes to the fact that if you have a ton of .net or java coders you re best served in starting from that base

4298766
uigesturerecognizer	subviews
i can only handle the double tap on the main view but not for the subviews and can only do it on the transformgesturereconizer.h but then not choose the view tapped i think because subclass of uigesturerecognizer

4298771
gif	png
i have changed the png images to a gif and they go away however i want to use png

rar	zip
i need to extract all the multi-part zip and rar archives in a given path

4298866
put	get
i have a script working perfectly on my localhost but when i try and put it on my server i get this message

4298906
getter	setter
second wpf will not use your property getter and setter to access your dependency properties that s why there should not be any additional logic beyond getvalue and setvalue

4299006
cos	sin
to switch direction you need to subtract the sin cos results

4299023
keydown	keyup
or you could roll your own version of getkeystate and remember what keys are presses in keydown and reset the flag in keyup

4299062
firefox	safari
this works fine in firefox and ie but safari returns

4299066
google-chrome	firefox
i know in firefox and google-chrome exists .size to get file size with javascript and it s even possible to upload multifiles with ajax using xmlhttp.send file or in firefox 3.5

webclient doesn t expose webrequest s properties so it s unusable for me because i need to use cookies etc.

4299115
post	get
get post image

4299118
profiler	visualvm
use a profiler to see where the time is actually spent the jdk comes with visualvm which i would try first

4299135
width	height
i m thinking an array of incremental height coordinates and their respective width coordinates 1d or 2d array

4299135
min	max
you could generate the array beforehand using an algorithm with some randomness with a min max constraint on coordinate distance

4299160
put	get
now the question is can i get that to use a class that s not in a namespace as the mvc class is by default otherwise i ll have to modify the t4 template to put it in a namespace and include that

4299161
iconvertible	iequatable
for instance it could probably do well to implement some interfaces such as icomparable iequatable iformattable and possibly iconvertible as well if you re keen so it can better interact with the rest of the framework

4299167
put	get
in first example you can only put strings as keys and integers as values but in second example you can put anything to the map and the compiler can t help you to get type safety

4299199
bindparam	bindvalue
use bindparam bindvalue with value type booleans don t exist in sqlite but work if bound with param_bool .

4299199
postgresql	mysql
use stored procedures from mysql create matching names in postgresql and define them in sqlite with sqlitecreateaggregate sqlitecreatefunction

4299242
next	except
this will jump to the next except clause or the finally clause

4299244

usually they are int or double

4299258
width	margin
width 200 margin 141 142 0 153

4299286
width	font-size
other lengths with as width values are relative to the current element s font-size and you would have to make similar calculations for those

4299295
uiview	calayer
i believed a calayer is the real thing while a uiview is just the wrapper around it

4299325
width	height
note also that this code kind of assumes images of the same width and height

4299330
fpdf	fpdi
have a look at the fpdi library an add on to fpdf for template annotation

4299332
postgresql	mysql
it has many upsides including the ability to access multiple database types including mysql sqlite and postgresql with the same codebase

4299443
vb6	vba
in general vb6 and vba uses doevents to tell the processor to continue processing the messages in the message queue

4299487
