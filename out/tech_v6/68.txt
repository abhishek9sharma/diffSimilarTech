2 and it sounds far-fetched given ie s history but how many times have you expected firefox or google-chrome to behave the same way only to be met with dismay

9900331
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome have lots of trouble with certain css selectors sometimes with fixes that really take you back to the good ol days of ie5 ie6 and ie7

alternatively you could hide the exe s in some folder but the trick here is that the name of the exe will be show in task manager and once users see this they could search for the exe

button	checkbox
the onitemclicklistener for the listview will not work if you have any clickables like button imagebutton checkbox etc in the listview

so i can t use the properties s accessor to change the value

9901166
free	malloc
you cannot assume that the executable which has loaded your dll is using the same version of the c runtime library so if it tries to call free on the returned memory you might end up corrupting your heap due to differences in the malloc free implementations in the different runtimes

versioning	upgrade
one solutions is please upgrade the plugin to newer versioning it may solve your problem

9901432
free	malloc
it s likely that you have also trashed malloc internal data structures and so it s likely that subsequent malloc or free calls may crash your program leading many programmers to falsely believe they ve found a bug in malloc

innodb	myisam
it looks a little as though you should investigate mysql s fulltext index - last time i looked at it it was not good enough to make a search engine but it might solve your problem it also looks as if modern mysql supports fulltext indexes on innodb tables as well as the myisam tables it was historically restricted to

as part of that i am curious to know what is that stored in the index file .myi file if that is a myisam table or the shared table space if that is an innodb table.

9901679
dictionary	map
another way to do would be using dynamics or dictionary instead of anonymous class - that would remove anonimity problem and would just require to map specific keys on to properties - may be done with reflection again using for example mappingattribute key for distinction - attribute is a fiction just to give a general idea

how to know from the url if the given action was a get or a post request

i m trying to construct a mysql query right now that will get popular tags in a certain time range based on how many times they ve been used in the date range and with it the most recent post with the tag

9901918
free	malloc
notice if the second malloc fails i have to free a first

9901918
free	malloc
the problem is this can be very messy if there are many such malloc s and error checking s unless i use the notorious goto clause and carefully arrange the order of free s along with the labels

9901943
int	boolean
so if you are going to pass in url s and use int to update progress and return a boolean indicating success you would write

9902123
hlsl	glsl
i m sure someone who knew hlsl glsl could write a blur effect that works correctly

9902123
width	height
you should put them in a constant buffer and use them instead of the hardcoded 500.0 for width and height

9902123
width	height
they need to be the width height of the rendered object

9902124

9902193
getter	setter
when you add a public field to a groovy class string firstname in a domain class the groovy compiler converts this to a private field and a public getter and setter

9902193
getter	setter
in grails domain classes properties are persistent by default but properties are defined as a matched getter setter pair

9902193
getter	setter
so when you add a getter or a setter it looks like half of a getter setter property pair and since the setter isn t there it s a problem for gorm

9902240
jar	war
if you package this code in both the war file and in a jar file in your ear this might return you the correct information depending on the classloader

9902266
equals	gethashcode
for equivalence yes you should write that yourself if you need that but it is rarely all that useful really and there s a problem because if you override equals you should override gethashcode too with a suitably parallel implementation

9902275
post	get
this means that it is not necessary to send all the table s value through form post get method

if you intend to use this connection mreo than once you need to keep the bufferedreader and printwriter for the connection

9902631
width	height
do you also want to set the iframe height and width

if domains are same then there is no need for this plugin you can set the width and height by js code.

getter	setter
the latter checks for and prefers to use a getter and a setter for the property while the former does not do this at all

9902950
getter	setter
this implementation gives precedence to getter and setter over bare properties which may or may not be what you want

9903019
jdk1.6	jdk1.4
else you need to add rt.jar of jdk1.6 to your class path but that will cause conflicts for classes common to jdk1.4 and jdk1.6

then you can make the same graphic for the hdpi just multiply the pixel of the mdpi image 1.5 and for the ldpi just multiply the pixel of the mdpi image 0.75

9903094
versioning	upgrade
using an ancient java versioning is a liability at best and you should upgrade to at the very least java 5 as soon as possible

9903292
hash	md5
however with md5 hash it always returns a numeric value for which i cannot determine any origin

you cannot add md5 hash with + just as you cannot add any other kind of strings with +

width	height
if the specified destination pixbuf dest is null then this function will create an rgb pixbuf with 8 bits per channel and no alpha with the same size specified by the width and height arguments

another way to do it is to use the cairo api which would work with gtk 2 and gtk 3

9903424
versioning	upgrade
found this bug is solved in 1.6.0_31 and 1.7.0_03 maybe also in some previous versioning so just upgrade the java compiler

in the same page i want to get the post get value as

9903737
pop-up	dialog
and when i click on the link the dialog doesn t pop-up

9903740
post	get
notice that i have used a get request to refresh the grid instead of post because this way the value query string parameter selected in the dropdown is preserved for future sorting and paging

9903742
cos	sin
if i understood you correctly you could let the camera look at a fixed point the center of the arena and then using sin cos trickery rotate the camera around it

9903747
google-chrome	firefox
the second is impossible except if you are running in a google-chrome extension or firefox add-on which isn t the case i assume if it is the case than the function is called drawelement on the cavnas context

9903885
textview	imageview
try using another xml for the textview and the imageview inside the listview say list_item.xml

9903886
textview	simplecursoradapter
also you need to create a separate view for your list_row which is used in the simplecursoradapter constructor. so define it any layout you want will do in the case in question it would be a linearlayout with 2 textview with the data you need to put in each row of the table

9903889
post	get
generally you should use get to query data and use post to submit data

9904034

with rest you can connect it with http connection get and post

9904243
jar	war
the simplest solution is to package all dependant jar files and classes inside your deployable war file if you can

9904243
jar	war
any supporting jar files should be place under the web-inf lib directory inside your war file

9904243
jar	war
you can of course deviate from this standard structure and load jar files from elsewhere outside of your war but then you have to understand potential class loading issues

9904273
oncreate	onstart
the code below will go in oncreate or onstart or onresume wherever you prefer

9904284
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this is a valid json format so use json.parse xmlhttp.responsetext when possible ie8+ firefox google-chrome opera safari... and use eval + xmlhttp.responsetext + for ie6-7 note you should add an extra pair of bracket and when using eval

in order to send back something to php you must call the serverside via p.e via get or post actions from a form

put	get
but if i use doctrine common annotations annotationreader i need to put orm on the annotations to get work

9909222
hide	show
the easiest would probably be to use jquery and the show hide div

9909224
inherited	properties
i assumed that because i have inherited from the pfitemobject i should be able to assign values to the superclass properties without problem

9909276
rss	feed
i am working on custom rss feed for one of my clients website example.com and for that the feed url takes query strings to customize the feed like

9909551
put	get
i don t get why you didn t put them yourself unless you wanted to assign none to strusername strwage and strhours

9909570
min	max
likely your query will need to pick using an aggreagate function on dataadded use the min or the max function

9909571
ssl	https
so i suspect that from play i cannot do this https request without having an ssl certificate

9909604
pull	push
this repo was cloned from an svn repo which we still use to push from pull to the svn repo is our central blessed repo for triggering ci etc

9909604
pull	push
but i don t know how git-svn handles line endings during the push pull operations

9909609
bash	zsh
personally i d make it absolutely clear and perhaps explicitly call bash or zsh or whatever with the path to the shell script as the first argument or directly call ruby with the -rubygems and script test_s2t.rb as arguments

9909652
stdout	fflush
in your case you redirected pipe to stdout then called fflush to make everything in stdout fflush and move them to read buffer

9909655
cpu	affinity
the parking is not controlled by the cpu affinity setting of your process it is done automatically by the windows cpu scheduler

9909655
cpu	affinity
adjustments to your cpu affinity can perhaps force utilization of certain cores but then windows will just park different cores

9909655
cpu	affinity
setting your own cpu affinity is something you should do with extreme caution

9909655
cpu	affinity
the cpu scheduler is aware of such things so usually the affinity is best left to it -- unless you know what you re doing and have checked that system s cpu

9909689
tunnel	vpn
i think what you want to achieve it create a vpn tunnel connection form your system server to another system server that has smpp installed

9910100
mongohq	mongolab
any idea on the better setup mongohq or mongolab

9910157
getter	setter
if you expect your class to be extended and the getter setter overridden it is best to use the methods instead of the variables

9910157
getter	setter
you can mark the getter setter as final and then you don t have to worry about overrides

9910175
getter	setter
rule #1 always limit the access to the least necessary unless you explicitly need to change the values of the first last names make the object immutable constructor with parameters no setter only getter

9910178
hide	show
you could change your approach by having a hidden div with those contents already within it then your problem comes down to having the drop down show hide depending on the field

9910189
vb.net	vb6
i have a winforms control written in vb.net for vb6 program

9910199

when i try to load a vtk file which is approximately 100mb in size in paraview the program crashes

9910361
inherited	properties
say for example you want a properties which as inherited has the browsable true attribute but for your control you want browsable false

9910445
joptionpane	jdialog
often you might want to use a jdialog joptionpane to handle login

9910477
int	double
int is converted implicitly to double so no errors occured

9910485
wmv	asf	wma	asf
if you do want to differentiate between wma and wmv and not just asf you will have to parse the media file using asfmojo

9910510
pop-up	dialog
one of the button as you can see in the code below is a preview button where if clicked another dialog will pop-up to display more info about the intended operation consequences

9910515

the only difference between asf files and wmv or wma files are the

9910596
post	get
what i didnt want to do is do one query to get the post then iterate through each one and query to get and set the tag category array - but maybe that s my only option

9910616
m2e	pom.xml
there are several possibilities how the lifecycle mapping can be configured in the pom.xml in m2e extensions since m2e 1.1 snapshot in metadata provided by the plugin

9910628
getter	setter	public	protected
it is considered best practice for encapsulation to use private fields with accessors getter and setter instead of protected and public fields

9910628
public	protected
so by following this best practice we never use protected and public anymore

9910654
public	protected
sometimes protected is acceptable if you expect there to be subclasses though. and public static final attributes are also perfectly okay

9910654
public	protected
that said public and protected methods are absolutely necessary

9910722
jmenubar	jmenuitem
another way is use cardlayout if autentification passed then to display jmenubar with jmenuitem for access to another cards

9910725
public	protected
apart from that and some protected cases - but need always to be careful i think it s very rare to see that and you should have some good reasons i can t think of for making a field public and not final at least

9910725
getter	setter
however i also think that use of getter setter should be limited to the minimum indispensable - i saw in the past people putting getter on every field - even when not needed

9910735
folder	directory
i have a ruby on rails website which i have successfully tar the apps directory which included the current folder ect

9910762
put	get
i understand that they exist in order for your class to get more information about itself like its data or whether it should do something i just don t always know where to put it

9910820
pop-up	dialog
i want to use the sharer.php pop-up to open the share dialog but would like to customize it so that the share option is by default not to my profile but to a page - and ideally also select the page by id

9910828
width	margin
css note that i have removed margin and place it using absolute positioning since you know the width is 220px

9910830
getter	setter
it s certainly more convenient and readable to just have a class with public fields than a class with a bunch of getter and setter

9910851
min	max
so there will store many matrices data in that table now i need to get average value for each matrix edge by edge if one matrix is 20 30 and had value in 5 3 5 7 5 15 12 4 17 5 17 10 i need to get four groups of data one for all values that x 5 one for all values that x 17 one for all values that y 4 and one for all values that y 15 cause they are the max min for x and y

9910854
versioning	upgrade
which got implemented when it got upgrade to versioning 3

9910875
post	get
other wise you can define the time from last interaction with the server and calculate the time to expire in the client by getting the date from last get post that returned successfully

9910879
google-chrome	firefox
it s working fine on google-chrome the icon is centered on the button but in firefox the icon is completly down

9910894
public	protected
public private protected and package are not limited to fields

9910966
bash	zsh
suppose a script that if the user is using zsh then put path to his .zshrc and if using bash should put in .bashrc

9910981
vim	sublimetext
i ve poked around in the sublimetext documentation but haven t come across a good way of replicating the above vim command in subl

9910988
getter	setter
using getter and setter is not best in all cases

9910988
public	protected
again because direct access is much simpler in some instances you may use protected to give direct access to subclasses while denying access to the public

9911007
google-chrome	firefox
using the example code below i am able to set the cursor position in firefox google-chrome and ie9 to after the inner div

9911032
pop-up	dialog
then when i get to the place in my app where i ve set a breakpoint instead of hitting the breakpoint eclipse is not even going into debug perspective my app suddenly expires and the emulator pop-up the dialog

9911103
post	get
you can have a single function to handle both post and get

9911124
put	get
however when i put the plugin on the website i get a complete different results which looks like this

9911131
width	height
this is because because i wan t to increase the border property of that button control and at the same time wan t the button to stay same size height and width

9911148
getter	setter
i think with a custom setter and getter

9911243
bufferedoutputstream	inputstream
therefore need to write the inputstream to a temp file by bufferedoutputstream

9911257
disk	ram
second if sqlite db file is stored on a disk not in ram and is several gigs or ters in size how does that affect the performance when querying it

9911285

9911295
google-chrome	safari
i m not going to use this with ie browsers just safari google-chrome if that helps out

9911322
strcpy	strncpy
the strncpy version of strcpy limit the characters you can copy

9911333
width	height
3 to handle the horizontal fit i found that css gave me problems with iframes pdf combos in a few browsers as of today and resorted to using old-school width and height as follows

9911333
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
quirky but it works in firefox google-chrome ie9 safari so please do not neg me for browser quirks

9911338
portrait	landscape
keep in mind that you must support both orientations landscape and portrait when developing an app for release on ipad

9911373
versioning	upgrade
we are unfortunately using an older versioning of magento 1.1.8 and have no opportunity to upgrade at this point

9911382
post	get
aside of binding same function to post and get as suggested by justsid in other answer you may use app.all handler to route all request types to function

9911383
min	max
cause a select list cannot include both a group function such as avg count max min sum stddev or variance and an individual column expression unless the individual column expression is included in a group by clause

9911383
min	max
remove the group by function ie min max sum count from the select statement

9911390
portrait	landscape
the portrait mode sets images with correct orientation but once i use landscape mode the images are set rotated 90 degrees clockwise

9911390
portrait	landscape
if i look at uiimageorientation on all images the value is always 3 nslog d uiimageorientation in both portrait and landscape modes

9911402
zipalign	jarsigner
i can t recall if i have to run zipalign after jarsigner

9911423

trying to create a secure login i have decided to create an md5 hash using the following code adapted a small bit from how can i generate an md5 hash

9911572
qthread	qobject
qthread inherits qobject already so you must not inherit from qobject

9911573
put	get
you could still put some incredibly simply puzzle on your start page to get rid of them i guess but that might alienate some visitors as well

9911625
udp	tcp
the only reliable method for tcp udp integrity checking is encapsulation inside a cryptographically secure layer

9911628
width	font-size
divide the nowadays 17 monitors standard resolution 1440px width with this pixels 1em font-size result

9911658

i keep it in one class not multiple inherited classes for simplicity sake there are ten types but they mostly have the same properties

9911664
tabs	tabpanel
i ve seen how to handle extjs window and tabpanel but i can t figure out how to get the reference of the dialog i m in so that i can manipulate it add remove tabs

9911697
int	double
means divide the int 3 by the int 2 and then cast the result which is the int 1 to a double giving you 1.0

9911699
int	double
both 3 and 2 are int so despite receiver being double you still get an int result and it is then converted to double

9911700
zipalign	apksigner
if you use apksigner zipalign must only be performed before the apk file has been signed

9911700
zipalign	jarsigner
if you use jarsigner zipalign must only be performed after the apk file has been signed

9911703

then when clicking toggle show hide on the div s needed

9911889
valgrind	memcheck
on linux this kind of problems are usually resolved by using valgrind tool memcheck

width	height
i want to put the images into container elements with a fixed width of 130px and a fixed height of 60px

9912458
getter	setter
adam bien says in this post that if you are using a dto you may not use private + getter + setter but only public fields

9912458
public	protected
but unless you are the absolute owner of the code and or you can force new standards to be fulfilled you should keep avoiding the use of public protected fields.

9912682
superclass	subclassing
i have a superclass and two subclassing and i want to serialize the objects of the subclassing as a list and deserialize it

google-chrome	safari
although google-chrome and safari will work they do not have the print background options

because your array expects person instances you can put instances of any subclassing of person because subclassing always have an is-a relationship with their superclass

9912777
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
you can add subtract or multiplying whatever you like

9912785
post	get
what i ve done to get started is write a basic servlet that accepts the jsp post then in turn post the data to the web service parses the xml and puts the data in a form the jsp can see

9912785
post	get
how should i get my jsp form to post data to a restful web service and then parse the xml results

9912802
accessor	properties
a better approach would be to modify your poco classes so that they instantiate the collection properties in their get accessor rather than in the constructor

9912808
post	put	post	get	put	get
similarly for create think post and or maybe put for read think get and for update think put or maybe patch

9912847
ienumerable	iqueryable
update as i mentioned it worked fine with webforms i am calling .tolist to get ienumerable from iqueryable in when selecting data

9912858
submit	submission
if your submission is not blocked you will be able to submit data via your form and see results on expedia s site

9912865
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested is google-chrome firefox and safari over osx

9912873
width	height
as i see we write width 3 height bytes

9912882
ienumerable	iqueryable
i am calling .tolist to get ienumerable from iqueryable in when selecting data

9912942
swt	swing
it supports swing and swt

9912973
ant	maven
one would be to use a build script like maven or ant to build it for you and specify a different name in the app.xml for both the android and ios version

9912994
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
if you re trying to allocate using pure c you use malloc or calloc to allocate and free to deallocate

9913026
for-loop	loops
you should change the 3 occurrences of 10 in your two for loops by the max variable so when the user define another size your for-loop will take his input instead of the 10 value

9913033
getter	setter	superclass	subclassing
i want to get my head around the idea of using setter and getter in superclass and subclassing in terms of software good practices

9913033
superclass	subclassing
declaring a protected instance variables in the superclass and let the subclassing uses them

9913033
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
declaring a private instance variables in the superclass with public getter methods to let the subclassing inherited the getter methods from the superclass

9913083
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in google-chrome firefox ie9

9913099
getter	setter
normally i would have public getter setter methods since anyone can use them not just subclasses

9913103
cos	sin
however an interesting issue is that computing the trigonometric functions sin cos and tan requires reduction of their argument modulo 2ï

9913103
cos	sin
this is how most all c versions of the sin cos tan functions work

9913107
post	get
servlet will communicate through post get to the backend

9913113
getter	setter
getter and setter are for classes using another non-related class

9913114
google-chrome	safari
currently it works on osx in google-chrome and safari and on windows in google-chrome

9913117
put	get
bytebuffer are used for read and writing data you can get put many primitive type and control the endianess

9913128
folder	directory
the source property is relative and you window appears to be in the viewlayer directory so the dictionary folder must also be in the viewlayer directory if you use

9913149
draggable	droppable
so i have these draggable elements which are pulled via a database that drag from one area to a droppable sortable area

9913152
getter	setter
if your ultimate goal is interoperability and scalability you re safer using getter setter

9913152
getter	setter
another advantage is with the getter setter you can perform multiple operations instead of only a single operation for instance getusers may actually tabulate multiple data rows

9913170
width	height
first of all you calculate the contentsize for the scrollview when you want to use the ipad in landscapemode with 8 pages then the width should be 1024 8 8192px and the height 768px

9913213
getter	setter
otherwise i always pick 2 creating getter setter

9913213
getter	setter
any good book on object oriented programming will list other benefits of using getter and setter

9913260
hide	show
hide show different edittexts that have different input types

9913272
int	double
the half round rule only applies to exact numbers int and decimals for you double the behavior depends on the underlying c library

9913279
nsstring	nsdata
convert the nsdata to a nsstring and push that through

9913280
put	get
use file.listfiles to get the content of the directory where you put the files and use the retern values to fill an adapter arrayadapter for instance to use in conjunction with a listview

9913282
hide	show
that section would have a header that says competitors. if there are no competitors assigned to that category yet i not only don t want it to show space for the competitors but i would like to also hide the header

9913288
i2c	spi
attaching an external spi or i2c adc might be a bit tedious since having no spi or i2c on your part you d have to bit-bash it

9913293
mouseover	mouseout
because the number of replies varies for each comment i cannot do a simple mouseover mouseout script

9913307
wordpress	joomla
you can build a website like that with joomla maybe with wordpress too but i m not sure

9913327
fiddler	charles
you should get a web debugging proxy like fiddler or charles so you can see your web traffic

9913327
post	get
also try doing a post instead of get some servers do not allow that verb

9913344
innodb	myisam
innodb is usually much better than myisam at tables being available while insert update and delete are happening because innodb uses row level locking for updates whereas myisam uses table level locking

9913362
ddms	adb
go to ddms perspective click on the down arrow next to the screen capture camera icon and select reset adb from the dropdown menu

9913378
width	height
the only solution i know is to specifiv the width height in the usetemplate method

9913378
width	height
see fpdi documention on setting width height

9913461
width	height
you re looking for images are rectangular that have similar height width dimensions

9913466
unsigned	short
you can convert a byte short or int to unsigned by using the next bigger type for example

9913499
folder	directory
in the build events for the project the only macro seems to point to the build output in the solution files on my computer not to the end directory on the mobile device output file folder under deployment options

9913557
nexus	artifactory
the latter can be improved by adding maven repository manager such as nexus or artifactory that would cache and optimize access to all remote maven repositories

9913600
for-loop	loops
like mentioned above the nested for-loop is unnecessary and can be inefficient if you plan to create larger rectangles in the future not saying you re going to have to but try to stay away from nested for loops if you can

9913652
gif	png
if you want to convert the bitmapsource to other file format like png or gif you have to use third party libraries like .net image tools

9913665
int	double
i have some financial data gathered at a list int double like this

9913681
packets	pcap
i am using pcap.net to send packets using send buffer with wireshark file pcap extension and my question is there is any way to change the packets s ip during or before playback

9913685
packets	pcap
i want to delete certain packets which i don t want to be part of my new pcap file from the wireshark file copy of the original pcap file via java code

9913685
packets	pcap
is it possible to create a new pcap file with certain packets removed

9913719
clearinterval	settimeout
when working on some javascript for a web application i noticed that i had used settimeout but i had tried to clear it with clearinterval and it stopped the timeout from occurring in google chrome and internet explorer 9

9913749
stdout	stderr
there are 3 channels open for any console app running stdin stdout stderr

9913753
x86	mips
android platform can run on different architectures - arm mips and x86

9913765
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
happens with google-chrome safari and firefox

9913765
google-chrome	safari
this method uses a controlled amount of memory grows to 100mb and stops but it is slow especially in safari 50 cpu usage there 17 in google-chrome

9913806
google-chrome	firefox
are there any plugins for firefox or google-chrome or internet explorer to show me how many sockets it currently has open and what data was sent through them

9913902
versioning	upgrade
i m pretty sure that other upgrade always copied the user settings from the previous versioning so i d guess that there s some problem related to the new certificate

9913910
keystore	jks
client certificate .cer .crt .pem and it s corresponding private key .key should be packaged into pkcs#12 .p12 .pfx or jks .jks container first keystore

9913914
rss	feed
i ended up using the custom formatters module to accomplish this -- just a little php code to display the rss feed that is entered as a field in the user s profile

9913946
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux 10.04 x86_64

9913947
uilabel	uisegmentedcontrol
make a uiview add your uisegmentedcontrol to that as well as a uilabel that you style the way you want with the or so

9913978
versioning	upgrade
it looks like the user settings framework can see the previous versioning but they just didn t get upgrade for some reason

9913978
versioning	upgrade
i used mitch s technique for upgrading user settings to manually call upgrade the first time i run a new versioning

9913978
versioning	upgrade
a useful trick for testing this upgrade process several times was jason s suggestion of copying old versioning of the application manifest over the current versioning

9913998
pop-up	dialog
the jquery ui has a real nice pop-up function called dialog

9914024
min	max	width	height
it must be that i have made same error with max min width height

9914033
versioning	upgrade
and onupgrade method will be call when you upgrade the database versioning

9914035
screens	tablet
just imagine what would happen if you had 3-4 flash sites open and rendering off screens on your tablet

9914037
tablet	galaxy
i am developing a custom camera application and testing on two galaxy tablet

9914049
for-loop	arrays
i have an arrays of structs and i intend to pass each element of the arrays into separate pthreads in a for-loop

9914115
hash	salt
on our users table the password salt and hash are different on each record -- which leads me to believe that somehow rails is somehow running transactions save operations twice

9914128
for-loop	arrays
but the objects will be created dynamically since the amount of balls could range from 3 to 25 preferably with a for-loop pushing the different balls to an arrays

9914177
put	get
how did those get there i didn t put them there

9914191
cpython	pypy
but note that if you really want more performance i recommend you to use pypy which is a lot faster than the standard cpython implementation

9914212
width	height
the max width and height are there to make sure the image dont size to big

9914236
oncreate	ondestroy
your service might also have a background thread of its own for other work but the lifecycle methods oncreate onstartcommand onbind and ondestroy are always called on the main application thread

9914238
strcpy	strncpy
one solution is to pass the size of the buf in the function and check it before strcpy or use strncpy

9914251
sitecore	kentico
for .net i am looking at sitecore ektron and kentico

9914258

9914283
hide	show
jquery to show hide steps and preventdefault on steps 1 2

9914327
vsto	add-in
they don t live together happily in the same add-in so you should either base everything on excel-dna which allows you to access both the c api and the com interfaces or make two separate add-in vsto has some ribbon and other high-level wrappers which can be convenient.

9914333
implements	extends
i ve looked into extends newtonsoft.json.serialization.defaultcontractresolver and implements my own newtonsoft.json.jsonconverter but i have not discovered any way to implements this desired override

9914379
client-side	server-side
few ways you can do this from the collection but whichever way you choose you have to call destroy on each model which will run sync and destroy it on both the client-side and server-side which localstorage is acting as

9914425
client-side	server-side
i m currently new into client-side programming especially using the jquery ajax method to call server-side methods

9914437
rtp	sdp
as i understand it you need to have a sdp information so that the receiving ffmpeg instance can interpret the rtp stream

9914477
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to avoid leaving the page because the dialog pop-up is a lookup that helps a user populate a form field

9914477
pop-up	dialog
i somewhat like the built-in jqm implementation of the dialog pop-up for long multiselects

9914477
pop-up	dialog
does anyone know how this dialog pop-up is implemented and if i can call the same method in some way

9914518
hide	show
you can just bind the menu click event for all divs with .evtog classes the handler hide the submenus that are visibles and show the submenu

9914522
snmp	mib
if i were to write code to monitor this device i think i should learn how the snmp and mib files work exactly

9914533
awt	swing
don t mixing awt components with swing jcomponents since is possible but still caused with a few issues

9914540
express	node.js
i am using varnish 3.0 on ubuntu 11 - the redirect is being handled by expressjs v2.5.8 - running node.js 0.6 - the redirect is called by express works without varnish in between but when varnish is used in between the redirect to a new page gets blocked displays error 302 found

9914544
pull	push
is it possible to substitute the default pull push target as headurl

9914586
button	checkbox
however when the currently selected radio button is selected again the selection is cleared like a checkbox i guess

9914586
button	checkbox
my implementation checks the status of the radio button and if selected clears the selection emulating the un-selecting like a checkbox

9914586
mouselistener	actionevent
one solution would be to essentially log the buttongroup s selected button right before any actionevent fires although my program isn t psychic like that i suspect i could easily implement this using a mouselistener although that restricts functionality to mouse-usage and i could use the keyboard etc thanks for any pointers

9914622
put	get
i put the gridview inside an aspxcallbackpanel and am trying to get my gridview to update on the page after an attachment is uploaded using aspxcallbackpanel.performcallback

9914696
google-chrome	safari
it works fine in safari and google-chrome

9914726
getter	setter
in this case use a property instead of a public field or explicit setter getter methods

9914726
getter	setter
properties are compiled down to setter getter methods which allows you to change your internal implementation later on if required so still respects encapsulation

9914726
getter	setter
explicit setter getter methods are not idiomatic for c#

9914810
width	height
width height and max

9914810

note for the sake of others who arrive at this question with similar issues it s also important to note that you should being using post requests not get requests

9914834
inherited	properties
how do i change this structure so that the inherited classes employee and customer have their person properties overriding the person properties in the abstract class without touching the auto-generated code

9914840
disk	ram
the main thread keeps executing while other threads are waiting for 4gb to be read from disk to ram or for the db server to return a response

9914874
getter	setter
to do this some fields in wheelview and wheelscroller needed getter setter

9914874
public	protected
as well some constants and methods needed to be accessible and set as protected or public instead of private so they could be overridden

9914876
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
this is common issue with jradiobutton and jcheckbox and occasionally for another jbuttons jcomponents these events must be wrapped into invokelater

9914876
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
for jradiobutton and jcheckbox is better to use itemlistener only because fired exactlty events selected and deselected

9914882
led	electronics
this text then will display in a window like electronics led display board

9914907
stdout	stderr
i am trying to redirect output of stdout and stderr using a file

uilabel	uibutton
the currenttitle of the sender uibutton should be passed to a uilabel in the dayview of the dayviewcontroller

9914923
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
if you however need to use grid for some reason you can set horizontalalignment to left and verticalalignment to top specify appropriate values for width and height and then set margin to x y 0 0

9914935
width	height
now it is nessesary that this canvas object has always a ratio between width and height

9914947
modifiers	sealed
use of the sealed modifiers prevents a derived class from further overriding the method

9914979
post	get
working with method get but not with post what s the problem

9914987
scatter	graphing
i am doing a project that requires me to study the several condition that affect gps accuracy and after i collected a set of data and dumped it to excel i was trying to plot a scatter graphing grouping the data into different series according to a value in this case i wanted to plot the latitude and longitude values as the xy scatter values and separate the series by the number of satellites when the fix was obtained

9914992

9914998
powerpc	i386
the file command list all available architectures for .a file only when the file is trully universal contains two or more of powerpc i386 x86_64 otherwise it only shows the vanilla ar archive... message

9915001
width	height
the frames are perfectly square so it cannot be a matter of getting the height and width confused

9915046
fadein	hide
hide it and fadein back.

9915055
google-chrome	safari
it only seems to happen in google-chrome and safari

9915056

i modified it so that i can get height and width from the html anchor tag

9915061
children	parent
use a parent div and fix the size of the children

9915150
hide	show
use this simple function to do the dynamic show and hide

9915158
mdpi	hdpi
its not just the galaxy nexus ldpi phones will look different than mdpi which will look different than hdpi etc

9915206
getter	setter
all non getter setter methods are handled by categories that can have method interceptors

9915210
jpql	hql
jpql and hql expects a path between the entities in order to join them

9915228
ready	each
although one should avoid creating threads which will simply run for a short time and quit or creating really huge numbers of threads using a dedicated thread for each serial port will ensure that when data comes in there will be a thread ready to handle it

9915238
onmouseover	onclick
i tried applying this to radio buttons too that would change the bg color onclick however if i wanted a preview of the color by using onmouseover that part didn t work as it doesn t with the above

9915302
fish	zsh	fish	bash	fish	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
if it contains fish zsh bash ksh or tcsh the user s favorite shell is probably that shell

9915322
portrait	landscape
if you have two uiviewcontroller classes a base class for portrait mode and a subclass of that for landscape mode you can put almost all the code in the base class

9915334
unix	solaris
solaris unix run the following command rm -r glassfish

9915337
post	get
in order to get that second heading in though i need to break out of the while loop otherwise it ll run it for every post

9915337
post	get
i know using wp function the_title i can get the title of the post

9915400
titlebar	window
this removes the click action so it becomes like a modal window without losing the titlebar

9915403
int	double
i think mvc doesn t cast convert from int to decimal so the .00 tells it to hydrate using float double decimal

9915446
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i m setting up a uistoryboard in interface builder and while everything is working fine i seem to be unable to hook up the delegate outlet of the uitabbarcontroller to any of the uiviewcontroller s in the uistoryboard regardless of their position in the uistoryboard

9915446
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve set the uiviewcontroller s to be a in the .h file but interface builder won t allow me to select the uiviewcontroller as the delegate for the uitabbarcontroller

9915480
width	height
and you have to make sure that the canvas parent does not set its width or height at the same time

9915480
width	height
you could for example put it inside another canvas and set either your canvas width or height explicitely

9915492
width	height
in the css file i ve set your image in background of my container with fixed width and height

9915501
folder	directory
make sure that the thumbdest destination folder directory is writable by the user that apache or the web server is running as

9915508
min	max
you can use the same thing to make sure value is min and max

9915512
implements	extends
if you re using default android styles then the idea would be to extends whatever style you re implements and just change the elements you need

9915521
range	max	range	min	min	max
if you range between 0 and 10 and want 0 10 to fail exclude min and max - simply replace with and with

9915528
filtering	grouping
that way you can join on one table where feed id s match as well as grouping by or filtering by content type

9915535
google-chrome	firefox
my rendered html looks great in google-chrome but not in firefox or ie the links are not as wide and the page looks weird because the fourth link doesn t hit the right edge of the page

9915640
uilabel	uibutton
after a bit of playing around i realized that uitextfield can be thought of as a uibutton rounded rect style with a uilabel on top of it

9915640
uilabel	uibutton
in my case i wanted a read only text-field so i used uilabel on top of uibutton

9915664
stdout	stderr
simply open 2 two files fd1 and fd2 and then use dup2 fd1 1 for stdout and dup2 fd2 2 for stderr

9915679
filtering	grouping
i grouping on the productid then use that in a 2nd query to filtering the original collection

9915758
hex	binary
to expand on comments below if this problem was expressed in hex or binary it could be done very simply using shift operators

9915775
width	height
if you have a recent enough compiler you can replace your height width weight etc code with

9915798
post	get
you ll know there if the browser is actually hitting the server on every click and you can even see with what parameters whether post or get

9915826
preferencescreen	listpreference
how can i remove listpreference from preferencescreen at runtime

9915847
rss	feed
i have an expression in the middle of a bunch of html actually an rss feed of the form

9915849
popover	tooltip
currently no since the popover script is basically extending the functionally of the tooltip script but nothing is impossible

9915874
width	height
i doubt this is the cause of your issue but the width and height that you apply to are declared outside the tag which might prevent those attributes from being interpreted

9915881
filtering	grouping
you might try a grouping and filtering approach something like the following

9915882
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
i ve only used while loops to put data into arrays but i figured using a for-loop here would be easier

9915882
for-loop	arrays
not sure if it s my for-loop that is messed up or if it s an issue with passing the arrays

9915884
google-chrome	firefox
under firefox and other google-chrome it is right

9915893
implements	extends
if instead you have a concrete beveragedecorator class that extends or implements beverage by simply delegating each call to the wrapped beverage subclasses can extends beveragedecorator and only implements the methods they care about leaving the base class to handle delegation

9915919
umask	chmod
if you ve already installed gitolite then existing files will have to be fixed up manually for a umask or 0027 that would be chmod -r g+rx

9915943
children	parent	onresume	onpause
when you create a tabhost to hold activities the children inside it can t manage their own lifecycled methods onresume onpause oncreated etc and the parent the holder must do all the managements

9915943
onresume	onpause
i ve implemented this behavior by overwriting onpause and onresume in the holder the activity that defines the tabhost like this

9915943
onresume	onpause
with it i think that your onresume onpause methods gonna be triggered

9915971
portrait	landscape
the image centering must persist through a screen rotation from portrait to landscape

9915997
children	parent
in all the examples i have seen there is no reference to the parent in the children

9916005
put	get
may be you can put the desired cell in the tag property which accepts objects then at menu item click get the cell from the tag and set it s value

9916013
folder	directory
the filewatch folder is the watch directory

9916016
hash	md5
consider for example restoring the original value from its md5 hash

9916016
hash	md5
for a lambda calculating md5 hash inverted function must break md5 in cryptological sense

9916036
implements	extends
public class andactivity extends activity implements locationlistener

9916051
min	max

hash	md5
that will invalidate the md5 hash of the existing registry and force it to build a new one

9916332
salt	md5
beyond md5 vs sha2 which is a good idea it s actually much more important to add a randomly generated salt to each password

9916343
for-loop	arrays
the problem is every time it ticks it always creates the arrays and the for-loop

9916350
width	height
after reducing the code and commenting out it was the animation of width and height that are causeing the problem

9916368

9917070
folder	directory
using a .htaccess file with deny from all will stop people accessing that folder it wont stop php from accessing it but you could put your files one directory lower then your htdocs www public_html folder and use php to grab and serve thos files

children	parent
for example if you have have a parent div with two nested children and you need to have even 10px spacing between the children and also have the children be spaced 10 px from the parent

9917104
children	parent
then would you add padding to parent div padding 10px and then just add 10px of margin between the children

9917104
children	parent
or would you leave the parent at 0 padding and have the children define what seperation they need from each other and also their parent

for me it depends entirely on the semantic meaning of the nodes in question -- what is the parent what are the children

9917812
children	parent
or do the children want distance between and amongst themselves and their parent margin

9917856
portrait	landscape
the only problem is that it uses the api level 9 camera.camerainfo to get the orientation of the camera with respect to the device presumably to deal with landscape vs portrait devices

9917901
getter	setter
you provide getter and setter for each property again implicitly telling users of your class that it is ok to set on but not the other

so to do it correctly you d first need to run the following query to get total post

9919883
switching	screens
so if one would want to achieve that what i was trying to achieve - that is to get one panorama item to stretch over 3 screens widths - the best way to go is to make 3 separate panorama items and try to set the margins of each one manually so the user feels like he s browsing the one and the same panorama item seamlessly switching from one to another

a first slightly incomplete idea is that the post request would pre-calculate the html for successive get head requests and store it into the file system

9923433
post	get
post in this case would not generate any html but only update the database appropriately and delete the html file from the file system as a flag to have it generated anew with the next get head

9935311
post	get
and if you are really out for ideas then you can stuff the info in the query string of the url in the action attribute of the form and then get the info by checking the get array however if the form method is get instead of post then the values might get overwritten

9935311
onclick	onsubmit
1 that the onsubmit function doesn t know which button was pressed however you can instead use the button s onclick event but you will have to bind to every submit button on the form you can do this much easier with jquery etc.

9935311

9935465
hash	salt
the script would then compared the provided hash with db password hash rehashed with session salt

9935465
hash	salt
plus if you use as salt a string using hex char of a variable even length it will make the job harder for the attacker to recognised that the value bruteforced by the second hash is a sha1 hash and even if he know it s an sha1 he will have to test multiple case to try to find the right portion of the value that correspond to the hash

9935465
hash	salt
because of variable salt a same password won t be the same if hash

9935465
hash	md5
finally sha1 hash are safer than md5 i tell you that because you used the md5 tag in your post

9935465

an hardcore way still without using https would be to encrypt your password and username with a strong cypher like aes or 3des and use a secure key echange algorythm like the diffie hellman one to exchange a random shared key

ready	each
the document ready function will execute while the page load or each time you hit the refresh button

9937291
width	height
if you want more control over that - you can bind both width and height to the same value from a view model that you change depending on the need or write a converter that will convert a hardcoded width height value to actual value depending on detected screen size resolution or settings

9937333
for-loop	arrays
depending on how you are initialising the arrays there may be a vectorised way to achieve this without using a for-loop

lan	localhost
in addition not all ip addresses have a host name associated with them and some may not have any periods eg if you get localhost or another local lan machine name

my couchdb is actually a ssl cloudant database and my app is hosted on heroku which is deferent than the app on heroku that is actually combined with cloudant

9938644
equals	gethashcode
distinct prefers both gethashcode and equals to be defined either for the type being compared or to have an equality comparer supplied

9938644
equals	gethashcode
you can implement gethashcode and equals for your type - but i sometimes find that a definition of equality in one case isn t always suitable for all cases - in ui cases it might be enough only to check that two objects ids match because the ui might not have all the same data defined on the object that is actually available therefore a single true equality can t always be satisfied

9938652
min	max
a database with min max temperatures with humidity and rain snow info etc

9938689
getter	setter
it seems that you are reluctant to write getter setter for some reason but that s pretty standard oo technique

9938718
equals	gethashcode
you need to implement in your class and provide your own gethashcode and equals methods

9938719

9938852
int	double
this way you will get double value then multiply it with 10e6 you will get int which you need to use in creating geopoints

9938888
children	parent
the most obvious ones are that the explicit tree has a greater memory overhead either involving pointers within each object or a separate object to be allocated for each object in the heap and is also slower as any time an object moves within the heap you have to update multiple pointers to children and possibly parent

9938888
put	get
the reason why you need to be able to get at the last element easily is that to add an element you make it the last element and then reorder it with respect to its parent and sibling an o log n operation or to remove the smallest you simply put the current last element in its place and reorder downwards

9938893
int	boolean
like float int boolean string

9938938
cout	cin
the first wrong thing you re doing is using cin and cout which are terribly slow

9938938
cout	cin
never use cin and cout for contest programming

9938938

then for each grouping you just need to filtering the records with a join to filtering item_name and a between to filtering inv_date

9939356
int	chars
since c is not an interpreted language there is no internal representation of int or floating point numbers or chars

9939359
comparator	comparable
always safe to use either comparator or comparable interface to provide sorting implementation if the object is not a string or wrapper classes for primitive data types

9939388
post	put
post requests are being put straight into an sql query which allows someone with a specially crafted post request to execute any query pretty much on the server.

division	multiplication
division may be heavier than multiplication but a commenter pointed out that reciprocals are just as fast as multiplication on modern cpus in which case this isn t correct for your case so if you do have 1 x appearing somewhere inside a loop and more than once you can assist by caching the result inside the loop and then using y

inline blocks table cells and table captions are also elements that you can affect height and width but that are not intrinsically 100 of the parent yes table tr td is one that would fill 100 of it s parent but it is designed to allow for multiple td s so the td doesn t count as it will automatically shrink to accommodate additional td s this also applies to any overflow other than visible because it breaks the containment of the block element

9944099

for example when new button is clicked dialog pop-up asking user to fill some data

width	height
in your markup remove the width and height attributes and then in your css add

9944386

9944633
textile	liquid
the content is still in textile because monthly.html is a html file and jekyll doesn t run any text processor over html files other than liquid which just does a substitution with the text in page.content no conversion

however jekyll has some built-in liquid filters to help with this specifically textilize to convert textile to html

9949302
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
now when i touch inside the uiimageview it doesn t scroll but still won t call the methods touchesbegan withevent touchesmoved withevent or touchesended withevent which each reside in the viewcontroller

9949341
jar	war
i believe the surefire plugin is bound to the test lifecycle phase by default for a jar war ejb anyway but nothing is bound to integration-test or verify

9949361
client-side	server-side
cookies are primarily for reading server-side localstorage can only be read client-side

9949363
put	get
either the caller expects never to get an eof he put his own marker out there for instance and eofexception is of the same nature as a nullpointerexception or he expects it and doesn t need the hassle and lost processing time of a stack trace

9949378
postgresql	mysql
but it just replace my default postgresql connection with this temporary mysql

9949395

9949434
post	get
is there a way to get the current culture from a custom validation attribute on a post

9949448
min	max
alternatively since min and max are the same for all three dimensions you could use np.minimum and np.maximum like so

9949448
min	max
i recommend calling min and max something else so that they don t shadow the builtins

9949470
avasset	avurlasset
avurlasset is a concrete subclass of avasset and can be used when the url of the local video file is available

bash	zsh
so why does bash keep the process placed in background with bg as the current process indicated by + which will be resumed if fg is run while zsh sets the other process as current

9949527
scalapack	mpi
the only way i ve ever used mpi_type_create_darray myself and indeed the only way i ve ever seen it used is to create an mpi file view of a large matrix to distribute the data in a block-cyclic fashion so that one can read the file in and then use scalapack to do parallel linear algebra operations on the distributed matrix

9949573
queue	fifo
for events each subscriber is queue up put at end of list a fifo model

9949582
curve-fitting	splines
interp1 will match the graph exactly but you might be interested in fancier curve-fitting operations like splines approximations etc

9949747
public	protected
as for your question of where your code goes yes the import goes at the top with the others your addcallback statement goes under the entry point comment and the function becomes a function on the main class just like the init function - within a class it will need a scope declaration like public protected or private

9949773

9950538
inherited	subclassing
this is critical to understand when deciding to use subclassing and class inherited as a means of constructing programs you don t make your subclassing more specific than your interface or super classes

9950538
superclass	subclassing
for subclassing to work in ways that solve problems instead of create problems you need to abide by this guideline all subclassing must be functionally equivalent to the superclass liskov substitution principle this means that three classes which provide database access to three different databases is a good candidate for being subclassing from a common class or perhaps sharing a common interface because the functionality is offer database access

9950602

in long mode the cpu has 64bit capability but can also run in 32- and 16-bit compatibility modes

9953265
x86	64bit	16-bit	64bit
the mode switching is controlled by the l and d flags in the code segment descriptor see extending x86 for the 64bit world in this pdf -- essentially different sections of memory can be marked as containing 64- 32- or 16-bit code and the cpu switches into the appropriate mode for the code segment it s currently running

if x is a type then pointer to x is a type itself and therefore you can even find pointers to pointers to int or pointers to pointers to pointers to chars

9953885
int	chars
note also that you may find in literature the term nul only one l but this is the ascii chars with code 0 represented in c c++ with 0 and is a logically distinct thing from a pointer or an int number

9953885
int	chars
unfortunately in c++ chars are int too and therefore for example 0 is a valid null pointer value and the same goes for a - a they are int constant expressions evaluating to zero

folder	directory
directory folder simulation

9955959
folder	directory
amazon s3 doesn t actually have a native concept of folder directory rather is a flat storage architecture comprised of buckets and objects keys only - the directory style presentation seen in most tools for s3 including the aws management console itself is based solely on convention simulating a hierarchy for objects with identical prefixes - see my answer to how to specify an object expiration prefix that doesn t match the directory

9955959
folder	directory
i have a faint memory of s3 actually placing a zero byte object key into a bucket for the simulated directory folder in more recent regions all but us standard whereas the legacy solution for the us standard region might be different for example simply based on the established naming convention for directory separation by and omitting a dedicated object key for this altogether

9959680
post	get
how do i make it so all get implemented so when the new post are loaded via infinite scrolling the post are the right width

9959703
post	get
i think the easiest way to do that is by registering a custom post type for the special post that get this special single.php template

9959706
post	get
the access_token value has to be passed as a get instead of a post with the rest of the parameters

int	chars
in some cases this easily allows analysis and synthesis code to abstract what the underlying datatype might actually be signed long int unsigned chars etc

9959923
int	double
for ieee double you have a 53 bit mantissa which is enough to represent 32 bit int considered as fixed point numbers between -1 0x80000000 and 1 - 2 -31 0x7fffffff

9959942
actionscript	haxe
here s a demo code for your reference for actionscript and haxe

9959951

if you get rid of the isfinishing check i think you need to move the acquirebinding call from oncreate to onstart onresume depending on sdk version to ensure that your ref count doesn t get messed up

9960004
min	max
you can use just about any aggregate you want max min sum etc. above it doesn t matter as long as there s only one value for each distinct combination of tag and timestamp

9960007
int	double
when an int is converted to a double the number is held with an appropriate exponent 1023+10 and the same bit pattern is effectively stored as the original int actually ieee binary floating point does not store the top bit

9960007
int	double
a 32bit int will require a double to hold its value perfectly and an 8bit int will be held perfectly in a float

9960007
int	double
when code divides that 32bit int stored as a double to map it to the range + -1 then error will very likely be introduced

9960007
int	double
double holds 32-bit int perfectly

9960007
rational-numbers	fractions	int	double
so when an int is mapped to the range + -1 and hence is converted to a rational-numbers n m some numbers can not be represented by the finite number of bits in a double s fractions part so errors will creep in

9960007
int	double
so they can be converted back and forth between int and double using rounding and the error of double representation will not cause the int to be wrong

9960018
libpcap	jpcap
i built a webapp that uses libpcap via jpcap

post	get
one way to get around this is to create a viewmodel struct that has both your post and key info untested but this is the gist of it

9960463
express	node.js
i can also do this with a hardcoded query in a node.js app using express restful routes and mongoose

9960497

9960515
google-chrome	firefox
results google-chrome places me right where firefox did far away in hood oregon

9960515
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome calculates your geolocation using wifi hotspots if available whereas firefox does not

9960515
google-chrome	firefox
perhaps it is as simple as google-chrome is setting this to true while firefox is not

9960538

i know there is no frozen dictionary data type but if there was one how would it be different from namedtuple

the problem is in the spec that tests the point 2 i check that sending a put request to the user_path i m redirected to the root but running rspec i get the following error

9960761

in my case i had portrait settings for the activity and changing it to landscape fixed it

9960761
width	height
my guess is that you re just mixing height and width of the preview

9960763
free	strdup
it is fine sometimes you have to do that the c function strdup does the same you just have to follow the convention to free it after use

9960784

google-chrome	firefox
in both firefox and google-chrome the second timestamp is a sensible number

9960932
hash	md5
assuming that you re only being asked to use the hash functions and not to implement the hash yourself python s hashlib module has routines for md5 and sha1

9960939
mp3	ogg
in this example a get request to should return one http url to a mp3 ogg whatever

9960943
width	height
it may have been replaced by the source parameter in the newer feed dialog api which i don t think you can define a width height for

9960945
int	chars
to get the x and y values of the array from that input we just treat the chars in inputlocation like int and subtract either 0 or a to start in the correct index

9960967
initializer	class-method
i d like to split some of my classes into other files and have most of my database logic in those other class-method and keep application.py for the routes and initializer these other classes when needed and passing the necessary data to them for the database

is there a shorthand way of changing this while keeping the min and max as their default values or would have to manually put in -214.

9961426
put	get
what i want to get is the coordinates of all those anchor points and put it into a file

9961434
imagemagick	minimagick	imagemagick	mogrify	minimagick	mogrify
minimagick instead dynamically generates methods by iterating through a list of mogrify_commands that match up with numerous dash-prefixed options specified in imagemagick s mogrify documentation

9961434
imagemagick	mogrify
according to the imagemagick docs mogrify -crop takes an argument geometry

9961434
width	height
mogrify -crop can take a geometry as a string width x height + xoffset + yoffset so we just need to build a similar string

9961459
width	height
or try adjusting your configuration by removing the px from the height and width settings

9961460
unix	bsd
if you have code to an existing bsd socket unix server that does what you want i would create a secondary thread and just use the existing code on that thread

9961460
unix	bsd
the best instructions for using bsd sockets is unix network programming by stevens

9961467
post	get
so in your post call the data variable will get that value once the jquery post call make a call to the inert.php file

9961467
submit	submission
if you are calling the above javascript in a submit button click you should do a return false at the end otherwise it will go for the normal form submission and you will not be able to notice that it did an ajax post

9961495
opera	google-chrome
also see the javascript resizeto function not working in google-chrome and opera

9961527
super	self
that prints out self 0xa83dc50 super 0xbfffe8d0

9961527
super	implements
thanks to bbum for pointing out that this value is the stack address of a special struct used by the compiler to implements the super behavior

9961540
innodb	myisam
the exact method depends on whether you re using myisam or innodb tables

9961591
children	parent
-if a child allocates memory will the parent other children be able to access it

9961623
super	self
i ran nslog self p super p self super and it printed out self 0xa83dc50 super 0xbfffe8d0 leading me to ask this question

9961628
width	height
if you can please clarify why you need the width and height of the image

9961651
inherited	properties
basically divobj inherited all the properties of or jquery i.e if you try to print jquery.fn.jquery will also print the same version like 1.7.1

9961683
disk	ram
but one approach might be to write your logs to a ram disk

9961708
spaces	delimiter
the result list contains the spaces delimiter string

9961727
preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder	postorder	inorder
let s say the module is a binary search tree and i want to add three new functions preorder postorder and inorder that each traverse the tree differently and print the data at each node

9961739
do.call	lapply
or in all its gory detail a base r solution using split lapply do.call and rbind

9961744
folder	directory
are you sure you copied the new db to your assets folder so it could be moved into the database directory again

9961795
postgresql	mysql
for the following mysql create database statement what would be the equivalent in postgresql

9961808
binutils	automake
m4 binutils autoconf automake updated newest for required by gcc 4.7 build

9961855
implements	extends
those classes inputstream bufferedreader does not implements the same interfaces nor extends the same class but you can creat one from the other

9961858
children	parent
i am stuck on writing a correct query to retrieve the code values from just those child records that are the children of a single parent record

9961867
inline	inlining
profiling both methods and manual inlining of the first one showed no difference in performance so i can only assume that both methods get inline and work in the same or similar manner at least on my vm

9961882
sorting	filtering
everyone of the fields will be subjected to some type of filtering query sorting but in particular i wanted to do some type of intelligent textual search of the info and info2 columns

9961925
post	get
if you want to get into detail about what the means and what alternatives are possible dave abrahams wrote quite a detailed post on c++ next about it

9961931
tcpclient	networkstream
once the tcpclient object is connected call the getstream method to get a networkstream object that you can read and write to to send and receive data to the server process

9961932
folder	directory
you should check the permissions of your home folder and your sites directory to make sure that they allow apache access

9961939
post	put
if this is too vague i can post my code to put it in context

9961964
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you could use offsetx y and layerx y but layerx y is deprecated in webkit google-chrome and safari and firefox does not have offsetx y

9961994
inline	inlining
it s can be kind of hard to explain what the jitter does when it inline - it does not chage the c# code to do the inlining - it will always

9962030
folder	directory
you need to add the firephpcore folder to the same directory that this code is being run in

9962047
joptionpane	jspinner
i m trying to put a jspinner in a joptionpane as follows

9962048
getter	setter
a serializable javabean with two properties long id and string value a default constructor and a constructor filling both properties a bunch of appropriate getter setter equals and hashcode overriden

9962122
children	parent
a node has a parent children and some other things

9962135
folder	directory
but this code is not yet able to flag warnings if any particular file under a folder is opened by an editor which is another cause that makes a directory not deletable

9962212
int	double
since your extern declaration says var is a double when it s actually an int attempting to access it as a double causes undefined behavior

9962212
int	double
in reality however in a typical case a double will be eight bytes where an int is four bytes

9962212
int	double
it s also possible that probably on a big-endian machine instead of the bytes corresponding to var happening to be in the right place on the stack for printf to access them as an int that the other four bytes that would make up a double will end up in that place and it would print garbage

9962216
for-loop	arrays
the problem is that you have in the outer for-loop and then simply assign max1 to numincommon if max1 is contained within the second arrays

9962226
superclass	subclassing
i would think you should instead say that a subclassing instance can be equal to its superclass instance

9962226
superclass	subclassing
your subclassing might have added many new instance variables for example but if you set it equal to a superclass those ivars are lost or at least the superclass doesn t recognize them so it isn t truly capturing the object it would seem

9962226
superclass	subclassing
going the other way saying the makes sense since everything in the superclass is in the subclassing

9962226
superclass	subclassing
you just don t get values for the extra ivars that are in the subclassing but not in the superclass they might be set to default zero but at least they exist

9962235
width	height
you would probably want to use glortho 0.0 width 0.0 height -1.0 1.0 to setup your projection matrix

9962255
superclass	subclassing
a superclass pointer can point to an object allocated from the subclassing since the class members of the superclass are always present in the subclassing

9962255
superclass	subclassing
this isn t true the other way around since the subclassing has members that are not present in the superclass

9962299
post	get
i can get all of a user s post but i can t find any way to fetch everything a user have +1ed or commented on

9962323
hash	salt
adding a user-specific salt to the password as a hash defends against an attacker who can obtain the password hash and who knows the system

9962372
width	height
however i am calling this at the time of the creation when it can t get the actual values of the width and height

9962394
min	max
normalize the data using max and min values from both the dimensions

9962422
audiotrack	audiorecord
is it not suitable for using audiotrack and audiorecord class on the same side

9962446
lattice	hmisc
for the record here s a lattice solution which uses a couple of functions from the hmisc package

9962507
multiplying	add
to decipher ciphertext you need to multiplying the ciphertext by the modular inverse of r add the offset you applied and then convert back to a character from the numeric unicode representation

9962507
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
in short you need to get the unicode for a character subtract some offset multiplying by 2 add 2 and take the mod of that number mod 26 to encipher something

9962507
multiplying	add
to reverse the process multiplying the ciphertext minus 1 by the modular inverse add the offset and convert back to a character

9962558
google-chrome	firefox
i have found in some articles saying that firefox s javascript engine partially adopt google-chrome s v8 feature ï¼œor even some sourcecode are from v8

9962558
google-chrome	firefox
if soï¼œcan i say that replacing the javascript engine in firefox with google-chrome s v8 is just easy as pie

9962604
width	height
product_info length product_info height product_info width

9962605
width	height
it seems you need to add the width height attributes to your canvas

9962605
width	height
i tried canvas id d width 300 height 300 on a fiddle and it worked

9962611
post	get
while i do a huge post request a file upload that takes more than a minute i can do other get requests at the same time

9962629
post	get
this means that thin does async receiving of your post request while serving get requests in the meanwhile

9962632
xpages	lotus
i am working in xpages on lotus notes 8.5.3

9962715
mdpi	hdpi
all i do is scale image using gimp and put them into hdpi ldpi and mdpi

9962736
mdpi	hdpi
in android we have phones of different resloution and a single app code we develop supports multi resolution in order to maintain in the image clarity we need to have images in hdpi mdpi ldpi

9962753
post	get
i m trying to send a simple post to a web service but the server doesn t seem to get the post data

9962771
union	distinct
but since you need to access the same fields in two distinct ways y- a and x- a are different i would use union

9962775
fast-forward	merge
merge your new_feature to master branch without fast-forward mode

9962795
hide	show
to hide the containing divs of those not selected and have the reset show them here s a demo

9962829
ienumerable	iqueryable
the difference between iqueryable and ienumerable is important when dealing with remote data but that s what the repository does in the first place it hides the fact you re dealing with a storage which can be remote

9962866
express	node.js
the most popular framework for node.js right now is express but express doesn t even include a way to connect to a database

9962866
django	turbogears
for comparison note the relative obscurity of python s turbogears a bunch of disconnected parts compared to django

9962866
django	turbogears
django ate turbogears lunch because it s cohesive and consistent

9962881
range	max
i guess the final formula will be some sort of combination of countifs and max on the date range columns but i can t see how i can apply this on a row-by-row basis

9962921
post	get
check this post for answer to get mime type which should be set for your content type

9962979
onclick	onchange
shiftfocus is called onchange and scategories is called onclick

9963018
jruby	mri
like the guy who started the thread i have an ubuntu os 11.04 und mri and jruby installed

9963020
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is showing up images great in firefox safari and google-chrome but in internet explorer it shows a nice red cross and i assume it is because of the encoding

9963021
rss	feed
i have records with no time attached so with the rss feed i m just getting 00 00

9963081
ubuntu	debian
its called libqt4-opengl-dev on ubuntu and debian

9963141
post	get
i made a previous post and i fixed the issue in that problem but i get something weirder now

9963161
mouseleave	mouseenter
also i puted the mouseenter mouseleave methods instead of the old ones under the .prod divs because when you get your mouse on the desc it had a strange effect

9963180
width	height
how can i constraint carmen such the width and height are pre defined the spacing between characters is rendered by the browser

9963213
letter-spacing	font-size
if the header always stays the same you can also adjust the font-size and letter-spacing attributes until it fits

9963229
children	parent
then to loop through the children in the parent div you can do

9963246
setinterval	settimeout
does settimeout work from within setinterval

9963246
setinterval	settimeout
it only has settimeout which does not seem to be working from within my setinterval loop

9963255
post	get
it is not invoked during those phases when i perform an initial get load of the view.xhtml with id parameter only during a form submission post and subsequent redirect and get

9963257
implements	extends
you have to implements yourself this validation you can do that using model validation or you can extends the django-uploadify form and add some validation there

9963298
free	malloc
you allocate with malloc and when finished you call free on it this is important to avoid memory leaks

9963300
hash	md5
name etc hosts it would be better to accept an image id instead of a file name or a hash of the file name you can use md5 to generate the hash but remember to name the image files according to their md5 hash in this case you always lookup the image file only in the images directory

9963316
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout works perfectly inside of setinterval but since you re trying to emulate sleep which javascript does not do or have it sounds to me like you are trying to write synchronous code when settimeout works asynchronously

9963394
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome actually returns the correct values after rotation but firefox does not

9963394
width	height
so there doesn t appear to be any normal way to get the top and left positions after rotating unless there is some kind of formula that could calculate it based on the height and width and the angle

9963413
ostream	istream
that works fine but i want to use this for full duplex i o where one thread can input while another is outputting so i d like to use an istream for the receiving thread and ostream for the sending one while sharing the network streambuf as that abstracts all the socket stuff

9963413
ostream	istream
my question is to what extent are the streambuf members affected by input operations on an istream disjoint from the streambuf members affected by output operations on an ostream if the input and output buffers are separate

9963413
ostream	istream
it would be better to be able to do that rather than have to separate the socket stuff from my streambuf abstraction so the socket can be shared between istream and ostream with separate streambufs--then i d also need two versions of the streambuf--one with a single internal buffer for use in either istream only or ostream only and one with two internal buffers as i have now for use in iostream.

9963527
oncreate	onstart	onresume	onpause
onpause method is called followed by the onstop and then the method oncreate of second activity is called followed by onstart and then onresume

9963527
onresume	onpause
onpause method of second activity is called followed by the onstop and then the method onrestart of first activity is called followed by onstart and then onresume

9963605
vim	emacs
why did i meet so many vim and emacs fans fanatics and hardly any fanatic of xcode visual studio code blocks eclipse dev-cpp whatever

9963605
vim	emacs
could anyone explain me if there is anything wrong in being programmer and not knowing any of this hardcore ones emacs vim just using for example xcode for writing a game in objective-c and c++ textwrangler for ruby js and so on

9963605
vim	emacs
i know emacs vim are really old and what comes with that more experienced but are they better anyhow

9963605
vim	emacs
don t get me wrong i m not against using emacs vim - i m currently experimenting with one and another and i m not underestimating their power i just want to know what s wrong with these modern ides

9963617
implements	extends
public class mypaypalactivity extends activity implements onclicklistener

9963621
google-chrome	firefox
this works prefectly in firefox but not in google-chrome

9963625
vim	emacs
is there anything wrong with being a programmer and not knowing vim emacs

9963682
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
using core animation you can make navigationcontroller s pushviewcontroller like animation on writing code in thirdvc s viewwillappear method

9963721
int	chars
so since the difference in int s between and is identical to the difference in chars s between and - you get the same result for both

9963739
rss	feed
the google product feed rss 2.0 example in their docs doesn t include a doctype either

9963740
google-chrome	firefox
is there any java script library to fix all css and other issues associated with internet explorer 7 8 9 and make it work like google-chrome firefox

9963763
vim	emacs
on the other hand my friends who knew linux better than me preferred vim and emacs

9963763
vim	emacs
vim and emacs are designed with two principles in mind to be available in terminal environments with limited graphics and keyboard capabilities vim does not require two keys to be pressed at the same time to invoke a command for instance and to increase productivity of programmer for example keyboard shortcuts in emacs are designed to be easily accessible - save exit equals to ctrl+x s ctrl+x c

9963763
vim	emacs
you may save exit fast in emacs but you have auto-completion feature in visual studio but you can work only with keyboard in vim but.

9963790
pop-up	dialog
not working means that execute returns false without a pop-up see updated code example always the message false pop-up without being preceded by the dialog

9963791
width	height
then see which one fits your needs better and resize to img_width height or width img_height

9963801
jruby	rubinius
but using either jruby or rubinius which don t have the gil allow for true threading which in the long run allows for a lot more efficient memory usage better garbage collection and allows you to use threads where you would normally spin up new processes

9963814
translation	localization
to the info.plist file those localization will be shown on the app store and i can translation the meta-data for this via itunes-connect like this

9963822
hash	md5
according to this post spl_object_hash creates md5 hash of the internal pointer of the object

9963893
onresume	onpause
as the article points out for a running activity onpause onresume are always called when the power button is used to blank unblank the display so if you have something that you don t mind doing even in those cases for which the power button was not the reason for the onpause or onresume call you can do it in those methods and thereby catch every instance of the power button being used to blank or unblank the screen along with calls due to other causes without the overhead of creating a broadcastreceiver

9963893
onresume	onpause
in fact as the article shows even if you only want to respond to the power button events the proper way to do that is to set a flag in the broadcastreceiver and then test that flag in onpause and or onresume to see if the power button was the specific cause of the call to those methods

9963947
128bit	64bit	16-bit	64bit
with intel compiler intrinsics given a 128bit register packing 8 16-bit elements how do i access cheaply arbitrary elements from within the register for subsequent use of _mm_cvtepi8_epi64 sign extend two 8-bit elements packed at the lower 16-bit of the register to two 64bit elements

9963962
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
other browsers like safari firefox and google-chrome do it correctly

9964070
children	parent
i ve set up a parent and a child however some children don t have parent

9964070
children	parent
these stray children need a handler to put them in a new parent or model like foster parent and have a way to access the foster parent and iterate with a foreach in a separate list

9964102
gridview	onclientclick
then another activity that show the selected image in full screen will be appeared when one of image in gridview is onclientclick

9964179
istream	getline
there s a version of getline that s a member of std istream that will do it

9964203
getter	setter
if it is should getter setter be declared in the interface or only business methods

9964219
google-chrome	firefox
for me this snippet is working perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

9964226
children	parent
when parent checkbox is checked all children checkbox will be checked

9964226
children	parent
i am looking for a plugin that is smart and flexible to define which is parent and which are children

9964231
gridview	onclientclick
in your gridview onclientclick you are starting activity with startactivityforresults intent 0

9964232
getter	setter
several classes with the same interface might implement it in a different way so there s no need to specify variables and thus getter and setter in the interface

9964242
getter	setter
interface definately shouldn t contain getter and setter

9964242
getter	setter
interface provides only functionality that your class can perform if you need getter setter - use abstract classes

9964278
jobs	cron
it could be handy but somehow over killed for normal cron jobs

9964286
submit	submission
add a input with type submit element which is hidden to support submission by the enter key

9964327
put	get
it s not invoked during those phases when i perform an initial get load because when you perform a get the component tree isn t traversed in those phases only the metadata is processed which is the reason view params are put in a special metadata section

9964327
post	get
in order to make the id that you received from the get request available in the action method after the post back you d best use the view scope viewscoped for your backing bean

9964501
width	height
i need to do calculation like a x y sum from z 0 till z n b x y z +c x y z where matrix a has dimensions height width and matrix b c has dimensions height width n

9964512
hide	show
edit however if you often show and hide the form and you can easily change the code to make it use the same formular then go for it because sometimes memory leaks are difficult to recognize especially in case of events etc

9964521
superclass	subclassing
once in your subclassing do ctrl + o windows this will list the methods that you can override which includes the standard ones as well as the methods from your superclass

maven	m2e
disclaimer i like maven and m2e and i have not experienced any of the issues that you mention

9964656
button	checkbox
if only one of the four possible answers for each question is correct it seems more logical to make single choice questions radio button rather than multiple choice checkbox groups

i kept the width and height in the span html above only because the original question by both gviswanathan and tomas requested it

9969902

i imagine most implementations of settimeout and setinterval are set to wait at least the amount of time you specify

9970101
addclass	removeclass
toggleclass in the one function instead of addclass and removeclass and unsurprisingly it s impossible to reproduce the click problem

9972212
free	malloc
what is the use of malloc and free when we have new and delete in c++

9972225
free	malloc
also it s undefined behavior mixing the two using new with free and malloc with delete

9972225
free	malloc
in c++ you re supposed to use new and delete malloc and free are there for compatibility reasons with c

9972264
ssl	https
i m having hard time trying to force https ssl to particular page on codeiginiter framework

9972268
free	malloc
in c++ it is rarely useful that one would use malloc free instead of new delete

9972268
free	malloc
if you do not want to get your memory initialized by implicit constructor calls and just need an assured memory allocation for placement new then it is perfectly fine to use malloc and free instead of new and delete

9972268
memset	malloc
new guarantees callng of constructors of your class for initializing the class members while malloc does not one would have to do an additional memset or related function calls post an malloc to initialize the allocated memory to do something meaningful

9972280
google-chrome	firefox
onclick event is not working on ie and google-chrome but it is working fine in firefox

9972375

4 each enumerated type shall be compatible with chars a signed int type or an unsigned int type

9972416
explode	implode
and what are the other methods i can use to find it them without implode then explode

9972423
getter	setter
well i dont think entity pojo as interface makes any sense because entity or pojo has properties with getter and setter and used for data

9972435
versioning	upgrade
we are using very old versioning of spring 2.0.6 in our code we were trying to upgrade it to the latest 3.1.1.release but facing issues

9972444
explode	implode
the best way is this as you mentioned implode and explode

9972457
getter	setter
i have put logging in the getter and setter and it is never set to the value that is being returned

9972481
width	height
however these will typically adapt the width and not height of elements since all web pages can be scrolled vertically

9972499
g++	gcc
-g in gcc and g++

9972527
boost	stl
i couldn t find an equivalent to boost unwrap_reference in the stl is there an other straight forward way to do this

9972580
interbase	firebird
i am guessing it is either an interbase or a firebird file but i am having trouble working out exactly which

9972580
interbase	firebird
furthermore it isn t clear exactly which version of interbase or firebird was used to create the file

9972580
interbase	firebird
i have tried various different software to read this file flamerobin firebird s isql.exe and also the latest version of interbase and the error messages i get tell me the ods on disk structure is version 9

9972580
interbase	firebird
which is quite old and dates to around the time that firebird was forked from interbase

9972580
interbase	firebird
i have managed to connect to the database and query it using firebird but some errors i m getting lead me to believe it is actually an interbase database i can explain further if required

9972580
interbase	firebird
is it an interbase or firebird file and if so which version was it written with

9972598
client-side	server-side
if i were to build my server-side via warp and had a javascript client-side

apache	nginx
any reason why you do not want to bypass symfony entirely and just serve the file via your http server apache nginx etc

9972670
winpcap	libpcap	winpcap	pcap.net	libpcap	pcap.net
if pcap.net is a wrapper for winpcap it is not possible - libpcap winpcap can t block incoming packets or modify them before they reach the networking stack it can only passively capture packets and inject them

9972693
unsigned	short
now lastchar is really just an unsigned short so you can compare it like so

9972720
range	max	range	min	min	max
you could partition your data into time range and calculate the min max for that time range

9972720
range	max
using that information you can filter out time range max value for a range is 50 and you search for v0 60 then the interval is out

9972748
explode	implode
str_word_count works on a string which means you only need to implode not to explode again and using a second argument of 1 will count the occurrences of each word

9972750

floating-point	fixed-point
now converting fixed-point numbers to floating-point and invoking printf are expensive operations and they usually destroy any performance gained by using fixed-point

9988415
floating-point	fixed-point
also note that if your platform is doing fixed-point because floating-point operations are forbidden or not available then you ll have to do something different along the lines of manually doing the decimal conversion

nstextfield	nstableview
i think the nstableview acts as the delegate for an nstextfield that gets instantiated as a black box delegate for the nstextfieldcell

9990317
chain-of-responsibility	visitor
there are other patterns that may be applicable depending on your exact needs such as visitor or perhaps a chain-of-responsibility type pattern where you chain your receivers together in a linked list type construct and each one calls the next in a recursive construct - this would be nice as fetchdata wouldn t need to know it is getting a collection it just gets a reference to the top adapter in the chain

9990429
rubygems	bundler
not using bundler to start your app lets rubygems satisfy the requirements of your app according to it s own method and that is a fairly random - i would be quite surprised if your app is currently running all the same gem versions that you ran your tests on for instance eek

9990429
rubygems	bundler
the approach i usually take is to uninstall all the gems from the server install a single version of rubygems and bundler and then rely exclusively on bundler to maintain my app s gems

9990801
for-loop	loops
it looks like in the first example you are passing in 2 data objects and a string however in loops you are passing in 3 strings and no data object i believe in javascript you would need to use eval or something similar if you wanted to pass a data object called data n for each iteration of the for-loop

9990872

i have few jar files which i am not getting from any repositories.i have these jar files in web-inf lib folder for src directory

9991138
getter	setter
why in c# is it standard convention to define properties with the getter before the setter

9991138
getter	setter
for properties with both you re almost always going to use the setter before the getter so it s in a valid state

9991138
getter	setter
also the setter would typically have some validation logic which the getter doesn t need

9991138
getter	setter
the code in the setter is far more interesting than the getter should it not take precedence and be defined first

9991138
getter	setter
i know there are no rules with these things but practically every example ever ever of properties defines the getter before the setter

9991140
strlen	strcpy
the example above is not going to work as expected it is not going to iterate over all the characters within a because strings in c are null terminated and this is how various functions strlen strcpy and others know that they have reached the end of a stream of chars

9991141
post	get
this will make the link a get request not a post request that might be the issue try using a simple link and replace post will get in your routes.rb just to test if the issue is arising due to this

9991179
opera	firefox
this works fine in webkit mobile and desktop and firefox yet when i try to open the page in opera 11.6 or the internet explorer 7 to 9 hell breaks loose

9991231
hex	binary
it may be simple ascii text or binary hex codes

9991303
range	max
use a zset to index the max value of your range

9991303
range	max
retrieve the unique range whose max value is greater than an ip

9991303
range	min
check the the min value of this range is lower than the ip

9991303
range	max
score is the max value member is the id of the range

9991303
range	minimum
then the client program just has to check that your ip is greater or equal than the minimum address of the returned range

9991312
getter	setter
the order of the getter and setter are totally irrevelant i think the reason for the convention is visual studio s property snippet which generated the properties in this way getter before setter

9991316
width	height
a flexible switch couldn t resize width or height as it is system drawn for its size

9991336
post	put
i dont post the code because its alot...dont want to put two chunks of code here but essentially the php reads rows from a db section and post the latest 10 post from the db via echo

9991345
post	get	chunked	transfer-encoding
i m trying to read the post data from a request with transfer-encoding chunked while it s being sent but can t get the script to fire until after all of the data has been received is it possible to get php to be able to react to a chunked request as it s coming through

9991412
pull	push
if all of those aren t an option how about extracting the actual processing you re now doing in the webserver to an external process which the webpages communicate with via some form of rpc mechanism to push work requests and pull data

9991436
folder	directory
i have the following syntax to change the directory access permission of the logo folder in the web application

width	height
when this event is launched you are able to get the width and height of your pictures so you can set your canvas to the same size

9991573
put	get
its just a string...when someone pushes the button it should get the server time and put it in the text field.

9991581
width	height
but i want the table to have a default minimum height width should be managed by the gridlayout of the composite

9991581
width	height
there is nothing else added to the composite and the composite seems to grab all the empty space from its parent but the table does not expand to a height of 300 width is correct

9991609
width	height
most of them just vary the width of the image but doesn t shrink the height of one side and increase the height of one side to produce the effect that you are viewing the image from another angle

9991612
width	height
try using table-layout fixed on the table element and defined width height on the td

9991649

is it possible with jpa to automatically nullify children when deleting the parent

9991679
width	height
which means you will need to define what will be your width height or both will be and it will hide anything which des not fit there

9991756
google-chrome	firefox
in ie9 firefox and google-chrome

9991818
getter	setter
just don t do business job in getter setter

9991818
getter	setter
the getter setter should solely do the things as their name suggests returning a property or setting a property

9991822
children	parent
both parent and children and children of children

9991827
hide	show
certain links on the iframed page load content via ajax and then show hide it using the slidetoggle jquery animation function

9991841
jsf	seam
when you write viewscoped works - did you include seam 3 for bridging jsf-scopes to cdi or can it be that you are mixing jsf and cdi scopes

9991870
implements	extends
depending on whether you extends servlet or implements a servletcontextlistener i would recommend to create an instance variable for the context and then store it from one of these methods

9991901
for-loop	arrays
but as counters is an arrays you have to use a normal for-loop

9991942
implements	extends
by extends the application class and implements it as a singleton you get an object that will exist whenever any of your application components exist providing a centralized place to store and transfer complex object data between application components

9991948
viewdidload	viewwillappear
for example in the viewwillappear method and the viewdidload method and both give me the accurate indexpath and i even checked the array outputs and all of them return accurate results so i really don t know why it s giving me the error

9991988
width	height
the method changewidth height will set the width and the height of the layer and not the content of the layer

9992031
int	double
the argument you passed is int which is not instance of double so it returns false

9992044
int	double
as for the double comparison as explained by other answers you are comparing a double with an int in new double 0.0 .equals 0 which returns false because the objects have different types

9992051
int	double
the 0 in your first expression is interpreted as an int which may be autoboxed into an int but not to a double

9992052
hide	show
how i can show it in code and don t destroy possibility of click it to show hide how it always works

9992054
multiplying	add
if i m correct from studying the generated assembly code the ideal schedule would look like follows where the mov instruction takes 3 cycles the switch latency from the load domain to the fp domain for the dependent instructions takes 2 cycles the fp multiplying takes 4 cycles and the fp add takes 3 cycles

9992054
multiplying	add
note that the dependence from the multiplying - add doesn t incur any switch latency because the operations belong to the same domain

9992059
slideup	slidedown
i have a little question regarding to slideup and slidedown the problem is in slideup actually once i click the link the content is sliding down and thats ok but when im trying to close this slide it slidesup and slidedown automatically i mean it can t be closed once it is opened anyway hope everything will be clear after i show u the code

9992083
google-chrome	firefox

9992193
int	double
this line compares a double value of 0 which is not exact zero with int of 0

9992203
imagemagick	mogrify
a simple solution would be copy followed by mogrify - another imagemagick tool - this will keep the same names it takes all the same args as convert

9992234
google-chrome	firefox
the present implementation works fine for firefox and google-chrome

9992277
google-chrome	firefox
i installed the user script in both firefox and google-chrome the issue is the number of scripts for the same site is different in both browsers

9992277
google-chrome	firefox
i am getting the number of scripts in firefox as 17 and in google-chrome as 15

9992332
post	get
try http post instead of get or set the ifmodified and cache options to false as below

9992336
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
however i attempted to uninstall rmagick and imagemagick so that i could have a version that works with graphicsmagick

9992394
put	get
that is the most general methods at the bottom of the program and the more specialized you get the higher up in the hierarchy you should put it

9992409
post	put
ok but i m not sure how to create an archive for my custom post especially as i m not using pretty urls because it wouldn t work with my custom post so had to put it back to the default

9992425
width	height
if you don t set a width and height of the jcrop object and fancybox you need to run .fancybox.resize as a callback after you ve loaded the jcrop object

9992425
width	height
since you re loading the images dynamically the fancybox will open with a width and height of 0 otherwise

9992435
memcached	apc
on the other hand if you want to cache for a longer time multiple requests etc you should use something like memcached or apc

9992451
int	chars
secondly chars to int conversion just requires an explicit type

9992466
pop-up	dialog
when using fb.ui https hosted iframe pages give a proper modal dialog but the same page via http gives a pop-up

9992466
pop-up	dialog

9992470
opera	firefox
so when is your userscript opera or firefox s greasemonkey

9992470
google-chrome	firefox
that you are getting different counts in firefox and google-chrome may happen because you are not viewing the same page

9992505
post	get
usually you can get to the acrhive of a custom post type via exapmle.com customposttype

9992508

as you can see below there is two graphing the right side is the boxplot of all macrocosmes with the mean values and the left side is the boxplot with scatter plot of all mean the macrocosmes

9992515
memcached	apc
you can use file cache or memcached apc

9992515
memcached	apc
zend has good cache lib called zend_cache it supports many backends like file memcached apc

9992580
post	get
the html specifications technically define the difference between get and post so that former means that form data is to be encoded by a browser into a url while the latter means that the form data is to appear within a message body

9992580
post	get
might even work imo with post since the url should still be transmitted to the server but the server would need to detect that the post request is actually a get request and behave accordingly

9992704
onchange	onsubmit
you don t really need ajax just a javascript variable that gets incremented on any onchange event you place on each html input dropdown etc... then onsubmit pass that javascript variable

9992713
put	get
how can i get back exactly what i put in not unicode

9992721
client-side	server-side
finally by understanding that the custom decimalmodelbinder would only handle server-side validation and not affect the jquery.validate.js which handles the client-side validation i found a solution to the problem

9992747
google-chrome	firefox
if you already are doing things right writing both string in utf-8 the problem can be google-chrome firefox tryiing to use a font that is not unicode aware for the titles

9992754
post	put	post	get	put	get
get requests work fine but not post or put

9992761
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
you can set the height width and the margin by below code

9992774

if that doesn t work out consider to install the client server stuff in virtual machines virtualbox vmware virtualpc and use virsh to start stop them from your tests

9992834
post	get
the sends a post request but you apparently want to send a get request

9992843
mouseleave	mouseenter
note that hover isn t an actual event the function is just a shorthand for binding to two different events mouseenter and mouseleave

9992845
post	get
if you post up your html there is most likely a better way to traverse the dom to get to the checkbox

9992910
post	get
you are using a post instead of a get

9992910
post	get
the post call above will give you and error where as the get method will not

9992959

add a new for-loop inside the outer loops of sorting to print the values after each pass

9992984
inherited	properties
i know of at least one control vendor componentone who has a control that inherited from textbox and provides a watermark properties

9993019
hide	show
the clusterer show and hide the individual markers by calling setmap so it is likely overriding your call to setmap null

9993029
width	height
set the geometry call qlabel setgeometry x y width height

9993032
folder	directory
ssh to that node and identify the location of the hadoop.log.dir directory check the mapred-site.xml for this node - my guess is the hadoop user does not have the correct permissions to create sub-directories in this folder

9993049
inherited	subclassing
and finally i can access just the things i need from all the classes that inherited class b the ones that would be concrete decorators in a controlled manner as opposed to through the access function without the need to make all the subclassing of b friend s of class a

9993107
bde	dbase
i have got a ttable component that uses the bde to access a dbase table

9993107
bde	dbase
i was under the impression that with this constellation bde + dbase it is also possible to set the recno property to move to the corresponding record

9993154
g++	gcc
can i import apache axis 2 into say eclipse or any other ide and just point it to the arm g++ gcc compiler and just click compile

9993170
width	height
iframe id xxxx width 70px height 70px scrolling no src content.html

9993177

you have to defien a properties such as ipaddress and its accessor method

9993178
haskell	ocaml
this would be a task for a maybe x in haskell or an x option in ocaml

9993237
superclass	subclassing
the only solution which i have found is to declare the interface in both superclass and subclassing

9993272
post	put
i want to retrieve html from a server don t know how so you may see a post from me concerning that and put that in a text field maybe uiwebview but how do i know when the ui is ready

9993382
paradox	dbase
tbdedataset implements recno setter only for paradox not dbase

9993386
for-loop	arrays
if you are saying that the arrays is empty because the for-loop was not entered it is probably because your integer i is not initialized

9993386
for-loop	arrays
therefor it contains some garbage value which was likely higher than the value of self.arrayquattro.count making it appear that the arrays was empty hopped over the for-loop

9993414
implements	modifiers
pass only a read-only interface of subject to observers - this is the easiest to implements with no side effects however an evil observer may still attempt to downcast subject to access its modifiers methods and or to access the full subject via some other object s

9993441
firefox	safari
the jquery file change event is not working in ie yet works perfectly in safari firefox etc

9993445

9993539
width	height
note the text gets clipped to the given width though just that it doesnt seem to clip to given height

9993552
disk	ram
with even more variables or if you want to manipulate the values a lot or if you don t have huge tables or disk space ram is not an issue or if you are not sure what to pick i would consider bit n or bit varying n short varbit n

9993552
int	boolean
for just 3 bits of information individual boolean columns get by with 3 bytes an int needs 4 bytes maybe additional alignment padding and a bit string 6 bytes 5 + 1

9993552
int	boolean
for 32 bits of information an int still needs 4 bytes + padding a bit string occupies 9 bytes for the same 5 + 4 and boolean columns occupy 32 bytes

9993552
int	boolean
this answer on how to transform the types boolean bit n and int may be of help too

use attr src to get the src attribute

9993844
.htaccess	httpd.conf
it works fine in my httpd.conf file but not if i move to .htaccess

9993891
width	height
what you need to do is calculating the proportions of the original image to resize it to your desired width and height after that you should have the calculated size value to pass to the serving url and get what you want

9993924
decoder	encoder
it is design to work with a concept of encoder and decoder that could fit your need there are a lot of default implementation of encoder and decoder for zipping using ssl.

9993924
decoder	encoder
than it should be quite easy to write both the encoder and the decoder in each language

9993938
3des	aes
note that people often suggest that using older algorithms gets better performance not a very good tradeoff imho but that s generally not the case you ll need to test it against the library you use and aes ends up way faster at least from 3des

another way to do it if you don t want to specify the pom.xml as a dependency the maven dependency plugin has a get mojo that allows downloading of named artifacts from a remote repository

9994656
for-loop	loops
the range based for-loop is just a loops so any state that is to be used outside of loops has to be declared outside of that scope

if you malloc be sure you free later

9995248
interpolation	splines
a starting point would be scipy.ndimage.zoom which can use splines linear or nearest-neighbor interpolation and does exactly what you want

9995248
interpolation	splines
specifying will give nearest-neighbor interpolation will give linear interpolation and anything greater than 1 will give the specified order of splines interpolation

9995248
interpolation	splines
with splines interpolation this commonly leads to strong artifacts near the edges of the array

9995286
filtering	grouping
i have a dropdown that allows the user to filtering the table for those customers who members of a particular grouping

9995286
filtering	grouping
if i do regular filtering see below and the user selects grouping 1 from the dropdown it will still show customers who are members of grouping 10

9995286
filtering	grouping
so a filtering for grouping 1 will show those in grouping 1 without grabbing grouping 10 too

9995569

mouseleave	mouseenter
and also you dont need mouseenter end mouseleave functions

9995689
mouseleave	mouseenter
i think the problem is the fact that you are assigning mouseenter and mouseleave handlers within the mouseenter and mouseleave functions of hover and you are also referencing all .mainlevel elements when setting the css not just the current element

9995691
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i did use viewdidappear because viewdidload is not called since i dont use initwithnib

3des has a 8 byte blocksize compared with 16 bytes for aes which can lead to a bit more overhead when using it in block mode encryption

9998385
3des	aes
none of the three reasons above is generally enough to choose 3des or blowfish over aes of course

10012201
svg	vml
it uses javascript to produce graphs in svg and in old versions of ie vml which makes it a great cross-browser starting point - it works in ie6 and above and doesn t need flash

10012201
svg	vml
another good advantage is using svg vml dom elements controlled by a javascript object means your graph elements can be made highly interactive and manipulated in javascript at any time

to do this use the same code provided in the answer you used for the onresume and onpause methods

10012555

mspec	moles
see is there a workaround for setting hosttype moles when dealing with anonymous methods in mspec

10012805
mstest	moles
mstest but moles is being promoted to microsoft.fakes with vs 11

10012805
mspec	nspec
close substitutes i ve found for mspec such as nspec

10012805

only generate nunit tests not mstest

10012827
min	max
you can combine them and then call min or max

10012837
width	height
in the attributes you need to tell the runtime that you re expecting the width and height as an url parameter

10012837
width	height
at the moment the runtime assumes that you re calling the url without parameters but the method being called expects parameters so the runtime really doesn t know how to find the values to pass to your method for width and height

10013070
consistency	acid
so your concurrency consistency isolation guarantees drop from the whole database acid to only one row

10013128
width	height
in order to do that you have to take the dimensions of your camera 1024x768 in our example and check to see if the sprite s position is inside the rectangle of the camera s view - which is the position of the camera s upper-left corner plus the camera s width and height

10013128

10013287
folder	directory
i have removed the assets folder from my public directory

10013300
getter	setter
i think your properties are causing a stackoverflowexception because the getter and setter invoke themselves in an endless loop dtype - dtype - dtype ...

10013303
getter	setter
you have a property referring to itself and thus calling its own getter and setter inside respectively the getter and setter

10013316
pull	push
i ve created a gem that run as daemon and automatically pull changes from a git repo precompiles assets commit and push back

10013645
width	height
less than both the width and height of the map the transition will be

10013645
width	height
but if we need a mechanism to animate even if the change is greater than the width height of the map how can we do that

10013652
converter	multibinding
i need to use a multibinding to get the stringformat property used in the converter

10013658
width	height
the width and the height are set to pct values because the application has several sizes that can be chosen by the user so the correct size is set on the embed s width attribute

10013672
width	height
i have double checked that the width height set in xaml are correct and same as the fw mockup so no idea what s wrong with it

10013707
slideup	slidedown
another thought has been to write a plugin that extends the slideup slidedown animate classes to take an argument that contains 1 or more html elements and mirrors the animation of the target object

10013734
charindex	substr
i ve done similar tasks in ms-excel using string concatenation and string manipulation functions like substr charindex

put	get
i m trying to put textures into my java opengl scene but when i do the colours of other things get skewed as if it is blending the colours incorrectly

10013860

you can manually set the width and height if you know it or calculate it dynamically each time you switch your css classes

10013891
hide	show
i use jquery to show and hide one or the other

10013918
hash	salt
oki so i want to hash my password by appending random salt in .net

10013918
hash	salt
the inbuilt classes i m using for this purpose are rngcryptoserviceprovider - to generate the random salt and rfc2898derivebytes - to hash the actual password

10013918
pbkdf2	salt
the reason i want to make it work with ascii encoding is because the same db in which this hashvalue is stored will also be used by a php application the hashvalue produced by pbkdf2 implementaion of php matches the hashvalue of rfc2898derivebytes only if the salt encoding is ascii

10013966
width	height
you could also give it a very large pixel value rather than 100 for the height and width if you don t want to use position fixed

10014030
d3.js	raphael
however i have not been able to apply the d3.js force layout to raphael drawn svg objects

post	get
i could post some code but i am not sure which code to post since this problem permeates the entire site and there is way more code than i could possibly get into one post

10014451
slideup	slidedown
either use slidedown or slideup on both elements or use .animate on both elements to mess with default full height

10014451
slideup	slidedown
with that being said here are both examples using slidedown slideup and .animate

10014457

iboutlet	ibaction
i know that they are in fact connected to both their iboutlet and ibaction as i ve tried some nslog-ing to make sure of that

10015038
width	height
what happens is that when amcharts creates the svg it needs to or at least decides to define the width and height in absolute terms

10015038
width	height
this forces a recalculation of the width and height based on the div s new current dimensions

10015058
nhibernate	queryover
if you are using linq with ef why not use linq with nhibernate too instead of queryover

10015063

10015214
updatepanel	contentplaceholder
source triggering an updatepanel in a different contentplaceholder

10015222
width	height
remove the width height strings from your binding constructor and it should work

10015237
width	height
the window s width will expand to the 200px you set on your grid but then you have no control to dictate which height the window needs to have

10015262
actualheight	actualwidth
the content class does not raise a propertychanged event when actualheight and actualwidth change

10015265
cldc	midp
the configuration is cldc 1.1 midp 2.0

10015308

folder	directory
is there a way to get the directory size folder size without actually traversing this directory and adding size of each file in it

10015345
post	get
second perhaps your plugin works on pre-creation and pre-creation means that the record does not exist yet in the database but if you changed the plugin to post then you can get the guid of the newly created record

10015366
actualheight	actualwidth
if you absolutely want to go the actualwidth actualheight route in silverlight you d have to do something like.

10015447
width	height
jquery functionality for example width height or left can be

10015481
for-loop	arrays
it is also very fast to use instead of arrays and do a simple for-loop

10015537
int	chars
once that is done you can go in and tweak the data types to better fit your needs if desired and you can add your own restrictions to the data such as requiring that an xs int value be in a range of 0 and 50 or an xs string value be less than 10 chars long - there are dozens of other possibilities but that should give you the idea

10015540
pull	push
i haven t tested this there is a chance that it might let you only pull and push from and to the same repository

10015542
maven	pom.xml
these should also be managed with maven using mvn deploy deploy-file as described on and imported in your pom.xml

10015551
lsp	principles
doing so by throwing exceptions would violate the liskov substitution principles lsp

10015551
getter	setter
i also tried to work with two interfaces ireadonly and iwriteonly having only a getter or a setter respectively

10015551
getter	setter
obviously it is not possible to synthesize a property from separate getter and setter as i expected

10015601
filesystems	fat
for fat filesystems and its descendants the list of invalid characters is larger and includes

the fastest types for the buffer seem to be unsigned chars and both signed and unsigned versions of short int long

edit 2 viewwillappear viewdidappear gets called when the view is added to the uiapplicationdidenterforegroundnotification notification in your view controller and respond appropriately when that message is posted

the min and max for the range are the expected values from your input but if we turn the range into an array the last element is u1036 and it s successor is u1000

min	max
under the covers range# must be enumerating the string#succ sequence rather than simple bound checking on min and max

btw as a work around you could use a range of int ordinals and test against ordinals if you only care about single chars

now normally as a software engineer you would not intentionally put yourself in a situation where you needed to get at 10 bytes at address 5 you would probably do 12 bytes at 0x4 or 16 at 0x0 or something along those lines even if you only use 10 of them you would align them more logically

there s very little that it offers in benefits over direct2d and directwrite which are both what microsoft is pushing as the replacements for gdi gdi+

10021965
directwrite	direct2d
there might be some benefit to using opengl if you absolutely must target windows xp because as far as i can tell direct2d directwrite are only supported on vista and later but that s because as i mentioned originally windows xp falls squarely into the legacy or obsolete camp itself

10021965
directwrite	direct2d
alternatively if you already know opengl well and don t have time or the desire to learn direct2d directwrite then it might make sense to continue using it in a new application

10021965

edit hmm it looks like directwrite has also been declared by some people at least obsolete as well having been replaced by direct2d

10028244
client-side	server-side
the answer depends on whether you need to get this table server-side or client-side

10028308
salt	md5
i am working on a system that has been hashing user passwords with md5 no salt

10028308
hash	md5
while this is easy enough to implement for future passwords i d like to also retrofit the existing md5 hash passwords preferably without forcing all the users to change their passwords

10028308
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
my idea is to just use sha-512 and and an appropriate salt to hash the existing md5 hash

10028308
hash	md5
i can either then set some flag in the database that indicates which passwords were hash from plain text and which ones were hash from an md5 hash

10028308
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
or even just hash new passwords with md5 and then sha-512 salt so they can be treated the same as old passwords

10028308
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
programmatically i don t think this will be a problem but i don t know enough about encryption hashing to know if i m compromising the quality of the hash in any way by applying a sha-512 salt hash to a password that was already md5 hash

10028319
inherited	subclassing
inherited is used when a subclassing is needed that is basically a specific type of the parent class

note that you cannot know if the implements class only calls the super

10028346
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i get the first result firefox safari and google-chrome

10028358
hash	md5
probably hash your new passwords with md5 and then hash the md5 with your password hashing library

10028361
versioning	upgrade
the thing is that the release process upgrade versioning of the pom.xml after every build

10028395

width	height
i found another way to capture from webcam and also set some properties like preferred width and height

10028512
hash	md5
if you hash with md5 first you will only have the spread of md5 128 bit

10028512
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
you have the benefit that if someone obtains the sha512 hash and doesn t know the salt this you have to enforce somehow can t look up the hash and get the passwords -- something that would be possible with the md5 database you have now

10028512
hash	md5
but as explained in the first paragraph it would be a bad idea to apply md5 to all new passwords as well and then hash them as sh512

10028512
hash	salt
a easy implementation would be to have a boolean salt field in the database next to the hash but don t put the salt there

10028547
hide	show
put both fields in the same column and use the rendered attribute to dynamically show hide the field using an if-statement

10028569
hash	md5
should never compare two hash as a possible answer because what if md5 abc 123 sha no 123 that means someone could have typed in the wrong password but still gets in

one can use curl or some other mechanism to connect using https without ssl certificate verification

10029574

10038449
getter	setter
if you want to use separate properties for the individual array values i would suggest going back to using indexes with a single set of getter setter methods by using the index specifier on the property declarations i would even go as far as declaring a public array property again for good measure in case you ever need to loop through the values in code

10039235
int	chars
that means all values of unsigned chars can be represented as signed int s

10040031
getter	setter
previously we were asked not bother commenting on getter and setter as long as it is obvious what it does

10040033
getter	setter
actually i deliberately don t javadoc getter and setter because you aren t adding any value by doing so - they are what they are.

10040040
getter	setter
this means the getter and setter are redundant

10040040
getter	setter
i would strongly recommend to make your auto_key field private and keep the getter and setter

10040040
getter	setter
then adjust the name of the getter and setter to match java conventions autokey setautokey getautokey

10040040
getter	setter
and consider firing propertychangeevent s when the autokey is changed as a getter setter combination typically suggests - see javabeans

q in which scenario it is more appropriate to extends an abstract class rather than implements the interface s

10040069
subclass	abstract-class
1 use abstract-class when the requirement is such that we need to implement the same functionality in every subclass for a specific operation implement the method and different functionality for some other operations only method signatures

3 we can extends max of one abstract class but can implements more than one interface

10040071

the shortest answer is extends abstract class when some of the functionalities uou seek are already implements in it

10040148
getter	setter
while documentation for setter getter methods may seem like code bloat i would still suggest creating it for a couple of reasons

10040148
getter	setter
it gives you a standard location to mention important information such as setter arguments that should not be null or getter that are woefully inefficient in a particular implementation of an interface

then you do some simple logic to check whether or not it is located within the viewport hint - use the page offset and width height properties of the window object

10041630

you could do some hacks if you know where exactly your element will appear and its height width is really of no consequence here but that s a brute force approach

getter	setter
i think getter setter aren t really necessary most of the time so they would only be used when they actually trigger something

10042767

mergesort	in-place
this solution is n log n complexity and could be performed in-place if needed in this case in-place implementation is a bit harder than with normal mergesort because adjacent parts could contain gaps from the removed duplicates which also need to be closed when merging

you can rather use an autocompletetextview with pre-populated items of your expandablelistview so that you can have smooth functionality of search and allow the list to be refreshed based on user selection instead of the above mentioned functionality...you might affect the end user experience with your above mentioned functionality....but if you are so persistent on your implementation..you can use the same autocompletetextview with onkeydown functionality or textvalidation functionality.

10047435
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in firefox and google-chrome but ie9 draws them on separate lines and in order to have the same effect as in the other browsers i need to specify a width of 102px in the parent element

10047473
width	height
i first created a new basemap image file with width and height halved then in the annotation_raster i did the following

10047483
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
there are benefits in being case-sensitive and benefits in being case-insensitive

10047523
for-loop	loops
my observation is the initial for-loop seems necessary because its calculating and checking the values against the list but once that is done all the other times it loops is repeating the same process

10047576
boost	stl
if you want to store pointers in an stl container consider using shared pointer wrappers std shared_ptr or boost shared_ptr

10047584
ssl	https
the answer still applies because the second redirect is stopped when there is a change in protocol to https ssl

10047589
16-bit	64bit
if contrary to expectation no 64bit integer type is available you can calculate the modular product by splitting the factors into low and high 16-bit

10047601
hash	md5
i was wondering whether or not it was possible to harness the power of the gpu to hash things in python md5 sha-1 etc

10047607
google-chrome	firefox
this is how your given code looks in firefox 11 and similar in ie9 and google-chrome 18

10047689
int	chars
a is a pointer and an unsigned chars is treated like an int so you are making a pointer from an int without a cast

10047701
jlist	jtable
it seems the standard jlist has no methods to adjust the sorting why on earth did they only added that to a jtable ... but there is a tutorial for sorted lists

10047722
sin	sqrt
and the above will be equivalent to log sqrt sin 2

10047722
sin	sqrt
if you need to invert the order of function application for example sin sqrt log 2 then do this

10047859
getter	setter
the advantage of using setter and getter on member is to be able to overwrite

10047890
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine with firefox but does not play using the html solution when using google-chrome chromium

10047905
x86	64bit
when installing 32bit java on 64bit windows system set android_swt to e android-sdk tools lib x86

10047911
punctuation	words
w matches any words character but that includes numbers some punctuation

10047925
requestfactory	gwt
i m using gwt and requestfactory on a new project that needs authentication

10047970
min	max
this is an expensive process that s why i strongly suggest you to create a table with only an integer field with values from 1 to x where x is at least the maximum amount of dates that separate the min day and max day from your table

10047978
int	chars	unsigned	short
because calculations are not done with types below int unsigned int chars short unsigned short etc

10047978
unsigned	short
uint16_t is possibly unsigned short on your implementation which is promoted to int on your implementation

10047978
unsigned	short
on older implementations that calculate with 16bit int may not be able to represent all values of unsigned short because both have the same bitwidth

10047978
unsigned	short
such implementations must promote unsigned short to unsigned int

10047979
exif	xmp
i have written an application that writes metadata into the image file itself into the various namespaces iptc exif ifd and xmp

10048027
post	get
this seems to be a commonly used function to get the first image out of a post

10048033
implements	extends
the java language specification says that type variables can only be constrained to extends implements particular classes or interfaces

10048033
implements	extends
since annotating a class does not cause the class to extends or implements a particular type you can t constrain by annotation

10048039
width	height
just subtract half the width and height of the internal frame from the corresponding center coordinates of the desktop pane

10048102
google-chrome	firefox
this issue doesn t occur in google-chrome firefox nor ie

10048130
int	chars
how does c c++ deal if you pass an int as a parameter into a method that takes in a byte a chars

10048130
int	chars
how does the int get cast to a byte a chars

10048185
int	chars
if chars is unsigned the original int value is reduced to the unsigned chars range modulo uchar_max+1

10048221
google-chrome	firefox
but it does not render properly in google-chrome or firefox the tab is only wide enough for the tab one text and edit x are mostly under the tab lower z-index apparently

10048223
prepare	execute
i want to initialize prepare and execute the qsqlquery in a method that is a const

10048226
base-class	subclassing
the individual configurations are correct new-table with discriminator at base-class and superclass-table at subclassing for the first case and complete-table only at base-class for the second

10048242
put	get
in this example i assume that you ve put the code objects from all your functions in one file one after the other and when reading them in i get the code object s name and use it as the basis for both the function object s name and the name under which it s stored in the sandbox dictionary

10048293
jboss	glassfish
one strategy would be to use jboss infinispan in glassfish

10048295
integer	unsigned
4.7 2 if the destination type is unsigned the resulting value is the least unsigned integer congruent to the source

10048295
integer	unsigned
integer modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits used to represent the unsigned type

10048297
ccscene	cclayer
it s the center by default except for ccnode cclayer and ccscene where it is the lower left corner

10048297
width	height
since the ccnode has 0 width and 0 height the lower left corner equals its center unless you set the contentsize property manually

10048360
src	attr
#myiframe attr src

10048404
google-chrome	firefox
the javascript code below tested in firefox and google-chrome based on matthew s post will warn the user the good innocent one a priori to uploading a large file saving both traffic and the user s time

10048411
post	get
in a class i have a handling method which performs actions based on what post get variables are available

10048465
post	put	post	get	put	get
the hostsitesectionheadereditscreenobject instance passed as an argument to the post handler method is not the same instance as the one you put in the model in the get handler method

10048465
post	put
so if a parameter isn t present in the post because you didn t put an input in the html form for it that field will not be set by spring it will just be whatever the default initial value is for the field

10048502
post	get
i need to post it and get the response code

10048516
width	height
but i suppose worst case you can give the glass style some insane height width in the css

10048545
hash	md5
you might generate the entire set of brute force values and the md5 hash on the gpu

10048545
hash	md5
if i ve understood the program generates all 1 character 2 3 4 5 and 6 lower-case-letter strings and generates a md5 hash yes

10048545
hash	md5
there are approximately 27 6 keys 387 420 489 keys and hence md5 hash

10048545
hash	md5
an md5 hash is 16 bytes so that would consume 6.2 gbytes if it were to be stored

10048653
google-chrome	firefox
for mozilla firefox and internet explorer every thing works ok but for google-chrome it works only for one time after the browser restart the file become as it was before modifying it

10048654
google-chrome	firefox
being limited to a specific browser such as firefox or google-chrome is acceptable but all of the browser combinations i have tried don t seem to work with any of the multitouch demo applications i have tried such as

10048707
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

filtering	grouping
what im trying to do is be able to return a list of grouping filtering by tags

10048806
nowjs	node.js
i ve been using socket.io with node.js and came across nowjs it seems this just wraps socket.io and provides a more user-friendly interface

10048830
google-chrome	firefox
it worked in firefox but not google-chrome

10048850
margin	border-color
or as dmackerman suggestions set a margin of 0 but a border of the size you want the margin to be and set the border-color

10048925
hide	show
the code hide all fields initially the second-to-last line invokes the change event to achieve this showing only the default selected option and then show only what was selected

10048936
for-loop	arrays
in order to iterate through the arrays of objects you can use a for-loop like this for example

10048989
crypt	md5	crypt	hash	hash	md5
i should comment that crypt is not as bad as marc b makes it sound and may in fact be the easiest way to good hash as long as you don t rely on its weaker schemes like md5

10048996
aggregate-functions	sum
when you use an aggregate-functions line sum you need to tell the sql server what columns are going to be used to group by for doing the sums

10049000
post	get
based on my experience on google s refresh token method i think you should do an http post instead of http get to given url

10049014
google-chrome	firefox
ie and firefox google-chrome are simply behaving differently just their interpretation of the specifications

10049014
google-chrome	firefox
to be honest that fact that firefox and google-chrome are similar and ie has had a long history of float bugs i d side with mozilla google here although can appreciate that ie seems to be behaving nicer in this instance

10049019
post	get
how do i get my jsp page to automatically call the listmemberscommand upon page load without a get post request

10049037
aggregate-functions	sum
if bill_country and ship_country are going to be included in a query that also has aggregate-functions like sum you need to group on them

10049079
opensuse	debian
i installed a copy of debian instead of opensuse and tried again and this time i no longer encountered the error on top

10049079
zlib	libz
ran into a few issues of missing libraries and had to install gcc and various zlib or libz libraries after the compiler kept complaining about missing them

10049188
toolbar	tabs
i have a panel which consists of a toolbar and tabs

10049218
textview	imageview
the block that has to stretch contains in imageview and textview

10049224
width	height
5 and 6 are good these are the actual numbers passed to the function although x should be equal to 5 and y should equal 6 making width and height both equal to 1

10049246
hide	show
it s just some css to hide everything on the page and only show an image

10049278
put	get
i am looking for a way to get this plane name from the plane class to the airport class to put into a queue

10049285

i had the exact same needs couple years ago and ended up writing an application that reads and writes metadata to iptc xmp exif and ifd namespaces

10049305
queue	fifo
hadoop by default uses fifo fifo scheduler pulling jobs from a work queue

10049322
width	height
just wrap it into another container and let the browser handle the size by not applying height width values

10049339
hide	show
i assume that you are trying to show and hide onclick of #sliderarrow

10049354
jobs	cron
it would likely be helpful in any event to configure the mailto variable since you re using cpanel it s just a text box on the appropriate page that you can fill in so that you get an email with the output from your cron jobs

10049366
yslow	pagespeed
however for website performance optimization yslow pagespeed etc i want to have cache-control and expires headers set and i do not want etags

mouseup	mousedown
i have a basic window class that i need to have events such as mousedown mouseup windowresized etc

10049455
onmousedown	onmouseup
i have two possible routes signal handlers boost.signal or virtual functions where the user of the class creates a class derived from window and overrides the onmouseup onmousedown and onwindowresized functions

10049461
put	get
originally their names are readable and users put their files names contain cyrillic symbols into the server and i get their files from my app

10049484
hide	show
you can use .toggle bool to eliminate the if and show hide

10049492
put	get
ideally i would like to put on a cell within excel 2010 the following function and get the xpath content

10049495
client-side	server-side
i think you re confusing the difference between client-side templating and server-side templating

10049591
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure if this is what you were intending or not as i haven t tested in ie but this works in google-chrome and firefox

10049600
for-loop	arrays
using get_row is expecting to return 1 row but you are trying to select everything from that table so using get_results will populate the arrays you need for your for-loop

10049610
width	height
when the viewbox is a different size from the width and height you are effectively scaling the size of the graphic s in your pattern

10049631
hide	show
these divs control the show hide state of other divs on the same page

10049640
folder	directory
then on the example solution i added my main.cpp and then i included properties c c++ additional include directory the folder of the oscpack library then on the linker tab i added the folder location of the libs and the name of the libs

10049642
children	parent
the child update panel will only refresh its children not its parent if the update mode is not set to conditional

10049659
getter	setter
one common approach to hide the setter from your client is to encapsulate all the getter that the client needs in an iemployee interface and code the service apis to that interface

10049694
interpreted-language	compiled-language
especially in an interpreted-language like php where classes add more overhead than a compiled-language

10049726
width	height
the solution to one of my problems had to do with browser-supplied gradients on un-styled form objects propagating for the full width and height of the page even when on a lower z-index than other elements they were hidden behind due to a variable not found error in my javascript

10049756
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
if you really want separate classes for it you could use single table inherited have a votes table a superclass vote and two subclassing voteup and votedown

10049759
entities	entitymanager
flushing the entitymanager doesn t clear anything from memory it only synchronizes entities with the database

10049759
entities	entitymanager
this guy had a similar issue. clearing it will indeed remove all references from entitymanager to your entities however you should probably re-evaluate how you use your entitymanager in general if you find yourself constantly having to call clear

10049860
tinyint	boolean
as for boolean tinyint 1

10049895
dumpsys	adb
they may be included in the output of adb shell dumpsys

maven	pom.xml
you ve also listed maven-3 in your tag set for the question and included a pom.xml - are you using maven to manage your project dependencies

10049916
width	height
that way when i change the width height of the uielement it stays in the same spot

10049916
width	height
for instance if i change the width height of the following rectangle its center will move

10049920
folder	directory
when you install add-ons no upgrades just extra bundles they go in .eclipse a hidden folder under the users home directory

10049954
post	get
what i would do then is inject a content script into each page and use something similar to the below example as inspired by reading this so post - get selected text #39

10049978
client-side	server-side
there are two types of flows you can take the server-side and client-side from your code it seems like you need to use the server side flow in order to have an access token for the user on the php side then the call for the getuser method should return the user object you want

10049982
innodb	myisam
it s especially important with mysql because of the myisam innodb thing but if you specify it grails doesn t need to inspect the connection metadata to figure out what database you re using

10049990
serializable	deserialization
this page talks about how to preserve references during serializable deserialization in json.net

pull	push
when creating a branch with name that matches that of a remote branch the configurations for push and pull are set differently

10050119
spaces	delimiter
split the string into an array using spaces as a delimiter

10050153
chunked	transfer-encoding
my intention was to add transfer-encoding chunked via httpaddrequestheaders remove content-length via httpaddrequestheaders http_addreq_flag_replace and then in my internetwritefile loop write the data in chunked encoded blocks

10050153
chunked	transfer-encoding
even after removal it ends up sending content-length 0 to the server in addition to transfer-encoding chunked which is confusing the server

10050227
many-to-many	one-to-many	many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-one	one-to-many
if your relation between student and teacher had additional attributes apart from the foreign keys of both entities then you will need an additional entity but you already existent entities student and teacher will no longer have a many-to-many relationship but a one-to-many many-to-one with that intermediary studentteacher entity

10050241
post	get
and you can add or remove action names from the map depending on which actions require post and which allow get

you should post your asynctask for us to get the full picture but from the log i would tell that you re trying to inflate some view in doinbackground

10050454
daemons	systemd
hostname is set by the systemd syslog daemons before it forwards the message to a centralized server

10050454
daemons	systemd
also it s worth noting that sysloglogger is basically wrapping the c openlog and syslog functions so basically all post-log configuration happens on the systemd daemons

10050454
daemons	systemd
generally that s desirable but sometimes you may want your rails app to log directly to a specific destination like to simplify automated deployment change attributes not allowed by syslog or run in environments without access to the systemd daemons

10050502
width	height
next give inner-block to span and the image height and width

10050507
put	get
in the app i am building i have a auto increment row so say i add 3 entries to the sql database in android it be 0 1 2 but say i delete the 3 entries from the database and then add another it will continue auto increment number from the last auto increment number that was put in the database so if i delete all entries in the database how do i get the last auto increment number if there is notting left in the database at the time

10050571

the application uses qnetworkaccessmanager qnetworkrequest and qnetworkreply to communicate over https to a server

10050610
getter	setter
you can still use dot syntax even with fully declared getter and setter so it shouldn t make a syntactic difference to any other part of your program

10050640
inherited	properties
my problem is that i do not want to inherited this class but i have other classes that need to access the ds dataset properties

10050643
g++	gcc
basically what is covered in shared libraries applies to c++ just replace gcc with g++

10050643
g++	gcc
if you tell gcc g++ to stop after the translation stage with the -s upper case s option and then look at resulting .s file once with the -fpic option and once without you will see the difference the dynamic code has gotpcrel and plt at least on x86_64

10050924
client-side	server-side
the rendered attribute is server-side and the visible attribute is client-side

10050932
width	height
another method is to determine the title bar height and window frame width and just subtract them from the given coordinates since you are positioned adjacent to them inside the game window - if you move adjust appropriately for the position relative inside the content frame

10050969
rss	feed
use a heuristic to look for link titles or hrefs containing rss feed or xml which may indicate an rss link

post	put
can anyone offer a solution to make it so that when these ajax post return i can put the returned data from that particular post into the correct div

10051047
knockout.js	upshot
i m pretty sure that upshot should be able to send only the modified properties as it uses knockout.js observables so it can keep track of what s changed and what s not

10051073
width	height
remember always set the width and height if you are going to float elements

10051108

in c your pointer can be invalidated by a malloc and realloc where in c++ your pointer can be invalidated by delete

10051433
sorting	grouping
even though there are few grouping i don t think you will be able to avoid the initial sorting into grouping while still keeping the reduction step efficient

10051438
width	height
i found a way to get the x y coordinates along with width and height

10051485
spaces	delimiter
if you want to separate the errors with a delimiter other than a spaces just replace the spaces in the first parameter

10051487
daemons	launchd
but when you need to launchd a thread for a single task operation or instantiate a daemons thread that run for all the application time or for a long specific time then could be better create a single thread and terminate it when you don t need it anymore

10051499
post	get
for example in php i find it annoying to have the _ and then capital letters for session post get and cookies

10051592
express	node.js
i m trying to post data from an ios app to node.js express

10051592
post	get
however when i try to post from my ios app i get no console app - it s almost as if node never sees the incoming post request

10051604
udp	tcp
however unlike udp which transmits a complete message at a time tcp just keeps sending data until the connection closes with no protocol-level concept of individual messages

10051605
qdatastream	qbytearray
due to the fact that this code is called extremely often i would like to avoid this unnecessary std copy operation and make either qbytearray or qdatastream work on preallocated user memory pointed by out

10051643
google-chrome	firefox
use a google-chrome or firefox extension that lets you view cookies

10051670
google-chrome	firefox
my code is working fine in ie and firefox but in google-chrome i get following exception

10051688
pull	push
so br1 was originally supposed to pull push from master and we end up with br1 pulling from origin master and pushing to a branch we never knew existed

10051716
hash	salt
currently i store a salt value and an encryption key in the config file but i d really rather move to a password hash

10051716
hash	salt
since i can t store the salt separately i wonder if it would be ok to derive the salt from the password itself and then hash the combination of the two

10051716
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
for example i might take the password md5 hash it then use the md5 hash as the salt

10051727
udp	tcp
should work - dst port 443 and greater 100 is a complete filter expression which checks for packets that are being sent to tcp or udp port 443 and that have a total length including link-layer ip and tcp headers

10051732
hash	salt
if you derive salt from the password all the same password have the same hash and the salt became useless

10051747
client-side	server-side
your server-side code does its job of retrieving data and sending it to the client while your client-side code does its job of dealing with the view

10051756
packets	pcap
you could either capture the traffic with tcpdump make sure you capture with -w so that the trace is saved in pcap format and with -s 0 so that you capture all the data in the packets or with wireshark

10051758
salt	md5
the problem with your example is that if some attacker wanted to find a match they could create a rainbow table where all the passwords are salt by their md5 couterparts

10051758
salt	md5
salt should be unique per entry so that way a hacker would have to have a reverse engineered table of every possible combination of the md5 with every possible salt

10051760
hash	salt
if a salt has 65536 different values for example then it means that the same password can hash 65536 different ways

10051794
sorting	filtering
sorting paging and filtering do not work together

10051821
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

10051863
pop-up	dialog
i hope this piece of code will able to help you figure out how to implement the pop-up text dialog box

10051863
pop-up	dialog
the way of this example work by implementing a button in the main window root when you click on it the pop-up dialog will appear mydialog class object will be created then it will use wait_window to wait until it is finish

10051863
pop-up	dialog
you can see how the pop-up dialog box is implemented it is an simple toplevel widget it is just like another frame you can think of you pack your label your entry field and finally a button mysubmitbutton

10051870
boost	eigen	eigen	ublas
i d recommend you use a library such as eigen very fast or the boost ublas matrix not so fast relatively speaking class

10051887
hash	salt
if the purpose of your salt-like scheme is to make the password resistant to a dictionary attack using pre-determined hash then your approach may be a little more secure than an unsalted hash but not nearly as secure as using a valid salt

10051887
hash	salt
one significant security benefit of a valid salt is that two instances of the same password would yield two different hash

10051888
post	get
but currently i can t get even a simple post to work

10051939
getter	setter
i d suggest limiting functions to at least 3 lines with one exception methods that require access to an object s internals like getter or setter for example can be smaller

10051962

the ldd is not a normal binutils utility like strip or ar that can be built alongside gcc for cross compiling but instead it is a cryptic shell script that apparently can only run on native platform

10052053
sorting	filtering
doing sorting filtering becomes very difficult

10052111

itemset could have various subclassing using single table inherited or you could possibly achieve this kind of behavior another way

10052119
hide	show
i have a photo gallery i am working on building and i have a previous and next button that show and hide and change opacity depending on hover and such

10052151
octal	decimal
the algorithm to solve this issue is closed to the process we learn for manual mathematical division or also to convert from decimal to another base like octal or hexadecimal - except that two examples only look for a single canonical solution

10052170
post	get
in express s routing framework app.get only responds to get requests post are ignored and probably result in a 404

10052214
getter	setter
the animaldata is just a typical getter setter so i will just skip the code for that

10052223
integer	unsigned
i trying to write a mips program that gets an unsigned integer as argument and returns the sum of all decimal digits in the integer recursively

10052233
serializable	deserialization
binary plists looks pretty simple to use for objc objects serializable deserialization this is important point cause its experimental non commercial project but it looks inefficient

10052298

10052554
redhat	fedora
here are my notes from my recent redhat enterprise linux rhel installation of ruby which i believe is pretty similar to fedora

10052582
min	max
so for example if i set the min and max options to 10 and 100 then the slider would increment by 10 s like 10 20 30 etc

10052593
integer	unsigned
in c++11 long long is a standard integer of at least 64 bits so for example unsigned long long has these limits

10052640
for-loop	arrays
depending on how many items are in the arrays and how often you want to search for different items it can get very costly to have a for-loop iterate over the entire arrays every time you want to count things which would happen if you did what the other two answers suggest

10052688
post	get
if you also get the out of memory exception with this i think you will then you should take a look at the following post

10052736
filtering	grouping
the definition of filtering class which you use don t use grouping part on the input

10052736
filtering	grouping
the simplest code which add support of the grouping part of filtering can be

10052738
g++	gcc
i mainly work in c hence the default compiler is gcc rather than g++

10052745
mouseover	mouseout
without the code one has to guess but my guess is that you re using mouseover and mouseout to determine hovering

10052745
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter
because jquery doesn t use mouseover and mouseout it uses mouseenter and mouseleave which are more suited to this scenario

10052745
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter
if you re not and you re either not using a library or using one that doesn t emulate mouseenter and mouseleave for you you need to check which element the mouseout operation is coming from and ignore it unless it s the li itself

10052745
hide	show
this css will do it you d want more than this for positioning but this will do the show hide part

10052756
put	get
if you use two different streams most likely each will manage its own put and get pointer each will have buffering which means that if you don t use flush you won t be able to determine what is the order the operations will be done on the file

so hash functions have the same mathematical quality as modulo division and looses the information

10053163
apache	nginx
you can create separate php file on your public folder which will check from what ip we ve requested it _server remote_addr if it s local works fine in default apache some additional config required if you re using proxy server like nginx then you can proceed to getting ga data

10053195

10053890
cashapelayer	calayer
may be someone might even be able to suggest if a calayer can be converted to a cashapelayer

10053930
getter	setter
this wrapper exposes the fields of the underlying structure via getter and setter

10053957
getter	setter
especially for getting classes started this is a very easy and flexible way but as already has been mentioned if that code is going to be heavily used then it probably not a bad idea to introduce some more control over those options with getter and setter especially if you need to take actions when some of those options are get or set like in your case dependencies if i understood your problem correctly

10053957
getter	setter
also note that you don t have to implement getter and setter yourself in php you can use the __get and __set magic methods

10053993
put	get
i put this annotation on entity getter and when i check constrains violations agfter i put this email test test than i get an error message not a well-formed email address

spaces	linefeed
the next trick is to replace spaces in your variable with linefeed

10054912
spaces	linefeed
there are countless valid ways of adding or subtracting linefeed and white spaces into the xml document that would break your algorithm

here i am not getting clear view related with how does scala compiler interpret these as int or floating points or double and comparing

10058108

i might be confused between hashmap in java and map dictionary in python

10066821
vim	emacs
it generally fills the same niche as vi vim or emacs but generally follows modern interface standards and has some really useful features that i haven t seen in any other editors such as the minimap and multi-selection hit ctrl-d with some text selected and it will select the next instance of the same text while still keeping the old selection intact essentially putting your input cursor in two places so you can edit them both in tandem

10066862
width	height
there s no content and you re not actually setting the width or height of the block so it s not going to be visible

10066905

10067097
width	height
is the height of the image changes as does the width but they don t change proportionally

10067097

post	get
i know how to display information by processing get post requests but i don t know how to display information from database without get post requests if that makes sense

10067390

otherwise as long as you have the original ratio ration orgwidth orgheight you could take it and reflect it on the width height

10067469
public	protected
there s nothing wrong with using protected data members if using private won t work for your solution using public data members however is almost never a good idea however it can be sometimes too

the width of the two images is the same and it s the height that s different

the width will drive the horizontal of the top of the hex the height is derived from that number since all the sides are equal length on a regular hexagon

10068351
text-align	height
assuming you want centered text the text-align handles the horizontal of course but the line-height that matches the height is going to allow for a vertical centering

10068351
width	height
the shift calculation width x cos 30 2 is also the same as height 4

10068351

the before of the second will change the origin point of the translation and will shift the main width on the x-axis and half the height on the y-axis

10068373
udp	tcp
another likely possibility is that there is a firewall which needs to be configured to allow the tcp server socket to be opened or the udp socket used by the various postgresql processes to communicate regarding statistics

10068405

10072761

my question would it be a better logic to make all these 10 methods non static and instantiate mypreference all over my project before accessing the getter and setter methods or should i move the code present in the constructor into all the setter getter functions and repeat it everywhere its required before calling the methods of mypreferences class

i m unclear on how enet uses udp sockets and how it manages connections so i m unclear whether you re better off with lots of open tcp sockets or lots of open enet connections

10074975
hash	md5
if you want to avoid collisions while sacrificing speed you will want cryptographic hash functions of which md5 128 bits sha-1 160 bits and sha-2 usually sha-256 or sha-512 are the most widely used and have fast implementations

10074975
hash	md5
very efficient hash collision finding algorithms for md5 are available but if you input random messages you ll get as close to the as you re ever going to get while still running in reasonable time

the delegatedmap used in the sample code does not extends java.util.hashmap it just wraps an instance of one and implements the map interface

10075634

ultimately the grid s will sit inside of a tab panel but if i can get this simpler example working and understood i can take it from there. i could put the following grid panel into a window getting draggability out of the box and then add this window to a viewport but the extjs4 layout documentation seems to warn against this

10076552
maven	pom.xml
one questions comes to my mind why are you defining maven central in your repositories list cause it s already defined in maven itself...btw repository definition should be put into the settings.xml instead of the pom.xml apart from using a repository manager

10076580

set the dimensions width and height and see if your problems are resolved

10076663
width	height
the advantage here is that you don t lose the height and width of rows and columns during the process - they re restored to exactly their original formats

10076695
width	height
as for scaling the canvas i believe that is still necessary all of my other widget scale to their width and height before drawing with no issue

10076709
int	double
if the compiler assumes atof returns an int casting it will solve the conversion warning but it will not cause the return value to be recognized as a double

10076718
children	parent
this means locking not between siblings of the same kind but between parent and children which might be from different types

10076727
put	get
can someone explain very simply how to get the id of the new record and put it into the id field in my grid

10076730
jsf	seam
the reason i m asking about seam is because it appears to have some template-friendly logic and can work along with jsf and richfaces

10076805
stdout	stderr
the most likely explanation is that the output you re seeing is from stderr not stdout

10076835
sorting	filtering
you d then handle your sorting filtering etc

10076839
int	chars
if let s say i send this as the buffer to recv int s chars buf int len int flags

10076863
fgets	fgetc
then you can read from your file by line using fgets to read by lines or fgetc to read by characters

10076863
int	chars
continue with converting the num s chars into int here stdlib.h also has to be included

10076865

the parent class s properties will be automatically inherited duh

10077058
nowjs	node.js
i am very much interested to learn node.js and nowjs

10077080

yes the visibility of the type is the same as any class member and effected by private protected and public

10077414
junit	jmockit
i m using gradle milestone 8a to run junit tests on my project with the ibm j9 jvm which according to running tests with jmockit requires that i pass the argument -javaagent jmockit.jar to the jvm

i ve also added jmockit and junit to the testcompile configuration making sure that jmockit is first and verified this by running gradle dependencies

thus it would seem to me that all three browsers are behaving according to the spec but google-chrome safari firefox all have ua rules that more closely match what most users would expect

however if you edit the test case to add both google-chrome and firefox do not properly show the overflowed contents

you can multiplying it by its transpose though

10077833
profiling	instrumentation
you can use the time profiling tool from instrumentation

10077836
free	malloc
in a pinch i believe that you can customize boost shared_ptr with a custom deallocator so that you can allocate with std malloc avoiding the initialization overhead and deallocate with std free while still maintaining the goodness that shared_ptr brings to the table

it isn t possible to bind multiple processes to the same tcp socket but it is possible with udp

10077976
qtimer	qwidget
when my qwidget is closed is must delete this qtimer but i can not because closeevent is not called

10078019
udp	tcp
you could parse the tcp udp header create an own socket with the same src dest port ip use protect on this socket so it not routed over tun0

10078019
udp	tcp	icmp	tcp	icmp	udp
since tpacketcapture only supports udp tcp and not icmp they might use this approach

10078020
width	height
make sure x y width and height are doubles and if you want further information check out this

10078044
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox and ie if i just change the background color to red and then select the item from the list the color is now blue

sometime during the history of the project someone decided that #define malloc my_malloc and #define free my_free had some use

10078184
free	malloc
these didn t do much more than call built-in malloc and free but project already compiled and worked this way

10078184
free	malloc
with new delete it might be trickier but still with ld_preload you might be able to replace malloc free without even recompiling your app

buildout	django-lfs
i m using django-lfs that i installed it using buildout

10078200

jms	nms	nms	xms
i used jms not available in .net directly unless you use api from some jms provider like ibm xms or apache nms tibco ems and tibco randezvous previously and if i compare pub-sub pattern available in wcf with real pub-sub infrastructures the wcf implementation is like a bad joke

google-chrome	firefox
the end result is close enough that the majority of users would never know the difference between ie google-chrome and firefox

10078497
octal	decimal
note that 00 through 07 work fine because both octal and decimal interpretation yield the same value

10078501

awt	swing
i m using java and i m using swing and awt

10078680
put	get
as oli has added you want to shift by 32 not 31 - shifting by 31 will put it in the 31st bit so if you shifted back to the right to try and get the first number you would end up with a bit missing and the second number would be potentially huge because you could have put a 1 in the uppermost bit

10078685
hash	md5
signature object already does the hash md5 and encrypts with the private key rsa

10078711

10078865
for-loop	arrays
you can not do this in java and if you feel you must print these separate variables with a for-loop then your best bet is eugene s answer of putting them in an arrays first

10079694
cil	ildasm
the point is write it in c# then use the compiler and ildasm to show you the correct code that you would need for one parameter then you could write a routine to generate that cil for you which you would then plug into the .net profiling api to attach to any routine you want

10090711
width	height
if the viewmodel is built for the view should i be making strings of properties like height and width

10090714

my take on this is that the result type should be an unsigned 16-bit integer with the value

10090740
mouseover	mouseout
no it s not possible because every css that will be applied on mouseover hover will be removed on mouseout and there is no other way to capture mouseover and out

admob	inmobi
i am using webviews only in the ad networks i am using some of which are admob inmobi etc

10090839
sorting	filtering
if the sorting filtering is specific to a view then the filtering sorting logic belongs in the view

10090839
sorting	filtering
edit i suppose i should add that the logic itself doesn t necessarily belong in the view -- depending on the situation you might for example have a back-end that uses something like sql in which case the query that specifies the filtering sorting goes in the view but the implementation of the sorting filtering itself would end up in sql implementation

10090906
hive	hdfs
the cluster has hdfs map reduce hive pig and sqoop installed on it

10090913
hide	show
you could show it on submit and hide it on render

jsf	seam
as far as i know seam 2 was the only who offered a reuseable jsf component for this the

10090925
hide	show

it logically represents a single value similar to primitive types int double and so on

10090981
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
because i know that it s probably not possible with javascript css is it possible to install a browser-plugin or something like that for safari google-chrome or firefox

it can have methods like hashcode equals and the standard getter setter but very little else

10091064

what i m doing is separating this out in divs and having the submit button hide the current div and show the next one

10091077
filtering	grouping
ensure the filtering returns unique combinations of c1 c2 c3 using distinct or grouping by if necessary

10091087
google-chrome	firefox
ie is probably going to mess stuff up that works correctly in firefox or google-chrome

10091117

its sounding like you need to attach an event handler for onkeydown and then use both preventdefault and stoppropagation to prevent the postback

10091119
folder	directory
just for directory project folder traversal

10091120
post	get
the service was already properly configured for get and post protocols so that was not the issue

symfony	silex
i m trying to render a symfony form using twig in a silex application

10091139
gridview	rowdatabound
you need to modify the script in a way that can find the keys of the source and destination rows on client side you could include them in a hidden filed inside a template in your gridview and assign its value on rowdatabound

10091195

the user has to rotate the ipad to landscape himself to make things look good again and will then be unable to rotate back to portrait as expected

10091333
hide	fadeout
you could also use fadeout instead of hide if you want to get really fancy

10091418
client-side	server-side
because credentials handles are used to store configuration information the same handle cannot be used for both client-side and server-side operations

10091437

google-chrome	firefox
please visit if you see it in internet explorer and firefox the content will show up but in google-chrome the whole screen goes black

10091623
put	get
this design explicitly and clearly asks the consumer to only update the ids of the person but i m concerned that the object graph for a put patch looks different than the get making the api hard to learn and remember

10091636
jflex	cup
i have come up with idea using jflex as lexical analyzer and cup as parser

10091636

10091686
stdout	fflush
the initial requirement was that this be a vb.net cgi executable - but during testing i havent been able to use the stream from the vb.net executable until the app finishes - like it wasn t able to fflush the stdout even though i was specificly using the console.out.flush

10091687

i want to create simple script that will be resize loaded image using css width and height

10091806
google-chrome	firefox
the code prints directly to firefox google-chrome console

10091806
google-chrome	firefox
as you will see the message handler is called in firefox but not google-chrome

10091839
post	get
you re trying to pass the saveuser-parameter as get and the other as post maybe that confuses your serverside part

10091853
tablet	galaxy
in short the requests work fine with android 4.0.3 api 15 the most current but not for android 2.3.3 api 10 which is what i need to be compatible for a galaxy tablet

uiview	uiwindow
lets simplify the problem how can i add a uiview or uiwindow that passes specific touch events to the next responder just like setting the userinteractionenabled to no

10091879
put	get
this implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic operations get and put .

10091882
post	get
whenever you asign a an element as a jquery object to a variable you don t need to recall that elements id and if you do recall it by id and get undefined then you ddn t actually post your dynamic html to the dom yet or the id was not established correctly

10091905
post	put
since i didnt read your code am going to post the one which they have put in the documentation

10091914
google-chrome	firefox
the same code works great on firefox 3.6.27 and google-chrome 18.0.1025.151

10091951
ostringstream	std
you could use std ostringstream

10092004
margin	height
so i used an old technique where you basically use a wrapper with 100 height then give it a negative margin and a positive padding corresponding to the constant height value

10092004
margin	height
the combination of a negative margin and a positive padding will result in an empty space with the same height as the content with a fixed height

10092013
versioning	upgrade
should i just upgrade the jars to spring 3.1.1 or another versioning

10092037
jquery	scriptaculous
the most interesting feature of the 3.0 version is that you can use together jquery bubble popup plugin with any other libraries and javascript frameworks like scriptaculous mootols or prototype because the plugin is completely encapsulated to prevent incompatibility problems

10092045
jobs	cron
i m a moderate to good php programer and have experience with terminal shell scripts but what i m trying to wrap my head around is the logics behind background processes and is most certainly not cron or cron jobs but a continual flow of data

10092060
put	get
in my opinion you should stay with the same structure for both get and put requests

10092075
addclass	removeclass
it will better if you put your styles to classes and manipulate with jquery through classes addclass class and removeclass class

10092084

10092233
client-side	server-side
client-side jquery validation is fun and it looks slick but if you already have to implement server-side validation then what s the point of the client-side validation

10092233
client-side	server-side
also are there any good ways to implement client-side validation that don t require server-side validation

10092248
slideup	slidedown
slidedown and slideup won t help

10092253
folder	directory
core relates back to the mage_core_block_core class under the app code core mage core directory and then the info after the slash relates to the folder inside of that directory

express	node.js
i m coding a small api in node.js express for my spine.js application

10092440
requestfactory	gwt-rpc	requestfactory	gwt
anyway when crafting your own headers you should add a prefix to avoid conflicts with other things on the network adding headers something like myapp-date or x-myapp-date like gwt does it with x-gwt-permutation and x-gwt-module-base in gwt-rpc and requestfactory

10092456
google-chrome	firefox
as far as i know google-chrome ie firefox don t allow you to customize this error page and as others have said you d need to have access to the dns server to change this when any browser is used

10092460
ioexception	fileoutputstream	ioexception	fileinputstream	fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
when you do your read and write statements on your fileinputstream and fileoutputstream objects resp. an ioexception may arise from the native part if there s a problem in reading or writing from into the file system

or should i have it somewhere else like in www.somehost.com directory folder where the page that is going to load the sdk will be at

10092683
comparator	comparable
as you are sorting a number of different types you may want to provide a custom comparator instead or make document implement comparable

10092689
comparator	comparable
if you re trying to sort an array of document s you need to have document implement comparable or pass in a comparator

10092717
express	node.js
check out this tutorial for the image upload portion on the node.js side using express

10092725
voip	sip
unfortunately most of the traffic streams including sip for voip and video is encrypted and sent over tcp

10092725
udp	tcp
so the router has no way to figure out what tcp udp streams does what

10092746
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
then in your table view controller s viewdidappear or viewwillappear call

10092772
maven	pom.xml
while using maven 2 i ve never needed the acme-parent pom.xml at the following location

10092772
maven	pom.xml
in maven 2 when doing builds of child-alpha maven would have no trouble finding acme-parent pom.xml one directory up with a relative path of .. pom.xml so it would never try going to my repositories to find it

10092772
maven	pom.xml
having the parent pom.xml in my local checkout only and not having it in the repo worked fine in maven 2

10092772
maven	pom.xml
if maven was able to correctly find the acme-parent pom.xml initially per the block at the top why is it now trying to download it from the repos when processing the child-dep-jdk15 dependency

10092778
hide	show
just a thought but you might accomplish the same result using a hidden textbox and when the user clicks the checkbox you just hide the passwordbox and show the textbox

10092782
mvp	presenter
if the query you are running contains user specific data then i would probably place the results of that query into session within the code which composes the ui part of your application if you are using a pattern like mvc that would be in the controller or mvp in the presenter

10092799
post	get
if you re not able to make it work with that please post the results you get from the items 2 3 both from eclipse and the shell and paste the actual traceback you re getting when running the module

10092832
versioning	upgrade
the windows phone marketplace application will take care of notifying the users when an upgrade versioning of your application is available so you don t have to

10092838
libpcap	wireshark
that way you don t have to care about the details of pcap files and your code will with libpcap 1.1 or later also be able to read at least some of the pcap-ng files that wireshark can produce and that it will produce by default in the 1.8 release

10092838
winpcap	libpcap
writing your own code to read pcap files rather than relying on libpcap winpcap to do so is rarely worth doing

10092912
min	max	minimum	max
define the functions min and max to find the minimum and maximum elements of the list s

10092915
min	max
min and max are a little more complicated.

maven	m2e
after cloning the repo using mercurial into my workspace eclipse and downloading maven m2e and all the other required set up files i was able to get all of the project libraries except for 4

10093012
profiling	benchmarking
benchmarking isn t a profiling it will only measure the total time taken by a code snippet but sometimes that s all you need

10093039
requestfactory	gwt
if you use hibernate objectify or some similar orm solution look into gwt requestfactory

10093041
comparator	comparable
all elements inserted into a sorted set must implement the comparable interface or be accepted by the specified comparator

10093063
margin	height
if you don t know the height you would probably want to use either a negative left margin or position relative

10093083
hlsl	glsl
yet when the vertex arrives at my vertex shader it will have been converted to a 4-float value a vec4 in glsl or a float4 in hlsl

10093181
cruisecontrol	jenkins
jenkins aka hudson cruisecontrol

10093208
post	get
i m guessing there is probably an event i could hook to look at a get or post param which maybe could be a hash of the username and hashed password then bypass the normal login method which relies on username and plain text password

10093218
google-chrome	firefox
however it works exactly the same across firefox google-chrome and ie 9 so i suspect it is a part of the css standard however i cannot find any reference to why it might be the case

10093241
equals	tostring	tostring	getter	getter	setter
i ve omitted some boilerplate code like constructors setter getter not annotated and the methods tostring equals and hashcode

10093274

you can start your app in eclipse and use visualvm or yourkit or you can use tptp

10093315
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
when i generate the element using javascript all works well in firefox safari and opera but not google-chrome

10093421
google-chrome	firefox
while this works in ie9 it does not work in google-chrome or firefox

10093460
getter	setter
you should declare mysqldao in your mainservice and its setter and getter because spring is looking for it

10093482
disk	ram
just to be clear if you have enough ram don t forget that the os wants to have some for disk cache and background activity too this solution will be slower maybe even by a factor of 2 since twice the amount of data needs to be read and written but in case you are swapping to death it might be a lot faster -

10093546
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the installation goes through a wizard to choose a couple of options checkbox dropdownlistfor button radiobutton and then proceeds to install everything it also asks at the end if the user wants to install another component

10093579
sorting	grouping
note primarily others are concerned with the changes to collection items not updating the view grouping sorting without calling refresh

10093671
width	height
also overflow hidden will cut off anything that is outside the defined width or height so you need to define min-width and min-height and then use overflow auto instead of hidden

10093708
post	get
i know the --boundary stuff is correct for a multipart post but somehow it must be possible to just get the content of the post...

10093715
inherited	properties
should i create a instance properties instead and instantiate the sessionmanager in a base controller which i inherited from the mvc controller class

maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
version 1.6 of the maven-antrun-plugin uses ant-nodeps 1.8.1 per its pom.xml

10093776
google-chrome	safari
i would use the servervariables over the browser capabilities because using browsercapabilities on google-chrome will currently return desktop which seems to be the same for safari when i check it on a mac

10093784
move	drag
the problem i have is that if somebody clicks and drag the map around and then move to the scrolling div and pushes a down arrow or pgdn or something like that then the google map move as well

10093830
subscript	superscript
for example to get rid of the subscript and superscript buttons add the following code

10093841

one notable exception is mac os x which is unix-based but uses a default filesystems type hfs+ that is not case sensitive

10093869
post	get
either get to post or post to get

10093938
scheme	racket
learning scheme or racket will help you understand that these aren t the only way to go about it

10093938
scheme	racket
scheme and racket make it easy to explore these ideas

10093960
qfile	qdatastream	qfile	qtextstream	qtextstream	qdatastream

i would like to add a control to my asp.net 4.0 project for the user to search select their local directory and select a folder

10094020
cvs	svn
we use eclipse classic with the pdt extension you can add anything you need as svn cvs web tools javascript html css ...

10094066
int	chars
when you pass this to sprintf s d format specifier it s expecting a single decimal number - not an array of chars - so it converts the chars to their int representations and prints those

10094126
int	double
i tried using the tostring method to change the rdfnode into a string and than converting into an int double but that doesnt seem to work and gives me the exception that is listed below

10094154
nginx	lighttpd
i m testing the responder role against nginx and the authorizer role against lighttpd

10094156
capistrano	bundler
require bundler capistrano

10094170
nsdateformatter	nscalendar
you need to use an nsdateformatter and set its locale and time zone - just as you did with the nscalendar object - and then call stringfromdate on it passing the date you ve created

10094174
portrait	landscape
up to the 3.2 android version i could use qualifiers for the layouts like small normal large xlarge and combine them with port portrait orientation or land landscape orientation

google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome and firefox a form is submitted if the return key is pressed inside any text input inside the form

pygtk	pygobject
in gtk+2 pygtk there existed gtk.glade.bindtextdomain but i m wondering if there is any equivalent in gtk+3 pygobject

10094348
google-chrome	firefox
i mean running this on google-chrome and in firefox opening the page in a tab show the test in 2 seconds while the responses from google-chrome ajax requests come 2 seconds after the last request finished so other browser request has no effect on the first one call that would prove this to be a session problem but see below

10094353
inherited	properties
if you remove those properties and let it inherited the same settings as the other list elements you can override the style of the inner list and get a more consistent effect

10094373
width	height
programmatically i m able to position things perfectly based on the device width and height

10094403
directwrite	direct2d
directwrite doesn t actually require direct2d and can be used on its own idwritebitmaprendertarget

10094403
directwrite	direct2d
it s just much much easier to use direct2d to render directwrite text into an iwicbitmap via id2d1factory createwicbitmaprendertarget and then draw that bitmap using dx maybe by copying to a dx surface or using some shared surface approach

10094411
udp	tcp
udp gives no guarantee to the received ordering of packets so basically the first packet you recvfrom might be the first packet you sent but must not be - that s what tcp is for which guarantees ordering of received data

10094461
onresume	onpause
what i did was i put my cursor w c also comes from simplecursoradapter to an instance variable instead of a method variable then on my onstop and onpause methods i call stopmanagingcursor then on my onresume and onstart methods i call startmanagingcursor

at least in my experience this is also an issue that s likely to change from one versioning of a compiler to the next so even if you don t intend to port to anything else your code may quit working just due to a seemingly trivial upgrade unless you include the right header

10094596
google-chrome	safari
it looks fine in google-chrome safari etc but in ie8 the text is stuck to the top of the input area

that should give you enough to get started at least i d post more if i could sadly it s slightly too complicated to mock up a version

10094810
width	margin
to center the div within an element you would set a width and margin with the left and right margins set to auto

10094824
width	height
you could just do 100 for both the width and the height that way it fits the box

10094889
post	get
i have done some googling on this error and have found some post about using autodiscover to get around this

10094969
exponent	modulo
in fact entire groups of users can use the same public exponent each with a different modulo

10094969
exponent	modulo
there are some restrictions on the primes factors of the modulo when the public exponent is fixed. this makes encryption faster than decryption and verification faster than signing

10094969
des	rsa
by comparison des see section 3.2 and other block ciphers are much faster than the rsa algorithm

10094970

10095069
accurev	svn
it s the same if every team will do their development in the separate branch using svn and trying to merge everything after 1 month of development....basically accurev creates late merge price and you are going to pay this price for ever if you will choose accurev for more than 1 team

10095084
folder	directory
the problem was the directory of the unit test which is not allowed to be the target folder itself

10095131

you have the original width and height of the image

10095131
width	height
divide it with the width and height of the view

10095137
google-chrome	firefox
i wrote a little bookmarklet that works great in firefox trying to use it in google-chrome and not having any luck

10095137
google-chrome	firefox
which works fine in firefox but not at all in google-chrome

10095137
google-chrome	firefox
the javascript that i use is pretty much identical between firefox and google-chrome the javascript command for the bookmarklet is identical between my firefox bookmarklets and pre-installed google-chrome bookmarklets so is there something else going on here

10095141

vbscript	jscript
for example if the default language is jscript you can have a vbscript function fna call a function declared in jscript fnb as long as the call to fna is made as part of the inline execution of jscript

10095192
vbscript	jscript
iow jscript can call into vbscript which in turn can call into vbscript and so on the limiting factor is the engine that the top of this chain must be jscript in this scenario

10095192
vbscript	jscript
in your example code you had code at the global inline level of your vbscript attempting to call a function declared in the default jscript language

10095193

peer	p2p	packets	multicast
is it possible to create a p2p group with multiple devices and send multicast packets from a source peer to the other peer

10095433
haskell	ocaml
note that it currently does not support true parallelism you won t have two threads running ocaml code in parallel but it doesn t matter as ocaml is much faster than many other languages for example on a quadcore the language shootout shows that ocaml outperforms even haskell with multicore capabilities

10095456
dns	spf
i have also activated reverse dns on my hosting account and created an spf dns record that sends email through godaddy only and checked the include ptr box for dns lookup

10095470
post	get
i can not get the hang of the way this site post code

10095506
width	height
even though you gave it a height and width i believe that some browsers don t assign it a real size until you actuall add a shape to it

10095506
google-chrome	firefox
by default it s value is visiblepainted so i really don t know why google-chrome and firefox allow the events to get through

10095525
octal	decimal
you write as octal and print defaults to decimal

10095538

maven	m2e
using m2e maven plugin in eclipse i had excluded the spring-core dependency this had excluded the library from every dependency where it was a transitive dependency i assumed this would be ok as i was using the org.springframework.core library instead

10095943

might it be a good idea to switch to something like django or web2py which do have built in authentication systems

10095995
pull	push
as stated by other answers neither push nor pull is better but rather you should pick the one that best fits your design needs

10095995
pull	push
from here discussing whether an observer model should be push or pull based

10095996
width	height
i can almost guarantee that it is because you are setting the width and height of the canvas using css width and height and not the html attributes

10095996
width	height
you need to define the width height either in the canvas tag

10096012
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox ie7+ and safari i can use style table-layout fixed in order to force the table columns to certain widths

10096012
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
with divs in google-chrome firefox ie7+ and safari i can use style word-wrap break-word

10096023
listview	gridview	gridview	datalist
it s definitely possible but i would use a listview or datalist as your parent container instead because with a gridview you ll have to put the child list in a column which will look ugly

10096027
width	height
when in landscape you need to reverse width and height

10096027
width	height
remember that the device retains its same height and width your rect just needs to change for the changed orientation

10096116
vb.net	vb6
first vb6 is not vb.net and does not use the .net framework but instead uses the older com framework

10096132

keeping our hash salt secret

10096268
hash	salt
if an attacker gets ahold of the data in the datastore as well as our hash salt i m worried they could brute force the sensitive data

10096268
hash	salt
some of it like ssn a 9-digit number does not have a big key space so even with a modern hash algorithm i believe it could be done if the attacker knew the salt

10096293
glassfish	weblogic
weblogic or glassfish are recommended

10096307
free	malloc
so the quick answer to your question is that you can overload operator new delete to use your specific memory allocation scheme via malloc free and the object creation will be taken care of by the generated exectable code

10096338
sorting	filtering
when you need to paginate results you need to also include 2 other aspects of the overall query that will be sent to the database filtering and sorting

10096338
sorting	filtering
the reason why is because unless you also apply both sorting and filtering in combination with paging you will not be able to compute the correct results

10096338
sorting	filtering
ideally you would like to send the db 1 query that applies filtering sorting and pagination to return exactly the paged section you need

10096338
sorting	filtering
if you want to make any part of the query sorting filtering pagesize pagenumber customizable to the user you must pass these values as arguments to the action method

10096348
post	get
since get is to get retrieve data you should use post to post updates to the server deleting a record

10096374
calloc	malloc
you should also test using malloc instead of calloc

10096381
width	height
imageview is a rectangular view which asks for height width

i found in attempting to dynamically alloc init a view controller for use like this i had to call initwithnibname bundle and thus i had to put my view controller in a separate xib class so it didn t get confused in the storyboard and leave warnings about an unreachable scene

polymorphism	specialization
they are typesafe and a lot of inlining and optimizations may be made with templates consider it polymorphism optimization and specialization which takes place at compilation

10096723
ant	maven	ant	maven-dependency-plugin
use ant through maven - use maven-dependency-plugin to unpack dependencies and then pack the applet jars through ant scripts

invokerequired	begininvoke
your code really does not show if begininvoke has something to do here since we don t know when invokerequired is true

10096775
jar	war
seems like jar takes the bytes from the text file and stores exactly those bytes in the jar war file without storing any encoding information

10096777
ant	maven
i m pretty used to maven and its system for dependencies at this point and find our old ant way of doing things pretty messy and hard to maintain

10096777
ant	maven
with that said basically everywhere i seem to look online people are building solr with ant and the few tutorials i found for doing things with maven are all along the lines of this one which doesn t seem to work

10096815
pull	push
therefore the proper approach is to first pull changes from development build and test and then push back to development

10097349
firefox	safari
an additional question is how i can make it so images don t have the save as functionality if held down i tried putting a span over the images and that worked for firefox but not ipad safari

10097353
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the problem is reproduceable in google-chrome firefox opera and ie9

10097414
public	protected
actually your descendant class automatically provides a public constructor that does a pass-through to the protected constructor of the base class

10097517
versioning	upgrade
the scripts to create the current database are stored in tfs along with the source code and then dbghost is used to generate a delta script to upgrade an environment to the current versioning

10097521
int	chars
they take a list of int as input which i believe could just be the ord s of your serialized chars

10097531
implements	extends
abstract classes can also implements final methods so they can never be re implements by a class that extends it

10097538
awt	swing
ordinarily swing programs should override paintcomponent instead of overriding paint as mentioned in painting in awt and swing the paint methods

realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	min	max
if you control all allocation you can simply keep min and max bounds based on every dynamic pointer that ever came out of malloc calloc or realloc

10098195
min	max
a pointer lower than min or greater than max is probably not in the heap and this min and max delimited region is unlikely to intersect with any static area ever

10098203
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
inherited is normally not a good way forward because it couples the extensions subclassing too tightly with the superclass

10098213
submit	submission
generally speaking it is unwise to submit a form to a page that the user will see because it can cause multiple submission if the user goes forward back they reopen the tab etc

10098246
layoutparams	viewgroup
when you add parent to the window or root viewgroup you should create a proper set of layoutparams and specify wrap_content

it adds checkboxes to each widget to either show or hide it on every site page

10098303
