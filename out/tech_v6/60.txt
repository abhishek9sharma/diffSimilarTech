turns out the very minimum that i needed to do was set the width and height of the canvas to the pixelwidth and pixelheight of the bitmapimage instance

8300110
unsigned	short
i allocated a large chunk of continuous bytes in the ram using a vector of type unsigned short

8300118
keydown	keyup
the simple way to do this is to simply increase the animation speed every time you receive a keydown message and reset it whenever you get a keyup

8300119
filtering	grouping
i need to filtering the original results table so that i get no more than one package from each grouping for each customer each customer may have a package from one or more grouping but might not have a package from every grouping

8300124
range	minimum
from the interface designer select your uislider and change the value range minimum and maximum

8300135
client-side	server-side
but as others mention without knowing a bit more about what exactly you need to have happen you would probably want to look at either a regular expression validator and try to validate on the client-side instead of server-side unless you need to have it happen on the postback

8300208
prepare	execute
Ã¢ i printed the prepare statements as they re execute and i noticed that the values are not enclosed in quotes

8300209
stdout	stderr
if i use a different file for stderr and stdout they are both created but the stdout is always empty

8300236
disk	ram
your times will never be the same because every single time you execute your program the conditions on the machine are different the os process thread scheduler ram assigned and freed again as well as other task the system might be doing like reading a heavy file from disk swapping

8300249
stdout	stderr
stderr is typically an unbuffered stream while stdout is buffered

8300286
hash	hmac
an hmac is a message authentication code mac constructed on top of a hash

8300286
hash	hmac
you would use an hmac is a hash were already present in the program ie it was handy

8300286
hash	hmac
when i have both a block cipher and hash present in the program i generally use an hmac because its faster

8300286
hash	whirlpool
use the sha-2 family of hash or use whirlpool

8300296
hash	hmac
while the most often used mac type hmac is based on hash functions there are also ones which are based on a block cipher like aes like cbc-mac this is like cbc but with zero initialization vector and using only the last block as output

8300379
post	get
i already spoke with you on irc but i believe that if you get the view and post a runnable to it that will call .setchecked this will in effect cause the setchecked call to occur at the proper time and thus avoiding having called setchecked before the view hierarchy was ready for it

8300415
post	get
i think you re going to get the same answers here as you got with your mailing list post

8300437
rss	feed

8300455
freebsd	linux
i need to check for both linux and freebsd

8300503
post	get

8300663
put	get
you can put code in a block in any class and it will only get loaded once per classloader

8300818
onchange	onblur
my reason for this would be to show if the input was valid once you leave the input field using onchange or onblur and the i also wanted to check if the input field was ever empty to remove the message indicating that bad input was entered using onkeypress so that it would update without having to leave the field if the user were to delete what they had in response to the warning message.

8300823
gridview	objectdatasource
i want to use an objectdatasource with a gridview in asp.net

8300858

8300895
postgresql	mysql
the unapproved scope works with sqlite and mysql but it doesn t work on heroku where it uses postgresql

for-loop	arrays
my guess is buffer over-run since the for-loop reads in 11 numbers and the 11th number gets stored outside the arrays probably overwriting i

8300918
subtract	add
my idea was to have a separate method that takes in parameters such as the specific edittext to increment decrement and another param for whether to add or subtract but i am not sure for the implementation since onclicklistener has to have the public void onclick view v method

8300923
hex	binary
the only real downside vs their solution is that they use 12 bytes while an int64 uses 8 guids uuids use 16 in binary or 32 in hex plus a few bytes of overhead

there are ant tasks and maven plugins readily available for doing just this

8301066
prepare	execute
i plan to use pdo s prepare and execute mechanism to prevent sql injection attack

8301071
children	parent
the event listener is registered only to one object but it receives the click events from its children because mouseevents bubble up in the display list they are forwarded upwards in the hierarchy so each respective parent object will receive the event even the stage

8301089
free	malloc
that said glibc does have functions mcheck mprobe to find the malloc status of a pointer for heap consistency checking and one of them is to see if a pointer is free

8301089
free	malloc
just make sure you have paired malloc free

8301095
jar	manifest.mf
if you are building an executable jar and have other jars that you need to be available in the classpath there is a class-path line in the jar s manifest.mf file that lists entries including jars and directories to include in the classpath when the main class is run

8301095
jar	manifest.mf
by the way to make your jar executable set the main-class line in your manifest.mf file

8301457
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is a fair bit stricter than sqlite and mysql and no orm can fully insulate you from the differences between databases

8301457
postgresql	mysql
the behavior of group by is another common problem when moving from sqlite mysql to postgresql so you might want to review all you grouping

8301457
postgresql	mysql
also check how you deal with strings that are too long for your varchar columns afaik sqlite ignores your size limits but postgresql will complain loudly if you try to exceed the column size and mysql will truncate your data with a mere warning unless you ve put your server in strict mode

8301562
int	chars
your code won t compile in any way cause in that method t value can t be int and chars at the same time.

8301850
submit	submission
so if i had 20 empty rows in the table because i stated in the spinner i wanted 20 questions then what happens is every time i submit a question it adds a new row every time so submission 20 questions from the textarea would mean the table would contain 20 blank rows and 20 rows with questions

8302079
ontouchevent	ondraw
however if you just want to draw the circles over the image a better solution would be to subclass imageview so you can detect touches in its ontouchevent method directly instead of a listener and do custom drawing in its ondraw method guaranteeing everything is in the same adjusted coordinate plane

google-chrome	firefox
and it works in google-chrome and firefox but not on my iphone

if you re just using the win32 api you normally handle this by handling the wm_size message and respond by calling getclientrect on the parent window and movewindow on the children to move resize the children to fill the parent appropriately

8302448
ienumerable	iqueryable
both iqueryable and ienumerable have deferred execution

8303412
profiling	instrumentation
jeff recommended hitting command + i to launch the profiling and then select the zombies instrumentation

8303412
uiview	calayer
every uiview has a calayer but the point is i don t create these calayer instances myself

8303412

getter	setter
so the reason why your code is crashing is because when you use dynamic you are telling the compiler i promise that an implementation for these getter and setter will be available at runtime

8303609
getter	setter
instead there are two things you could do use an nsnumber for both the bool and the float or implement your own getter and setter

8303609
getter	setter
implementing you own getter and setter

1 use a dataset to store the log entries and then use a dataview to apply filtering sorting

8303765
for-loop	arrays
well the only way i could think of was to store the column values in arrays and then using for-loop to spit each value out along with their percentage

8303780
client-side	server-side
while that doesn t allow dynamically loading dependencies in an asynchronous way as the amd specs does it does allow to nicely share the same javascript code on both the client-side and server-side which is a huge bonus for me mainly because i m working with nodejs on the server side too so i m not sure how important that might be for you and it handles packaging all of the dependencies together nicely for you so they can be synchronously require d by parsing your javascript code and looking for plain require calls to determine what a given script requires in order to run

8303785
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
everything works great on google-chrome 15.0.874.106 but is doesn t work on firefox 7.0.1 and opera 11.52

even if i put in the correct password after the dialog the dialog just flashes as if the request was sent and then it pop-up again

8303841
queue	fifo
a fifo queue might be a better approach than recursion as suggested by the wikipedia article on breadth-first search

8303844
put	get
you may be able to get away with using it if you put back-ticks around it but i think you would be better off changing the name to a non-reserved word

8303862
min	max
my problem is that using this code the y-axis remains at a max and min based on the original view of the data

8303862
min	max
i want the y-axis to autoscale so that the max and min is only based on the data visible due to the x-axis zoom per graph pane of course

8303881
post	get
get more visitors and post content more frequently to get google to visit your site more often

8303890

8304090
udp	tcp
digi now has a wifi xbee module which can plug-in directly where an old xbee was and can be accessed via tcp or udp directly from a iphone app

8304116
post	get
without the attribute the form automatically submits as a get request while your php code is trying to get post data

8304119
post	put
for security reasons you don t want to post a query to that page it s better to put the query in the code on that page and then send some information with your post to invoke the search

8304122
profiling	instrumentation
to do almost the same thing but without having to open instrumentation or profiling your app you can set nszombieenabled mallocstacklogging and guard malloc in the debugger

apparently in vb 6.0 you were able to flip the min and max values and this achieved what i desire to do but they removed that feature in vb.net

8304227
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine except every now and then the url used to access one of the logs which sometimes gets around 700mb stops responding in google-chrome it says no data recieved in ie and firefox it just shows a blank page

8304233
onresume	onpause
you shouldn t need a wakelock stops power saving ensure you are releasing the camera resource in one of the lifecycle methods onpause or onstop then reacquire the camera resource in onresume

8304250
bottle	flask
flask and bottle are popular choices for this kind of lightweight http work

8304254
getter	setter
but mostly its also when you want to encapsulate other logic into the getter an setter to perform other functions

8304255
getter	setter
yes private properties can make sense particularly in cases where you have logic you want to implement in the getter setter

8304255
getter	setter
you may only want these accessible within the class hence they re private but you still want to encapsulate the getter setter logic in one place

8304255
getter	setter
someone reflecting over public properties won t see the first one but they will see the second even if they can t invoke the getter setter

8304265
getter	setter
i ve never created a private property with an auto getter setter

8304275
put	get
now i thought maybe changing the tabs programatically doesn t call viewdiddisappear so i put a breakpoint there but it does indeed get called

8304299
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome and firefox just not ie 9

8304387
pull	push
android widget design seems to work on the basis that your widget pull information when it wants it i think there are many sensible scenarios where an activity may wish to push data to a widget

8304402
pop-up	dialog
i launch an activity which in turn pop-up a dialog

width	height
the fields i can access for each photo through the graph api are id from tags name icon picture source height width images link created_time updated_time position

8304443
folder	directory
unfortunately the best approach is probably os dependent ie writing to the application data folder in windows and writing to a hidden folder in the home directory in nix systems

8304492
for-loop	loops
if you add a for-loop it will likely freeze all other computations which means your activity view won t show up until loops breaks

8304514
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade to php 5.3.2 and according to phpversion that s the versioning that is getting used

8304538

nstimer	nsblockoperation
i could have the nstimer fire on the main thread then use nsblockoperation to dispatch a background thread but i m wondering if there is a more efficient way of doing this

8304704
submit	submission
if you need to add the subscriber to the db or do other processing before submission the best way is to do all processing via ajax and once the processing is finished return true so the form will submit

8304711
pull	push
this is useful when direct push and pull are not

8304714
cos	sin
use sin and cos approximation functions instead of math.sin and math.cos

listview	gridview
one way to accomplish this is to bring up a small form with all the subitems of the listview item in textboxes or a gridview so they can be edited

8304794
union	distinct
use union all if you know the values will be distinct unique -- union removes duplicates and is slower for that reason

8304804
accessor	properties
minimize properties access - cache dom accessor objects in local variables before performing operations - especially before loops

8304807
jobs	cron
using cron jobs

8304807
jobs	cron
another idea is to use cron jobs which will call your script on constant interval and you won t need your browser to be running all the time

8304820
postgresql	mysql
mysql usually wants to use 3306 first but iÃ¢ ve had it try to use the postgresql port on one occasion but i feel like i need to account for strange configurations

8304848

8305226
nsfilemanager	nsfilecoordinator
however i am using nsfilemanager s copyitematurl with an nsfilecoordinator to copy a file from the application sandbox to the ubiquity container

8305227
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
my download class performs an nsurlconnection to fetch some xml data uses nsxmlparser to parse the data and then updates a complex schema in core data

8305239
nsmenuitem	nspopupbutton
if the data is hidden it needs to be added to the nspopupbutton as an nsmenuitem but the hidden flag needs to be set to yes so it does not normally appear in the nspopupbutton menu

8305239
nsmenuitem	nspopupbutton
i was wondering if there is a straight forward way of doing this using nsarraycontroller and an nspopupbutton but thus far i have not been able to find anything resembling a solution -- not when it comes to managing the hidden property of the nsmenuitem objects

8305280
onclick	onchange
ajax listener event valuechange seems to be firing onclick instead of onchange

8305280
button	checkbox
that s indeed the default valuechange event which is been used by the radio button and checkbox which are genreated by the respective jsf components

8305280
button	checkbox
the reason why jsf does that by default is clear for checkbox but at first sight not entirely clear for radio button as they cannot be unticked anyway

8305297
post	put
following up on the comment i just put on your post that article states the following regarding objective-c

8305329
adplus	procdump
alternatively you can use adplus or procdump to do it automatically when it crashes

8305383

i currently have button on the screen as well that shows congratualtions message when clicked but that should be on an if i need to make the button call the webservice post information entered in fields to database and get back a reply in this case true false

8305385
superclass	subclassing
the cryptic code under convproxy is just a smart-aleck way to generate the specified methods when creating a class each of which calls a superclass method and creates a subclassing from the result using the specified converter function

8305386
post	get
usually for web testing i use test www mechanize but that seems more appropriate for get post html rpc testing

8305386
post	put	post	get	put	get
are there any test modules that would make testing of http with basic auth using get post put delete etc and json easy

8305404
post	get
then you d get a view where each post gets two rows one with the title and one with the comments

8305442
textview	imageview
looks like imageview is not scaling to fit textview

8305442
textview	imageview
but if you put textview above imageview everything looks fine - imageview is scaled down and text fits perfectly

8305446
width	height
i m running into an issue with my template that seems strange to me when i use ems to define image height width it will not display while setting the image size using pixels works fine

8305456
post	get
when you post your form you can get all the variable in the action using the names of the related hidden input

8305464
cos	sin
and then you would add the items that are currently in your sin cos tan graphs sub-scenes as child items of one of those 3 top level items

8305484
google-chrome	safari
you can observe this by using a tool like firebug or the native developer tools in google-chrome or safari to inspect the images while they re being rotated by the cycle plugin

8305516
jboss	glassfish
fix give up on glassfish and move to jboss 7 which actually works most of the time

is so you could set it to to limit it to minimum of 5 chars and a max of 20

8305622
rss	feed
i m trying to read an rss feed using powershell and i can t extract a cdata-section within the feed

8305691
post	get
https post s on google app engine are getting redirected to app url with a get and losing all arguments

8305703
fancybox	jgrowl
fancybox is not a popup but a modal lightbox jquery plugin which is a non-intrusive solution like jgrowl from a ui point of view

8305714
textview	imageview
by using relativelayout you can set textview below the imageview so that imageview and textview can wrap

8305779
children	parent
the requirement is that the parent and their corresponding children need to be exported into a pdf document

8305779
children	parent
something as above will probably solve the problem but all of a sudden the requirements changes and now each of these parent and their corresponding children need to be in separate pdfs so the above given snippet is modified by changing the appendtoparentpdf to exporttopdf follows

8305795
width	height
they seem to be fixed to the iframe based off this fiddle note jsfiddle uses an iframe and my height s and width s were just to test scrolling

8305876
multiplying	add
means add two after multiplying by three

8305888
profiling	debugging
when using this it work for creating a record with a yes true statement or no false statement i can even update a no false to a yes true in the database....but i can t edit a yes true to a no false ...if i debugging everything looks good right up until i hit my riaservice then using sql profiling the field isn t updated

8305893
hash	salt
hash the users password + salt together

8305893
hash	salt
surely if they can read what the salt value is for that hash password they can work out what the hash password is without the salt and then use a rainbow table

8305899
implements	extends
there will be a server program that will implements your interface extends remote and it will have definitions or calls to other methods at server and it will bind an object

8305916
for-loop	loops
with an arraylist a hand-written counted loops is about 3x faster with or without jit but for other collections the enhanced for-loop syntax will be exactly equivalent to explicit iterator usage

8305932
hash	salt
the introduction of a salt invalidates these precomputed hash a rainbow table must be made for each unique salt

8305939
ddms	adb
update2 i found a resolution and i could use remote adb to connect the device after running the app in the device you can type following from pc command to make it connected to ddms

8305943
hash	salt
the point of the salt hash password process is to make it computationally infeasible to precompute possible password hash because the random salt screws up the precomputation process

8305943
hash	salt
it also means that if the same password is used at different sites it won t be obvious by simply looking at the salt hash password values - because the salt will be different at the different sites so the resulting hash value will be different

8305951
hash	salt
let s say you didn t use a salt and an attacker got your hash

8305951
hash	salt
now let s say the same attacker got your hash but they are salt

8305951
hash	salt
for each hash she wants to examine she ll need to take the candidate password apply the salt compute a new hash and compare it to the hash you have stored

8305967
int	chars	unsigned	short
write a program to determine the ranges of chars short int and long variables both signed and unsigned by printing appropriate values from standard headers and by direct computation

8305967
range	minimum
i ve managed to determine the range of all types except floating-points both by using minimum and maximum values from standard headers and by direct computation

8305971
width	height
i have tried using setpositionandshow however the supplied offsets are 12 even though the createwidget is actually about 200px for both width and height

8306002
post	get
and in your your_url_for_function_to_update_status in php you can get post value and updte accordingly

8306007
decoder	encoder
this way adding support for a new format or type is as simple as providing a decoder and or encoder for it adding an spi file to the manifest of the jar it is in then adding the jar to the run-time class-path of the application

8306007
decoder	encoder
so if you can provide the encoder decoder then yes

8306043
punctuation	words
basically i m trying to read in the words from a file and without punctuation read each words into a multimap which is then inserted into a vector with each pair being a words and the line of the file that words is found

8306045
tinyint	boolean
i recommend using an boolean or tinyint and validating the radio input value by using intval

8306046
for-loop	loops
i would improve this function by removing the while loops for and replace with for-loop so that doesn t have to be evaluated every time in loops and also replace is_array with isset and move the values to keys isse t is quicker than in_array

8306070
folder	directory
the location unfortunetly seems to quite often contain n or n in it because the current directory is in the temp folder causing the line to either break or remove itself from the line entirely making the folder location invalid

8306088
hide	show
the tabs as a whole jquery plugin do not hide show the problem concerns only the header part of the tabs

8306101
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i have used ajaxcontrol toolkits control now i want to use updatepanel i have added it but it is not working it will work on scriptmanager but other controls of ajaxcontrol toolkits not working

here server is my interface which extends remote serverimplementor is class implements server

8306231
free	malloc
i m on linux and trying to work with the examples create a wrapper function for malloc and free in c

8306231
free	malloc
and i just get the test program output - not printouts from the .so on each malloc free call as i otherwise understood the effect should be

8306254
uibezierpath	nsbezierpath
first i assume you have a uibezierpath ios not an nsbezierpath mac os x

8306283
free	malloc
try replacing malloc with debug_malloc or free with debug_free and see the difference

8306314
debian-based	ubuntu
or maybe on a debian-based system ubuntu

8306316
free	malloc
the define needs to be in a header file which you include in your malloctest.c file that way the right malloc free will be called

8306337
jobs	cron
using the whenever gem to control cron jobs is great

8306338
portrait	landscape
it has an initial thumbnail view supports landscape portrait modes swipe for next previous cartoons timed hiding unhide of status bars navigation bars etc.

8306346
128bit	64bit
in practice computer systems have been known to use 128bit or even 64bit numbers as supposedly unguessable tokens

8306346
128bit	64bit
another way to look at this is to consider how many guesses per second an attacker might be able to make and considering how long it would take them to guess a 64bit or 128bit number with whatever probability makes you feel threatened

8306370
width	height
you ll likely want to maintain the aspect ratio so you ll want to calculate max width or height and place in that frame centered or crop it to the square

8306405
put	get
put a tail -f on your error log for your web server and see how far you get

8306601
put	get
i tried to follow abhajit and anders k s advice and actually put everything in the executable file - which would eliminate the .so but just to see if i can get it to work.

8306610
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
sidenote arrays also implicitly implement icollection ilist and ienumerable the clr actually generates an array that inherits from the generic versions of those classes in addition to the non-generic at runtime so your above code would work with arrays as well

8306627
mouse	keyboard
selectionmodel currently handles mouse click and keyboard on select row in celltable

8306644
post	get
those variables - get - post populate no matter what verb is being used

8306660

when i put an exit command in the php file i can solve this problem but then i will not get the value of the returned file s id to tpl

8306723
post	get
i think you re limited to either get or post there too

8306723
post	get
you might be able to configure the maximum size of request data post get

8306742
jpa	javax.persistence
if i want to use hibernate with jpa i have to use some of javax.persistence

8306748
wamp	ampps

8306784
stdout	stderr
if fd is 3 it will close fds 0 1 2 which would have been originally pointing to stdin stdout stderr respectively and create 3 copies of fd 0 1 2 all pointing to the same destination as the fd 3

8306784
stdout	stderr
if fd is 1 it will close fds 0 2 which would have been originally pointing to stdin stderr respectively and create 2 copies of fd 0 2 all pointing to the same destination as the fd 1 stdout

8306814
public	protected
the purist in me says that you should leave protected members alone and only test them through the public interface

8306847
maven-deploy-plugin	maven-install-plugin
instead of looking up the project builder you can look up the artifactinstaller and artifactdeployer - you ll find the code you want in the maven-install-plugin and the maven-deploy-plugin

the parent wrap constraint is very loose but i want it to specifically use the matching width but always match the height of the image view

8314178
inherited	subclassing
its not that clear from your question maybe some code would help but yes this seems like an acceptable approach in that the consumer does not care which subclassing is used as they all inherited from the same abstract base class

8314178
super	implements
if you are only reliant on the interface then you can provide another implementation which does not derive from the super class but still implements the interface and everything will still be ok

the whole serializable deserialization process would be like this

width	height
tables are for developers who can t be bothered to fiddle for hours with css to get two adjacent columnesque divs to expand to 100 height and width regardless of content and then get the hack to work in all browsers without adding extra div wrappers and then finally in absolute frustration they resort to the 5 second fix

width	height
use a function other than getbounds to determine the area of your mazecircle for example using the properties x y width and height instead

maven-jar-plugin	pom.xml
if i had to guess i would say that since your packaging type is jar configuration for the maven-jar-plugin gets inserted into your effective pom.xml

it seem that the soci library search for the file usr lib libsoci_mysql.so that is not in the system buy if you make a link to the library usr lib libsoci_mysql-gcc-3_0-3.0.0.so that it s in the system it works i think debian ubuntu makes a file name change from the original name but it have side effects because the soci library search inside for the original name

if the configured authentication is windows then the ports needed for kerberos ntlm 135

8316229
quicksort	heapsort
i like heapsort but as well as the drawbacks noted above i have heard it said that it makes poor use of modern memories because it makes memory accesses all over the place whereas quicksort and even small radix sorts end up intermixing a relatively small number of streams of sequential reads and writes - so caches are more effective

8316261
stdout	fflush
when a program segfaults does stdout not fflush its buffer automatically

8316270

i found that if i try to put some special entities like lambda into the xml file i will always get the following error

8316516
for-loop	loops
some of the restrictions would have been either rather arbitrary or rather complicated especially on loops given that c++ doesn t have the concept of a native incrementing for-loop but both the end condition and the increment code have to be explicitly specified in the for statement making it possible to use arbitrary expressions for them

8317601
put	get
it s technically possible to build this sort of system but managing the synonyms the privilege grants and the build process can get unwieldy very quickly in addition to making it more likely that data integrity problems are introduced when different applications put essentially the same data in different tables because they weren t aware that some other application already had a table for that entity

8317607
profiling	instrumentation
after profiling this code with instrumentation leaks it s telling me that the line with performrequestwithhandler is leaking

this is because uinavigationcontroller is a subclass of uiviewcontroller and a self centered one at that

i have my site built with jquery show hide divs and want to have a specific div show when the page is loaded from a specific link

8317850
onclick	preventdefault	onclick	onchange	onchange	preventdefault
i have tried every combination of preventdefault and return false i can think of both in the function and the onclick event and have tried using the onchange event etc etc but nothing seems to allow me to call a function that fires when the checkbox is clicked that allows the function to get the current value of the checkbox before it is changed by the click event

i m trying to use this code to hide or show a div based on the url param direction i can t get this to work and wonder if there is a better way

8317992
hide	show
it s possible that your code isn t working as the divs haven t been loaded in to the dom when you re trying to show hide them

8318006
hide	show
maybe in the if else statement you need to show and hide the other div so that the correct one is show and the correct one is hidden in each condition

8318027
free	malloc
instead of using malloc to allocate on the heap and since there is no free which will lead to a memory leak it will be much easier if we allocate on the stack with a predetermined buffer size

8318039
google-chrome	firefox
but when the page is load i am not able to click the image it is not in clickable mode while when i open the same page in firefox or google-chrome i can click the image and item command event is also firing

8318055
keydown	mousedown
i m not aware of any deselected event but there s probably only a couple events that will allow text to be deselected so you can probably listen for blur mousedown and keydown

8318362
octal	binary	octal	decimal
the program converts a number in binary decimal octal hexadecimal

8318396
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you re able to edit your html the optimum solution would be to move the buttons inside #top-products positioning them as required and changing your javascript slightly to use the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead

8318397
onmouseover	onclick
1 since there is no onmouseover event in mobile browsers iphone android i use onclick event to change the button color

8318591
mouseleave	mouseenter
btw mouseenter and mouseleave do not work with this seemingly

8318593
tinyint	boolean
if you never need to use sql to filter out records based on these checkboxes i m guessing they are yes no boolean tinyint type values then serializing is a valid approach

8318596
firefox	safari
i did some testing and to my surprise experienced the same error myself on firefox and safari for windows

8318608
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
you can set width 100 and make it account for padding and borders by also setting box-sizing border-box - you ll need to use the vendor prefixes i believe -moz- and -webkit-

8318617
comparator	comparable
but for both cases you should use the standard java interfaces even though you are only using comparable also see comparator

8318630
google-chrome	firefox
onblur is disabled on google-chrome this will work on firefox and ie

8318646
mouseover	mouseout
unfortunately the event mouseover was poorly named - it would ve been better if it had been called mousein so that it was more obviously and intuitively the opposite of mouseout

8318646
mouseleave	mouseenter
i think mouseenter and mouseleave are ie things that other browsers may not support - though i think jquery supports those events too

8318670
calloc	malloc
or if you prefer malloc can be re-defined in terms of calloc

it is probably not possible at least not on linux because the instruction register sets are different on x86 32 bits and x86-64 64bit

8318827
post	put	post	get	put	get
this is also not a problem when using servicestack every result you return get s automatically converted in the response contenttype you want this is the full code of a simple web service that can be called via all http verbs get post put delete on all the supported formats no config required json xml html jsv csv soap even by a direct html form x-www-form-urlencoded or querystring request

8318838
multiplying	subtract
there is nothing to subtract from 9 after multiplying

8318868
width	height
say the image size is greater than 50x50 is there any way that i can proportionally scale down the image so that the shorter of its width and height would become 50px

8318868
portrait	landscape
note that the image can be in either portrait or landscape

8318909
uitableview	reloaddata
just empty the array you re using as a data source bear in mind that your numberofrowsinsection data source method must use the array count and call reloaddata on the uitableview

8318933
width	height
divide the width of the image by the height that s your ratio

8318933
width	height
then find what s the largest dimension if it s the width set the width 50 ratio and height 50

8318933
width	height
if it s the height set it height 50 ratio and the width 50

8319057
pull	push
i don t get any errors or warnings on commit only on push and not on pull

8319064
width	height
you can t constrain an image to a fixed width and height rectangle while maintaining aspect ratio in css alone

8319064
width	height
if you set just a width then the height will be set to maintain the aspect ratio likewise just a height but this will not force the image to fit into a box since you can t know which is greatest the width or the height

8319083
atomic	compare-and-swap
in a typical jdk implementation for a modern processor atomicreference.set simply uses a volatile write since atomicreference.compareandset uses a compare-and-swap operation that is atomic with respect to volatile writes

are you asking how to show an image in your rss feed

8319096

do not accept session identifiers from get post variables

8319109
post	get
session identifiers in url query string get variables or post variables are not recommended as it simplifies this attack

8319109

if it is the first case then most if not all python ide i have ever used do have that functionality built in gedit eclipse geany spe just to mention a few

8319216
memcpy	malloc
essentially what the below does it dynamically allocate some memory if i goes over 256 then the array needs to be increased in size so i malloc a temp array with 2x the size memcpy etc

folder	directory
i ve noticed that in my project s eggs folder some projects are unzipped to directory and some are left in their zip files

8319312
tcplistener	tcpclient
this is a bit more complex than using wcf but you could simply use a tcpclient and a tcplistener in system.net.sockets which could be used to open up an actual tcp port and communicate that way make sure to listen on ipaddress.loopback not any or you might get a firewall warning

8319320
daemons	launchd
stop the postgres server launchd daemons

8319418
pull	push
since post-receive hooks do no affect the outcome of the push since they happen after the push the push itself has gone fine but the pull that the hook attempted as part of the post-receive has failed due to the local changes

postgresql	mysql
i ve looked at oracle db2 mysql postgresql and sybase and almost every resource has a different list

dbcontext	objectcontext
you still have all the bells and whistles that data or model first approach have and some since you can extend the dbcontext which is objectcontext under the hood

8319473
setinterval	settimeout
geoff has outlined one approach using setinterval and clearing it from the callback so i ll outline the other using settimeout from the callback

8319473
setinterval	settimeout
so if draw took 100ms say the chained settimeout would be equivalent to setinterval func 1100

8319473
setinterval	settimeout
that means that events you schedule with settimeout or setinterval or any other async function will never occur during a loop even if the loop is infinite

8319475

we set the content-disposition and content-type in the response header in the controller like so

8319571
curlpp	libcurl
to download a file via http in a c++ program you can use libcurl or the curlpp c++ wrapper

8319575
post	get
they can use curl functions to post the data to a script on your site fsockopen to manually perform the http request if curl is not available or if it is a simple get request file_get_contents of your url with parameters in the query string would work as well

8319647
getter	setter
the canonical way to do this is by using a combination of opaque pointers and public structs along with allocators getter and setter for the private elements

8319676
oncreate	ondestroy
i have two activities and both use oncreate and ondestroy methods only

8319687
hide	show
the only workaround i ve been able to find has been to catch the showevent function and to promptly hide the window but this still allows the qdialog object to be show for a split second

8319712
ssl	https
so viewing google maps behind ssl is still an issue unless someone knows of a work-a-round to get those location or building images removed or to be displayed behind https and not http such as the case below with the image itself

8319716
google-chrome	firefox
the website works fine woth google-chrome but slows down when opening in ie all versions or firefox

8319719
yacc	bison
i will take a moment to plug my own tool meta# which allows you to build a pattern matching grammar for exactly these types of scenarios but you could also use one of many others such as lexx yacc flexx bison or antlr

profiler	shark
the argument i want to add is -agentlib shark on mac osx for running a profiler

8320031
oncreate	onstart
onstart and onstop are existing methods on an activity just like oncreate

8320031
oncreate	ondestroy
oncreate and ondestroy are not an appropriate pair of methods to use for flurry session tracking because ondestroy is not guaranteed to be called

8320036
gson	jackson
while there is a handful of java-to from-json apis that provide for easy basic binding between json and an arbitrary java data structure jackson and gson are by far the most sophisticated capable and feature-rich options

8320036
gson	jackson
back in july 2011 i posted a multi-part series on my blog comparing using gson versus jackson stepping through features as they were organized in the gson user guide including examples of comparable implementations in jackson and of implementations in gson where the gson user guide was incomplete or broken

8320036
gson	jackson
this is the most comprehensive comparison of using gson versus jackson for common json-to from-java tasks known

8320036
gson	jackson
the current release of gson 2.0 shows to be about 16 times slower than the current release of jackson 1.9.2 at serializing and deserializing a 500 byte json structure using very comparable implementation efforts just one or two lines of code

8320056
opera	safari

in the following code that i simplified how could you debug to find out what type each t is depending on main that will initiate the a with int double or any other type

8320336
jobs	cron
edit if you really can t merge the two cron jobs you could use the technique described in this question to wait for the first process to finish

8320343
jobs	cron
one approach would be to make sure that if those two jobs are separate cron jobs - there is enough time inbetween to surely cover the run of job 1

8320430
width	height
1.fix the imageview width and height and use

8320430
width	height

8320705
width	height
you define objects and sencha in his turn will generate html with all the properties that you will define in your js files height width class id etc

iprincipal	iidentity
i also create my own custom iprincipal and iidentity because i want to store a bit more info in the cookie which forms auth creates when a person has been authenticated

maven configuration is done via the pom.xml

8321027
for-loop	loops
you can easily loops over all of the contained integers using a for-loop

8321037
for-loop	arrays
still working on the assumption that you re thinking about python. there s syntax in objc called fast enumeration for iterating over the contents of an nsarray that is pleasantly similar to a python for-loop but since literal and primitive numbers can t be put into an nsarray you can t go directly from an nsrange to a cocoa arrays

8321263
width	height
the values for width and height in this line are 0

8321263
inherited	properties	width	height
the reason being that they are referring to the width and height properties of the class you re working within main - properties inherited from displayobject which will be zero based on what i can see

uilabel	uitextview	uilabel	uibutton
how can i place the uitextview uitextfield uilabel and uibutton in uitableview

8321848
gridview	rowdatabound
i believe that rowdatabound adds the rows in the same order that the data source has them in therefore if there are 100 records in your datatable and you bind that datatable to the gridview rowdatabound gets called 100 times for each row in the order they exist in the datatable

8321848
gridview	rowdatabound
by doing this you can look at the next row that will be added to the gridview by rowdatabound because it will be the next row in the datatable which already exists and can be viewed

8321876
subtract	add
regarding the buttons you don t actually say what is wrong with your add subtract button behaviour but i m guessing the problem is that you update the display first via the allinone function and then increment or decrement after that

8321895
opengl-es	glsurfaceview
i m writing an android app with a glsurfaceview opengl-es 2.0 on top of a surfaceview used for camera live preview

my situation is actually currently the other way around a chars int into a std string taking function

8322198
apache	nginx
i ll probably put it behind nginx but the only web development i ve done that s gone to production in the past has been apache with php and node.js - i don t really understand exactly what is happening in memory and with processes when you push a ruby web app to production

if i do it some other way - with wsgi or reverse proxy to unicorn thin - what exactly happens with concurrency

8322241

when you create an instance of a qwidget without a parent by supplying a null pointer or letting it default to a null pointer it s parent effectively gets set to your application s qapplication 1 instance

8329072

the reason qapplication allwidgets works is due to the fact that all qwidget instances have a pointer to them which is stored in your single qapplication instance

8329072

this project grew into several different projects with xsl-fo fulfilling this rÃ£ le and xslt doing the transformations i mentioned above

8329478
xsl-fo	xslt
it was originally designed to help with the xsl-fo stuff xslt would turn some xml into xsl-fo that would detail rendering but now has many uses outside of that so it made sense to split it off

dlsym	dlopen
with the same method why does dlsym always return nil even though dlopen returns non-null

8330528
comparator	comparable
you can use priorityqueue which suits best to your needs then you can implement custom comparator if you think in future you may need a different implementation for sorting or else comparable which will sort your request so that jobs in terms of size are submitted executed first

8330559
hide	show
i am using css3 hover and transitions to show and hide an image

8330578
innodb	myisam
you then join the original innodb table against the myisam copies with fulltext searches on the myisam fields and regular other where clauses on the innodb copies

8330578
innodb	myisam
with appropriate triggers on the innodb table there s no reason that the myisam copies would get stale incorrect or you could simply rebuild them on a scheduled basis so that you ve got a staleness window that matches the rebuild interval

8330584
profiling	debugging
there are several compilation profiling in eclipse cdt release and debugging

8330584
profiling	debugging
the default profiling in eclipse cdt is debugging

8330584
profiling	debugging
i guess using release profiling instead of default debugging profiling rebuilding also works and i guess that it s the same with mingw environment

8330916
int	double
date is not an int in vb a it is a double

8330917
width	margin
if the image width is fixed perhaps the easiest way is to put the image inside the content div and then push it back to the left with a negative margin

8330944
width	height
in code rather than via the layout xml you can create a bitmap of the right aspect ratio device height x width by cropping the image after scaling the bitmap to be big enough to crop

8330950
getter	setter
what i meant was if we d know ammount of class templete arguments n we could create n variables of difrent types one for each argument and n strings all private and so we could create n functions for setter and getter of that strings + variables which we would call in constructor

8330957
mouse	keyboard
also two or more fingers may be used to augment normal touching and dragging gestures though this is analogous to using a mouse with alternate buttons or keyboard modifiers

viewing this chart on font-face browser support webkit safari and opera browsers do not support the woff font format which is the format that particular font is in

8330961

8331096
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
ie 8 google-chrome 15.0.+ firefox 7.0 safari 5

8331138
put	get
you have to put something like the following to this file in this example i m using php_xdebug-2.2.3-5.3-vc9-nts.dll use to get to know which version you need and of course you need to substitute to the appropriate path

8331140
hide	show
i want to hide the map and direction link if there is no office name address phone and working hours..like on the first cell there are all those values so i want the map and direction to show up but in the second one since there are no values the map and directions link should hide..how do u do it using jquery

8331173
hash	md5
i am trying to generate a unix-style password hash using md5

8331186
setinterval	settimeout
i think you should use setinterval instead of settimeout

8331213
hex	binary
the unix password hash is in hex format while you re writing it down in binary

8331241
hash	md5
because hash bytes may be in any range from 0 to 255 which is not like md5 hash is looking

8331259
width	height
that way all the pages occupy 100 width height of the viewport and no scrolling-to-the-top-before-transitions will occur

8331291
crypt	md5
unix md5 crypt doesn t use plain md5

8331291
hash	md5
that would be insecure because plain md5 is fast and password hash should be slow

8331318
charindex	substr
the problem with doing something like substr filepath 9 charindex filepath 9 - 9 is that when i have a path that looks like c root iwantthisstring it returns an error because the charindex never finds a last after root because there is no third in this case

8331329
nexus	artifactory
have an out-facing instance of nexus or artifactory

8331344
onclick	onsubmit

8331348
decoder	encoder
for instance in the case of json encoder decoder we can try whether we have simplejson library available and use json library as a fallback as follows

8331374
google-chrome	firefox

pull	push
dr do a git pull merge changes if needed then push again

8331471

8331471
pull	push
is this actually possible or so i need to push to a different github branch and then do a pull request between branches or setup a completely different github repo and then pull request from that one

8331473
google-chrome	firefox
i m on ubuntu using google-chrome and firefox trying to prevent browsers from caching css files on localhost .

8331487
put	get
but i don t think i can use javaobject or javamethod to work around it since i have to call a static method to create the object and i can t just throw it in an eval because i get a transparency violation error or if i put it in an anonymous function defined outside the spmd i get the same class is undefined error

8331522
jlist	jlabel
if you have a map you can have it retrieve the point of interest from the jlabel s or the jlist s string and then pass this point to the class that s drawing the image and let it use the point to draw a rectangle

8331522
mouseevent	mouselistener
and in your code that is called from this mouselistener use a joptionpane to get the user s choice of tag name and add the resulting string to both the listdatamodel so that it is seen in the jlist and also in the stringpointmap together with the point obtained from the mouseevent so that you can map the string to the point and be able to retrieve it

8331567
ssl	https
i have a django site setup with lighttpd and ssl working but i can not seem to get a redirect to work from http to https

8331568

the idea is that the display class takes in a set of fairly lightweight objects that extend gameobject and contain information about their location size and appearance on the screen and then draws them pixel-by-pixel onto the applet stretching and positioning them proportionally depending on the specified display height and width

8332223
width	height
in testing this i set the width and height of the display to 128 and pass two objects to the display which are both 32-pixel squares both return 32 for getwidth and getheight one is red and returns 24 for getx and gety and the other is blue and returns 16 for getx and gety

8332223
width	height
why is java.awt.graphics.fillrect int x int y int width int height only painting the topleft corner of the applet

8333385
draggable	droppable
i know that i can set these up as draggable and droppable as follows

8333394
client-side	server-side
unfortunatly client-side techniques like the conditional comments used do not mix with server-side techniques

8333430
hide	show
wrap the imagebutton in a div and tie jquery handlers to show or hide the link

8333463
google-chrome	firefox
is there a client side method javascript+html no flash to change this behavior to send just the name like google-chrome firefox do

8333464

accessor	ivar
i use the _ivar construct to make sure that i don t access the ivar directly by mistake when i really intend to go through the accessor

8334000
put	get
put an alert and a settimeout in your code to test whether they all execute at the same time or get separated

8334018
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome both seem to ignore this and still put the scrollbar on the right side

8334018
google-chrome	safari
is there a way to get it on the left side in both safari and google-chrome

8334041
setinterval	settimeout
long example short you can track whether or not it s time to play a beat by checking the value of new date .getmilliseconds and seeing if the equivalent of one beat in milliseconds has passed instead of relying on the not-so-accurate settimeout or setinterval functions

8334050
post	get
for instance when i click on a story posted by the washington post on someone s timeline i get this screen - when i expected it to just bring me straight to the article

8334125
getter	setter
basically you can declare property s in a class extension to still give you the benefits of the synthesize d getter setter but without making your public api look ugly

8334130
accessor	properties
there are a couple benefits to differentiating ivars from properties accessor

8334134
accessor	properties	getter	setter
remember the properties and synthesize is there to replace boilerplate code - without it you d have to code getter and setter accessor

8334151
serializable	deserialization
please take a look at gson that is a great library to work on json serializable and deserialization even into objects easily and fast

8334152
.htaccess	httpd.conf
start with a fresh zf project or remove all of your zend routes and any special configuration in .htaccess or httpd.conf httpd-vhosts.conf that you created

8334195
getter	setter
i have a weird situation where the getter in a class returns a primitive int type and the setter takes a integer class

8334195
getter	setter
to the getter and the setter to change the type of the field in schema but that does not help

8334195

everything s fine in google-chrome firefox and even ie9 but after opening the page in ie8 an information toolbar appears with question if i really want to download those files

8334238
inherited	subclassing
the part is ill-advised because it is doesn t allow you to insert new classes in the hierarchy and it precludes subclassing from using multiple inherited with other classes that may have incompatible positional arguments

8334304
hide	show
i hide each content_div and show another one so i can keep the header static because other solutions didn t work so well

8334320

8334338
sudo	passwd

mamp	wamp
it sounds like you are using mamp or wamp on your dev box which will load a default vhost showing phpinfo for any page that does not exist

8334362
width	height
there are some trivial caveats however since texture objects do not carry width or height getters you are dealing with a source rectangle in texel space 0...1

8334372
post	get
i tried to do it but it seems i got it messed up that first i didn t get the right result and second when i post the code here on stackoverflow you can go to my page and see it for yourself the answers i got are not enough to solve my problem

8334408
g++	gcc
commands such as gcc and g++ work but make does not

8334408

8334449
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this in google-chrome firefox ie9 pc mac and all works fine only ie7 8 are giving me these issues

8334463
jflex	cup
otherwise if you would like to know what compilers and syntactic analyzers do under the hood then you can write your own expression parser using jflex and cup

8334543
hide	show
they can hide delete or remove access to the page and it completely changes how it show or if it show on their wall

8334563
sudo	passwd
if they have to have sudo access to run this script maybe it s possible to remove the passwd out of the file and into a file that has 600 permissions set

8334582
disk	ram
you say heroku say your db fits in ram so you shouldn t see disk i o issues when you measure

8334599
int	chars
just to be safe i would re-declare func1 and func2 to take void and then cast these pointers to chars and int as required

8334635
getter	setter
can you add a new setter getter pair using a new name which both use integer and put the xml tags on that new property

8334835
multiplying	subtract
the functions he asked us to write are to subtract divide multiplying exponentiation x n and a lessthan function

the fix for me using a maven project was to add the following dependencies in the pom.xml file

8334882
post	get
the matched groups from the regexes get passed into the requesthandler s get or post method as arguments

8334882
post	get
the problem is i want to read the values of these matched groups before the get or post is called

8334882
post	get
does tornado have a way of accessing these matched groups outside of get or post

8334889
min	max
the results of this method will commonly be a list of max values and min values with maybe 1 or 2 values inbetween

8334889
min	max
because of this there is a slight optimisation in there using abs which will prevent the iterator constantly trying to find min values counting down from max and vice versa

8334889
min	max
for this code s example it will basically always take away either max or min depending on which bound the value is closer to untill some non min or max value is left over as remainder

8334934
children	parent
scenario i have a parent checkbox that is all of the children are unchecked the parent should be

8334941

division	multiplication	division	addition	addition	multiplication
so even disregarding that division is more expensive than addition and multiplication we see that the number of operations the sieve requires is much smaller than the number of operations required by trial division if the limit is not too small

8335361
onresume	onpause
the most common way to register unregister broadcastreceivers is to use the onresume and onpause methods of your activity

8335365
multiplying	addition
due to the formalized and predictable nature of 2d arrays indexing into only requires a single multiplying operation and a single addition operation

8335389
src	attr
problem is everytime i use img attr src new_path its downloading new image not from cache

8335402
free	malloc
i am likely to be using more than 1 byte of memory because malloc is likely to be using some memory on its own to keep track of free blocks in the heap and it may effectively cost me some memory by always aligning allocations along certain boundaries

8335402
free	malloc
my question is is there a way to find out how much memory is really used up by a particular malloc call including the effective cost of alignment and the overhead used by malloc free

only those subclassing were ever serialized before - never the superclass

8335813
superclass	subclassing
the superclass nor any of the subclassing however implements readobject or writeobject and none of the subclassing had an explicitly defined serialversionuid

8335813
superclass	subclassing
despite all this things were fine as far as reading back previously serialized objects until a new instance variable a list arraylist along with a new method was added to the superclass and some private instance variables were added to one of its subclassing

8335813
superclass	subclassing
i m assuming this is caused because the default serialversionuid which was used because i didn t declare one in any of the subclassing has now changed due to the changes in the superclass and one subclassing

8335813
superclass	subclassing
nor do i know if i need to add serialverisonuids to all of the subclassing or if readobject and writeobject need to be implemented by each subclassing or if i can just implement them once assuming i need to at all in the superclass

gpl bonus for f# but i can translate from haskell ocaml sml if needed

8336087
for-loop	arrays
the reason that the problem goes away when the size of your arrays is changed from 10 to 11 has to do with arraysize being incremented up to 10 in the for-loop above the one causing the problems

8336092
for-loop	loops
your first for-loop should loops through numbers so it makes sense to use the length of numbers in loops constraint

8336092
for-loop	arrays
for the second for-loop you need to traverse the entire tracker arrays so might as well use the length for that tracker.length

8336424
ffmpeg	libavformat
as far as libraries i think libavcodec and libavformat from the ffmpeg project are the most complete

8336424
mp4	h.264
with these libs you can encode h.264 aac mp4 files assuming the licensing problem doesn t affect you

8336448

width	height
i have horizontal scrollview size of 320 width and 40 pixel height

8340115
width	height
i wouldn t think there would be a performance issue in the same way as not specifying height and width on a img tag since that forces the browser to repaint the whole page and that s where the performance issue is

8340126
width	height
you shouldn t care unless you work for google about the performance penalty you d get from not specifing a width height but more about the layout flickering you might get

8340126
width	height
not specifing a width and height will make the browser display an initial box as it doesn t know beforehand how much space the image will take and after the image is loaded it will do a reflow - which means it will have to recalculate the layout of some elements which will be affected by the size change

uiswipegesturerecognizer is for detecting a discrete swipe gesture - it only fires your action one time after a swipe has completed - so if youre asking about the offset or distance the finger moved you d probably want to look at creating a subclass of uigesturerecognizer or using uipangesturerecognizer to get continuous gesture info

the best i could come up with would be to scale the line to fit inside paper based on the width of the path assuming that the width is more than the height

8344080
put	get
as i understood all types of boost.variant are parsed into real types meaning as if boost would after compilation turn into and so i wonder how to get what type was put into boost variant

8344269
getter	setter
call for getter setter when you really need them

8344278
put	get
i need to get url from webview and put it to webadress and from webview2 and put it to webadress2

8344281
getter	setter
i would create an abstract class called baseieexporter or something and then provide a couple or more instance variables and their getter and setter methods within like name filename

8344288
getter	setter
the idea with getter setter is so that you can change the internal workings of the class without breaking other code that depends on it

8344296
implements	extends
extends the built-in observable class is a rather bad choice to implements the observer pattern as it disrupts your class hierarchy but you know that already

8344343
hash	hmac

rpyc	pyro
vpy has native python capabilities similar to pyro and rpyc via a general native objects layer code example

8344518
setinterval	settimeout
one thing i will note is that you have used a settimeout and really just engineered it to behave like setinterval

8344518
setinterval	settimeout
i m no js engine guru but i would like to think the constant reuse of settimeout has to have some effect on performance that would not be present using setinterval which you only need to set once

8344518
setinterval	settimeout
related stack question - settimeout vs setinterval

8344549
innodb	myisam

8344579
width	height
i want all the menus to be the same height or within a wrapper of fixed height width

8344586
stdout	stderr
if it fails silently try redirecting stdout and stderr to a file from your crontab call and post the result

8344587
children	parent
a safe solution is to store the children as boost shared_ptr and store the parent as a raw pointer

8344587
children	parent
can i disallow the deletion of children parent by the tree_node class

8344606

children	parent
i can see why children cannot be allowed to delete a parent node but i don t understand why you would want to disallow deletion of a child

8344849
terminate	timeout
there should also be a timeout on the whole process of two hours and a timeout of 2 minutes on the killed event in case it gets stuck at which point i would like to be able to unload it forcing any threads to terminate which is what kill should do anyway

8344898
getter	setter
i have tried to make those two action classes extend the same base class unfortunately struts 2 seem to ignore setter getter of parent classes and you can t use generic types either because again struts 2 won t know which class to instantiate and give to the setter in action classes

8344898
getter	setter
this is why i say struts 2 ignores setter getter in parent class

8344913
ssl	https

min	max
a possible workaround would be to wire the itemdatabound event of radchart and keep track of the min and max value plotted available through e.seriesitem.yvalue

8345585
range	min	range	max	min	max
then depending on their values compared to the baselinevalue you can decide whether to keep the autoscale feature that would be if baselinevalue is between min and max or set autoscale to false and manually define the axis range so that the marked zone is visible.

8345587
google-chrome	firefox

8345802
for-loop	arrays
now about the storing the department information problem- if you have a limited number of departments there s a pretty easy way to do that- you can store each department s employees in a different string arrays all of them can be stored in the same xml file and then simply go throw each arrays and for-loop within a for-loop and save each employee with its department key

8345857
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

scott hanselman recommended changing the application design to a post redirect get prg model when a similar question was asked here

8347913
implements	extends
but if you only have one base with member variables and other base classes contain only pure virtual functions then this pattern acts exactly like java where the class containing some methods and member variables maps to extends and other classes which contain only pure virtual functions maps to implements

you re also better off using mouseenter and mouseleave than mouseover and mouseout

8348635
mouseover	mouseout
the reason you re better off is that mouseover and mouseout bubble and so as the mouse travels over descendant elements of the tileagenzia elements you ll see messages from those descendants.

8348635
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you want to stick with the javascript solution you can use the hover function which is if you pass it two functions just a shortcut for hooking up mouseenter and mouseleave

simply enough you re using the http post method not the http get method so you need to use rather than on the php side

8350060

8350263
next	except
which is the very next line after the code except below as the culprit

8350322
width	height
if you absolutely wanted to use gridlayout instead of tablelayout to accomplish the layout you re describing anyway one slightly hackish solution would be to just create 9 copies of a fixed view set them to available width 3 x available height 3 and add them as children to the gridlayout

keydown	keyup
the event order of key presses is keydown keypress keyup and the value is updated between the press and up events

8350705

however as any good object oriented programmer will tell you and second rate hacks like me is that you should use setter getter functions to set your member values

8351285
getter	setter
instead of setting the hash reference directly in this program good design said i should have used getter setter functions like this

8351285
getter	setter
the only place that knows how they re stored is the getter setter function itself

8351285

i can t get the extras that i put into an intent that i put in a addproximityalert

8360375
width	height
both height and width of the red box is dynamic and different from box to box

8360394
vbscript	jscript
it only has an implicit dependency on the installed jscript or vbscript engine dll

8360401
width	margin
to account for variable width in the red box add another wrapper div around the the red box width position absolute and bottom 0 and width 100 - then remove the position absolute from the red box letting it center itself with the margin 0 auto

8360501
implements	extends
your object is a you car which extends bmwcars implements lexus interface

8360506
put	get
when i put the user input part above the create a new movie part like it is right now i get this

8360537
maven	m2e
the maven eclipse plugin is not the same thing as the m2e plugin for eclipse which i m assuming you are trying to use

8360537
maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml
m2e works very differently and instead uses the pom.xml files when you import projects as maven plugins

8360592
cvs	svn
i want to migrate from cvs to svn by using cvs2svn tool

8360592
cvs	svn

try using an nsmutablearray and - void replaceobjectatindex nsuinteger index withobject id anobject

8360640
post	get
most of the communication between the two can be accomplished with http requests using the standard get and post methods

8360645
post	get
if you are passing back json or xml then the client just needs to make the appropriate http call most likely get perhaps post to actually retrieve the information

8360654
dbcontext	objectcontext
create a new class that inherits from objectcontext - instanciate it along side the dbcontext using the same entityconnection

8360667

min and max work fine with dates

8360697
min	max
of course the min and max works

8360704
mouseover	mouseout
i am adding classes and manipulating the css with mouseover and mouseout

8360704
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in firefox google-chrome and safari everything works fine but in ie8 it seems to flicker between the classes

8360709
screens	tablet
keep in mind that a lot of modern desktop pcs these days have touch screens so even detecting touch support does not guarantee that it is a mobile device or tablet

8360769
children	parent
you were close with your first example you need to specify that you are hiding all of the children of the parent div except for the .donthide one like this

8360777
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
however the text placement is different between firefox and safari google-chrome

8360790
dependencyobject	uielement
so you should have the above accept a dependencyobject or uielement instead of a dataclass

8360808
children	parent	mouseover	mouseout
when the mouse goes over an element nested within the top level li it s not actually over the parent element anymore its over the children so it sends the mouseout but the mouse over bubbles up from the child element to the parent li which makes it flicker back into it s mouseover state

8360808
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
try looking into mouseenter and mouseleave as opposed to mouseover and mouseout

8360812
post	get
the blog gets a decent amount of traffic and most post get 10-30 likes 5-10 shares and any number of comments on facebook

8360830
fseek	ftell
it is tantamount to determining the size of a file by reading the whole thing in and counting the bytes one by one one should use stat fstat or fseek and ftell instead

8360830
disk	ram
one more thing on systems with virtual memory the free store that you are trying to measure may be closer to the size of the system swap file on disk than the amount of physical ram installed and the state of other processes on the system will also affect the value measured by successive allocations

8360853
range	min	range	max	min	max
now it s a simple select with min and max to turn it back into range

8360910
button	checkbox
the view displays a home button for going back to the main menu a checkbox for marking a problem for later a math problem in a uilabel and a get answer button

8360910
button	checkbox
the marked button with not text that sits on top of two .pngs that i switch between via .hidden depending on the state of the checkbox i hide one then display the other and vice versa

8360956
google-chrome	safari
this issue is not specific to google-chrome as i could reproduce it in google-chrome 15.0.874.121 for macintosh as well as safari 5.1.2

8360972
fast-forward	merge
results in a merge commit with its first parent set to the commit referenced by master and the second parent set to the commit referenced by some-branch i don t take into account fast-forward and conflicted merge here

8360995
jboss	weblogic
i haven t dealt with weblogic much or jboss at all so i don t know how it deals with unzipped war stuff

8361027
client-side	server-side
php is server-side and javascript is client-side

8361076
width	height
as you can see pixels are drawn with different width and height

8361087
stdout	stderr
now both will work normally but if you try to redirect only one of the stderr or stdout ansiterm will output ansi codes to screen and redirected output

8361130
post	get
post the results of free -m and ulimit -a on the remote machine to get more data

8361130
free	malloc
if you distrust yout your provider to be using some troyanized htop free and ulimit you can test the real available memory with a simple c progran where you allocate with malloc 70 80 of your available ram and assigning random bytes on it in no more than 10 lines of ansi c code

8361139
google-chrome	firefox
i have been able to code a css sprite menu that renders well in firefox and google-chrome but does not even display in ie

8361158
sqoop	hadoop
you can use sqoop to import data from rdbms to hadoop

8361168
pbkdf2	hash
then use bcrypt with a cost factor of 16 or more or pbkdf2 with 64k iterations or more to hash the password at the server

8361189
domxpath	domdocument
you can use domdocument with domxpath

8361191
screens	tablet
it is optimized for mobile 300 tablet 748 web 978 and 1218 and big screens 1378

8361262
plot	heatmap
i made a plot using matplotlib similar to a heatmap

8361278
google-chrome	firefox
i assume firefox google-chrome would have better performance than other browsers for innerhtml tag

8361285
for-loop	arrays
that means you have an arrays with ten spaces and for the last part of your for-loop you were trying to access which doesn t exist

8361288
children	parent
if i want a webgrid to somehow show all my parent and all their children will the new parentandchild class work

8361288
children	parent
i think that will only show the details for one parent and its children

8361302
google-chrome	safari
also set translatez 0px for all elements you want to move as translate3d is only used for safari and google-chrome enables hardware acceleration

8361303
png	ico
-- disclaimer ico to png not working right now --

8361326
hash	salt
the additional security to prevent this would require that you first hash the password to match how the server has it hash so including the salt and then hash that with a server provided randomly generated token that the server also remembers in the session

8361326
hash	salt
regardless of how the password is transmitted you should only store a salt hash version of the password in your database

8361326
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
ideally using a per user salt that you store as well and a secure hash function sha-2 for instance instead of sha-1 or md5

8361349
initializer	class-method
services and daos which have dependency requirements can now be initializer with no parameters which would break the initializer class-method but i had to do it to be able to use it as a type parameter

8361420
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
one of the more common reasons for works on simulator but not device is that you are reading from a file and use the wrong case -- device has case-sensitive file systems but macs have case-insensitive typically

8361541
stdout	fflush
so you need to either fflush theÃ¢ output stream using hflush after executing putstr or you need to change stdout s buffering mode using hsetbuffering to not use line buffering

8361555
width	height
i want to measure the height of the text given a certain width of available canvas

8361640
folder	directory

8361716
children	parent
the says to select only the children of parent

8361769
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome and firefox have their own implementations of the css flexible box module which allows this sort of layout

8361817
int	chars
the expression z + 100 is an addition with arithmetic operands of type chars and int the numeric literal 100 is considered an int in c

8361826
put	get
get the arraylist based on the string key do add to the arraylist and then put it back into the hashmap optional since the map already holds the reference to it

8361854
awt	swing	swt	swing
is it possible to do it in swt only or should i mix need to figure out how swt with swing or awt

8361871
mouse	keyboard
an element can gain focus via keyboard commands such as the tab key or by mouse clicks on the element

8361882
sorting	filtering
glazedlists sorting and filtering features are much more flexible than the one on jxtable

8361895
int	chars
since you have an expression with chars and int compiler converts chars into int by integral promotion thus sizeof operator will give you size of type int which in your case is 4 bytes

8361916
width	height
there are issues with missing browser support but you could perhaps use svgroot.checkintersection to hit test a small perhaps even 0 width height would work

8361928
profiling	debugging
however you should probably use aop-style profiling code instead of baking debugging code into your source

8361929
rss	feed
i have an app that reads about 3-5 rss feed and present the headlines on the ui

8361929
rss	feed
but my code reads the feed one at a time and i would like to read the 3 rss feed at the same to see if i can speed up the parsing process and present the headlines faster on the ui

8361929
rss	feed
and then i repeat this process for the other rss feed

8361964
mapply	grepl
in this case you could use mapply and grepl like this provided you re matching single characters

swing awt have standardized look and feels but also some that are heavily platform-dependent

8362043
folder	directory
so i know how to work around it by naming my directory different between the model and view folder but why is this happening and what can i do to get to resolve same named directory across the model view

8362070
g++	gcc
variable-length arrays are an extension in gcc and g++ .

8362136
fadein	fadeout
instead you should fadeout after the fadein is finished

8362149
post	get
post redirect get prg is a common design pattern for web developers

8362187
post	get
using scipy.signal will get the same result as using the method in the original post

8362194
post	get
the activities get handled by the usual multiplechoicefield i used i customized widget to get the checkboxes to display on a table pretty simple but can post it if somebody needs that

8362215
folder	directory
the problem is every time i run tomcat it first unpacks all the wars in its webapps directory into folder thus mywebapp.war gets unpacked to a directory called mywebapp before tomcat finishes starting up

8362242
stdout	stderr
your syntax for directing stdout to one file and stderr to another is correct

8362247
sorting	filtering
the easiest way is adding paging sorting filtering parameters to the method arguments list and adding corresponding linq query operators to your data context query in the service method

8362254
client-side	server-side
however nicolas s answer shows how you can add client-side validation to block typical users from submitting the form and server-side validation to block everything else

8362260
portrait	landscape
i have one table view that is filled from rss i am trying to scroll it to position 9 when the device is in portrait and position 1 when the device is in landscape but i get this error

i have a programming project that needs to read each line of a tab delimited text file and extract a string double values and int values

8362292
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
is this behavior documented for the major browsers like ie firefox google-chrome and safari

8362301
children	parent
typically there is one applicationcontext parent and 0..n dispatcherservlets children

8362317
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
ie opera google-chrome runs animations well but in firefox animation is too slow i tried with different computers and still same

8362317
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i might have had some errors about positioning divs with jquery codes or changing a lot of margins at the same may be reason for some lag but as i said it was happening only in firefox not ie opera or google-chrome

8362324
min	max
that gives you o log n operations for both delete min and delete max which should help you achieve your goal

8362333
rss	feed
i m trying to pull user answers from quora s rss feed using the google feed api

8362412
put	get
to put text on a specific row you can use getlinestartoffset to get the position of the beginning of the desired row and then pass that value into insert string int

8362430
factors	matrix
a common factors of 10 9 was factored out of every entry in your matrix

8362470
opencv	libdc1394
javacv first provides wrappers to commonly used libraries by researchers in the field of computer vision opencv ffmpeg libdc1394 pgr flycapture openkinect videoinput and artoolkitplus

8362549
children	parent
a component is valid when it is correctly sized and positioned within its parent container and all its children are also valid

8362551
children	parent
a component is valid when it is correctly sized and positioned within its parent container and all its children are also valid

8362570

have a jframe that would display multiple mypanel in a vertical stack and have its height change accordingly depending on the number of mypanel s added to it width of the jframe width of mypanel

8362571
ienumerable	icollection
how can i get v2 of protobuf-net to ignore the fact that my class implements icollection ienumerable etc

8362637
client-side	server-side
our solution was to serialize everything into json client-side then send just a single json object back up and handle the heavy lifting server-side

8362652
tpagecontrol	ttabsheet
using the example provided here how to implement a close button for a ttabsheet of a tpagecontrol combined with setting a forms parent to a tab sheet with matching caption i was able to take my pagecontrol with forms attached as ttabsheet and add a close button and image from an image list much like you see on today s web browsers

8362686
opera	google-chrome
the client output is identical on opera and google-chrome and is

8362705
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
select your groupcontroller from the dropdownlistfor and check the checkbox to bind personscontroller to groupcontroller

8362705
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
i think you can replace the groupcontroller - which is a plain nsarraycontroller - with an nstreecontroller

8362708
width	height
the body should also be width 100 and height 100

8362733
onresize	onload
when i call the function using onload it works fine it just doesn t fire when using the onresize event

8362765
http	spdy
amazon kindle fire may be using spdy for http traffic through their silk proxy

8362798
crypt	salt
you could just as easily use php s crypt function and pass the appropriate salt to force the function to use blowfish

8362798
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
as you can see the salt is included in the output from the call to crypt so when you need to check something against the hash you need to retrieve the hash first from the file or database where it s stored to pull out the salt

8362882
int	boolean
the + 0 will just convert from boolean back to int

8362896
post	get
2 post the list of invitees over to my server which would make the call to fb to get the friends and construct and return the list of user names

8362918
vcard	vcalendar
my app generates the codes that contain a link to a well known type file either vcard or vcalendar that are at variable directories on the server for example

8362918
vcard	vcalendar
most qr readers android i-nigma qrreader etc will correctly deal with a vcard or vcalendar download

8362918
vcard	vcalendar
while i can embed the data of the vcard or vcalendar into the qr code directly it would be better to have the file on a web server with a url to that file in the qr code

8362936
post	get
check out this post for an example of how to get the invoice ids

8362939
post	put	post	get	put	get
unfortunately you can t send put request with xhr from browser environment only get and post methods are valid across browsers

8362939
post	put
key here is _method put in data object this way you can override actual http method in this case post

8362941
post	get
my problem is how could i get this impression votes related to the diary post

8362941
post	get
i would like this var impressions get all impressions related to these 6 last post i show in my page

8362955
nsexpression	nspredicate
cocoa defines predicate classes nspredicate nsexpression etc. which provide a general means of specifying queries in cocoa predicate programming

8362996
crash	exc-bad-access
while for the most part everything still runs perfectly well all web pages load correctly and when i purposefully turn-off my airport to test things reachability catches it gracefully - i do now get inexplicable crash at odd times with the dreaded exc-bad-access error..

8363078
firefox	safari
there was absolutely no perceptual difference in the rendering in either safari 5 for mac or firefox 8 for mac

8363090
rss	feed
come back to your topic you can always pre-analyse your problem set and split scale them into sub-set for example total 100 rss feed can be split into 5 chunks with each perform 20 rss feed in sequence then feed these pre-processed sub-sets into 5 asynctask

8363090
rss	feed
this will gives you 5 asynctask running asynchronously and probably get 5 times faster than using 1 aysnctask download 100 rss feed

8363090
rss	feed
note that it is also possible create asynctask per each rss feed which imo is a very bad practice as if your problem set is big it will eat up you memory and kill system quickly

8363120
mouseout	mouseleave
why not just use mouseout to tell when the mouseleave an element

8363126
jtextfield	jlabel
2nd frame contains two jtextfield for input two values and one jbutton will sum the given values and return it to first frame or print it to jlabel of 1st frame

8363133
getter	setter
item should just be a domain type object with a few auto getter and setter properties

8363176
freemarker	velocity
it appears the developer designed it to address the shortcomings of velocity and freemarker

8363185
children	parent
i have 2 parent classes a c and 2 children b d

8363210
gdk	cairo
you have gtkmm-2.4 friends for windows but you lack gtk+-2.0 no gtk+-2.0.pc file and all its dependencies pango cairo gdk atk glib...

8363246
joptionpane	jdialog
instead that second frame should be a modal dialog such as a jdialog or a joptionpane

8363315
hash	hmac
we would like to use an hmac authentication scheme as described here and here but both examples seem to fall apart when describing how to validate the hash

8363327
folder	directory
when you attempt to do cross-repository movement of files moving a directory from the old working copy into the new working copy will place .svn folder of one working copy into the other working copy

8363327
folder	directory
since these folder contain bits of the subversion working copy configuration for the directory you effectively mix up configurations in one working copy

8363352
cpu	processors
however when you write a mex-file you compile it directly in the cpu language such that it can be run directly by the processors

8363398
width	height
no or - just pure tag with given width and height attributes

8363447
button	checkbox
first of all you should better use radio button instead of checkbox

8363461
single-quotes	double-quotes
and use single-quotes for string literals not double-quotes

8363464
width	height
however i would like to know how to increase the height width on the file input field tried basic css on the file but it only increases the browse button size and not the actual field where you can drop the file into

8363468
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and newer versions of ie have inspectors that could help you without the need to write any code of your own

8363471
gif	png
image_type type of image png jpg gif .....

8363505
boost	allocator
boost format uses allocator as far as i know so it could suffer from this

8363509
prepare	execute
you can do what you want in a stored procedure if you concatenate the parts of the sql query together as a string and then prepare and execute that string as an sql statement

8363515
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome or firefox press f12 this will bring up the inspector

8363532
bash	zsh
that s a normal standard shell zsh bash younameit prompt one that tramp will understand

8363606
lwjgl	slick2d
i ve been delving into game programming with slick2d and i ve began to wonder if in the long run knowing lwjgl would be more helpful

8363606
lwjgl	slick2d
on one hand slick2d is fast and simple but it seems lwjgl is more adaptable in the sense that it has both 2d and 3d capabilities

8363630
strsplit	substr
you ll want to parse the file path that file.choose spits back using string manipulation functions like substr or strsplit

8363686
salt	md5
and unless your required to use unsalted md5 it may be wise to add a salt

8363691
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it ignores the file path and works correctly on ie and google-chrome but i get an incorrect file alert regardless when using this in firefox or safari

8363692
loops	while-loop
another and better in this case is the while-loop that works the same but checks the while-part before the first loops

8363804
post	get
the method attribute specifies the submission type get or post but you ve used the type attribute...and this is incorrect

8363918
setinterval	settimeout
i m not sure whether to use setinterval or settimeout

8363959
org.json	jackson
and surprise surprise if you go with some more modern classes like jackson or just the latest sources from org.json you will be able to get around both these constraints without a problem a later android runtime also seems to have some utility classes for json pull-parsing

8363972
chunked	transfer-encoding
it seems i can click on the request on the left panel then choose on fiddler right bottom panel click on transformer tab uncheck chunked transfer-encoding and click no compression

8363974
free	strdup
note that you must free all the pointers you get back from strdup

8364024
xslt	xquery
is there any good reason why you can t do it in xslt or xquery

8364038
subtract	add
the reason why i add or subtract the width rather than setting the x coordinate directly to 0 or width is that the character may be moving faster than 1 pixel per frame

8364043
maven	cargo
rest api that tools like maven s cargo plug-in can leverage to

8364076
glut	glfw
i m switching from glut to glfw to find that when i re-size my glfw window the rendering region does not change

8364104
post	get
reading through several post i understand that gallery does not recycle but i don t think that it should be creating every single item from the get go

8364130
google-chrome	firefox
it does the same thing in both firefox and google-chrome

8364212
post	get
from the research that i ve done i think this would be possible using alarmmanager but i ve read in another post android alarmmanager not being very reliable that it s not very reliable and the events could potentially get cancelled

8364225
versioning	upgrade
there is a versioning available in later versioning and online with minimal compatibility upgrade

8364227
addclass	removeclass
instead of setting the class directly to those strings it s better to construct your own addclass and removeclass functions

8364245
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i m somewhat surprised that works in safari firefox and google-chrome

8364247
min	max
the sequence will begin and end at an arbitrary point each day so min and max would differ upon each run

8364313
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i made it work successfully on firefox and safari but on google-chrome buffered event behaves strange.

8364332
int	chars
you want to call string#indexof int which will give you the index of the chars

8364332
int	chars
string#charat int returns the chars at the given index

8364372
folder	directory
i have a folder called importfiles in my test project with a file called contacts.xlsx which has the property copy to output directory set to copy always but the file is not getting copied when i run the test

8364374
inherited	properties
there are two problems with using bare javascript objects to emulate sets first an object can have an inherited properties which would screw the in operator and second you can only store scalar values in this way making a set of objects is not possible

8364402
public	protected
i don t see why this shouldn t be supported except for conflicts with access restriction public protected private etc. and encapsulation but perhaps only structs could have this feature

8369328
free	malloc
the only features of c++ i m using is classes to encapsulate data and methods but that can be done as well with structs and functions i m using new and delete but could as well use malloc and free and i m using inheritance just for callbacks which could be achieved with pointers to functions

8369362
inherited	properties
since all default inherited properties are not plain arrays mostly host objects or functions the array.isarray check is sufficient

if you want your int and double to have a certain length then i suggest you use numberformat to format your numbers instead of cutting off their string representation

8369747
ubuntu	debian
the profile module is part of standard python and is different from cprofile as it is implemented purely in python but ubuntu doesn t install it by default likely because of its debian lineage

8370229
i2c	spi
if it is just an inductor then you have to add more circuitry if it is a full sensor package with a serial or parallel interface spi i2c rs323 then that is a programming question but you still have to then decide on what microcontroller you want and ask how do i do i2c in an arduino for example of which there are many web pages

8370255
post	get
a controller will be responsible for preparing data to display for rendering and sometimes handle get and post requests that originating from your client

firefox tries to honor the width of this whilst maintaining the float but it seems google-chrome wants to move the fieldset onto a new line due to being block and 95 width

8370372
onfocus	onblur
i m not sure if this is because the code as i have written is not calling the form correctly or if using onblur onfocus values in the form changes the way the jquery should be written

8370387
gif	png
i have had this problem myself here is what i did i hope it will help you as well first determine the biggest image size you would use for example 200x200 then use png or gif images all 200x200 with transparent backgrounds

8370400
width	height
given the code below how is it possible to use a percentage to get width and height

8370424

8370932
post	put
can you try to put your input into and post the results in your question

8370936
for-loop	arrays
i have done most of it and am confused as to how to make the arrays and if any one could take a look at my code to let me know if i have my for-loop set up correctly

8371066
udp	tcp
for reliability you would typically build on top of tcp but depending on what you need to do you could design a protocol on udp which will run faster

8371102
post	get
i think the ajax set of methods can speak http get and post so you need to tell it to get the file from a server giving it the url for the server the path part in the error message

8371177
post	put
i ve put 20 because is url is encoded and when i try to perform the post operation with firebug these are the variables sent

8371201
int	double
this is similar logic to the parse vs tryparse methods on int double etc

8371209

8371210
hash	md5
as key you can use a md5 hash of the image file plus the users ip

8371241
actionlink	redirecttoaction
it only works on standard methods like redirecttoaction or actionlink though

8371313

8371382
minimum	max
2 determine the max personal amount separately then take the minimum of the max personal amount and the max property amount

that ejb-jar war or application jar file unless the persistence unit

8371469
ubuntu	linux
i am using the gcc compiler on ubuntu linux

8371492
nhibernate	automapper
the problem is that even though the destination objects called projectcontract does not contain a list of branches automapper still invokes this collection and a lot of queries are made to the database because nhibernate fires the lazy - loading and loads the branches collection for each project

8371503
hide	show
for my profile type i use a show hide piece of coding to display another div if value 2 is selected in profile type

8371510

i ve read previous questions asked about using jquery to show hide multiple elements individually but i haven t been able to modify the code that worked for those users so that it works for my case

8371522
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if you want to read object into your program then you have to use objectinputstream not objectoutputstream

8371587
antialiasing	transparent
this is where it got tough i can t get the directwrite text to render on an alpha-including background without the antialiasing going wrong as foreground text pixels should fade to transparent they instead fade to black

8371587
antialiasing	transparent
explain what grayscale antialiasing is supposed to do and whether it works with transparent bitmap render targets

8371623
google-chrome	firefox
this should show you the error in the console window of firefox or google-chrome console.log will not work in ie and break the script

8371623
google-chrome	firefox
to bring up the console window in firefox or google-chrome press f12

8371668
fts4	fts3
i have noticed that the .jar driver doesn t seem to support fts4 but it does support fts3 and doesn t show indexes in the data structure

8371670
printf	strtok
most likely problem is that your first input line doesn t begin with a lower case letter so you never call strtok in the first place and never assign to either svar or fvar but you still pass those uninitialized values to printf which then gives a segfault.

8371706
post	get
since you android client appears to be getting an article you might consider using a get request as opposed to a post request however the differences are trivial

8371711
pop-up	dialog
then hover over the semi-transparent manage button which you can barely see hidden behind the word extensions perhaps and wait for the pop-up dialog and then click create new module

8371735
inherited	subclassing
unless a subclassing b and i wouldn t do that just for the sake of inherited there s basically no special relationship between a and b so there s no way of doing this i m afraid

8371759
rvm	bundler
it would be even better if you could migrate this application to run with bundler then you don t need to uninstall rails 3.x gem but if it s not possible you can take a look at rvm s gemsets

8371773
width	height
you can add width and height to the drawimage call if you want the user to be able to resize the image just provide some kind of control the change them

8371774
google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine in google-chrome firefox and shows the selected value correctly

8371798
uiview	subviews
in my app i have added a uiview as a new subviews however it covers up a uisegmentedcontrol

8371828

8371832
post	put
there was a bug in prestashop version to whose web service i was trying to put post

8371854
post	get
i just found this works for me now but only after changing my requests to get requests instead of post

8371854
post	get
for reasons unknown google returns request_denied for post requests but allows the same request via get

8371854
post	get
if that works then just rewrite your android code to use get instead of post and you should be all set

8371863
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i guess you are talking about serialization using the classes objectoutputstream and objectinputstream

8371867
width	height
but raphael js manually set a width and height directly on your svg elements which kills this technique

8371875
rspec	capybara

therefore mathematica s export in the csv tsv and xls formats should work as well

8371956
antlr	parser-generator
i m working on a fairly standard compiler project for which i picked antlr as the parser-generator

8371964

code not working in firefox google-chrome safari

8371993
range	min	range	max	min	max

8372025
indexof	replaceall
if you want to parse their textual bodies which are essentially string s then you d need to grab string based methods instead such as substring indexof replaceall etc

8372040
int	chars
the former is an array of chars but the latter is just an int

8372045
width	height
the createimage function creates a qgraphicsscene of a given width and height draws at coordinates 0 0 a solid red rectangle of the same width and height as the scene renders this scene to an image and writes the image out to a file

8372045
width	height
i believe that this function should always write out an image that is solid red regardless of the width and height it is given

8372058
put	get
you get the idea you can put them in weatherworker

8372103
ati	nvidia
i have heard of a few solutions such as programing directly on the hardware but while from what i understand ati has released the specifications of there low level api nvidia keeps theirs secret so that wouldn t work too well not to mention the added development time of making different profiles

8372111
tablet	galaxy	tablet	hdpi
my situation is that i have put an image in res drawable hdpi which will be picked up when running on my samsung infuse 4g as well as on my galaxy 10.1 tablet

to centre a div which is display block by default you need to give it a width then margin 0 auto

8372205
try-catch	exception-handling
try-catch supports inheritance with exception-handling classes

8372216
client-side	server-side
if you already have a non-js version you can think about if you still need the enhanced version and if you do if you want to re-use the server-side templating you already have coded and tested and need to maintain anyway or duplicate the effort client-side which adds development cost but as you say may provide a superior experience and lower the load on the server although i cannot imagine that fetching rendered data versus fetching xml data makes that much of a difference

8372246
put	get
if you design for the client-side approach it s easy to get carried away and put the processing in the wrong place

8372253
tablet	hdpi
tablet are usually xhdpi not hdpi

8372260
mdpi	hdpi
the samsung infuse is hdpi the galaxy tab 10.1 is mdpi

8372260
screens	tablet
generally games will have resources that are independent of density and just have their game playfield fill the screens and are happy with the result being something larger on a tablet

8372264
min	max
the possible args for min and max are either one iterable or 2 or more scalars

8372276
int	chars
the chars has been explained but i think the most important thing to remember in the int example is that

8372305
int	chars
that is float all flavours of chars and of short int and also .

8372327
calloc	malloc
not using calloc malloc or

8372388
getter	setter
skipping many getter and setter they may not be needed anyway use package access

8372484
stdout	stderr
edit fprintf stdout fmt... and fprintf stderr fmt... don t work either

8372518
concave	convex
box2d does not support concave polygons so in order to create any concave polygons you will have to split it up into a series of convex polygons

8372541
carrierwave	fog
i am using carrierwave with fog to store images on amazon s s3

8372547
int	chars
but get ordered comparison between pointer and int chars and int

8372548
hash	md5
a javascript will get the sha256 hash from the file it s more accurate then the md5 hash before it get s uploaded

8372560
width	height
the center cell should have a fixed width and height and centered horizontally and vertically

8372575
sequence	permutation
the cycle-type of a permutation of n is a partition of n that is a weakly decreasing sequence of positive integers that sums to n

8372578
serializable	deserialization
i m not familiar with python libraries for doing this with json so i can t recommend endorse any but a search using terms like python deserialization json object and graph seems to reveal some django documentation for serializable and the library jsonpickle on github

8372582
strncmp	strcmp
use strcmp 3 or strncmp 3 or strcasecmp 3 or strncasecmp 3 to compare your strings

8372613
strcpy	strncpy
if not please replace strcpy with strncpy

8372615
post	get
i apologize for posting so much code i couldn t get the behavior to repeat on an abstracted simplified program so i had to post the actual code

8372621
uilabel	uitextview
for anyone else having this same issue i ended-up solving it by using a uitextview instead of a uilabel

8372637
rvm	bundler
i have rvm and bundler on my server

8372646
octal	binary
since there are format specifiers for octal o and x for hexadecimal is it that octal and hexadecimal are somewhat more important than the binary representation

8372693
width	height
stackpanel gives its children whatever height width they ask for and that makes the inner listbox miscalculates its actual height and then its scrollviewer won t work properly

8372696
octal	binary	octal	decimal
the original implementers of printf et al at at t did not have a need for binary but did need octal and hexadecimal as well as decimal so that is what was implemented

8372744
jlist	jfilechooser
every time i open some txt file via jfilechooser i would like to add this file to the jlist

8372745
xdebug	xhprof
if you actually want to benchmark real world code use tools like xdebug and xhprof

8372745
xdebug	xhprof
xdebug is great for when you re working in dev staging and xhprof is a great tool for production and it s safe to run it there as long as you read the instructions

8372745
apache	nginx
as an example i can make nginx + php-fpm seriously out perform mod_php + apache which in turn gets trounced for serving static content by using a good cdn

8372762
punctuation	words
basically the b means a words delimiter matched the beginning and end of a words excluding punctuation

8372766
width	height
rectangles or squares it sounds like you are asking how to represent jagged arrays arrays that are not rectangular but have a fixed height with a variable width per-row

8372773
queue	fifo
note that here it is a lifo queue instead of the expected fifo queue so allocate enough workers

8372791
width	height
getsize defined as void _stdcall getsize int width int height and makecurrent defined as void _stdcall makecurrent void are callback functions for the buffer

8372817
xdebug	xhprof
xdebug has an impact on performance and xhprof i wouldn t say there is none manages a lot better

8372826
octal	decimal
it doesn t make any difference whether you express the number literal in your source code as 0 decimal or 00 octal or 0x0

8372835
ubuntu	debian
this sounds a bit like ubuntu or debian on the server

8372835
ubuntu	debian
assuming you are on ubuntu or debian this should show you the location of all installed files

8372841
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
as a test i open the uiviewcontroller within a uinavigationcontroller do some things which trigger the notifications and then pop it off the stack by tapping the back button

8372910
width	height
setpreviewsize width height but you want to do it before camera preview starts

8372941
folder	directory
when i browse the created folder using oi file manager or file expert i can enter the first level directory and see the names of second-level directory but they are indicated as 0 byte files

8372941
folder	directory
the second level directory mnt storage flac artist_1 etc have the same permissions on the album folder

8372985
implements	extends
have your tab activities extends that baseactivity and the activity with your imageview implements it

8372998
firefox	safari
but firefox and safari give me the same error above

8372998
firefox	safari
update #3 i was able to get the video to autoplay when the shadowbox opens but now you can t pause or go fullscreen in firefox or safari on mac

8372999
awt	swing	swt	swing
for that you need to resort of the usual awt swt swing etc routines

8373039
nsstring	nsdata
if you don t want to do that for some reason and if it s all valid property list objects nsarray nsdictionary nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsdata the simplest approach is to use property list serialization

8373062
hash	md5
ideally the compilation must happen via the asset pipeline so that content-based asset names ones that include an md5 hash of the content are generated

8373087
postgresql	mysql
i totally understand the error and assume that the mysql implementation is less sql conform than the postgresql implementation

8373108
profiling	debugging
as well flash builder includes extensive debugging and profiling functionality far beyond flash professional

8373131
implements	extends
i have a couple of checkboxpreferences set up my preference class extends preferenceactivity and implements onsharedpreferencechangelistener

8373133
post	get
the type of request to make post or get default is get

8373142
post	get
also for a more generic answer that can be used on other themes you can search your theme files for references to get_the_time or the_time which are the built in functions in wp to get the post time for a post

8373146
filtering	grouping
instead of special-casing values with the if else equivalent of a switch statement it is more linq-friendly to grouping and filtering your values

8373152
post	get
now i want to get a second custom post type and nest its menu items with the existing events items

8373177
flask	cheetah
i am no cheetah or flask expert but i don t think you need any special support to make it work

8373239
implements	extends
then after i started working on another activity implements listactivity and providing a custom view per row by extends an arrayadapter i start getting the runtimeexception

8373251
bmp	png
i am using assetmanager to load images form assets image and the loading process went well as i can see all images have been loaded in the gallery but the gallery only shows the frame but not the pictures i tried different mime types png jpg and bmp and didn t work out

8373281
rtsp	rtmp
rtsp for 2.1 and embedded flash player playing video from rtmp stream you can also play local file from the server

8373281
rtsp	rtmp
edit i used h.264 on rtsp streams and vp6 on rtmp

8373327
int	chars
the case statements for a switch must be compile-time constants of type sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong chars string or an enum-type including implicit conversions and that s not what you have with the type objects

8373331
int	chars
according to the specification only sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong chars string or enum-types can be used in a switch statement so basically you can not switch on a type object

8373334
atexit	main
also glibc can register some functions to be run after main via atexit

8373355
disk	ram
similarly you need to pay close attention to your disk subsystem have as much ram as possible etc

8373382
width	height
the reason why the star images are referenced as a bitmap is to prevent android from scaling them to the container s full width and height

8373384
min	max
it s also been noted that using an aggregate like min or max would work

8373384
sorting	grouping
while this is true - and will lead to reliable and predictable results unlike using distinct on or an ambigious grouping by - it has a performance cost due to the need for extra sorting or aggregation and it only works for ordinal data types

8373454
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i want to display this entry on the original view after this but i m not sure how to update the previous view since the method viewwillappear and viewdidappear are not called

8373469
free	realloc
ensures that result is initialized so that the realloc call won t do something strange like try to extend or free random memory

8373485
hex	binary
while there is only one meaningful hex representation --- the abstract one the number -0x79 can be represented in binary as

8373485
hex	binary
the concepts of endianness and binary representation don t apply to hex numbers as there is no way they could be considered the actual bits-in-memory representation

8373485
hex	binary
if you are trying to use this to debug bitwise operations which i see as the only compelling reason to use binary over hex you want to use something close what the hardware uses which makes it impossible to standardise so you want implementation defined

8373521
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works in firefox and ie but it wont work with safari and google-chrome so i assume it s a webkit problem

8373521
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works fine in firefox and ie but as i said google-chrome and safari wont echo into the iframe

8373556
quicksort	insertion-sort
you re saying that class c just implements insertion-sort with no quicksort at all right

8373572
implements	extends
in the text.java comparator subclass extends writablecomparator and implements compare method which does compare in lexicographic order dictionary or alphabetical order

8373696
implements	extends
instead of having class 3 extends mapactivity why not try implements it

8373705
implements	extends
for example jtable uses the tablemodel interface which can be implements from scratch or by extends abstracttablemodel or defaulttablemodel

8373715
width	height
i am building a website in which the main content frame should span the entire width of the page and as much height as necessary with a minimum height in order to contain a floating sidebar of sorts

8373735
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works perfectly fine in firefox and google-chrome but it doesn t work in ie and safari

8373760
width	margin
the width of an element does not include border margin and padding

8373779
cassini	iis
so the result is common regardless of whether i use iis 7 or cassini

8373813
put	get
i thought that to get this to work i have to put all myclass.myclass but that didn t work

8373823
post	get
you have to contact the admin if your trying to do basic things you could try to use javascript to get the data you need then thru a post url send it to the php script but your probably better off contacting the admin

8373852
onresume	onpause
put a log statement in your onpause and onresume methods and check the sequence of execution

8373882
128bit	64bit
it s at least theoretically possible that int64_t might not exist say if the compiler has a 128bit type but no 64bit type or if signed integers aren t represented using 2 s-complement

8373885
post	get
there are no get or post parameters

8373912
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i ve got easy access to firefox google-chrome konqueror opera full-blown and mini surf emacs w3m links links2 lynx elinks epiphany and writing http traffic by hand

8373940
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
i have subclassed the uiimageview with a new class and added the touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended

8373948
accessor	properties
in the former case simply use the real properties accessor - if you decide to change this the refactoring tools make that trivial

8373997
maven	m2e
if you have m2e installed you should create maven run configurations for it like this

8373997
maven	cargo
you can run the cargo plugin from eclipse by creating a maven build run or debug configuration in eclipse

8374004
post	get
how do you get the post data to remember which option was selected in the select input

8374010
children	parent
for example when setting the children of a parent i say

8374010
children	parent
i want my tree to be doubly linked so i can crawl both ways downwards from the root to his children or upwards from a leaf to his parent

8374024
portrait	landscape
the image dimensions are 768 x 1024 portrait and 1024 x 768 landscape

8374063
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
when i view this page in any browser ie google-chrome opera safari and embed a youtube video link it previews just fine but the preview doesn t show up in firefox

8374078
post	put
it s based on the post by frank flynn on october 6 2006 11 05pm where he said if you wish to use outfile or dumpfile with a variable for the file name you cannot simply put it in place - mysql will not resolve the name.

8374085
put	get
i am working with ruby and i m going to make a pure-rack app to get the headers and put them into a queue for further calculations

8374128
submit	submission
i m not sure if my error comes from submission the form to itself via php but it is just not hitting my function and submit anyway no matter what is returned

8374140
freemarker	velocity
in wicket you can use templating built-in velocity panel or find or build freemarker panel

8374175
factors	mean
for a set of data that looks fairly normal you can use the correction factors method as outlined by dirk-eddelbuettel but with your custom values used to generate a set of data around your mean

8374224
int	boolean
boolean getrow int rownumber int nitems

8374226
portrait	landscape
if you rotate the device portrait and return to landscape it begins to work

8374279
sigkill	multitasking
sigkill is not an error on your part and is not a simulator bug it s what happens when you press the home button and kill the app in the multitasking drawer or press the stop button on xcode

8374283
google-chrome	firefox
basically the css below displays as expected in firefox google-chrome ie8 but not in ie6 and who knows about other ie versions

8374333
ssl	https
i have a java application that i m adding a jax-ws interface to and i ve gotten it to run over https but i want to be able to do two-way ssl authentication

8374343
gesturedetector	motionevent
you should override the ontouchevent motionevent event of the imageview to call the ontouchevent event of the gesturedetector and implement your own onsingletapconfirmed motionevent event in the attached listener to get the coordinates of the tap using event.getx and event.gety methods to determine the coordinates of the click

8374351
codeigniter	cakephp
some examples are ruby on rails codeigniter cakephp expression engine django to name some of the best

8374371
min	max
the php code will also store the max finishing time current time + 15 min or whatever the allotted time is in a session variable

8374405
spaces	delimiter
first of all delimiter must be a spaces instead of usual comma

8374405
post	get
on the server side if we still have # in get post request remove it and proceed to do db select

8374421
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
this is how i would like the ui to behave you click a button and it shows a qgraphicsview with a qgraphicsscene done and then i would like to show all of my qpixmaps in a grid view

8374421
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
spritescene extends qgraphicsscene and is being added to a qgraphicsview like this

8374436
std	ostream
in this particular case since the lhs is std ostream and you cannot modify it you are left with the only option of using a free function

8374440
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have a problem with a form being displayed peculiarly in google-chrome only in google-chrome works in firefox and safari

8374459
codeigniter	cakephp
i m pretty much torn between cakephp zend symfony reccess codeigniter and agile toolkit

8374486
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine on google-chrome but on firefox and ie it shows a save dialog for the pdf file as soon as the page is loaded

8374493
inherited	properties
my question is where i should add this properties in the product entity object itself or it s better to create another class that inherited from product

8374507
jboss	glassfish
i guess ejb works for non-jee6 tomcat or jetty in jee6 cdi jboss or glassfish you need to use inject

8374508
for-loop	loops
then again you could replace the while loops with a fast-enumeration-style for-loop

8374520
ubuntu	linux
linux distro ubuntu

8374521
min	max
can i find the max min value in an unsorted array in sub linear time

8374521
min	max
however if you keep a reference to the min and max value and update the values on every insert append replace operation the amortized cost of min max lookups can be very cheap

8374521
min	max
sorting the array is very expensive compared to a simple linear scan to find the min and max so only sort if there is some other benefit

8374521
min	max
of course insertion sort can provide very similar properties to updating the min and max values on every insert append replace operation so it might be acceptable enough.

8374529
min	max
for unsorted array min max complexity is o n

8374529
min	max
and if you need to search for min max only ones or near it sort is not useful

8374573
getter	setter
because i don t know your classes you maybe need to add some getter or setter or just make the properties public so smarty can access them

8374587
backgroundworker	dispatchertimer
another option is to use dispatchertimer with creating backgroundworker class instance on each timer iteration

8374638
int	double
i would still rather have int since i have already built my other matrixops classes using this type but double shouldn t be an issue i guess

8374665
pull	push
i would use a server and then push pull web service data the location data

8374673
maven	pom.xml
when work in sts springsource tool suite open pom.xml file and check dependencies in dependencies tab add select maven dependency will give 0 result found

8374679
portrait	landscape
i am doing a app for ipad in which we have added two images one for landscape and the other for portrait mode i have written code for

8374689
min	max
when adding a value to an empty list set min and max to that value

8374689
min	max
when adding a value to a non-empty list set min or max to that value if appropriate

8374689
min	max
when deleting a value from the list set min or max to unknown if the value being deleted is equal to the current min or max

8374689
min	max
you can also make this more efficient if you store both the min max and the counts of them

8374689
min	max
by doing it that way probably the vast majority of retrieving min max are constant time

8374689
min	max
it s only when you ve removed a value which was the min or max does the next retrieval require linear time for one retrieval

8374689
min	max
the next retrieval after that will again be constant time since you ve calculated and stored them assuming you don t remove the min max value in the interim again

8374692
firefox	safari
in internet explorer firefox and safari my second drop down menu appears straight away when i click on it after selecting something on the first dropdown menu for the first time

8374692
opera	google-chrome
in google-chrome and opera i have to select options from the first dropdown menu twice to be able to get the second dropdown menu working

8374706
innodb	myisam
i ve ran two separate batch of tests one that used a myisam table and another that used innodb

8374706
innodb	myisam
so basically you replace myisam with innodb in the above snippet.

8374706
innodb	myisam
here is the output of explain for the query above for each indices on a myisam top and an innodb bottom table

8374706
innodb	myisam
based on these i ve decided to use the endtime_only index for my tests because i had to run queries against a myisam and an innodb table too

8374706
innodb	myisam
for testing the efficiency of the query regarding the generated i o activity with a myisam and innodb table i ve written the following simple java program

8374706
innodb	myisam
i ve captured the state of the mysqld process before and after running my tests against the table using myisam and innodb using process explorer

8374706
innodb	myisam
the cpu s maximum load in case of the myisam engine was around 42 percent while using innodb it was around 38

8374707
intersect	contains
your code should print match on the intersect strings between the two vectors it should work fine for the intersection you may need to check the string value itself it may contains spaces or so

8374717
int	chars
please note that java has the chars data type which is a 16bit unsigned int holding a utf-16 code point

8374725
backgroundworker	dispatchertimer
if you use a dispatchertimer to start a backgroundworker you re circumventing its main purpose

8374739
inherited	properties
when i use this bindinglist in bindings only properties from t are visible while properties from inherited a interface are not

8374776
range	infinity
when there are no such keys either side the range lock extends to infinity

8374782
portrait	landscape
as per your question all you need to do is to return yes for supported orientation in shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation and you can call to a function to set the background image two different images for portrait and landscape orientation as follows

8374785
int	chars
the x specifier by itself prints the value as an unsigned int but you pass in a chars promoted to signed int

8374785
int	chars
the hh modifier changes it to unsigned chars instead of unsigned int

8374803
google-chrome	firefox
second of all this jsfiddle example works properly in google-chrome and firefox

8374894
width	margin
when two or more margins collapse the resulting margin width is the maximum of the collapsing margins widths.

8374974
ssl	https
i am still working in sandbox mode and have not yet bought an ssl certificate which is why i am still referring everywhere to http instead of https

8375003
maven	pom.xml
if you re using maven add this dependency to your pom.xml

8375012
python-daemon	daemons
rather than writing your own daemons use python-daemon instead

8375012
python-daemon	daemons
python-daemon implements the well-behaved daemons specification of pep 3143 standard daemons process library

8375019
super	extends
by default all pom.xml will automatically extends the super pom which is located in the maven_installation_folder lib maven-x.x.x-uber.jar package org.apache.maven.project pom-4.0.0.xml

8375019
maven	pom.xml
that means if you specify a in your pom.xml maven will try to download this dependency in the following orders

8375019
maven	pom.xml
maven central repository specifed in the super pom.xml i.e

8375019
maven	pom.xml
maven remote repository defined in the section of your pom.xml

8375019
maven	pom.xml
normally i will use some maven repository search engines such as this to find out the of the libraries frameworks tools that i want to use and then paste them in the pom.xml

8375019
maven	pom.xml
however if some of the eg hibernate cannot be found and downloaded from the maven central repository you can try to visit its official site to find out its repository link and paste them in the section of your pom.xml .for example hibernate require to define the jboss repository in the pom.xml like this

8375025
gnupg	gpgme
installing gnupg or gpgme would probably be far easier than trying to get a php implementation working debugged and keep it secure as problems are found and fixed in the real gnupg implementation

8375032
put	get
what regex i should put to get this

8375046
joptionpane	jcomponent
you can add any jcomponent s to joptionpane including jscrollpane contains jlist

8375069
tcpclient	sslstream	tcpclient	networkstream	networkstream	sslstream
you can wrap the networkstream provided by tcpclient with an sslstream

8375127
concave	convex
i am looking for some algorithms to add a convex mirror effect and concave mirror effect to an image

8375137
tcpclient	sslstream
you have to use the sslstream along with the tcpclient then use the sslstream to read the data rather than the tcpclient

8375155
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome work like a charm.but all ie fail

8375194
width	height
represent each rectangle by x1 x2 h where h is height and x2-x1 is width

8375194
min	max
for i min l 1 .x r 1 .x to max l size of l .x r size of r .x choose max l i .h r i .h

8375233
put	get
when i put the resulting framework in a 5.0 project it works great but when i put it in a 4.3 project arc or non-arc doesnt matter i get the following which i can t really understand .

8375240
xslt	xquery
my usual rule-of-thumb is that xquery is better than xslt for simple tasks whereas xslt is better for complex tasks

8375247
ssl	https
https means that you tunnel the http protocol over tls ssl which encrypts the http payload

8375256
getter	setter
also an new nsmutablearray was declared with setter and getter methods

8375283
post	get
now it uses oauth instead of changing the method from post to get which i never understodd why it had to do anyway

8375320
int	boolean
in terms of size an int is a 32-bit signed int while the boolean data type doesn t really have a defined size

int	boolean
int allow more flexibility while boolean offer limitation and simplicity

8375323
int	chars
i am trying to make a compiler and if the compiler is given the token int real or chars i would like it to generate code to make int float or chars instead

you may also redirect stdout and stderr to a log file

8375425
stdout	stderr
refer for more info viewing stdout and stderr

8375430
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
since the if statement is nested inside the for-loop i wouldn t expect anything less than getting an inaccurate output as the for-loop will continue to loops until all elements in the student arrays have been passed

8375442
post	get
i ve been writing an application which lets you take a photo from the webcam and post it to the user photos in a photo album named like my application which is what fb does when you don t specify an album then the photo is linked in a new feed post and it s uploaded to my client s web server where my client may approve it to get posted also on his company s facebook page

8375446
width	height
3 a view with visibility as invisible is still measured that means both its width height as well as its margins and padding is displayed as empty space in your layout

8375496
postgresql	informix
in oracle postgresql db2 informix

8375501
int	double
the original code was confused between int and double so i ve chosen one

you may think you re passing a pointers but in fact you need a double-pointer since it s the file pointers itself you re trying to change not what it points to

8375589
post	get
its easy do the posting comments with javascript after each javascript request to server do a page refresh request to get the newer comments and post distribute them accordingly in your markup then again you can use setinterval for doing this operation on a second basis

8375637
maven	pom.xml
that means if i remove the ejb project from workspace without deleting contents on disk such that only the hierarchal parent maven project pom.xml packaged is existing in the workspace which contains the ejb project but ejb project is then not known to eclipse then everything works fine

8375641
inherited	properties
thus static members do not follow the same rules of inherited and remain properties of the class that defines them

8375660
hide	show
you get this almost for free with mvc then you would do some client side script to show hide the link

8375678

opera	firefox
finally figured it out guys it was a rogue bracket instead of a curly brace higher up in my css stylesheet which meant everything underneath was not getting seen by firefox or opera

8375803
oncreate	setcontentview
if you are calling setcontentview r.layout.some_custom_layout from the activity s oncreate method you should be good as long as your app compiles and i assume it does

8375843
stdout	stderr
notice that with most shells you can start some program and redirect differently and independently their stdout their stderr

8375868
post	get
and you d get post parameters like

8375870
google-chrome	firefox
your test page isn t live anymore so i can t check this but i found that if looping is enabled for the tag the ended event wasn t firing in google-chrome or ie i didn t test in firefox

8375931
geocoding	geocode
just ask for a location using the locationmanager and then use the received location to send a reverse geocoding request with geocode

8375977
jobs	cron
why don t you just insert the information you need into another driver table and have a cron job or a dbms_job to create your scheduler jobs

8375980
int	boolean
you can even make honorary boolean if you wish like int with 0 and 1 etc

8376029
pull	push
this was fine until we started to use a third bare repository to push pull branches to each other

8376058
inherited	properties
back then i got the issue fixed by adding css that told the child elements to specifically inherited the filter properties of its parent like

8376091
pull	push	repo	egit
after a windows egit push existing repo cannot push or pull from origin

8376091
pull	push
the newly cloned repo can push and pull from the origin everything work smootly

8376091
pull	push
the origin can be cloned again and again can pull commit push as much as they want and everything works smoothly

8376091
pull	push
the older repositories still cannot push pull

8376129
put	get
it is probably easier if you put the suckerfish code on your site get it working then adjust accordingly for your template

8376133
put	get
you can put a limit on the results to get back only 1 row if that s what you need

8376194
httpresponse	request
i am using the low level api to get an httpresponse object as the response to my get request to a url an api function

8376208
rspec	capybara
i am new to ruby rails capybara rspec and that whole stack so this might be obvious but isn t this something that should have been caught earlier

8376227
do-while	break
break ends execution of the current for foreach while do-while or switch structure

8376235
margin	height
instead of animating margin which means the box height needs to be recalculated so rounding errors on partial pixels causes movement use transforms

8376244
opera	firefox
during development you might have had it broken but firefox and opera are clutching their old manifest files to the death

8376244
opera	firefox
i bet you also tried clearing the browser cache in firefox and opera which probably did nothing - you need to change the text content of the file and double-refresh before either firefox and opera will finally give up their broken versions of the manifest file and start using the one which works which you probably uploaded ages ago

8376247
width	height
think about our world for instance it has three readily-apparent dimensions width height depth

8376257

8376479
rss	feed
for example for a web application you can have an rss feed and a html page both using the same controller

8376533
dbcontext	objectcontext
if query performance is your main concern and you need to use compiled queries then don t use dbcontext api and write your whole application with objectcontext api

8376533
dbcontext	objectcontext
using objectcontext for one half of the application and dbcontext for second half of the application must result in code duplication

8376629
division	modulo
so the question is when you set the test_num constant to non-zero say 5 both the conditions modulo and division are perfoming approximately at the same time but when you set test_num to 0 the second condition performs slower up to 3 times

8376629
division	modulo
in case of 0 the test instruction is used instead of cmp x 0 but even if you patch cmp x 5 in case of 5 to cmp x 0 you ll see that it wouldn t affect the modulo but would affect the division operation

8376673
hash	md5
i cannot just trim extra characters of an md5 hash because i think the problem of collisions will come up at some time then

8376704
children	parent
which means i can easily find both parent and children through page.parents and page.children

8376704
children	parent
now here s the question how do i find the orphans or trunks if you want to go tree-style without parent and the dead-ends or leafs without children on a global basis

8376782
hide	show
when you roll over one of the thumbnails it will sometimes hide and show itself in rapid succession

8376791

sqlpackage.exe action publish sourcefile c dbproject bin debugging dbproject.dacpac profiling c dbproject localdb.publish.xml

8376816
hide	show
specify yes to hide the navigation bar or no to show it

8376834
hide	show
so i suppose you could use some javascript to hide all the other divs and only show this one

8376835
mouseover	mouseout
when an element moves over the element you re mousing over it blocks the mouse from the element with the mouseover event triggering a mouseout event

8376835
width	height
if you put your events on .block_thumb and you make block_thumb have absolute positioning and height and width equal to the .thumb height and width you should be fine

8376883
jobs	cron
on my rhel5 box i have so far set up cron jobs by placing entries in the etc crontab file which is for safely reasons only editable by root

8376883
jobs	cron

getter	setter
i m trying to sort out wether i should add more instance methods or doing the calculations in another class using the getter and setter

8376965
.htaccess	httpd.conf
finally the problem is because httpd.conf disable .htaccess on the directory

8376970

but i don t completely understand what ovverridded methods i need another post said i need a hashcode and equals but hashcode is unavailable and automatically adding unimplemented methods just adds compareto

8376983
mouseover	mouseout
i m trying to handle mouseover mouseout animations and a statement i have is not evaluating to true when you mouseover an element that you previously moused over

8376995
width	height
you can set width and height of loader only after swf is completely loaded

8376995
width	height
so you have to wait for swf load complete and then set width and height

8377052
realloc	malloc
with malloc i can use realloc for the same part of memory but what about new operator

8377096
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
however if you start getting involved with nsurlconnection you will notice that putting nsurlconnection inside an nsoperation wrapper and writing completion blocks isn t so hard as it sounds and you will start thinking what keeps you from dumping 3rd party libraries

8377110
longlistselector	silverlight
use the longlistselector from the silverlight toolkit

8377122
sorting	filtering
however there are some minor points - firstly it may be a good idea to perform filtering before sorting because then your sorting function will need to sort fewer elements

8377123
super	self
although you have to remember to call the super class self .get ... function so i guess it s not so different after all

8377125
public	protected
both are protected i don t know guice behaviour in this case but all my working examples work with setter annotated or public fields annotated

8377140

8377187
cpu	processors
i m using windows xp and the cpu is amd athlon tm 64 x2 dual core processors 5600+

8377207
inherited	properties
why not simply let the genericbarviewmodel set the default values for the 3 properties make it abstract and let any other bar viewmodel implementations inherited from the genericbarviewmodel

8377224
public	protected
also in such a case no need to create layer of public methods for just for calling protected visibility methods

8377233
button	checkbox
in my case i was dealing a software-generated pdf which always produced the same graphic paths for checkbox and radio button

8377286
children	parent
callbacks on the page model so that every time we manipulate a page we check if it is a trunk or a leaf by checking if it has parent or children via parents.exist

8377286
children	parent
you will probably have to use default_scope includes parent children on the page model or at least use includes a lot to prevent the number of db hits to explode

8377291
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
but i still don t know how to solve the problem because my objectoutputstream constructor is before the one for the objectinputstream

8377293
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
2 secondly i have a page that contains a dropdownlistfor and checkbox and again a submit button

8377293
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
when user selects any item of dropdownlistfor checks the checkbox he wants and clicks submit button i want to store item selected in dropdownlistfor and checkbox values checked by user in 2 different columns of my database

8377295
ubuntu	linux
chromium 14.0.835.202 developer build 103287 linux ubuntu 11.10

8377337
getattr	subclassing
b can i use something like getattr self myfunc to call a function name i have stored in an array so i can genericise the handle_options method and define it in the base menu class rather than for each subclassing

8377344
google-chrome	firefox
i ve narrowed down my fundamental problem the scope of an array differs from ie9 to firefox and google-chrome

8377344
google-chrome	firefox
it is in ie9 but not in firefox google-chrome

8377344
google-chrome	firefox
in the line quoted sortedworking is empty in firefox google-chrome

8377364
urwid	ncurses
if you re using python urwid is a popular choice for ncurses layouts

google-chrome	firefox
i recently noticed that my site is broken in google-chrome despite displaying well in firefox

8377523
google-chrome	firefox
there is a larger gap below the 4 blue titles in google-chrome than in firefox - which is breaking the frame of the containing box

this works but i d prefer to push the work off to sql instead of doing the grouping and sorting in c#

8377563
sorting	grouping
my question is how we can accomplish the above linq statement in an nhibernate fashion which results in the grouping sorting occurring in sql

8377563
sorting	grouping
the part i m stuck on is accessing the month portion and year portion of the datetime property for grouping and sorting which is currently accessed by the .net datetime object

8377618
pushviewcontroller	modalviewcontroller
i am trying pushviewcontroller and modalviewcontroller not able to render other view

8377656
typedef	typename
is the problem related to the scope of typedef typename

8377665
min	max
i think you have to configure min max channel memory size of omatpe or you may have an context attachment leads to this situation

8377726
spaces	delimiter
cin is delimiter on spaces so if you try to cin 1 2 3 4 5 into a single integer your only going to be assigning 1 to the integer a better option is to wrap your input and push_back in a loop and have it test for a sentinel value and on that sentinel value call your write function

8377835
config	ini
because spring s xml config is slightly more powerful than shiro s ini spring users are encouraged to use full spring config instead of shiro ini

8377850
int	chars
while shifting the types are automatically promoted to int which is wider than chars most often

8377859
viewdidload	dealloc
also you have some leaks here if you retain in viewdidload you should release nil in viewdidunload and in dealloc

8377863
simulink	labview
given how much image processing work is done in block-level dataflow languages such as labview i would recommend starting with simulink

8377866
hide	show
so you can t hide and show tabs at will

8377878
google-chrome	firefox
this wasn t a problem until i took a look at my website in google-chrome and noticed the links not clickable like firefox

8377939
hide	show
this is processed by a special pygments lexer pythonwithsqllexer and pygments formatter popupsqlformatter in order to generate a popup with the code snippet and the link that show hide it

8377939
hide	show
the show hide toggling is handled by jquery magic in init.js

inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
this is the exact point of class inherited having a parent run functions and reference properties that you don t have to code in every subclassing

8378162
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
in order for this to work you must flush the objectoutputstream immediately after constuction to write the initial header before you attempt to open the objectinputstream

8378167
nhibernate	automapper
in my project i also use castle automapper nhibernate nhibernateintegration

8378197

8378298
x86	64bit
and the reason you have x86 folder is that you are running 64bit version of windows

8378313
min	max
my calculations for max min lat lon are just examples you can do better -

8378359
prepare	execute
in theory your perl code should speed up significantly if you execute before the loop and simply reexecute the same prepare query repeatedly

8378398
jxtable	jtable
although we do not yet know whether the jtable is the actual problem i had performance problems with jxtable s note the swingx version of jtable in combination with large tablemodel s where the table would iterate over all elements to determine the column size before painting it

8378398
jxtable	jtable
i am not sure whether a regular jtable contains this logic as well but it might be worth a try to replace your jtable by a jxtable and set the prototype

8378414
post	put
if you pass in the _method post parameter set to delete or put then you can use app.delete and app.put in express instead of using app.post all the time thus more descriptive verbose

8378447
rsa	dsa
so it looks like you are trying to do an rsa signature with a dsa key which will not work or spit out nonsense

if you do the md5 hash of the bytes representing the strings will be the same

8382118

the grid.arrange function from the gridextra package is handy for arranging lattice plots

8387231
jtable	jeditorpane
how to insert jeditorpane into jtable cell

8387242
width	height
by default when you add a view to a layout in java code like you have done without explicitly setting any layoutparams it will set your view to be laid out using wrap_content for both height and width

8387242
width	height
since as far as we can see you are not overriding any of view s measurement methods to tell the layout system how big the content inside your custom view is the view will be added to the hierarchy with a height and width of zero

8387281
nsdateformatter	uidatepicker
i studied nsdateformatter nslocale uidatepicker etc but i couldn t find the solution

8387282

8387306
min	max
this is not working and its giving me a black line only even though i changed the interval of max and min

8387308
ant	maven
if you intend to use ant instead of maven then the only requirement is that all dependencies be present in the classpath

8387402
onmousedown	onmouseup
you could also use onmousedown and onmouseup listeners to change the style when the user clicks the button

8387408
postgresql	mysql
first of all you will have to install something other than sqlite i recommend postgresql not mysql

8387463
innodb	myisam
one of my friends who is a dba commented that mixing myisam and innodb is fairly common among the dba community while designing schema in mysql

8387479
children	parent
i want those parent where the children collection contains this item

8387479
children	parent
i want those parent where at least one of the children has

8387505
post	get
you can mix get and post in one request which can lead to some obscure problems especially when register_globals is switched on in your php-installation but you shouldn t

8387514
versioning	upgrade
http_post_vars is deprecated and should not be used anymore unless you re on an ancient php versioning in which case you really should upgrade

8387530
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
min max and sum are other examples of aggregate-functions you may want to use to specify how the data is to be handled where items are not distinct

8387561
filtering	grouping
if you want to transform or filtering a collection or do both to a grouping of collections you ll still have to handle all the mechanical details of constructing the result collection in addition to computing the values

8387581
folder	directory
and another thing is when i want to create a folder in the directory where my code is do you know how i could write that

8387614

hello i m actually using ryan bates cancan gem authorization to make my application s users to only manage the data that they create.i m using sorcery gem to handle authentification

8387615
client-side	server-side
i ve used it here and there on the client-side for a while but now i am adventuring into server-side javascript

8387658
innodb	myisam
notably on one system where queries were locking a whole table as myisam and we converted a number of the critical tables to innodb so they locked at the row level

8387661
google-chrome	firefox
it s typical in my debug and creation process to fire off a few jquery commands from the javascript console firebug in firefox or google-chrome s built-in just for inspection and testing purposes

8387692
public	protected
what if we don t test the protected methods can we use the public methods to cover those protected methods

8387692
public	protected
if not is it because of the protected methods too complicated refactor to extract the complicated things to a new object which provides public interfaces leaving the old object just one private object in some public methods

8387702
actionscript	haxe
for this to work you will have to write your code in haxe instead of actionscript and have it targeting the flash platform when compiling

8387744
devise	cancan
not sure if there is a cancan or devise feature out there

8387752
ant	maven
first traditional way is to write ant task maven plugin just command line java utility that scans given file path and calls for each class something like class.forname classname .getannotations myannotation.class

8387752
implements	extends
you can implements your own processor that implements javax.annotation.processing.processor or even better extends javax.annotation.processing.abstractprocessor

8387760
apache	nginx
you can discard apache switch to nginx who is solid in term of serving static html

8387876
put	get
i d like you to tell me how to get some properties from my .properties file specified by locale and where to put it in

8387922
put	get
locally the wcf project has an app.config from which it gets the connection details for the db dal however i m thinking that this does not get put into the compiled .dll for the wcf services project as i get the following error when i upload this to the production site

8387934
post	get
so 6 post 13 total database calls 1 to get the post then 6x2 to get the users

8387976
put	get
how do i get line breaks in data at the end of my query when i put line breaks in

8388005
folder	directory
i have the following code and although the call to boost filesystem create_directory returns true i see no directory created in my project folder

8388029
int	boolean
i can have continuous float values discrete values int and boolean

8388049
cpu	affinity
if you already using nativeprocess you could also set cpu affinity in platform specific way

8388057
innodb	myisam
newer versions of mysql 5.5+ have extended innodb to support all the features that were previously only available on myisam such as fulltext and geospatial indexing and innodb performance is usually considerably better than myisam when configured properly

8388091
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
as i know it has never shown the percentage i use firefox opera and google-chrome

8388105
setinterval	settimeout
if you only want the effect to happen once you should use settimeout not setinterval

8388150
setinterval	settimeout
in addition it is better to use settimeout instead of setinterval as the latter can cause performance issues

8388171
setinterval	settimeout
this uses settimeout instead of setinterval to reduce bubbling of the timeout events

8388190
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works in firefox safari google-chrome .

8388279
children	parent
here parent can see there children report card and can sign on it

8388288
int	boolean
it seems you want to associate an int attribute to each boolean variable

8388288
int	boolean
so each variable is a pair a boolean value and an int attribute

8388301
google-chrome	firefox
this does not appear to work in my google-chrome 14.0.835.202 but does work in my firefox 8.0 and ie 8

8388387
ubuntu	linux
i am looking to install java on linux ubuntu 64-bit

8388404
hide	show
here is a sample of the html table and the jquery code i am using to hide show rows

8388439
post	get
in html when we have something like passwd pass we call the part user uname passwd pass after the question mark form data .the form data can be attached to the end of the url after a question mark as above for get requests or sent to the server on a separate line for post requests.the form data are split to parameters

8388439
implements	extends
in our case the httppost and httpget classes extends the abstracthttpmessage which implements the setparams method

8388439
post	get
this method is same for get and post but does the job only for get

8388439
put	get
in the case of get the parameters are put in the url

8388439
post	get
on the server side when using servlets the getparameters is clever enough to find the parameters for get and post

8388440
int	double
in javascript however the only way of converting a double to an int that i m aware of is by using math.round floor tofixed etc

8388532
implements	extends
hopefully you can extends this to implements the 1 second delay

8388536
hash	md5
password of administrator is stored as a md5 hash in

8388551
accessor	properties
second way properties get accessor

8388568
int	double
you don t need to worry about precision issues since double correctly represent any int up to 2 53 but you really are stuck with using math.floor or other equivalent tricks if you want to round to the nearest int

8388568
int	double
most js engines use native int when they can but all in all js numbers must still have double semantics

8388589
actionscript	mxml
you can either use actionscript 3 and mxml and compile it with the flex sdk

8388616
sorting	filtering
but you can see the pattern for that functionality by looking at the basic sorting filtering model example

8388616
put	get
news is that how those widgets you put in the column headers get populated is up to you

8388620
getter	setter
you could workaround this by introducing lazy loading in a getter or lazy executing in a setter

8388661
int	double
only string double and int values no methods or references pointers

8388674
innodb	myisam
imho this is one of the terrible things about mysql that it makes you choose between speed and full-text indices myisam and referential integrity and transactions innodb

8388675
hide	show
it may be that the code for this in ie8 is clashing with show hide

8388677
folder	directory
to find the folder directory where one of your classes is assuming they are not in a jar and then to create a subfolder there

8388693
hide	fadeout
popup div should hide fadeout and the image can be dropped elsewhere

8388708
gson	jackson
if you have not already invested too much time into jackson may i recommend you looking at gson here is a tutorial that should have you started

8388711
post	get
post is not any more secure than get

8388735
debian	linux
we were encountering a very grave slowdown in our web server machine which is running on debian linux

8388767
unix	aix
nawk alas aix don t have sort and unix sort is far more superior then any hand-made sort in awk

8388768
hide	show
i m not sure why your code is having trouble but i have many times done projects that do a hide and show on a table row without any problems at all in ie8

8388772
folder	directory
looking into this folder is somewhat misleading as explorer will show the file in this directory but when you run ls cygdrive c windows system32 en-us there is no qwinsta.exe.mui file

8388820
innodb	myisam
you don t say what db you are using but in case you are using mysql note that mysql myisam tables the most common type do not support transactions--you need to use innodb with mysql

8388846
portrait	landscape
so what i want to do is figure out what the current orientation landscape reverse landscape portrait reverse portrait is change the orientation to that one orientation and then later change it back to what it was originally

8388846
portrait	landscape
it does return landscape or portrait

8388846
portrait	landscape
it wasn t until gingerbread 2.3 api 9 that reverse landscape and reverse portrait were added

8388846
portrait	landscape
in froyo how can i detect whether the device is in landscape reverse landscape portrait or reverse portrait

8388886
outputstream	inputstream
inputstream and outputstream

8388905
width	height
if by the dimensions you mean the width and height you can use yourtabhostinstance.getwidth and yourtabhostinstance.getheight to retrieve them

8388905
inherited	properties
there are other methods available for finding out more specific view properties as well see tabhost for more information particularly the methods inherited from android.view.view

8388907
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it just work on firefox both on mac and windows platforms ie google-chrome safari don t like this

8388924
strcpy	strncpy
use strcpy to copy the contents of the string but in new code don t use strcpy use strncpy instead

8388959
freebsd	debian	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	freebsd
i m not really sure on debian ubuntu but in freebsd you need to add a -x to use simple authentication instead of sasl

8388993
udp	tcp
this only works with direct tcp udp connections

8389006
dictionary	map
but the keys to the dictionary you should populate from the headers and somehow you have to map the data to the respective value in the empty slot s of the dictionary

8389012
pop-up	dialog
my issue is that this same og data is not being pulled into the like button pop-up when it pop-up a dialog to post a comment with the like - whereas this functionality exists and works elsewhere

8389025
inline	inlining
will that extra indirection be removed if the call can be inline either via explicit inlining or whole program optimization at linker level

8389030
portrait	landscape
are you trying to determine if a device is currently oriented in landscape or portrait mode

8389059
google-chrome	firefox
this might not be an answer but i have made this jsfiddle and it works in all browsers ie7- 9 firefox google-chrome

8389083
opera	safari
provided you don t care about really old browsers opera 6 and safari 1 most notably you can just save the image without any gamma information

8389129
filtering	grouping
the idea is that you can add a grouping search filtering for the parent grouping and the uid of the user in your spring security config

8389142
superclass	subclassing
in case i subclassing a class with a delegate protocol and property does my delegate still need to implement the delegate protocol of the superclass or do i have to define a new one for the subclassing

8389155
stdout	stderr
usually isatty tells you if a stream is a tty and is the common way to determine if the stdout or stderr is a console

8389171
fadein	fadeout
this will ensure that fadein is only run after both the ajax request and the fadeout have finished while running both simultaneously

8389193
uiview	subviews
not the background color but the entire uiview with all its subviews

8389215
put	get
you should rather just put it in the classpath and get it from the classpath

8389245
junit	testng
with testng i dont even get the stack trace with junit i see the below

8389261
opera	firefox
if i open the page in another browser i tried opera firefox everything works as expected -- no errors

8389287
sudo	passwd
also sudo will by default prompt for a passwd which monit won t be able to provide

8389290
google-chrome	firefox
this improved the problem to an extent but we were still left with different borders in firefox ie and google-chrome

8389313
keydown	keyup
the keydown keyup listener should be on the input not the submit button

8389324
division	addition
the objective of jacobian coordinates is to avoid the division during addition

8389393
ubuntu	linux
gnu linux red hat enterprise 5 + ubuntu 10.04 if it matters

8389411
post	get
get rid of it - that s skipping the first post

8389439
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
four values for background-position is only supported in a couple of them firefox google-chrome and safari do not support it

8389486
pbkdf2	hash
this project was set up to use sha-1 hash as the algorithm but i am thinking about switching to something like bcrypt or pbkdf2 and was wondering how people usually make a transition like this

8389492
hash	md5
i wouldn t personally use md5 to hash passwords but that s a different conversation.

8389500
hash	md5
since this is the result of an md5 hash you can assume the input data is equal

8389505
portrait	landscape
son now i m somehow forced to adapt all the views for both portrait and landscape mode which i ve never did before

8389578
postgresql	mysql
you need to lookup mysql or postgresql full text search

8389603
scatter	graphing
like the others have said to get the true time difference between your points to show up you have to use a scatter plot instead of the excel line graphing

8389610
pop-up	dialog
however you may be able to make it seem instantaneous for the user by doing the call to download the file through ajax what you re doing now provide response cache headers when sending the contents and then pop-up the download dialog through an iframe for example for the exact same url as the one in the ajax call

8389617
pull	push
git supposedly has the ability to push pull via ftp natively

8389634
gif	png
i currently have an image upload input that only accepts png jpg jpeg gif images

8389638
superclass	subclassing
i have a superclass named message with the field string msgtype and a subclassing named connectmessage that extends it which contains the field string pos_x

8389689
jlist	jtable
in the example below i have a jtable a jlist and two jbutton s add and remove

8389704
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
in inherited subclassing child derived class call it whatever you are comfortable with will extends inherited properties from superclass parent class

8389737
qobject	qwidget	qobject	qnetworkaccessmanager
now one way that i use to ensure requests are made in separate threads is to create an entire qobject qwidget for my qnetworkaccessmanager like this

8389745
google-chrome	firefox
does anyone know of an extension like this for google-chrome preferably or firefox

8389770
actualheight	actualwidth
doing the same without the viewbox and the bindings to actualwidth and actualheight will help a lot if it is feasible to replace with an lighter alternative

8389771
opensuse	linux
this is on a windows system but i run an opensuse linux box that i m not opposed to using for help with the issue

8389772
folder	directory
it should be possible to specify the targetpath as above but i think it would be cleaner to reproduce the wanted directory structure inside your source folder

8389783
nspredicate	nsmanagedobject
i m using an nspredicate to search an array of nsmanagedobject instances

8389809
udp	tcp
low level access to c socket api exposes features such as socket options to use protocols beyond vanilla tcp ip and udp

8389825
build-helper-maven-plugin	pom.xml
i am aware of the build-helper-maven-plugin that allows users to augment their pom.xml to specify new source folders for a build but using this plugin is not ideal since it requires more than 20 lines of extra configuration in the pom.xml

8389845
post	put	post	get	put	get
the response in case of get put post should contain the location to the requested created updated resource

8389856
min	max
passing a parameter to an oracle group by will be difficult because the grouped columns are the only ones which can appear directly in the select clause anything not in the group by can only appear inside a group function such as sum min max count etc. so you would need to modify the sql on the fly to add remove columns in the select clause

8389905
post	get
i am trying to post into a database table 3 different bits of information but i get an error of column count doesn t match value count at row 1

8389914
width	height
since your div#content is absolutely positioned within div#container the container will ignore the height and width of the content when determining its own dimensions

8389916
children	parent
as for reaping children of a parent whose sigchld handler is explicitely set to ignore will be reaped automatically by the system

8389945
activemq	rabbitmq
as far as my experience the queue capacity depends on the machine and not that large compared to activemq or rabbitmq

8389960
debian	centos	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian
amazon elastic compute cloud ec2 basically is your virtual operative system you can install whatever so you want debian ubuntu fedora centos windows server suse enterprise

8390041
spaces	delimiter
assuming that the white spaces is a delimiter you can use the following mechanism

8390053
post	get
only problem is on my new php page when i get the variables using post they come us as empty

8390082
unsigned	short
in short srand unsigned int seed is correct if you re using older versions of c++ or if you just want one rng in your program

8390084
post	get
you need to create a before_filter to get the user and the form post to create not new

8390117
terminate	timeout
my question is why doesn t connection.open not timeout and terminate

8390128
rss	feed
i ve previously used yahoo weather rss feed

8390144
strsplit	substr
or you can use substr or strsplit as others have suggested

8390146
submit	submission
the submit button is deliberately a clickable div and submission is done by jquery thus

8390149
width	height
padding is never the same in firefox and ie while ie adds padding to the height and width firefox just ignores it

8390186
versioning	upgrade
i guess technically the answer here is to upgrade to a newer versioning of visual studio 2010 or later

8390198
google-chrome	firefox	slideup	slidedown
i have a jquery slidedown slideup animation that runs smoothly in ie9 and firefox but is very choppy in google-chrome

8390206
int	boolean
the value that goes after the keyword case is an identifier or something that evaluates to a constant value such as an int enum or boolean value

8390208
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it does this in internet explorer and opera but it does not do this for safari firefox and google-chrome as in those browsers it displays the tables inline but inline by bottom of the table and not top of the table

8390222
width	height
one additional wrinkle is that some browsers require some content to be in a container say table cell or div before applying width height to it

8390224
textarea	textbox
how can i make s with textbox and textarea inside

8390224
textarea	textbox
how can i disbale the textarea or textbox when the radio buton isn t selected

8390253
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this appears to work in the latest release versions of firefox safari and google-chrome if i widen the jsfiddle result view enough so that both tables can fit next to each other

8390288
carrierwave	paperclip
also consider using carrierwave instead of paperclip for your uploads

8390292
google-chrome	firefox
however i tested the following code in firefox and google-chrome and it works

8390305
devise	cancan
is there any way to use devise or cancan for this purpose

8390320
maven	pom.xml
it is unclear to me how to alter my maven pom.xml to accomplish this

8390324
post	put	post	get	put	get
the main aspect is that get put post should be used appropriately against the same url for respective api

8390337
prepare	execute
i would also consider a few things like switching to prepare statements or using something like sprintf to store your query then execute the query

8390353
width	height
then change your #container #dropdown #button hover #menu selector to #container #dropdown #button hover and give it the following properties width auto height auto overflow visible

8390404
getter	setter
the combination of a magic setter and getter essentially provides dynamic class properties via property overloading

8390406
put	get
so this brings up a window for me to put in the user and password but after accepting it i get an error of nil class for an instance variable that works perfectly without the authentication

8390409
pop-up	dialog
for instance it s impossible to close opened pop-up of combobox located on qt widget by pressing enter or esc key - dialog is closed instead cdialog onok or cdialog oncancel is called

8390426
versioning	upgrade
as with older versioning they use the ie rendering engine if you upgrade the server machine which is running abcpdf to ie8 or higher abc pdf no longer have access to the rendering engine and will produce some very very odd results

8390449
ratingbar	textview	implements	extends
i m attempting to create a class that extends a cursoradapter in order to display a ratingbar and text in the listview using its newview and bindview methods.this is an attempt to go further with the notepad tutorials from the dev website.my problem is that the program crashes manly because i m implements the methods wrong although there may be other problems of implementation in this class or the filldata method.my question is what is the correct way to write the code so that i can display a ratingbar in a listview along with other textview

8390467
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
in such model neither margin nor padding are part of the content dimensions width and height as this figure illustrates

8390471
portrait	landscape
and yes you ll need a landscape and a portrait value for your constant

8390503
for-loop	loops
now that you have two answers about the while loops i ll suggest using for-loop instead

8390568
csv	tsv
since c# is compiled and can t do evals like scripted languages can not that you should be doing that anyway you should probably use streamreader to read the data from file formatted perhaps as delimited text csv or tsv

8390585
folder	directory
the ngram folder is in the same directory as the file

8390595
width	height
i ve tried to create a div through javascript setting its background-color position width and height and adding an onmouseover event to it

8390598
post	put
but in v5 there are no such things and i have searched and searched and found nothing that could help me even put a post on thier forum and no responses yet

8390604
passenger	webrick
when i run the webrick server on port 3000 my app runs perfectly but when attempting to access it through the virtual host i continue to get passenger errors

8390636
folder	directory
when i add this file it always shows my path as being the file in my projectfiles directory not my binary folder

8390722
mouse	keyboard
use mouse messages to determine which tab is being clicked on directly look at the tpagecontrol.indexoftabat method and use keyboard messages to detect left right arrow presses to determine which tab is adjacent to the active tab look at the tpagecontrol.findnextpage method

8390729
interpreted-language	compiled-language
this question is more about interpreted-language vs compiled-language which has actually no other answer that the usual it depends of your need

8390762
decoder	encoder
does not have any depending on any 3rd party encoder decoder library unless you use gzip encryption libraries

8390814

i would like to have a default value for a nstextfield or nssearchfield and have this default value removed when the user clicks on it and set back when the text view loses the focus and the text field is empty

8391005
width	height
you must specify a units designator for height and width

8391021
bazaar	git
i m new to bazaar coming to it from a background of subversion and git

8391021
bazaar	git
in addition although rebase is commonly used in git it appears it s not generally approved of in the bazaar world

8391049
button	checkbox
the selection is twofold and at the moment two different set of button so no checkbox or radio button

8391089
post	get
i don t do anything in get post functions after writing should i somehow shutdown close the connection before returning

8391089
post	get

you would probably be better suited using a modal pop-up dialog to edit the data rather than navigating to another page

8393444

super	abstract	super	implements
so since getsystemresource is the same for all three printers so this can be pushed up to the super class to be implements in java this can be done via making this abstract in the super class and in making a method abstract in a super class the class itself needs to be abstract as well

8394338
getter	setter
so if you are pretty sure that any reasonable implementation would have a string named uniqueid you could declare it plus relevant getter setter in the abstract class saving some typing later

put	get
when i get to second column each number would be put in twp times and then repeated until the end of the array is reached

8394480
getter	setter
in c++ getter and setter are just methods and functions invokation always requires

8394483
post	get
therefore the authors of tornado were correct to ignore the post data for get head and delete

8394489
getter	setter
you can actually implement a getter and setter to a field like

8394507
getter	setter
finally you have to add getter and setter methods to the class which implement the get set logic and have member_t aggregate pointers to these functions as members so that it can call the getter inside the implicit conversion to prop_t and call the setter inside the overridden assignment operator

8394509

i would use objectinputstream and objectoutputstream and just write objects

8394576
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the constructor of objectinputstream blocks until it receives the header that is written by the constructor of objectoutputstream so if you are constructing both you must construct the objectoutputstream first

8394587
post	put
then you can instead of relying on urlconnection#setdooutput true to implicitly set the request method to post instead do httpurlconnection.setrequestmethod post which some might find more natural and which also allows you to specify other request methods such as put delete ...

imo you should hide elements in your css and do some conditional show rather than conditional hide

8398786
always-on-top	frame
while a modal always-on-top dialog is open in front of the frame click the frame

8398786
always-on-top	frame
the frame inherits the always-on-top behaviour even if it is not set to stay on top

8398827
required	placeholder
the query that i have required me to set the placeholder from another table class

8398839
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
i need some explanation of how to calculate runtime height width including excluding padding margin border etc and how to set it correctly so that i dont run into problems

8398839
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
problem is there is no way to set outerheight when we set height width of an element the height width is actually inner height width without taking margin into consideration while when we want to resize parent we need outerheight but we cannot set back the outerheight that easily

8398839
children	parent
my calculatesize and layoutchildren are two separate methods and two separate algorithms because parent will be resized to sum of all children s height

8398850
stdout	stderr
deny access to stdin stdout or stderr

8398850
stdout	stderr
encodings exit site stdin stdout stderr and traceback features

8398850
stdout	stderr
stdout stderr sys.stdout and sys.stderr

8398983
width	height
using this code block you can set the custom width and height of the page but if the width exceeds 520px the page will show the scroll bar at the bottom

8399000
min	max
another way to reduce excessive memory usage would be to find the min and max values used o n and then create the array to suite that number of values remember to offset the array position by the min value

8399008
gmail	hotmail
if gmail in sender_address or hotmail in sender_address or yahoo in sender_address or aol.com in sender_address

8399018
dlsym	dlopen
compile your own python with a dynload patch that prefer to not dlopen your module but use directly dlsym to check if the module is already in memory

8399048
width	height
unfortunately the 100 only works for the width for the height my contents are vertically squeezed if i don t set a value in pixels..

8399095
width	height
all i want is to be able to create this structure from blank page using only 6 sizes of width resizable height and sortable items

8399104
width	height
you have to change height and width of widget in appwidget provider file as per below

8399107
margin	height
this means that the iframe cannot generate height on its own so you have to set the height of the and tags to 100 also set their margin and padding to 0

8399110
google-chrome	firefox
i can t manage to resize the windows neither in google-chrome or firefox

8399120
jobs	cron
the problem here is that the implementation is not a pure django solution and must be integrated with a mail server and cron jobs

8399163
mapr	cloudera
besides apache hadoop it s more or less a three horse race for hadoop distribution between hortonworks cloudera and mapr

8399189
implements	extends
i just read a tutorial about it you will need to create a custom component lets say myauth which extends auth component to implements a custom login function

8399201
atoi	strlen	atoi	strstr	strlen	strstr
you can use strstr to find the spot in str then move the char pointer forward strlen content-length positions then read the value using atoi

8399264
ubuntu	debian
if this is an ubuntu or a debian based system a simple sudo apt-get install icecast2 should install the server for you without polluting your system

8399264
ubuntu	debian
if it is debian or ubuntu doing a dpkg -l icecast2 | grep etc after installing should show you the config files

8399278
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox the difference is only a factor of two but in google-chrome 15 it s one hundred times slower

8399350
int	chars
use 0 for chars plain 0 for int

8399398
google-chrome	safari
while developing i used google-chrome safari ripple emulator to see how my web pages were looking

8399399
google-chrome	firefox
10x faster in google-chrome and 2x faster in firefox for me

8399408
mouseover	mouseout
what i do is only execute the mouseover mouseout functions when the two elements target and related target do not share a parent

8399408
mouseover	mouseout
solved my problem a-ok because what i want to fire for mouseover and mouseout events will only happen when the elements don t share a parent - exactly how i intended on displaying the popups anyhow

8399408
mouseover	mouseout
this ensures that if i mouseover the popup it keeps it alive because the divcreator mouseout will fire and when i mouseout of the popup it disappears

8399408
mouseover	mouseout
however with this method whenever i mouseover a child element it detects a mouseout event from the parent element divpopup and closes the div

8399421
width	height
trying to set width and height for an empty movieclip will always returns 0

8399437
notepad	textpad
edit i just noticed that same thing is happening when i paste code in other text editor like textpad or notepad

8399529
atomic	interlocked
volatile here on so i understand and know the concepts of volatile no re-ordering always reading from memory etc. and i am aware of how interlocked works in that it performs an atomic operation

8399562
onresize	onload
to be called onload and onresize

8399567
try-catch	exception-handling
an exception-handling causes the script to pause despite that the exception-handling itself is positioned within a try-catch block

8399624
folder	directory
actually the behaviour of the android .apk file is read only so the directory structure which are in that apk file follows the same so no one can write this files or make changes on that at runtime that s why you can t make a changes in asset folder at runtime

8399643
gtk	cairo
like bezies scaling rotating and shearing the coordinate system and so on the way to go is to use cairo + python + some display library which might be pygame gtk or qt

8399649
websphere	ibm
we have a j2ee app running beautifully on tomcat-based app servers but all groovy scripts seem to fail on weblogic 10.3.5.0 and also ibm websphere

seems its not working i have also set permissions and changed mysql owner as well commands used are chown and chmod

8399679
mouseleave	mouseenter
the mouseenter w3 dom3 docs and mouseleave w3 dom3 docs but they are currently in the dom3 events working draft

8399710
maven	pom.xml
basically in order to avoid having to maintain development javascript dependency information in the html and production dependency information in my maven pom.xml i think it would be better to put the dependencies in comments of the actual javascript and css files

8399713
typedef	struct
is a typedef for struct _bit_reference which is defined as

8399757
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
this very first view controller could be uiviewcontroller uitabbarcontroller uinavigationcontroller etc

these events include mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseenter mouseleave mousehover keypress keydown and keyup

8399776
put	get
i will think you will get a lot of help to put your output into a file

8399778
client-side	server-side
file uploads are handled server-side in php in your case not client-side in jquery

8399783
implements	extends
is there an easy way to extends a mock object so i implements my own method

8399795
addition	multiplication	addition	modulo	multiplication	modulo
all operations are meant in that field you should do every single addition multiplication or inversion modulo p

8399795
division	multiplication	division	modulo	multiplication	modulo
this implies computing one division and two multiplication and a few subtractions all operations being done on integers modulo p as explained above

8399795
division	multiplication	division	modulo	multiplication	modulo
division and inversion modulo p are relatively expensive a modular division has typically the same cost as about 80 multiplication so in some situations we use projective or jacobian coordinate systems

8399795
division	multiplication	division	addition	addition	multiplication
with jacobian coordinates the addition of two points is done in a dozen field multiplication and no division at all

8399819
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup won t help you

8399827
hide	show
now my requirement is to show linkbutton and hide label if ispopup is true and vice versa

8399871

for older versioning i m not sure how to upgrade it

8399928
int	double
i want to compare arrays of int and double in my unit tests

always use parameter prepared query and hash salt your password

8400011
portrait	landscape
if the device is rotated from landscape to portrait and then to reverse landscape everything works as expected

uiview	subviews
those subviews could be uiimageviews or standard uiview that you then continue to draw by subclassing the subviews s drawrect

8400014
uiview	subviews
then it would be trivial to animate those subviews using uiview s animation methods

8400061
width	height
together with each image is a link with a width and height of 16px and a background image of a cross

8400077
folder	directory
the stylesheet is in the webcontent folder so in exactly the same directory as the index.jsp

8400112
post	put
it is a good idea to not to accept requests with the payload if they are not post or put

8400120
portrait	landscape
build two interfaces one for portrait and one for landscape but i found it awfully tiresome to devise some methods that enable one view controller to keep up with the other so when the device is rotated the second view controller knows where to pick up the story

8400141
equals	gethashcode
you can also just override the equals object method from system.object if you do this you should also override gethashcode see here

8400143
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
as you can see in the picture below my uiviewcontroller is not a uinavigationcontroller it s a common uiviewcontroller

8400188

sounds like the total width of the images padding and margin are too wide for your container width

8400193
realloc	malloc
finally after searching everywhere i got the answer i use malloc and realloc to replace new and i still dont understand how to use cvseq so i replace it too

8400209
post	get
i think that the problem is that you use post method and not the get

8400238
client-side	server-side
either in the server-side application php etc. so that the client-side times are written to the page

8400249
google-chrome	safari
there is some odd behaviour when it comes to box shadows in google-chrome and safari

8400249
google-chrome	safari
when i use box-shadow the google-chrome browser in recent versions does support the css3 specification without the prefix but the safari browser doesn t

8400249
google-chrome	safari
so to have my box shadow in google-chrome and safari i need following

8400249
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
which works fine in safari and in google-chrome and in firefox and in opera

8400249
google-chrome	firefox
do you all see the box-shadow in ie9 different to those in firefox or google-chrome too

8400356

8400546
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
i think you just need an iboutlet for the uinavigationbar or only for the uinavigationitem the title for your uinavigationbar and that s it

8400573
implements	extends
then i created a custom adapter extends baseexpandablelistadapter and implements the getgroupview method inside this method you can create a view with an imageview that you can switch manually to expand or contract the group using the isexpanded flag and hide it completely if the group was empty

8400574
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
u can refer to this thread as well create uinavigationcontroller in uitableviewcontroller inside uitabbarcontroller

i ve set up a virtual directory which points to the folder where the website is

8400977
hide	show
if you need to show hide windows taskbar you can use this

8401065
inherited	properties
i d personally attach the css properties to your element rather than the one as there is a chance that the properties is being inherited

8401116
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i m having trouble with the cursor in a searchbox that displays too far left in firefox whereas it looks fine in google-chrome and safari

8401120

though request will not be available in the model you will get a nameerror with the following code your current problem is that the controller is throwing a nomethoderror because you are missing self

8401148
width	height
and it looks great but when i rotate the phone the width and height remain the same so now it s too wide for the update view frame

8401172

8401522
gmail	hotmail
as far as i m able to tell if gmail yahoo hotmail lycos aol etc

8401553
cvs	svn
this shows a workflow different from the classic centralized server such as cvs or svn

8401553
pull	push
superficially it looks similar as you pull the source from a central git server but you push your commits to the gerrit server that can compile and test the code to make sure it works before eventually pushing the changes to the central git server

8401561
jboss	glassfish
java servlets run in some kind of container tomcat jboss glassfish jetty etc which needs to be running to serve request

8401575
width	height
the only way you can resize a image is using a img tag and resizing it with width and height css attributes

1 extends simplejdbcsupport which allows you to have access to the databse and 2 implements factorybean which returns the object to spring s context

8401908
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
unless you plan to package this as a browser extension plugin eg for google-chrome firefox or safari you will no doubt run into cross-site scripting security issues if you re trying to run javascript on another domain s page unless you re planning to have other site owners voluntarily include your script in their pages too

8401915
hide	show
i don t want to show hide the buttons

i have upgrade to versioning 2 and it seems the registries have been broken

8402264
portrait	landscape
after reading a few articles about android configuration i still don t know how to not launch an async task when i change the view from portrait to landscape

8402345
hide	show
option one instead of a clone generate serverside and then hide until needed - change the display to show them when you need them

8402358
post	get
that post will get you some html formatting that you could guess at

8402368
stdout	stderr
the operator redirects both stdout and stderr

8402369
pdfbox	itext
that s something a lot a libraries do quite fine such as itext and apache s pdfbox

8402369
pdfbox	itext
we tried several pdf libraries pdfbox itext pdfjet and more but all need at least those libraries and fail to encrypt our in-memory byte of a pdf

8402394
int	double
when parsing a string into an int or double a bad format will throw numberformatexception but when parsing into a date for example a parseexception will be thrown

8402398
g++	gcc
due to the alternatives system that s used for switching between gcc versions 3 and 4 gcc and g++ are symlinks to gcc-3 g++-3 or gcc-4 g++-4

8402424
packets	multicast
for instance multicast requires that you send an igmp join packets that contains the multicast group you want to receive

8402424
packets	multicast
on the multicast sender server use this command to send test multicast packets to 239.255.0.1

8402424
packets	multicast
on the multicast receiver client use this command to listen to test multicast packets sent to 239.255.0.1 on eth0

8402453

i would have just made the post-receive hook checkout to the parent folder whose child is the server s documentroot but my dev repo s directory structure does not map one-to-one to the live server s directory structure

8402453
folder	directory
where each folder of the tree should map to in the live site directory file structure

8402460
spaces	delimiter
french by default uses spaces as thousands delimiter for some reason - thus the if statement

8402496
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	show	hide	fadeout
just use fadeout and fadein instead of show and hide

8402500
int	double
putting the compilable code into a nested loop one would expect result to increment by 1 with each iteration because math.random always returns a double whose value is less than 1 and when added to an int the fractions part would be lost due to precision loss

8402581
int	double
1.999999 will be rounded to 1 but 1.9999999999999999 will be rounded to 2 but the double + operator rather than the cast to int

8402592
profiling	debugging	profiling	instrumentation
i can tell from debugging that the bodies goes back to sleep but chipmunks timestep solver query initially takes 25 of the running time and 50 after playing a level according to instrumentation time profiling

8402609
post	get
the http spec only states get post cookie and header

8402622
ienumerable	ienumerator
the issue you are seeing is likely not because of the ienumerable ienumerator interfaces but rather with the underlying resources you are using to produce values

textview	simplecursoradapter
i am using a simplecursoradapter called adapter and i want the textview to bold and the background to change when an item is clicked

8403310
post	get
i have read the documentation about using the http post on the app_id tabs but i couldn t get my head around it

8403342

get rid of the int cast to see more closely what the double representation of your literal is going to be before it s casted to int

8403386
floating-point	integer
the new radix-16 floating-point divider with variable latency radix-16 integer divide capability replaces the merom radix-4 floating point divide and radix-2 square root and integer divide hardware

i was thinking of having an option menu to hide and show it

8403428
disk	ram
edit rather what you want is a ssd solid-state-disk for your build workspace to get a 10x improvement-in-speed or a ram disk for a 100x improvement-in-speed for builds not kidding 64mb ram on an lga2011 socket gives you a 32mb ram disk which is what we use.

8403680
width	height
if you want to get the width and height before your activity has added it to its view hierarchy measured and layed it out you will have to call measure on the view yourself before calling getmeasuredwidth or getmeasuredheight

8403680
width	height
as the measured width and height are set after measure has been called which in turn calls onmeasure they will return 0 before this point

8403705
getter	setter
so it wasn t until i had added and began testing the new custom methods not setter getter that i started to get the error

queue	fifo
the only effects you might notice are for example if you change the queue from fifo to priority or vice versa

8404437
put	get
in this case the get put and trigger attributes are considered run-time and are only set when the queue is first defined

8404437
put	get
so once you enable get and put on the queue these attributes and the function of the app are never disturbed by subsequent script runs

8404972
range	min	range	max	min	max
however to do a binary search we need to know where the range of values in each clusters so we need meta-data that says the min and max value of each cluster and where that cluster is

8405776

8405857
interpolation	splines
the nurbs article probably covers all this but a quick and dirty way to draw a smooth curve between a bunch of points is to use cubic splines by interpolation a cubic polynomial in between every two points such that the first derivatives match at the edges

8405858
google-chrome	safari
but that only seems to work in some browsers namely webkit and is probably why your jquery css also only works in google-chrome safari as they probably did some updates to the library

8406962
backgrounding	multitasking
the address book framework on ios only allows you to add and modify contacts within the existing accounts on the device and the multitasking rules only allow your app to start in the backgrounding if it provides a voip service

8406967

if you don t care that your activity is recreated when you change orientation just create your layouts xml files for portrait and landscape with the same name and put the one for portrait in the layout folder and the one for landscape in layout-land folder

8407049
getter	setter
the main point of the exercise is that setter is used inside the getter

8407068
folder	directory
i m trying to have a user interface that has multiple versions of the images with the images folder being a symbolic link and have some outside action trigger my lua code to switch which directory the symbolic link is pointing to

8407190
opera	firefox
in firefox and opera the map-element is not actually above the image but invisible under it

8407225
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the primary problem with adding and removing your child view controllers views as you ve done here is that the view controller life cycle methods viewwillappear viewdidappear etc. won t ever get called on your child view controllers

8407225
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
containers like uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller have always known how to delegate methods like these appropriately to their children but uiviewcontroller didn t officially support the ability to nest view controllers under your own custom container before ios 5

8407242
rss	feed
keep in mind that you ll want to continue using absolute urls for the links in your rss feed

8407263
hide	show
i ve had to do something similar for stuff that used the hover state to hide or show menus where for whatever reason onmouseover events were not good enough for the browser to apply a different css psuedoclass

8407268
inherited	properties
i have a main object that has many properties which are generally either or in some cases they are mylisttypeb where mylisttypeb inherited from

8407289
memcached	apc
zend_cache would work and you could use apc memcached flat files etc

8407315
getter	setter
next there are only getter setter for lazydatamodel

8407316
versioning	upgrade
if you have the option upgrade to the latest versioning

8407326
rss	feed
you host the swf file on the domain verdandi.is but are trying to grab the rss feed from the domain or rather subdomain www.verdandi.is

8407326
rss	feed
you can allow access from swf files from other domains by creating a cross-domain policy file as per the link above or make sure the swf is accessed from the same domain as the rss feed

8407338
clang	llvm
you ll need to use the llvm compiler 3.0 aka clang

8407340
apk	dex
i know i can save strings in res values strings.xml but if someone disassembles the dex file or the apk file then he will be able to see hardcoded strings or res values strings.xml strings

8407378
capistrano	rvm
i am using capistrano to deploy to a ubuntu 11.10 host using rvm and ruby 1.9.2-p290

i can hide it and show it again and it will show where it it supposed to be but if i move my form the tooltip is left behind

8407403
width	height
for my windows settings the scrollbar width height is 17px

8407403
width	height
this is why you see the div width and height 378px 361 + 17 and 117px 100 + 17

8407415
public	protected
if so then maybe you could just have public protected methods to set clickhandler s for each button

8407437
getter	setter
if not then just use a persistent string attribute and parse this string in the getter and transform to string in the setter

8407442
post	get
can browser extensions be programmed to browse a series of websites filling out get and post requests automatically

8407452
post	get
silent post does not send you get data

8407452
hash	md5
add md5 hash in auth.net interface run a transaction and see if you re getting the value

i have started to see problems with search indexers or antivirus spyware opening the file for reading but not allowing deletes

8407477
lisp	scheme
lisp scheme set

8407531
button	checkbox
so i m thinking what this will do is on the button click get all the checked checkbox which is good

8407534
persistent	transient
when you say clone do you mean to create a new entity that will be persistent or to just create another transient entity that is an in-memory copy of the same entity

8407579
websphere	ibm
i don t know of a server implementation in either of those languages at this time but ibm provides websphere mq which supports mqtt clients and ships both java and c clients - since you mention a c# server i assume you are looking for a windows-based server and wmq can certainly run on windows

8407589
execvp	fork
if i try to print out the strings stored in input before fork everything seems to be in order but after fork input doesn t longer contain the strings it should have and therefore execvp doesn t execute properly

8407662
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
something such as a objectdatasource or sqldatasource control prove very helpful in such cases

8407681
google-chrome	firefox
all of that works fine in firefox but in google-chrome when the user clicks on the dropdown the call is made but the dropdown does not populate

8407711
width	height
if you delete those and correctly set the height width and alignment properties the divider and splitter should show up properly

8407716
google-chrome	firefox
so far as i can see this is a legitimate program but although ie9 runs it firefox emits some text then hangs infinitely loops whatever while google-chrome shows only the h1 firefox declined to do so and the last string

8407732
strdup	malloc
an alternative is to use strdup on tok_inline which uses malloc to make a duplicate of the string

8407743
objectdatasource	formview
this formview is bound to an objectdatasource which is bound to a dropdownlist

8407755
fpdf	fpdi
i have a php based form that inputs form data onto a pdf generated by fpdf fpdi utilizing a pre-made template

i don t use or even know nhibernate i just want to give my testimony i use linq to sql since about 2 years with mysql and postgresql databases using dblinq on windows using mono on linux and mac os x

8407770
google-chrome	firefox
i have a problem with a jquery change event on a text input that works as expected in firefox and ie but not in google-chrome

8407831
width	height
there you can set the scroll width and height of your webview as needed

8407831
width	height
this is an extremely barebones implementation--presumably you would also want logic to calculate the necessary width and height based upon the loaded text rather than use constants as shown here

8407834
postgresql	mysql
there are several good free databases out there like mysql and postgresql so you can relatively easily grab one and play with it

8407840
translation	localization
i incorporated a gettext-like localization system in my app but my translation function looks like this

8407867
translation	localization
implementing a general scheme for handling expressions of the type Ã¢ Ån itemsÃ¢ is not simpleÃ¢ cldr gives you sets of rules but you would need to code them and in translation you would need to request for all the relevant inclined forms of a noun like Ã¢ Åitem.Ã¢ if such expressions occur in some specific context s only it might be feasible to reformulate things so that you donÃ¢ t say Ã¢ Ån tickets leftÃ¢ but Ã¢ Ånumber of tickets left n.Ã¢ this would be much easier to implement just string localization and number localization

8407901

8408052
pop-up	dialog
i m implementing a facebook send dialog by opening facebook.com dialog send in a pop-up window

8408092
accessor	properties
it seems to me like you could write a wrapper function taking an expression tree decomposing each subexpression that has properties and field accessor and reconstructing it with explicit null checks that throw an informative exception on each of those accessor

8408098
children	parent
at that point since the parent has closed all of its pipes any further children will have nothing to write to or read from

8408098
children	parent
then after all children have been created your parent can wait

8408115
postgresql	mysql	javadb	hsqldb
some of them run within their own server application ms sql oracle mysql postgresql but some of them can be embedded within your java application for example javadb a variant of apache derby db apache derby db hsqldb h2 or sqlite

8408119
google-chrome	firefox
this only works well in google-chrome and in explorer but in firefox the image stops moving

8408143
getter	setter
with a getter setter or public fields even you can do a deep shallow clone of a book instance and illustrate what changes when you change the name of the author

8408244
width	height
i have removed the overflow scroll property from your table as you have it a fixed height width

8408260
hide	show
when you click darrens panel the only diference i see is that the display property is changed from block to none so show and hide should work

8408278
int	chars
if i understand your description correctly you have users.ip as cidr notation in chars or varchar and geoip.startip endip as int

pull queues. - push queue docs

8408416
google-chrome	safari
you can open the google-chrome safari developer tools and start profiling profiles tab to see if there is any javascript code that is performing badly and causing the hang

8408428
folder	directory
i ve uploaded a new unzipped module folder into site modules directory through ftp

8408429
put	get
note that this will raise a stopiteration if no matching item exists so you will need to put this in a try except and replace it with a default if you get a stopiteration

8408471
accessor	properties
create and add the button to the cell s contentview in your init method or create and add it lazily via an accessor properties

8408476
vpn	lan
if i understand your question correctly you actually want to be able to use the installed running version of outlook on a client machine to generate and send an email message which it will hand off to whatever configured mta it is using probably via the exchange server it is configured to on a private lan or over vpn when on a public network

8408476
vbscript	vba
the following microsoft article shows how to do this in vba which should give you enough specifics to use almost as-is for vbscript

8408503
public	protected
difference in visibility between private protected and public and even the strict notations

8408515
xmltype	clob
this returns your xmltype as a clob without the additional function overhead

8408613
tolower	uppercase
you also might want to use tolower c - a instead of just so that it will make the letter lowercase whether it is lowercase or not so that the array contains the count of both uppercase and lowercase versions of the letters for example both a and a will increment

8408642
width	height
you need to specifiy the width and height of the view

8408684
metaphone	soundex
while smith and its german counterpart schmidt would turn up as quite different using the edit distance a.k.a levenshtein soundex and metaphone would consider them phonetically similar or even equivalent

8408686
fast-forward	merge
to synchronize them you do a merge which sometimes just is a fast-forward merge

8408700
oncreate	onstart
according to the official documentation onresume is exactly what you want - it always gets executed when the activity comes into foreground either together with oncreate and or onstart or alone depending on the current process and activity states

8408724
children	parent
z-index issues are probably related to children of a pie border-radius parent not having a -pie-watch-ancestors value set

8408748
nsstring	nsdata
if you can get this super long string as an nsdata to begin with instead of an nsstring then you can be much more confident that nothing s going to get copied

8408760
interpolation	splines
one of the answers to my question explained the concept of interpolation using linear splines smoothing on the cumulative sum to overcome hiccoughs in binning

8408763
activemq	rabbitmq
my first advise would be to use activemq or rabbitmq both uses persistence with fail over they are very easy to pick up

8408769
unbind	livequery
if this still isn t having the desired effect though i really can t see why not as livequery when i used to use it was a dream try this dirty little hack to unbind and rebind facebox every time you mouse down

8408779
public	protected
you re missing function after public protected in several methods

8408822
int	double
int double and so on

8408857
getter	setter
when you have to access a member variable field in a class is it good practice to access it directly or call the getter and setter

8408899
getter	setter
call the setter getter rather than accessing directly

8408899
getter	setter
that way any extra required code in the setter getter will be run

8408906
client-side	server-side
you will need to write a custom proertyvalidator for server-side fluentvalidation with client-side support

8408909
ssl	https
they did actually publish the http urls at one point but i d imagine that the resulting mixed-content warnings etc that came about as a result of people adding ssl connections and not thinking it through just created a bunch of support questions so it was simpler to default to showing https and let people hack it if they really wanted

8408921
getter	setter
i see almost only benefits in making your fields private and only provide access through a getter and possibly a setter

8408921
getter	setter
if you only want to provide read access or only write access you can only achieve this by using getter setter

8408921
getter	setter
the only possible drawback i can think of is that it requires a bit more code to write for the getter and setter and a bit more code for accessing the field from outside the class

8408934
post	get
the post response page is quite certainly containing an empty get that the browser fill by replaying the post.

8408977
hex	binary
create a suitable mask with ones only where are the bytes you need you just need to write the number in binary and convert to hex to put it inside the c program

8408994
getter	setter
otherwise use the getter setter methods

8408994
getter	setter
you should not be creating getter setter methods just so that the calling class can access its own members

8408994
getter	setter
otherwise you should use the getter setter methods for the reasons elaborated by others

8408998
children	parent
how would i go about adding a class only to the li parent that has children

8409027
getter	setter
getter setter allows for lazy instantiation which is often a way to go

8409027
getter	setter
benefits are multiple when given a choice choose setter getter for the benefits of data encapsulation and more control

8409058
pull	push
the idea is that on the remote host which i don t own so someone else has root on it i can have my passphrased private key and the third read only key and then on that machine i can pull without a password and push back using the passphrased key

8409067
redhat	fedora
publican is used by redhat as part of its internal documentation toolchain and is an open source application hosted by the fedora project

8409090
getter	setter
unresolved properties are just that java properties which hibernate sees no getter setter for

8409090
getter	setter
most likely you meant to query for menuid since java beans aren t named with underscores in their getter setter

8409118
getter	setter
here is my users class i didn t enclose getter and setter for brevity it s implemented by admin class and signeduser class with some additional properties

8409129

debian	linux
i m getting the following errors seeing error in debian squeeze and also crunchbang linux

8409176
innodb	myisam
2 full text searches can only be used on myisam tables so if you use a framework that depends on innodb you will need to create a relational workaround

8409176
range	min
you will need to set that lower in your config then rebuild your full text indices if you need a lower min character range

8409194
mongodb	bson
i m seemingly unable to deserialize my mongodb json document with the bson json_util

8409197
mouseup	mousedown
i have a simple 3d model and you are a first person player on it you move your mouseup to look up i.e rotate by the 3d s x-axis and move your mousedown to look down rotate in opposite direction

8409197
mouseup	mousedown
now the problem is when i have turned when i rotate by the x-axis it no longer turns as expected i.e if you turn 180 degrees by moving your mousedown you actually look up and if you move your mouseup you actually look down

8409197
mouseup	mousedown
-so no matter how much little i have turned moving mouseup will look up and moving mousedown will look down

8409202
google-chrome	firefox
this does not happen in google-chrome or firefox

8409227

only one multiplication is required per character encoded and only one division is required per character decoded

8409288
post	get
in the past i have found some timing issues where facebook did not update the cookie with a new access token signed request in a timely fashion which is why i get it in javascript and post it to the server

so that you can move your from and to pointers freely across the range line and to show overlay period create another two sliders and hide and show them dynamically based on from and to selection

8409441
folder	directory
other files such as the main.rb that is supposed to put into root directory stay with the config.ru in the same folder if the code of main.rb as your given

freebsd	linux
the backend should run on anything that supports python and twisted it has been tested on linux freebsd and windows xp and above

8409535
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

8409583
minimum	max
i have two intervals that they take to control the max duration and minimum duration they take to move across the screen

8409583
minimum	max
now the problem is i check to see if the user has reached a certain score if they have then i would like to decrease the max duration and the minimum duration

8409587
nsurl	nsstring
so pretty much what i am doing is attempting to add a nsurl inside of a nsstring to pass to a mfmailcomposecontroller

8409608
put	get
the xml-rpc server is able to get and put files like ftp and

8409613
width	height
i can do this by having the menu div absolutely positioned without setting a width or height

8409613
google-chrome	firefox
in the example in firefox five gets wrapped onto the next line but in google-chrome for mac at least its all shown on one line

8409617
sorting	filtering
if i comment out the setresolver line all my client-side validation works as well as my client-side grid sorting paging filtering etc

8409637
width	margin
if your interface is base on a smaller width than 1900px probably more like a 960 grid you could center your background in in the body tag and center the wrapper width of your content ie 960 px with the margin auto on the left and right

8409668
nsurl	nsstring
nsstring and nsurl are both classes

8409668
nsurl	nsstring
nsstring objects do not know how to hold an nsurl object

8409686
post	get
when you look up the post if option1 is set then get text1 value if option6 is set get text6

i know that when cookies get sent from server to browser with a server language setting them it happens through http or ssl or https

8409738
des	aes
it looks like rc5 rot13 des aes in some way shape or form to me but i can t tell

8409801
width	height
but the images would need to be resized to 320px in width and the height would stay the same

8409813
min	max
try using min max widths percentages or a combination of the two if you don t want to commit to pixels

8409847
.htaccess	httpd.conf
php_ini_perdir 6 entry can be set in php.ini .htaccess or httpd.conf

8409857
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox but in google-chrome i have to refresh the page to make it works

8409858

8409908
google-chrome	safari
some browsers only gained support as of late google-chrome 12 ios4 safari 5.

8409929
hash	md5
if i where to have a more complex algorithm such as doing md5 of the last 3 bytes then it will be of order n 3 that is because as i iterate through file b i will have to have an inner for-loop that will compute the hash of the last three bytes

8409929
addition	multiplication
note that it is possible to do the same thing with multiplication instead of addition

8409929
addition	multiplication
maybe i can combine multiplication and addition and subtraction.

i have no idea why the structure of traceroute output is like this packets come from internal network of isp right to the destination loop at the destination address - it just should not be like this

8410130
hide	show
just don t use js to show hide the buttons

8410141
telerik	radcombobox
we use telerik rad controls so this is for a radcombobox but since that control just extends dropdownlist i think they may have extended textbox... the syntax for adding an empty item should be similar to what i have below

8410149
public	protected
because the access modifier public private internal protected is what you use to define variables and methods within a class

8410158
getter	setter
in addition the directive synthesizes a getter for n1 in a and a getter setter pair in b

8410158
getter	setter
at this point a s _n1 in b becomes orphaned neither the getter of n1 nor its setter reference it

8410199

the program can find 38 backends mp3 and wmv are among them

8410267
inherited	subclassing
i promise it ll be there at runtime. in the subclassing you will use dynamic to let the compiler know that it s ok to inherited n1

8410267
superclass	subclassing
imo subclassing shouldn t go messing with their superclass s ivars so i approve of the fact that synthesized ivars are marked private

8410267
superclass	subclassing
now some people think it s fine for subclassing to mess with their superclass s ivars

8410279
range	max
if i normalize it to get the range 0.0 to 1.0 by dividing by the max value from the image do i lose information

8410293

is there anyway to show and hide the span just as the end of the text without shifting and recentering all of the info

8410301
for-loop	arrays
you need to iterate over your arrays with a for-loop for example and print each value separately

xslt	xquery
not only as general interest but because in the coming xpath 3.0 xslt 3.0 and xquery 3.0 functions are first-class-citizens higher order functions and functions like fold-left fold-right and map are standard in xpath 3.0

8411847
integer	unsigned
the ideal option is probably to store it as 128-bit unsigned integer which makes them as unique as uuids and won t be as large as strings

8411847

the likely case is that the developer created a uiviewcontroller or uiview and added it as a subviews to the scrollview s content area and set it s position accordingly so it sits in the 6th position

8412697

try not to confuse yourself too much and just realize that the uiscrollview is just a very large view that doesn t fit in the viewport you can add whatever subviews you want to that view just like you normally would on any other uiview that is entirely visible

according to these specifications it is a normal screens mdpi

8413185
screens	mdpi
however as its screens is set in the landscape mode wide mobile screens android does not recognize it as normal mdpi but as something else and then it tries to pull xml layout from layout dir

for a step-by-step of how map reduce works please see the extras section of the mongodb cookbook recipe titled finding max and min values with versioned documents this should provide a better understanding of how map reduce works and why the output must be in the format _id some_id value some_value

from this in the calling code i can then get the actual instance put it in a map for later retrieval and use as normal

i did a test of displaying multiples of the same icons and zoom it it works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie

in this case using ipython s tab-completion to search the gtk gdk and gobject namespaces was invaluable

8420159

this seems kind of hacky and not the right way to do it but hey it works in ie8 9 and the latest versions of google-chrome and firefox that i tested

8420166

break will cause the for-loop to break while continue will cause the code in loops to be read from top to bottom with i incremented by 1 in this case

8420249
disk	ram
however if your documents and or time spans are large it might still be better to add the compound index loading a lot of large documents from disk since your ram is already full will take some time

if you just want to compare 2 heatmap side by side on the screen then rather than combine them into one single plot you can open 2 plotting devices and arrange them side by side to compare much simpler than creating a single graph

8420394
plot	heatmap
if you need them in one file you can still save the 2 heatmap or other plot as 2 files then use tools such as imagemagick gimp or inkscape to combine the 2 files into 1 with the graphs side by side

8420410
rss	feed
whereas the tutorial from ibm s developerworks used an rss feed and localname worked perfectly for him

8420458
pop-up	dialog
in this case a status code of 403 makes a lot of sense and is homologous to the 401 case with the caveat that the browser won t pop-up a dialog asking the user to authenticate -- the form is in the page itself

8420458
pop-up	dialog
there s the un-stylable cryptic pop-up dialog lack of an elegant solution for logging out etc

8420479

measure the browser page load time first the browser makes lots of requests ab is only telling you about one of them and usually your main page request is not the issue get page load baseline numbers from tools like www.webpagetest.org or www.gtmetrix.com for the public facing pages or browser tools yslow pagespeed or dynatrace for the private pages

8420679

8423305
portrait	landscape
considering it works when in portrait and not landscape it probably has to do with a table being taller than one page

8423306
children	parent
the objects themselves keep a parent relationship and have a hashset children collection that s lazy loaded

8423306
children	parent
this allows you to easily get the collection of parent or children for any object at any level of the tree

8423311
versioning	upgrade
in that case you ll have to convert the repo to the older versioning or upgrade your client to the server versioning in order to fix the issue

8423374
button	checkbox
i have 2 date pickers that contain checkbox within the button pane

8423375

8423380
min	max
use between 3 to generate all numbers from min to max

8423400
int	double
for example the user can add element of int type element of double type and element of date type into container at the very beginning

8423417
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
one of the examples i have encountered uses an input element of type range and an output element this example currently only works in google-chrome safari and opera

8423521
maven	pom.xml
i need to search for all pom.xml files at maven repository

8423539
int	chars
the other is that this oo perspective should have timeval or any other class struct on the same footing as int or chars rather than constantly annotated in the code as special

8423576
rspec	capybara
i m using rspec capybara as my test suite

8423587
int	boolean
i think boolean are actually treated as tiny int 0 or 1

8423592
pop-up	dialog
using such an approach a routine which accepted a structure by reference and was supposed to pop-up a modal dialog and fill in the structure from it could create a pass that to the form and then copy the data from that holder back to the passed-in reference

8423600
cassini	iis
some prefer cassini over iis or want certain projects to be hosted

8423610
int	boolean
in mysql boolean is just an int 0 or 1

8423610
int	boolean
most do not implement boolean in a way that is compatible with int arithmetic so the above query would and should per ansi sql generate an error

8423668
freebsd	linux	init.d	pid
really this wrapper should take care of locking to avoid launching abc.sh multiple times and should maintain its own pid file so it can be killed by a handler in etc init.d linux or usr local etc rc.d freebsd

8423670
superclass	subclassing
proper way to do abstract ui binder classes is to define a superclass that will contain logic that is common to all subclassing widgets

8423730
google-chrome	firefox
it work s fine for me on ie9 firefox and google-chrome as well

8423732
domcontentloaded	onload
an alternative is to use domcontentloaded as opposed to onload as the latter waits for all the images to load

8423736
dbcontext	objectcontext
entityobject derived types are not supported by the dbcontext api to use these entity types you must use the objectcontext api

8423761
illegalstateexception	illegalargumentexception
as a careful programmer will often throw an exception for a special occurrence it worth mentioning some general purpose exceptions like illegalargumentexception and illegalstateexception and unsupportedoperationexception

8423800
mousemove	mouseenter
i want to trigger the mouseenter hover mousemove anything which can bring the popup from code without any manual action

8423803
google-chrome	firefox
i was tasked by my company to research a solution for this that could function in ie7+ firefox and google-chrome

8423803
width	height
for the most part in order to gain the fixed header you need to implement fixed height width columns because most solutions involve using two separate tables one for the header which will float and stay in place over the second table that contains the data

8423860
children	parent
in this case you can put your linearlayouts into a relativelayout then add the other two layouts accordingly as children of the parent relativelayout

8423882
getter	setter
it seems like all the hibernate documentation glosses over where exactly the getter and setter should go

8423920
min	max
i think your problem boils down to this given n and k find numbers r1 r2 ... rk such that and max r1 r2 ... rk - min r1 r2 ... rk is as small as possible

8423934
post	get
i need to get multiple post in wordpress by id

8424026
int	double
a double variable can hold larger values than an int and is able to store an approximation of the value 4000000000

8424044
g++	gcc
the problem is that you re compiling hug.yy.c with g++ treating it as c++ instead of gcc

8424074
profiling	debugging	cvs	svn
out-of-the-box team collaboration git github svn cvs integrated php and javascript debugging profiling code inspection quick fix test generation reporting and others

word-wrap is supported in ie 5.5+ firefox 3.5+ and webkit browsers such as google-chrome and safari

8424143
put	get
you can get this same dialog box if you put the following somewhere in your code

8424148
hash	salt
also you normally don t want to use a rather short password directly as a key but instead use a longer passphrase and hash it with a salt included with in the message to derive the key

8424148
pbkdf2	hash
to avoid brute-forcing your password from the encrypted file use a slow hash function here pbkdf2 or bcrypt

8424157
int	chars
and quickly on right...right column int gives you the chars from the right of the string i used a 4 so it ll take the 4 right chars of the column specified

8424208

postgresql	mysql
one issue that has me stumped is to convert the mysql set data type to postgresql

8424326
hash	md5
i m trying to have 3 matches of md5 hash on this string

8424339
hash	salt
you could of course also store it using a salt hash and iteration count instead if access to the full text of the password is not required

8424340
ontouch	ondraw
if the logcat stops outputting from the app and there is no anr i would hazard a guess that the problem is that the ondraw function is failing to be called and so the canvas isn t being redrawn and ontouch isn t being called when you touch the screen

8424372
put	get
i tried to put a timeout before the function to allow time to get info

8424444
portrait	landscape
i have a web page that works no matter what size the viewport is so it shows up well on ipad in either landscape or portrait mode

8424444
portrait	landscape
however when you rotate from landscape to portrait the ipad zooms in and when you rotate back it doesn t zoom back out again

8424449
folder	directory
we always put our log files in a temp directory or a special folder such as appdata

8424452
gtk	cairo
left osd from gnome-settings-daemon coded in c with cairo and gtk

8424452
pygtk	pycairo
right i coded this one in python with pycairo and pygtk

8424478
unsigned	short
moreover the caveat is that this fails if i change size_t to say short unsigned i guess the compiler pads the class

8424509
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
for example a jpg image will have the string jfif at offset 6 png files have png at offset 1 gif files have either gif89 or gif87 at offset 0 bmp files have bm at offset 0 and so forth

8424548
reentrantlock	reentrantreadwritelock
i implemented a reentrantreadwritelock and saw a great speedup i knew there was some lock contention in one my class and using a reentrantlock did help speed things up

8424623
children	parent
in this instance the children although contained by the parent will not be aligned with it as they aren t in the same positioning hierarchy

8424628
ssl	https
it is important as ssl part of https works way before mod_rewrite will have a chance to do anything it only kicks in when secure connection is already properly established

8424644
google-chrome	firefox
once i got it working in firefox having verified that the server-side configuration was correct applying it to ie and google-chrome was a cinch

8424697

i created an rss feed page with php and tried to run it through through a javascript rss reader code

8424733
highcharts	fusioncharts
i m referring to libraries like highcharts fusioncharts all of which have great chart rendering engines

8424756

you can get finer control using letter-spacing line-height and font-size css classes

8424760
codeigniter	cakephp
if you are using any of the major php frameworks cakephp codeigniter symfony etc. then you are using mvc already

8424760
client-side	server-side
larger web apps being built today are moving towards using an mvc framework for both client-side and server-side application code

8424864
google-chrome	firefox
if you have control over the browser of the user you could use greasemonkey s cross-domain ajax to get the contents of the iframe assuming firefox google-chrome

8424897
width	height
this way you ll have your play button always centered as you are absolute positioning it s top left corner in the exact half of the parent and then adjusting its position by defining negative margins by subtracting half the width and height of the button in order to correct it s position

8424908
portrait	landscape
it loads correctly in portrait mode but in landscape mode it shows class cast exception

8424952
textview	simplecursoradapter
if you read the doc for simplecursoradapter the constructor which by the way is deprecated gets as 5th parameter the ids of textview from the doc

8424961
children	parent
it may also because that what i terminated is only the parent main process but not the children process

8424961
terminate	timeout
the python program i want to call may hang for very long time so i want to check timeout and terminate it

i get a form post and on the button pressed submitted there is a value primary key of the item in the database artid

8425042
folder	directory
i tried just renaming the folder on the server and the blog page does load but some of the content was missing the main default header image most notably so i m assuming there are other files that need to know the directory name as well

8425058
int	double
the exception is if you declare an array of primitives such as int double and so on and then you get zeros instead

8425081
hide	show
i have a button that allows users to show hide the navigation pane

8425082
post	get
edit any trick to send certificate name from post or get

8425089
paramiko	pexpect
i am trying to avoid paramiko and am using pexpect to log into the ssh server so a method using pexpect would be ideal

8425110
carrierwave	paperclip
carrierwave is a newer gem than paperclip and it looks a lot more flexible

8425116
daemons	launchd
i m trying to build a python daemons that launchd other fully independent processes

8425116
children	parent
the child processes also need to be fully independent so that if the parent process dies the children won t be killed

8425116
daemons	launchd
the original parent process can t exit because we need the launchd daemons to persist indefinitely

8425116
children	parent
after 650 spawns not concurrently the children have finished the parent process chokes with the error

8425135
filtering	grouping
i removed the where clause on inner query and instead added a grouping by dateadd dd datediff dd 0 t.ticketstart 0 so i could expose date for filtering in my outer query

8425137
put	get
after your feedback i put together this jquery which i have no idea if it works or not but should get you started

8425155
int	chars
in my program the first struct has a unsigned int and the second struct has chars array of 81 elements

8425155
int	chars
the larger scale model based on this program idea will have two unions consisting of many structs as members as each struct will have many members of various data types short int chars arrays and etc which will be passed as a argument to a function

8425160
children	parent
find the parent and then its children

8425173
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
here is my mod_mono.conf file on mac os x 10.7.2 and linux ubuntu 11.04 this should be compatible with your debian distro

8425179
mouse	keyboard
what i am trying to do is to allow user to copy certain field by using ether right click mouse or keyboard shortcut

8425198
post	get
for example i was to get the related post record for a specific comment records

8425199
std	ostream
going deeper a std ostream uses the locale facet put function to print an integer Ã¢ 27.7.3.6.2 ostream.inserters.arithmetic 1 and its implementation locale facet do_put

8425199
libstdc++	libc++
so far we see that showpos and showbase are not exclusive in c++ and the actual formatting behavior is defined by printf though the implementation doesn t need to use printf libc++ uses sprintf while libstdc++ does not which we have to check the c standard

8425249
carrierwave	fog
does anyone know how to specify image expiration headers for images uploaded using carrierwave to aws through fog

8425272
int	double
it sounds like your field type is not actually a double but an int

8425272
int	double
your query tries to implicitly unbox an int as a double causing the cast error

8425275
post	get
you can try to get your first blog and use the blog id to filter post like that

8425283
pull	push
you always pull new commits from the upstream and you ll push new commits + your fixes to the origin

8425302
for-loop	arrays
2d arrays cannot be set at the row level - because they are not managed using row level pointers --- in order to set an 2d arrays row you have to explicitly set and define the row and column for each column in the row in a proper for-loop

8425315
mouse	keyboard
i have tried the macro recorder does not provide any hints as the macro is blank after attempting to record the actions this is using either the mouse or keyboard

8425373
next	except
but when i push it on github again all work fine except i don t know how to download it on my laptop again to continue working in the next day

8425376
next	except
this is what i have and it does everything except it does not seperate each piece of data to the new next line in the text based email body... echo and print_r return to the screen of which i don t desire and foreach loops all the way through that by the time i try to pass the variable to the mail program it just displays the last question in the array that assigned to

8425393
put	get	pull	push
to put it on github from any computer use push to get it from github to any computer use pull

8425418
stdout	stderr
each new process probably creates three new pipes in the parent for the child s stdin stdout and stderr descriptors.

8425418
children	parent
your second children are being properly handled by init 8 -- their parent is dead so they are re-parented to init 8 and init 8 will clean up after them wait 2 when they die

8425446
put	get
to do this we can subclass and override the get put and other applicable methods from relevant java collection classes

8425475
jruby	mri
one final note i fear this is a jruby or warbler problem because we cannot reproduce this problem if we switch from jruby to mri ruby 1.9

8425512
rss	feed
i m trying to learn how to do rss feed and i m trying to make the xslt and css parts

8425512

i know the basic structure for an rss feed looks something like this minus actual data

8425537
gmail	hotmail
what is it and why do gmail hotmail et al care about it

8425556
post	get
i ve seen some post but unable to get right information

8425576
client-side	server-side
right now your onclick will be handled client-side and it needs a way to invoke your runtime calls on the server-side

8425577
uitableview	nsindexpath
now i want to use - void tableview uitableview tv didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath method to goto the record detail view i want to select from table with the record id

8425647
ciimage	uiimage
convert image uiimage to ciimage

8425676
for-loop	loops
is there any way to change the value of loops counter from within a for-loop

8425687
for-loop	loops
you could use a while loops instead of a for-loop

8425724
calloc	malloc
if you would like to increase the chance that memory can be returned to the os try allocating your entire array with a single malloc or calloc call and dividing it up into all the sub-arrays yourself - large single allocations often get special handling that as a side effect makes them easy to return to the os

8425724
boost	allocator
i would recommend just using a library that does this kind of contiguous multidimensional array allocator and lookup for you such as the boost multidimensional array library

8425751
int	chars
istream get returns the chars as an int so you simply need to append the returned chars as the next chars of the string

8425755
post	get
i am building the solution with get and post requests using ajax xhr requests

8425763
svm	kernlab
i ve created an svm in r using the kernlab package however it s running incredibly slow 20 000 predictions takes 45 seconds on win64 r distribution

8425817
firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox ie7-9 and safari

8425832
mxmlc	compc
the flex compiler shell fcsh compiles code faster than mxmlc and compc by keeping all the partial build objects in memory

8425833
mxmlc	compc
it works similarly to mxmlc and compc but compiles faster

8425834
post	get
it is vulnerable to an sql injection attack which has nothing to do with ajax post or get

8425859
post	get
i don t know if i should post my entire code here because i obviously don t want someone else taking my course to just get handed the bulk of code so i don t know what i should post to make you guys understand my issue

8425860
margin	height
give all three divs equal widths apply a height to each div to match its corresponding image segment and set each div s margin to 0px auto

8425860
width	height
then to position this div in the middle of the page position it absolutely give it and set your body element to to have a min-width and min-height greater or equal to the width and height of the big div

8425916
getter	setter
in the domain model i have a ball class a simple class with getter and setter and i have a basket class

8425955
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in firefox i don t get any javascript errors but for some reason nothing happens in google-chrome

8425983
stdout	stderr
if the latter then you can write something which captures stdout stderr and sends the result back as in

8425984
postgresql	mysql
ideally i would like to migrate everything to postgresql but converting from mysql to postgresql is a massive ball of hurt i ve already wasted close to a week struggling with it

8425984
postgresql	mysql
now i am thinking if only i could maintain only the spatial portion in postgresql do the spatial queries in postgresql then use those row ids to query non-spatial data from mysql

8425984
postgresql	mysql
my question is thus -- can i create a single database handle that actually allows querying by joining a table from postgresql with a table from mysql assuming they have a common id column

8426004
ant	maven
i am completely new to maven and come from an ant world

8426059
pop-up	dialog
i followed the tutorial as stated and has been successfully get the pop-up dialog box shows after selected friends that i want to invite i clicked send then the window closed

8426130
post	get
but my concern is that this would drop any post or get data

8426159
children	parent
i almost have this working except i cannot seem to remove the arrow icon when a parent no longer has children

8426159
children	parent
to create the arrow icon i add the class arrowopen to any parent that has children and use the jquery ui change event to remove all instances of the class and then re-apply the class each time the list is sorted or changed

8426183
children	parent
the best you can do is determine a way to limit selection only to these p elements with the same parent and then select the p children that are not .green_guys

8426183
children	parent
this will not match anything if none of the children of the parent element have the class

8426211
jobs	cron
usually cron jobs aren t run from the same directory where your php lives so it s possible that it is running but the output file is being created elsewhere

8426246
turing	decidable
time decidable languages or turing recognizable

8426264
gridview	detailsview
however instead of going this route i would rather design a user control that would probably show edit ui by capturing gridview edit event - for example you may use gridview and detailsview together

8426296
width	height
this custom control only works in a fixed height width

8426296
width	height
i try to specify the width height for this custom control the windowsformhost but since wpf size is resolution-independent the control got scaled and ruined the position

8426301
post	get
i presume to save and check for the post at regular intervals i ll need to use cron but i should be able to get that myself if i can figure out howto work with the api

8426307
width	height
such as width height border color etc

8426323
persistent	transient
at the end of the request my persistent manager is closed and - as far as i can tell the cached object becomes transient i might be wrong about this and hangs out in the cache

8426392
stdout	stderr
running the same command on my laptop i get nohup ignoring input and redirecting stderr to stdout

8426392
stdout	stderr
fortunately however i can resolve this issue on my laptop by simply redirecting stderr and stdout to a file

8426392
stdout	stderr
now when i run this one-liner on my laptop i get nohup ignoring input and redirecting stderr to stdout

8426392
stdout	stderr
but when i modify the line to redirect stderr and stdout

8426392
stdout	stderr
i still get the message nohup ignoring input and redirecting stderr to stdout

8426399
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the unchecked-exception classes are the class runtimeexception and its subclasses and the class error and its subclasses

8426399
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the reason for this is runtimeexception which is an unchecked-exception subclass of exception

8426408
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
runtimeexception error and their subclasses are unchecked-exception

8426409
dictionary	map
why don t you use a hash map to store the dictionary words

8426451
urllib	httplib
if you want speed you could replace the call using pycurl which is also a c-extension whereas urllib is a python module written on top of httplib

8426464
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works in safari google-chrome and ie but not firefox

8426497
stdout	stderr
very often error messages should be reported on stderr using fprintf rather than stdout

8426541
fadein	fadeout
i have an event listener which performs fadein and fadeout on some images when the user clicks on the li

8426541
fadein	fadeout
now on the load i need dynamic stuff excluding fadein fadeout effect as well user click on the li the animation has to work

8426541
fadein	fadeout
i am getting the fadein fadeout effect on load.

8426542
post	put	post	get	put	get
you can only have one verb post get put ... when doing an http request

8426556

8426572
rss	feed
i am trying to validate the format of an rss feed i m making

8426639
versioning	upgrade
if you have a module then create an upgrade versioning of your sql file and put in this code

8426716
strncmp	strcmp
both strcmp and strncmp provide the guarantee that the result will include

8426728
strncmp	strcmp
clearly strcmp always returns 1 or -1 for nonequal characters while strncmp returns the difference between the nonequal characters

8426766
winston	forever

one suggested to copy the .pdb in asp.net temporary files and even if there there are lot of directory with subdirs one for each dll i copied all pdb in temp folder with the dll

8435965
folder	directory
in order to make sure that you are always using a specific known version create an assemblies folder relative to your project directory copy the dll to that directory and add a reference to the dll in the assemblies directory rather than one in gac or elsewhere on your machine

8435967
mouse	keyboard	allegro	sdl	irrlicht	ogre3d
graphic-application frameworks such as sdl allegro irrlicht or ogre3d come with full keyboard and mouse handling too

8436026
min	max
to avoid this initialize min and max after you have the user input the numbers that way the max and min are not defaulted to 0

2 how would i go about implementing operator new in this case where it receives arguments for the object s constructor and it returns null in case width height are 0

8436075

this fails as the checkbox and redio button derive from the same class so how would i check if the control is a checkbox or a radio button

8436184
min	max
since you say the digits are a min of 4 and a max of 5 here m 4 n 5

8436224

in this case only a get is allowed on the file content and file metadata and to update either one a new file has to be put

8436227
maya	blender
i use blender for cutscenes for personal projects since it s free at my work place we use maya and 3ds max but the idea is the same

8436252

the best way to hide the window is to not show it in the first place

8436305

sorting	filtering
i need it to have multi-column sorting predicate filtering and a priority on performance

8436348
hash	md5
it s been a while since i messed with oauth but i think you just need to include a randomly-generated string i think i used the system clock time concatenated onto the requested username and md5 hash the result as the nonce for each request you make

8436363
x86	64bit
if i do happen to set my target to x86 because i have a 32bit 3rd party dll is my application actually considered to be running in 64bit if on a 64bit system just under wow64

8436508
portrait	landscape
it displays the portrait perfect but in landscape it is too small

8436512

however annotating the scala val with scala.reflect.beanproperty will produce java-style getter and setter methods

8436513
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the application works perfecty in firefox google-chrome opera and ie9

8436566

memory addresses just start from zero to its max range

8436587
calloc	malloc
sbrk in linux virtualalloc in windows but you will be accessing them usually through c s malloc or calloc

8436589
folder	directory
because you say the default directory for files is your documents folder i m assuming you are using the second method because idle.app sets documents as its current working directory which becomes the default directory for open s and save s and is automatically added as the first directory on python s sys.path the list of directory that python uses to search for modules when import ing

8436602
int	chars
limit - optional int to limit the max chars

8436623

8436636
google-chrome	safari
this works for me in google-chrome v16b and safari v5.1 on windows

8436636
google-chrome	safari
again verified to work in google-chrome and safari

8436642
set	bag
since you stated in your comments that the array is a result of a db query you can simply include the bag value in your result set by adding select bag as type to your sql statement

8436649
versioning	upgrade
the end goal for me is to upgrade from 2.2.2 that i have no to the latest versioning

8436666
ssl	https
i have enabled the ssl piggyback -option and can connect to it via https

8436799

example 1 if i select a parent range of 1 10 and child ranges of 1 2 and 2 10 i would have a gap of 0 meaning the range in the parent range has been completely filled by it s children

8436814
put	get

8436855
post	get
as you get stuck feel free to post more questions

8436868
post	get
can i just assume if i need to do a http post to a url to get back a string of data json or otherwise that it is a restful api

8436875
post	get
when you submit a page your browser will just perform a get or post request to the page listed under the action attribute of the form unless there is javascript going on

8436875
post	get
you can just write a php script that will successively make get or post requests to the action url with the email as data

8436903
children	parent
example parent 1-10 children 1 2 5 8 gap 3 4 9 10 because of this i would just suggest you write a thing which can subtract one range from another then apply it to the parent for each child

8436917
hide	fadeout
when i was doing fadeout tests for another question it seemed to hide and collapse the element

8436934
macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew	fink	macports
i would use homebrew macports fink or a manual installation

8436941
hide	show
what s left is you ll have to add stying for .morereleases so that it show using display block or something when .backcat is hidden and hide display none when .backcat is show

8436963
prepare	execute
the problem is that the prepare sql statement is not binding in values parameters or even passing them through the execute function

8436963
bindparam	bindvalue
as i said i have tried bindparam bindvalue and this method all without result

8436987
subtract	add
finally subtract the second number of the last range from the second number of the parent range add to running total

8437051
client-side	server-side
i wouldn t have thought so as php is server-side and xmlhttprequests are client-side

8437054
submit	submission
alex is right your submit button is submission the form

8437056
fflush	gets
call fclose fp or fflush fp to make sure content of file buffer gets fflush to the file

8437087
public	protected
for example with this you can list all public and protected properties

8437087
inherited	properties
you can use reflectionclass getparentclass to get the parent class and then compare the properties of your class with the properties of the parent class to see what was inherited

8437089
piston	tastypie
having implemented api s with piston tastypie and django webmachine django tastypie rocks

8437089
piston	tastypie
so that leaves piston which is picking up some activity and tastypie that has a lot of momentum and activity

8437089
piston	tastypie
piston is a bit more flexible but tastypie is moving very fast and in my opinion has a really easy api

8437095
inherited	properties
it appears you ll have to look at all the parents manually to get the inherited properties

8437137
terminate	timeout
the call itself must terminate at some time implementing its own timeout but blocking calls are usually trouble gethostbyname because then it s up to their or system timeout not yours

8437149
post	get
my problem is that i don t know how to get the system call parameters from the data that i have in the post handler the struct pt_regs

8437190
config	ini
below is a c# example piece of code that describes how to access the config data from the ini file from the file above

8437194
hide	show
instead of removing fragments when i add new ones i just hide them then show them when i want to display them again

8437199
post	get
if it was restful you d also have extensive use of http get for doing reading of things with content negotiation to determine the format Ã¢ the representation Ã¢ to deliver the values as proper use of http verbs for the true meaning not everything is a post

8437271
put	get
i quickly put this together but if you can combine the two queries you will get exactly what you were looking for

8437322
post	put
i struggled with this as well so put together the following blog post when i finally got it working

8437338
int	double
i have an abstract base class dataobject which just provides type information currently double int bool and is inherited by the specific data containers like

8437373
post	put	post	get	put	get
i put together a blog post outlining the steps i took to get diagnostics working with sdk 1.6

8437467
freebsd	debian	freebsd	opensuse	opensuse	debian	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	freebsd	postgresql	mysql	redhat	fedora	slackware	suse
i can use debian fedora freebsd mandrake opensuse redhat slackware suse or ubuntu with firebird mysql or postgresql

8437474
width	height
what i want to do is use javascript or jquery to detect the height of the images in the slideshow which changes depending on the width of the browser and then set the header s height to that value thus eliminating my crappy css bandaids that aren t really working in the way i need them to

8437485
width	height
one option is to make derive from a non-generic interface idrawing that has height and width properties then change your actions to be of type

8437496
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you need to do what you do in viewdidload in viewwillappear

8437497
min	max
the idea is that any number less than min or more than max is removed

8437529

in chrome 15 when using the element as a text field leading zeros 011 are removed even if the number entered does not break the validation rules min max

8437530

8437655
rubygems	bundler
since i am not using a bundler i had to add require rubygems at the beginning of my list of requires

8437667
zoo	xts
for this type of data you d be better off using the packages xts extensible time series or zoo z s ordered observations - where z is the initial of one of the package authors

8437671
children	parent
then a call to save in the controller runs saves on the parent object and all of its associated children

8437755
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
within this lone record the return value of count will always be a non-null integer while the return values of the other aggregate-functions such as min max and sum may be null

8437755
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
so whether you re calling count min max or sum it is important to understand not only the return values of individual aggregate-functions but also the return value of the query itself and what that result set contains

8437767
int	double
things get hairier when you start allowing int + double though

8437833

8437872
fadein	fadeout
it also comes with extras like fadein and fadeout effects

8437913
calloc	malloc
the code as edited is essentially correct though i have several stylistic differences with you such as not doing a typedef to hide the pointerness of an object not using the size of the allocated object in the malloc calloc call and a few other things

8437925
hide	show
this will hide the status bar until the user clicks along the lower edge of the screen in which case the status bar will get show it ll get hidden again after a few seconds

8437930
rss	feed

8437947
int	double
i am not sure i got your problem right but if you have m parametric types ... and n simple types int double ... you would need m n actual implementations if you want to support all combinations

8437959
int	double
zeros work in this case because they re convertible to each of the numeric formats int double float etc

8438081
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
then in the uitableview i am handling the gestures through touchesbegan touchesmoved etc

8438112
post	get

uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
so to start off each tab i assume you re talking about a uitabbarcontroller will have it s own uinavigationcontroller- uiviewcontroller

8438807
screens	tablet
for tablet sized screens you tend to end up with one or some small number of activities and more fragments and you swap out part of the ui with different fragments

8438807
screens	tablet
traditionally you d use a different activity for each screens but does that still make sense seems annoying and tedious to have if tablet swapfragments else startactivity logic everywhere

8438807
screens	tablet
so for people build apps that support phone tablet sized screens what are you doing few activities mostly fragments everywhere or still mostly activities for the phone sized screens

8438816

8439436
width	height
resize the width and height of this window to see what the media queries are doing

8439618
postgresql	mysql
a postgresql schema is like a mysql database in that you can query across different schema but they re isolated by default

8439657
width	height
my initial workaround was to loop through each row and grab the row height from the worksheet i am copying from then loop through and insert those values for the row height in the worksheet i am pasting to but the problem with this approach is that the sheet contains buttons which generate new rows which changes the row numbering and the format of the sheet is such that all rows cannot just be one width

8439666
postgresql	mysql
for example in both mysql and postgresql it looks like

8439672

these are negotiated between peers but i expect the weakest allowed would be md5 which provides for a 128 bit cryptographic hash of the data

8439758
qt-creator	codelite
some other ides like code blocks and codelite provide some facilities for qt but not to the level of qt-creator

8439787

8439891
post	get
normally you need to use a specific http get post variable to start remote debugging see remote debugging

8439891

8440540
free	malloc
i have never seen that before i don t usually use c libraries and i don t know how common that scenario is it s just a contrived situation that i can think of where using malloc would not be optional because it s undefined behaviour to call free on a piece of memory created by new

8440569
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+	hfs+	ntfs
although i assume you re using some typical linux filesystems format which doesn t enforce any filename encoding some filesystems formats like ntfs or hfs+ store filenames in a known encoding and the apis have to handle that

you would then write your request to the server into the outputstream and read from the inputstream returned from getinputstream if you expected a response

8441265
integer	unsigned
most of the time unsigned integer types have the semantic of modular integers they represent equivalence classes

8441265

according to this msdn article - only the following properties are inherited in the visual tree in silverlight fontfamily fontsize fontstretch fontstyle fontweight and foreground

8441365
inherited	properties
normally - dependency properties are not inherited in silverlight they often are in wpf

8441365
inherited	properties
this is likely why these are not mentioned in the silverlight msdn article on dependency properties value precedence but the wpf version of the article mentions inherited value as lower priority than the local value or style setters

8441365
inherited	properties
background dependency properties unfortunately is not inherited so your background will remain as is

8442718
jar	war
if the reason you are trying to convert a jar to a war is only because you want to be able to see the source code of the classes in the jar then trying to convert it to a war is not the right thing to do

8442718
jar	war
a war web archive is the same as a jar file but with a certain prescribed directory structure that makes it suitable for deployment on a java ee application server

8442718
jar	war
converting a jar file to a war file will not automatically make it possible to see the source code of the classes in eclipse

mouse	keyboard
the disabled option stops the being selected with both mouse and keyboard whereas just using display none allows the user to still select via the keyboard arrows

8442831
required	placeholder
note using an empty value attribute on the placeholder option allows validation required attribute to work around having the placeholder so if the option isn t changed but is required

8442831
required	placeholder
when the select element is required it allows use of the invalid css pseudo-class which allows you to style the select element when in it s placeholder state

because httpwebrequest and webclient don t render pages so i can t redirect to the page i want i need to use a webbrowser

8444797

where you have to decide whether you allow nulls for these columns then you need to use coalesce or nvl or whatever function your database provides for dealing with comparisons with nulls or set boundary values for these columns where you can be sure age will always fall in between

8444815
int	chars
chars in the chars array buf and return in the int

if you upgrade to the current versioning 1.7.1 i think you will find this error message no longer exists

8445363
subnet	packets
maybe you can send a udp packets with some hello request to all ips in your subnet and when the server receives it he responses with an ack paket

8445388
maven	pom.xml
btw intellij has built in support for maven so just open pom.xml from it - and everything will be ok

8445405
width	height
i already tried to use joe blow s code but it really works for objects that have the same width and height

8445432
width	height
the reason i think for that is because i am recreating datagridview after each resize to have cells stay the same width height and fill all the space

8445447
hex	binary
in python how to convert a hex ascii string to binary string

8445494
folder	directory
the more efficient way i found in dealing with millions of folder and files is to capture directory listing through dos command in some file and parse it

getter	setter
there is precious little advantage to hide this behind getter and setter

8445729
getter	setter
and more to the point if one has a data attribute that has a public setter method and a public getter method and the methods do nothing other than actually set get the attribute what s the point of keeping it private

8445748
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a gridview that shows information from a sqldatasource

8445789
int	chars
the console.read method returns only a single chars wrapped in an int so that is only applicable if you are reading a number that is only one digit long otherwise you ll always get only the first digit

8445789
int	chars
since the return value of read is actually a chars you cannot use it directly as an int you would need to parse it from chars to int

8445822
for-loop	loops
the natural approach for the first requirement is to use a dict so i can loops over keys values or items with a for-loop but for the second requirement it seems more appropriate to use a class hierarchy and let the attribute lookup mechanism to do the work plus i get other goodies like being able to use properties for some values

8445866
gson	jackson
you tagged your question with gson but i would recommend you the jackson library instead because i saw your last two questions and seems like gson is not flexible enough for you

8445867

8445929
hash	md5
you could use a hash like sha-1 md5 etc and crop it to the correct size 128 192 or 256 bits or use pbekeyspec instead of secretkeyspec

what s the best way of implementing a specific test for floats double and potentially int that compares values based on a provided number of significant digits

8445952
children	parent
where the properties for the parent and child are called parent and children respectively

8445957

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve got a small problem - i have a html5 video om my site it works fine in firefox google-chrome safari

pow	sqrt
if sqrt is implemented as a special case of pow that will save you a multiplication

8446089
sorting	filtering
provides the general table functionality like - filtering sorting copy paste

8446140
children	parent
the only problem with this approach is that i d need to save the path even for branches that don t have a parent children of root

8446223
children	parent
if you want to move an item relative to its siblings but remain under the same parent you can use treeview_sortchildrencb and pass a custom sort function that orders the children the way you want

8446333
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
2. use css properties which are limited to some browsers firefox use a set safari some others not sure if google-chrome use yet another set

8446341
post	get
some hints and functions to get you started as i won t post my entire script it does not fully do the trick but not far away

8446354
implements	extends
this all works as expected so we set up a class called hangoutmanager that extends a baseadapter we have implements several methods in there such as add remove and exists

8446373
hide	show
show hide

8446389
floor	sqrt
high floor element sqrt |u| floor 3 sqrt 9 floor 1 1

8446395
getter	setter
there are some cases when public makes no difference or having a getter and setter is unnecessary

8446396
width	height
you could in theory always use cgrectintersection ball platform instead and check the width and height of the resulting rect to be 0

8446420
outputstream	inputstream
you should realize that transferring bytes is after all just a matter of reading an arbitrary inputstream and writing it to an arbitratry outputstream

8446439
disk	ram
now how can i check or modify how much ram or disk space the database is going to take for each node

8446456
google-chrome	firefox
works perfectly in firefox not in google-chrome

8446476
google-chrome	safari
use webkit s safari google-chrome inspect element

8446486

jpa 2.0 doesn t provide a general way to do it except for creating separate getter setter for different representations of the same field

8446491
namedtuple	dictionary
also namedtuple have a number of useful methods such as _fields to get the names of the used and an _asdict method which returns an ordered dictionary of the namedtuple contents

8446503
profiler	shark
until os x 10.7 i used the shark profiler to profile my implementation which worked rather nicely

8446503
profiling	instrumentation
apparantly the time profiling in instrumentation doesn t use dtrace anyhow so the only option left is to write our own dtrace script or instrumentation

8446503
profiling	instrumentation
despite what people say online instrumentation does not use dtrace for everything specifically time profiling so i can t offer you a quick fix in the instrumentation ui

8446506
post	get
the post does not get added to the post count for the new category

8446513

8446524
websphere	ibm
the place i works is an ibm shop and tends to bleed blue pretty heavy so i only know of the ibm stack which may help you with websphere but i m sure there are other products and or free open source projects you can use

8446524
websphere	ibm
an example with ibm tooling is the ibm websphere datapower appliance

8446524
websphere	ibm
ibm does not let you generate the tokens if you are not running in the container ie a websphere box

8446645
getter	setter
some other oo languages actionscript3 c# etc support true properties where adding a getter setter does not affect the signature

8446645
getter	setter
in this case if you have a getter or setter it replaces the public property with the same signature so you can easily switch back and forth without breaking code

8446647
clang	llvm
however when compiled with llvm clang i get bar nfoo n

8446656
public	protected
myclass2 needs to derive from myclass1 then it is a more specialised type of myclass1 and can access all public and protected members as if they were defined on it

8446723
move	drag
has anyone seen a bug where you are using the wpf autocompletebox control and while the drop-down is displayed you drag the window and the drop-down stays put while the entire window move and now the drop-down is completely disconnected from the input field

8446764
stdout	stderr
since perl doesn t have a log like php you can create your own log file by redirecting perl s stdout and stderr to a file

8446785
superclass	subclassing
or converts it from superclass qstyleoption to the given subclassing

8446787
super	extends
btw there is no point in calling super at the front of your constructor unless it extends a base class

8446788
onkeydown	onblur
of course in this case we have two tests onblur and onkeydown event

8446806
inherited	properties
each of those segments will have the same custom properties however the values could come from an inherited segment a segment up the tree instead of from the segment itself

8446806
inherited	properties
if a value of a particular properties is inherited from a segment up the tree then its value is set to null

8446821
equals	compareto
as a good practice yes since equals hashcode and compareto has close meanings

8446846
zoo	xts	zoo	chron	xts	chron
somewhere in the conversion from zoo to xts the chron class information gets destroyed

8446846
zoo	xts	zoo	chron	xts	chron
if xts is supposed to handle chron objects when importing from zoo you have probably found a bug in the function xts xts

8446846
zoo	xts
so somehow in the conversion between zoo and xts the conversion code should adjust for the locale of the user

8446857
subtraction	addition
is there a specific reason why it uses subtraction as opposed to addition

8446857
subtraction	addition

8447001
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox 8 and google-chrome but doesn t function as expected in ie9

8447019
pull	push
if you want modify an item inside an array i suggest to use conditional pull first and push updated item then

8447019
pull	push
thus you may need tou use operator on it and then pull push on items array

8447034
public	protected
just to illustrate that i have one private property one protected property and one public property

8447043
int	chars	ord	chr
does io have built in methods that mirror the ord and chr functions in other languages namely being able to take an int and return the ascii chars associated with it or take a string chars and return the ascii number for that chars

8447093
777	tmp
the usr services 001 tmp has 777 permissions so why does it still not work

gif	png
some of the images are gif some are png but it is possible they are of other image types too

8447294
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter
i had a similar case and solved it by splitting up the mouseover event into separate mouseenter and mouseleave events

8447306
viewmodel	caliburn
caliburn micro as an example gives you a way to access your view getview from within your viewmodel then you could get a reference to your grid and call beginedit

8447307
apache	nginx
the second block of messages means that you re running the php interpreter and most likely that is through your web server like apache or nginx as a priviliged user which is in most cases the root user

8447313
getter	setter
because i know that all the dynamic names will at least start with rec_ but then the problem with this is i do not have specific getter setter for each field because i don t know what their full names will be

8447332
pull	push
they have the ability to pull a remote branch which says it is all up to date but they cannot push to that remote branch

8447369

i think the problem comes from calling setcontentview method at the en of oncreate

8447426
postgresql	mysql
on the production server i m using mysql and i m using postgresql locally so i m not sure if that s the cause of the problem

8447468
mouse	keyboard
i understand that windows and linux fill mibs in a completely different way but for istance bot of them seem to completely forget about other devices such as video card or mouse keyboard

8447478
sqoop	hadoop
sqoop does not run with hadoop 0.20.2

8447505
nscoder	nsdata
you can use nscoder like nskeyedarchiver to archive the data then send the resulting nsdata

8447546
implements	extends
so the solution is extends contextloader and implements both spring s applicationcontextaware and the servletcontextlistener interface

8447565
folder	directory
it s in the hooks directory in my application folder

8447568
folder	directory
if by any chance you need to change the language instead of the error statement itself create your own form_validation_lang.php and put it into the proper language folder inside your system language directory

8447570
subtraction	addition
floating-point addition and subtraction are not associative

8447613
implements	extends
i didn t quite understand the problem but you should probably make a class mainfile extends file implements constraints there and require the user to pass a mainfile instance to zipholder factory

8447620
min	max
in sqlite this is the standard use of min max avg group_by etc

8447639
uilabel	nsstring
i m working on an application for ios in which i would like to place the fractional value 1 2 as a single character within an nsstring for use in an uilabel is this possible

8447669
udp	tcp
on client you re using socket.sock_dgram which is udp yet you are using tcp server which would be socket.sock_stream

8447696
stdout	stderr
alternatively you could try redirecting stdout and stderr to a file iirc this will work but i don t have my phone with me to test it

8447767
min	max
personally i d stay with coredata as long as most of the app doesn t use min max avg.

8447790

8447879
put	get
as soon as we put the site back up we get this error again

8447880
implements	modifiers
i would suggest you using abstract property rather than trhowing notimplemented exception in getter abstact modifiers will force all derived classes to implements this property so you ll end up with compile-time safe solution

8447937
addition	multiplication
however when i switch from multiplication to addition it looks much better

8447944
post	get
i d like to override the get and post methods in rspec

8447944
post	get
my next bsest approach is therefore to overrride get and post which are in the correct scope

after reading all those articles i am convinced that getter and setter are evil

8447972
getter	setter
give the above class bond which includes three member variables without using getter and setter how does client get the price name or volume of an bond object

8447972
getter	setter

8448049
folder	directory
the tools directory in the folder where the package is installed

google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome and firefox this works ok

8448218
post	get
i m throwing together some test code now i ll post it if when i get it working seems like a very interesting way to get around any such situation generically

8448219
stringstream	ifstream
either use a stringstream or read token by token from your ifstream

8448249
setinterval	clearinterval
the parameter for the clearinterval is an id created by setinterval and you are putting the function used by setinterval

8448304
maven	pom.xml
that said the definition of central is in the maven super pom.xml that is part of the maven installation

8448308
setinterval	clearinterval
you are trying to stop the blink toggle function while you actually should save the interval in a variable and call clearinterval on that variable as clearinterval expects an instance of the setinterval object as parameter

8448318
children	parent
the parent nodes will wait for the children nodes to pass up data before doing any merging back

8448349
setcontentview	findviewbyid

my jtextfield is on a jtabbedpane

8448370
put	get
let me know if you get stuck and i can put more effort into this

8448414
put	get
the issue is that after putting a few objects into the map and trying to retrieve with the same key used to put on the map i get a null

8448414
equals	compareto
so it seems like the issue lies with the use of compareto and equals

8448414
equals	compareto
i think the algorithm used by the treemap is sorting the map in an inconsistent manner because of the way i m using compareto and equals

8448445
int	double
as i understand check double invokes template instantiation mechanism so int check int function is really created the type of template parameter doesn t have any influence

8448471
hide	show
i m trying to combine a chained drop down list with the ability for the last selection to show hide a div

8448471
hide	show
here s the javascript i m using to show hide a div

8448488
macports	homebrew
should i try to clean up the default perl installation and use homebrew or macports to do a clean install

8448502
width	height
cudamemcpy2d d_ref ref_pitch h_ref width sizeof float width sizeof float height sizeof float cudamemcpyhosttodevice

8448509
equals	compareto
i think your equals hashcode and compareto methods should only use the field that is always populated

8448510
accessor	properties
create and add the custom button label view to the cell s contentview in your init method or create and add it lazily via an accessor properties

8448511
devise	cancan
but i ve set up similar systems using the devise and cancan gems

8448514
mp3	wav
is it possible to change the tempo of a midi or wav mp3 file using fmod

8448585

this is the problem i am running into i post something say a photo upload to the server and get back a 301 because it is time to get a new auth token

8448594
versioning	upgrade
this allows you to make whatever changes you want install whatever modules you want and whatever versioning of perl you want without risking messing up your operating system or having your upgrade blown over in the next os upgrade

8448605
slideup	slidedown
there s no such facility for .slidetoggle so we do this manually using an basic if else clause to choose between a slideup or slidedown

8448621
int	chars
in particular it s worth dumping the exact chars values of the text by casting each chars to int before it goes into the database and after you ve fetched it

8448626
bindparam	bindvalue
use bindvalue not bindparam

8448685
adplus	procdump
tools like adplus and procdump allow you to create a dump for various conditions exception work load etc

8448685
adplus	procdump
for other situations you need to use adplus or procdump

8448705
aptana	rubymine
also i have tried if some ides rubymine aptana and netbeans and no one has a proper graphical interface to profile code

8448749
width	height
you can clearly set a height and width there

8448750
unsigned	short
i need to use void to point to unsigned short values

8448843
put	get
the problem that i have is that if i put the menu and content in different cells of one grid the menu is cropped to within its grid cell so that the drop-down menu is not shown when clicked but if i add a canvas with 2 grids having different z-indexes i can get the menu to display properly overlapping the content but the application does not resize to fit the browser window

8448861
sqoop	hadoop
there is no reason sqoop should only run with cdh and not hadoop

8448861
sqoop	hadoop
the sqoop documentation says sqoop is compatible with hadoop 0.21 and cloudera s distribution of hadoop version 3

8448861
sqoop	hadoop
fyi sqoop was made part of the hadoop 0.21 branch and has been removed from hadoop after moving it to apache incubator

8448874
unsigned	short
then you cast res to an unsigned short

8448915
width	height
for example to open the window with height set to 400px and width set to 300px

8448988
qpainter	qimage
i would start with qimage and qpainter and see if the graphics speed is the limiting step before starting to optomise

8449010
objectcontext	transactionscope
is it possible to open a transactionscope run a load of async task s which operate on an ef4 objectcontext and then commit the result

8449012
unsigned	short
is a cast on a pointer res is a memory address by casting it to an unsigned short you get the address value as an unsigned short instead of hexadecimal value to be sure that you are going to get a correct value you can print

8449012
unsigned	short
the first cast makes a cast on pointer to a pointer on unsigned short

8449013
windows	wow64
part of the windows wow64 layer is to emulate a 32-bit environment as perfectly as possible

8449020
post	get
i have set the form submit to use the post method and even if i use the get method i can see that my form data is being passed

8449028
width	height
there is a media query to fit the web to the width - is there a way to fit the web to the height

8449043
put	get
note in c++ it is very rare to use raw pointers you normally put a pointer into a smart pointer so that it will get correctly deleted

8449075
persistent	transient
the only thing it complicates is editing persistent entities or transient entities with persistent properties you aren t allowed to serialize dirty edited modified objects

8449117
hide	show
use jquery s effects to show hide and animate the text

8449139
hide	show
to show or hide a div when the user selects from dropdownlist 2 you can use the jquery change method

8449156
squash	merge
my argument is that the merge has the same effect as a squash but includes marking the commits that were included

8449156
pull	push
if you rebase from svn push to the remote branch have colleague2 push some commits to the remote branch and then later on colleague1 does a pull merge from remote branch will the resulting merge commit mention the svn commits and therefore cause a problem on subsequent rebases

8449158
post	get
in my mvc app i have an upload view with get and post actions

8449195
width	height
the only problem i am facing is that i cannot update the height and width of these path elements

8449259
google-chrome	firefox
i already have it those pages load ok in firefox and google-chrome

8449259
google-chrome	firefox
hope you guys can helpme i couldnt find the plugin file in firefox or google-chrome folders so i downloaded another npswf32 to put in the project folder maybe is that

8449277
pop-up	dialog
i want my main window to show up first and if the application can t find an application configuration file i want it to pop-up a dialog box to get some necessary values from the user

8449277
pop-up	dialog
if i put it in onactivated it seems to work but when i close the dialog or somehow click on the main window it pop-up another copy of the dialog

8449281
min	max
ie if you could calculate a min and max long and lat that were worth bothering to calculate

8449318
hide	show
you could hide or show whole panels or placeholders this way to swap out the whole content for specific menu items

8449360
subtraction	addition
and conveniently addition and subtraction are the same so x 8 -r x r x

8449376
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
this could be websockets if you re running your server on windows 8 server with asp.net 4.5 probably a future consideration or server sent events if the client is google-chrome firefox or opera or forever frame if the client is ie

8449405
width	height
as in don t bother trying to resize it inside the .flv file simply set the height and width of the embedded .swf using css on your page and i would image in it should scale fine

8449443
width	height
you are casting the height and width properties instead of the path objects

8449448
width	height
you have to specify the width and height of the image so it covers your button and yes check the path of the image

8449475
post	get
i would like to ask you about best practise in sending data post get variable between two web services where between them is esb

8449507
firefox	safari
seems fine in firefox safari etc

8449574
post	get
esb reads post get data formats data to meet web service 2 demands

8449579
maven	pom.xml	maven-release-plugin	pom.xml
my project pom.xml is containing -snapshot dependencies so in order to perform the release automatically i want to use the following maven command based on the maven-release-plugin goals mvn release prepare-with-pom in order to prepare the project s pom.xml for releasing and resolve dependencies -snapshot versions automatically without edit them by hand

8449588
cocos2d-x	corona
in cocos2d-x i was able to just create a custom action with corona i m puzzled

8449598
int	boolean
this uses an int and an array of boolean to implement a mutex without requiring any platform support for synchronisation atomic operations

8449608
children	parent
my understanding would be that i need to implement the swipegesture across the parent uiview which contains all these children uiview

8449656
hide	show
in jquery i m doing this to show hide by using filter

8449656
hide	show
basically what s happening as far as i can see is when you select one element it works to show hide the element

8449656
hide	show
when selecting more than one it show hide properly as long as you select it in the proper order

8449662
range	max
i can t just take the max and randomize over the range

8449662
range	max
one idea i had maybe was to grab the max randomize a limit based on the max and then grab a range of 10 records from random_limit_1 to random_limit_2 and then taking the first record found in that range

8449738
hide	show
instead hide everything and then show the ones for selected colors

8449782
min	max
and add a max and min lat and long to the query as mentioned in another answer

8449804
for-loop	loops
it some times happen when i use floating point numbers in c++ and only use numbers as multiples of say 0.1 as an increment in a for-loop the actual number which is loops iterators is not exactly multiples of 0.1 but has unpredictably other added or subtracted tiny numbers of the order of 1 -17

8449856
activiti	drools	bpmn	jbpm
there are also native bpmn 2.0 solutions like activiti jbpm and drools flow but they don t really support web service messaging

8449863
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
you can also disable set the compiler flag inline-functions expansion to only __inline ob1 to prevent inlining in the current module assuming you re not marking it as inline

8449924
prepare	execute
unfortunately variables can t be used in limit clause so you d have to use a dynamic query either writing the query string in code or using prepare and execute

8449960
range	min	range	max	min	max
now i have around 4k+ ids in the file and each id would have different range of distinct col1 max 165 million min 2k

8449965
maven	pom.xml
i do not have lots of experience with maven but as far as i understand i can create a pom.xml file that the user can use for downloading the last version of my project and its dependencies

8449975
std	ostream
for example to accommodate you will need to store a reference to std cout in the resulting functional object because the std ios_base copy constructor is private and it is impossible to copy construct objects of any class derived from std ios_base including std ostream

8450025
implements	extends
a useful feature of the recommended idisposable pattern is that it allows a consistent pattern for derived types extends types that implements idisposable independent of whether the base type exposes a public parameterless method called dispose

8450030
inline	inlining
when i define a function inside a cpp can the compiler inline it anyway if it deems that inlining makes sense for the function or do i rob him of some optimization capabilities

8450057
jqplot	flot
i use flot or jqplot

8450067
csv	tsv
i generally ask for the data in tsv csv or xml format

8450143
gif	png
for example to force the user to submit an image of type gif jpg png

8450209
public	protected
that s exactly why in a constructor you should never call a method which can be overridden non-final public and protected

8450223
textview	listactivity
i have a listactivity with custom rows icons textview etc

8450236
ienumerable	ilist
where you take a ilist or ienumerable of type string and return ilist

8450259
jgit	egit
i don t use jgit myself but i ve seen reports of various bugs that exist in jgit which is the backend to nbgit and egit

8450274
superclass	subclassing
a subclassing constructor method s first task is to call its superclass constructor method

8450274
inherited	subclassing
this ensures that the creation of the subclassing object starts with the initialization of the classes above it in the inherited chain

8450278
client-side	server-side
you don t really send values to javascript from asp.net. the former is client-side code the latter is server-side code

8450287
primefaces	icefaces
primefaces for mobile icefaces for mobile and others are good but the generated code is unnecessarily huge

8450294
rss	feed
i want to include my site rss feed to the page in the fbml tab

8450324
implements	extends
so the final class will extends one class and implements specified interfaces

8450324
implements	extends
and in the end i would like to have instance of class that extends iproxy and implements all interfaces that mi did implements

8450371
ssl	https
google ajax api cdn also supports ssl via https

8450371
ssl	https
microsoft cdn also supports ssl via https

8450382
onmouseover	onclick
the situation is i have a tooltip div which sits at the top of the page and is populated onmouseover or onclick by jquery based upon the trigger element

8450410
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
what i ended up doing was to change the background color of the active uiviewcontroller s view instead of the uiwindow

8450410
inherited	subclassing
apparently the simplest way to accomplish that is to have all uiviewcontroller s in the app inherited from a uiviewcontroller subclassing that implements -didrotatefrominterfaceorientation

8450510
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
this won t work if viewcontroller accesses the ivar directly but it will if it accesses the ivar through the accessor self.webview which is generally how you should access properties

8450539
width	height
someone on another question suggested comparing height and width but when getting these they are properly switched based on orientation another mystery

8450600
x86	64bit
64bit system represents the varchar 2 the same way as an x86 system

8450757
subclass	abstract-class
i also know that overriding static methods is useless because when i am dealing with say and my object has an abstract-class with a static method that gets overridden in it s subclasses t doesn t exist at runtime so objectwithid s static method would be called instead of the subclass

8450771
uilabel	uitextview
if you want to show some text in the app directly i suggest using uilabel or uitextview

8450849
uitextfield	accessoryview
i am trying to add a uiview as an accessoryview to a uitextfield but the alpha property doesnt seem to be respected

8450853
serializable	deserialization
then i could write classes that wrap the protobuf-generated classes and automatically convert these identifiers to real pointers on deserialization and back to ids on serializable

8450871
post	get
i found a post on codeplex talking about a different issue but at the bottom of the post they have a class autocompleteboxex that supports scrollintoview so you can hook up the selectionchanged even and this should get you the behavior you want

8450879
client-side	server-side
jim rush provides a pretty good overview of the pros and cons of server side versus client side logic and is pretty consistent with my discussion on this topic in my blog post client-side versus server-side development of voicexml applications

8450899
google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine on ie8 and google-chrome but on firefox upto version 8 i am having a problem

8450913
qpainter	qwidget
i could set icons instead of label but now i want to wear it with some better and my teacher told me to choose from qgraphicscene + item + view or qpainter + qwidget paintevent

8450915
nsnull	nsstring	nsnull	nsdata	nsstring	nsdata
so you can see that nsnull nsnumber nsstring nsarray nsdictionary and nsdata are all serializable to json and that any class that implements -jsondatarepresentation is also serializable

8450949
post	get
use encoded either in url get or as data in urllib2.request post not both i.e

8450951
google-chrome	safari
anything like that available for google-chrome safari

8450953
post	get
you re likely doing a get in your browser but in your code you re actually doing a post to a url with the query data and with your query data as the post data

8450953
post	get
the http request will be a post instead of a get when the data parameter is provided

8450976
width	height
how do i set the width and the height of the popup dynamically according to the particular measurements of the loading image

8451005
post	get
i need an url to download date time information from on client s machine inside desktop application another worlds to send request to post get and get response from with current date and time in some comfort to parse format .txt or .csv for example like for example we download stocks data some intersting stuff

8451006
google-chrome	safari
if you re using a webkit-based browser e.g google-chrome safari will always return the string auto and element.style.zindex will never return anything unless the selected element also has an explicit position css style

8451035
hide	show
so what i m trying to do is break a form into different sections and show hide using jquery

8451056
bluetooth	usb
i m trying bring up bluetooth over usb support on a new arm-based android device

8451100
put	get
when you install rvm you should get instructions to put this

8451129
google-chrome	firefox
i ve set my textbox autocompletetype property to autocompletetype.email it works fine in ie but nothing append in google-chrome or firefox

8451145
hex	binary
hi i am reading in a binary file formatted in hex

find the exact height and width of the viewport in a cross-browser way no prototype jquery

8451170
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the components cross-browser support internet explorer firefox google-chrome opera safari

8451216
onmousedown	onmouseup
two events are used onmousedown and onmouseup

8451221
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
apparently google-chrome and safari will ignore is and firefox won t and it then refused to load the rest of the stylesheet creating the idea that the body styles were loading but not others

8451244
websphere	ibm
how do i ping an ibm websphere mq queue manager

8451264
super	extends
this post is worth reading with respect to using wildcarded collections in java what is pecs producer extends consumer super

8451269
atoi	strtok
of course i can write a simple code with strtok and atoi

8451284
post	get
i was wondering what is a proper official name for the kind of route where the part of path is the parameter rather than an actual http parameter get or post

8451379
put	get
there are sample programs that come with mq such as amqsget and amsqput and their client-based equivalents amqsgetc or amqsputc which connect and get or put a message

8451398
internationalization	translation
i m trying to implement internationalization on my project but the pages only get translation with the language from settings.language_code

8451400
required	placeholder
one thing i ve done in the past there may be better ways is to define a placeholder in the head section of the layout and then use that to inject scripts that are only required on a small number of pages

8451404
listadapter	simplecursoradapter
i think you ll get the results you want if you change the declare the instance variable adapter the one at the top as a simplecursoradapter instead of a listadapter and then change this line from

8451476
getter	setter
if the class implements an interface with the id property you could wrap that class into yours and provide a getter and a setter

8451481
collabnet	svn
if you do not want to mess around with your ubuntu packages while you wait for them to update to svn 1.7.x one thing you can do is install the collabnet client rpm

8451538
range	min	range	max	min	max
as it just tests to see if the min max values fall within the defined range

8451551
put	get
this implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic operations get and put assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets

8451551
put	get
this implementation provides guaranteed log n time cost for the containskey get put and remove operations

8451578
filtering	grouping
the reason i want to do this is to grouping a bunch of given stack traces by similarity and use it as a filtering to sort stuff this grouping is important for a higher level reason which i can t exactly share publicly

8451616
submit	submission
there s no indicator resulting from the submit that allows the view to notify the user that there s an issue nor is there anything there to prevent the second from blindly submission if the first one fails

8451655
min	max
one thing that might be worthwhile is to first check if the touch point is inside the bounding box defined by the min x max x min y and max y values of the each polygon vertex array

8451656
post	get
back in the old days php had a setting called register_globals now depricated that automatically converted get and post variables into php variables

8451666
bash	tcsh
the real problem though is that bash and tcsh syntax are mostly incompatible

8451666
bash	tcsh
or source from either tcsh or bash but it would be difficult and ugly

8451689
stdout	fflush
i believe the problem is that when you run sys.stdout.write it writes to the stdout buffer but the buffer is not fflush until done so manually or closed stdout is a file object which you can confirm yourself with type sys.stdout

8451712
cos	sin
it is a sin or cos curve

8451724
terminate	timeout
what exactly does socket.setdefaulttimeout control and is there a way to enforce a hard timeout on these connections if 10 seconds go by regardless of what else is happening terminate the attempt

8451739
post	get
symfony always disable cache when post or get or other http headers are sent with a page

8451739
post	put	post	get	put	get
so disable post and get or other header put del from ajax call and cache will work fine

8451739
post	get
to disable get post

8451742
queue	fifo
this will create a fifo ordering based on the queue access of the threads

8451789
range	min	range	max	min	max
i d create an array with all the values in the min max range then do an intersect with all the existing range

8451850
post	get
but this fails also with get and post

8451850
post	get
edit i tried this but it did not help cant get jquery ajax post to work

8451895
autocomplete	autosuggest
i am trying to implement ebay autosuggest in an opera extension using jquery autocomplete

8451909
width	height
i m not sure if this is possible but i thought it would be cool using css transforms to create an effect where a div expands from its center to a predetermined height and width rather than just from the upper left corner

8451930
width	height
somehow though you need to actually move the div as well as animating the height width

8451937
uiview	subviews
when i drag the cell all uiview subviews are hidden

8451943
dumpsys	adb
use adb shell dumpsys activity to see what the current activity stack looks like

8451943
dumpsys	adb
the relevant log statements at the different steps the state of the activity stack shown by adb shell dumpsys activity etc

8451944
ant	maven
also how well will this integrate with the various build tools out there maven ant gradle etc

8451971
width	height
the basic idea is cgrectmake cgfloat x cgfloat y cgfloat width cgfloat height

8451977
uiview	subviews
it is worth mentioning that saving the contents of the uiview does not capture any other views or components that are not subviews of that component

8451990
hide	show	mouseover	mouseout
you could use either a click handler or mouseover mouseout combo but the javascript event handler would simply show hide the sub-menu

8451997
put	get
i have a char pointer points to an address of the memory and i need to get the content of that address and put it into an char array

8452011
memcpy	strcpy
try using strcpy or memcpy

8452030
jquery	touchswipe
i loaded the jquery touchswipe plugin

8452060
postgresql	mysql
the data layer relies on mysql postgresql microsoft sql server or sqlite

8452089
postgresql	mysql
a database mysql postgresql oracle etc. setup with the schemas you want a user table

8452160
postgresql	mysql
mono evolves regularly as of today linq to sql works fine with mono and mysql and i use it successfully with postgresql

8452167
postgresql	mysql
it could be a traditional rdbms database mysql or postgresql or something newer like a nosql solution mongodb riak couchdb

8452167
couchbase	couchdb
for my recent android project i ve been using couchbase s android libraries with ektorp that allow me to replicate to a server-side couchdb instance

8452167
pull	push
simple replicate command in ektorp to pull push data between client and server

8452178
width	height
not sure of my answer but you should try to have a multiple of 2 for image s height and width

8452191
post	get
i was hoping expecting that when alice clicks the like button in an article on our site and bob clicks on alice s like post bob would get an auth dialog

8452202
perforce	cvs
supported systems are team foundation server perforce visual sourcesafe cvs and subversion

8452213
ssl	https
the most obvious option was to use https ssl however the mobile developer is reluctant to do this because of the extra network traffic ssl handshake and the extra cpu load on the phone

8452218
int	chars
it can be used to iterate backwards and forwards through unsigned int enums and chars

8452271
int	chars
it can be used to iterate backwards and forwards through unsigned int enums and chars

8452299
soaplib	suds
the workaround is to cache the xmlschema.xml file locally see here suds and soaplib without internet access

8452304
translation	localization
you might avoid some complications if you can reformulate the sentence structure so that all the nouns appear in the subject position and you avoid Ã¢ ÅpackedÃ¢ expressions like Ã¢ Ånew year plans.Ã¢ for example Ã¢ Åjohn asked what plans kim kelly lee and bob have for the new yearÃ¢ would be simpler both for automatic translation and for pattern-based localization

8452309
google-chrome	firefox
my code is working perfectly as desired in firefox text1 on top of text2 and google-chrome but not in internet explorer

8452311
portrait	landscape
i m testing orientationchange to verify that jquerymobile manages layout accordingly with landscape or portrait mode

8452311

8457646
equals	gethashcode
if you haven t over-ridden equals and gethashcode on your paramid type and it s a class rather than a struct then the default equality meaning will be in effect and each paramid will only be equals to itself

8457646
equals	gethashcode
try to compile at this point and you will get a warning that you have overriden equals but not gethashcode the same is true if you d done it the other way around

8457646
int	chars
if the values where int chars or bytes we would have worked with the values themselves but here we build on the work done in implementing the same logic for those parts

8457646
equals	gethashcode
the first is that hash-based collections such as dictionary all use them it s just that unless passed an instance of one to their constructor they will use defaultequalitycomparer which calls into the equals and gethashcode methods we ve described above

8457646
equals	gethashcode
the other is that it allows us to ignore the equals and gethashcode mentioned above and provide them from another class

8457646
equals	gethashcode
we can change the concept of equality for our classes in either case but this must involve both equals and gethashcode

so as far as i can tell i either need to write an abstract static function that all extends classes must implements that returns the constructor...or i need to use reflection in some way to determine type and somehow call the appropriate class constructor

8459750
lxml	libxslt	lxml	libxml2	libxml2	libxslt
the lxml xml toolkit is a pythonic binding for the c libraries libxml2 and libxslt

8459779
g++	gcc
if you are using gcc or g++ you could use the following options

8459799
mdpi	hdpi
also i see that my android project has just a drawable folder in addition to hdpi mdpi ldpi what are the implications if i just place all my image resources to that folder instead of resolution specific

8459817
hide	show
the idea is to have several commentables in a single page and to identify the one which is currently commented to hide show a form to comment it

8459817
hide	show
so when the user click on the link to add a comment it hide the previous comment form if any it show the new correct one builds the id of the comments container for example comments_post_3 and store it in a global js variable of the page

8460086
margin	height
if you want to keep source order independence give the floated div a negative margin equal to the height of the first div

8460096

are there any alternatives to achieving this without dealing with touchesbegan touchesmoved .

8460144
google-chrome	firefox
that code is only for firefox 8 and google-chrome 15 and greater

8460150

functions like atoi atol atof do not work because it is not a string of numbers but more like a string of 0 s and 1 s that need to be interpreted as numbers

8460150
int	chars	int	double
in a broad sense you can think of it as the following format chars long int chars unsigned int double now if i were to want this first line i am doing something like

8460150
int	chars	int	double
my values for long int unsigned int and double are all incorrect but both chars s are correct

8460150
int	double
i do not understand how to correctly typecast a string of binary data to the types long int unsigned int and double

8460196
integer	fractions
.25 0 is integer below fractions part is .25

8460196
integer	fractions
-.25 -1 is integer below fractions part is .75

8460196
integer	fractions
with the other solutions you will repeat 0 as integer below and worse you will get reversed fractions values for all negative numbers

8460203
piston	tastypie
an api exposed to external clients then frameworks like piston or tastypie might be overkill compared to writing one or two views and using simplejson

8460213

my code is based off sample code from the microsoft website on how to do a list services operation which uses get however swap deployment uses post

8460309
mouseleave	mouseenter
that means that function will be executed on mouseenter and mouseleave

8460309
mouseout	mouseleave
using hover this way means you don t need a mouseout mouseleave event listener either

8460318
mouse	keyboard
i suppose the best workaround is to roll out my own implementation of a gridsplitter - just a custom control that handles mouse and keyboard events and updates properties of the hosting grid.

8460331
mamp	wamp
i ve had this code work flawlessly on windows with wamp but not on mac with mamp

8460425

8460538
viewdidload	viewwillappear
based on your new code if you are keeping the 2nd view controller around you may need to put your code in viewwillappear rather than viewdidload

8460540
jdom	dom4j
there s two fairly popular alternative dom-style apis that are more java-like jdom and dom4j

free	malloc
often malloc prefers to reuse previously free d memory space when relevant

8460584
free	malloc
i strongly believe that the c standard is very vague about malloc and free

textview	imageview
i have an xml file that has 2 textview and an imageview and here is my attempt at the code to get the image into the imageview

8460659
free	malloc
you can also use alternate implementation for malloc and free if you use a different memory allocator

8460681
mouseleave	mouseenter
when you call hover with just one argument it runs the handler function you pass in on both mouseenter and mouseleave events

8460681
mouseover	mouseleave
is it slidetoggling .the_menu twice - once when you mouseover once when you mouseleave

8460692
mouseleave	mouseenter
instead of hover you can switch to mouseenter and mouseleave and change the markup a bit

i have the same route for both post and get requests and use the following code

8460876
floating-point	integer
as the other answers have said to get a result close to 0.00833 which can t be represented exactly btw you need to do a floating-point division rather than an integer division by making one or both of the operands floating-point

8460876
floating-point	integer
if one operand is floating-point and the other is an integer the integer operand is converted to floating-point first

8460876
floating-point	integer
there is no direct floating-point by integer division operation

8460876
floating-point	integer
there are languages in which integer division yields a floating-point result

8461503
rss	feed
display is a partial class which is used to display the rss feed and it looks like this

8461508

have a look at project lombok which generates getter and setter at compile time

8461749
getter	setter

8461749
tostring	getter	getter	setter
all together now a shortcut for tostring equalsandhashcode getter on all fields and setter on all non-final fields and requiredargsconstructor

getter	setter
java doesn t have this feature but if you use eclipse you can automatically generate setter and getter for your class members

8461770
post	get
there are no input tags getting dynamically generated since when i step through the code using breakpoints none ever get added and when i tell google chrome to break on all subtree modifications the site still sends off the post with the added parameters before anything gets modified

8461786
stdout	stderr
it will go to a different device stderr instead of stdout and it won t be redirected

8461830

8461993
curb	libcurl	hpricot	curb
there is no reason to run a php script for this -- you can look at the sharrre.php file in the download and just redo it in ruby it looks like its using json libcurl try the curb gem and some xpath traversal try nokogiri or hpricot

8461999
getter	setter
i think you can get the selector names only if the property is declared with explicit setter xxx and or getter xxx

8461999
getter	setter
so to get the getter and setter selector names for some property furtype of the class cat

8462000

8463259
apache	nginx
are you running php as the mod_php apache module in your apache and as a fastcgi on your nginx

background-image	background-position
you could also use a div with a background-image and background-position of top center

8463970
getter	setter
i realise now that the best way to do this may well be to simply use strings for all fields but encapsulate that fact and still provide type specific method setter and getter

8463988

therefore you can also put a long vector of your single cell characters into the function and get back a splitted list of that vector

8464494
division	modulo
in other words it s the fact that integer division throws away the modulo divided by the divisor

8464505

the response from any web request get post put will vary depending on the remote service you are talking to

8464864
hex	binary
if you aren t using java 7 there is no binary literal syntax so you can do this integer.parseint 1010 2 as a work around or use hex literal notation

8464880
fadein	fadeout
the problem is that you are doing the fadeout before the decreasing height animation and the fadein after increasing the height

8464893
rss	feed
if you want your rss reader to work for both feed you could for example change the following line

8464909

8464916
min	max
each type have some facets that you can apply to the type element - ranging from simple min max length to regular expressions

8464957
pop-up	dialog
if this is not possible can air apps display oauth dialog in a frame in the app or do they need to open a pop-up for login

8465009
inherited	properties
if your control inherited from webcontrol it will have a properties called attributes

8465009
width	height
remember that the width or height attributes in html do not contain unit information it s just a simple integer

8465021
memcpy	memset
essentially it closely follows your c++ example only you don t need to mess around with sizeof and you use a copy loop instep of memset memcpy

8465029
implements	extends
your workflow would be simple to implements i would tackle resource uploads inside a separate controller since you may want to extends it later and you don t want the upload logic cluttering up your posts controller

8465034
floating-point	integer
now integer and floating-point literals are decimal by default in java

8465082
post	get
you could try clearing your cookies however somehow the locale was set to another value you can try forcing it to spanish by adding a get prarmeter to your url however other post parameters may override it

superclass	subclassing
i have a subclassing that has an extra method from the superclass so when i need to use that method i need to cast the superclass

8465218
superclass	subclassing
if it is what would be the tradeoff of implementing a blank method of the subclassing in the superclass and overriding it just in the subclassing that i need it

8465230
post	get
if you use post you can be sure that the data came in via a post request and not a get

8465230

google-chrome	firefox
i ve found that it works fine in firefox but in google-chrome when i try to drag an image it turns blue as if it where selected and to drop it i have to click again before release the mouse button or it still go following the mouse

8465260
superclass	subclassing
if a method is meaningful in the superclass and it should reasonably take no action there then you should put the method in the superclass and override it in the subclassing

8465260
superclass	subclassing
if the functionality of the added method does not belong in a superclass at all add and implement a second interface in your subclassing and program to that interface instead when you need the additional functionality

8465292
getter	setter
and these two classes i am assuming setter getter etc.

8465296
google-chrome	firefox
yes clickonce can still be installed through firefox and google-chrome however they will have to go and search for a plug-in or extension and install that first before installing your software

8465299

does anyone know how to change this code to get the height of the browser so i can make to font adjust not only to width but also to height

8465340
xna	spritebatch
if you want spritebatch in silverlight 5 try the silverlight toolkit which adds an implementation of xna s spritebatch and other handy things on top of the subset of the xna api that silverlight 5 provides

8465347
slideup	slidedown
create a div with red background and animate it using toggle or slideup slidedown if you prefer

8465410
webclient	webrequest
unless you have very specific requirements i strongly suggest you to use webclient over webrequest

8465460
chown	chmod
the point is ctime is altered not only by create but also by chmod chown maybe even by ln not sure

8465473
accessor	superclass	getter	setter	superclass	subclassing
if only subclassing need to access member attributes of its superclass define the attributes themselves as private and create protected accessor methods getter and setter

8465485
implements	extends
you ll have to extends the functionality for auto-complete by implements custom logic to perform substring searches to populate the match list

8465488
int	chars
you could always have your query from each result in same column names and comparable data types text vs chars int works in both memo vs blob etc

8465488
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
as per the interfaces i m referring to that of idbconnection sqlconnection vs oledbconnection idbcommand sqlcommand vs oledbcommand etc and has worked well for me connecting to sql mysql access sqlite and visual foxpro databases

freebsd	linux
is there a difference with the non blocking mode between linux and mac os x freebsd

8465895
width	height
now inside that there is another view called v2 at 10 10 50 50 which means that 10 10 is the point in v1 s coordinate system where the top left corner of v2 should be located and 50 50 is the width and height of v2

8465950
width	height
but i want to pass a width height array to an existing c library that expects a single plane of this data

8465962
gitolite	gitosis
in contrast to the already mentioned gitosis gitolite is still maintained and supports a more fine-grained control over the repository access

8466005
folder	directory
delete the .idea folder and the projectname.iml file both in the project directory

8466009
opera	safari
i loads without any noticable delay in opera and safari

8466010
loops	if-statement
i need to stop it from doing that so in the if-statement in the method i need to break that specific iteration of loops the method is in and make it go on to a new iteration of the same loops asking for a new number

8466033
maven	pom.xml
in our projects we have about 25 maven projects and each one of them contains at least 3 module projects and one parent pom.xml

8466033
maven	pom.xml
we have 25 maven projects and each one have on each other via parent pom.xml but not cyclic dependency dependency between them

8466101
profiler	visualvm
visualvm does not show me cpu usage in the monitor s tab says not supported for this jvm. the threads tab is missing and i cannot use the sampler or profiler

8466204
ssl	https
if you plan to write all the clients for the service yourself iphone android etc then sending email and password is a decent alternative as long as the provider communicates over a secure transport layer e.g ssl https

8466246
min	max
you can recenter the view so that all annotations are visible by creating and setting a new region that spans the max and min longitude and latitude of all the annotations

8466255
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
ie safari opera and google-chrome dont have this problem

if i use a tabpanel the tabs aren t clickable and on forms inputs won t focus or bring up the keyboard and don t seem to respond to input at all

8466307
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
while the qgraphicsscene does get the events my qgraphicsitem s or ...objects don t

8466342
jqmodal	simplemodal
if you want to open new modals from existing modals look at jqmodal not simplemodal

8466346
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works fine in safari and google-chrome but not in firefox

8466366
ant	maven
yes there are maven ant tasks available

8466421
opera	firefox
neither firefox nor opera support the mp3 format in html 5 audio only webma and oga

8466425
pylons	pyramid
pyramid is my first choice but if you strongly suggest against it or in favor of something else like django or pylons i am definitely wiling to consider it

8466450
move	drag
the helper option accepts the values original the draggable object move with the cursor clone a duplicate of the draggable move with the cursor or a function that returns a dom element that element is shown near the cursor during drag

8466463
awt	swing
for swing that means using swingutilities.invokelater somerunnable and i suspect it can be done similarly with awt

8466463
awt	swing
by the way why use awt and not swing

8466532
inherited	subclassing
on the instances of the subclassing you can call the this- gettablename method because it is inherited from the base class

8466535
stdout	stderr
in it scurrent state the script i have calls three bash functions and a python script that sends email with stderr and stdout for each share of which there are several 4 now and maybe up to 6-8 and it looks like this

8466541
int	double
this is why uint has an implicit cast to double but not to int

8466585
width	height
but i d like to bind the width and height to the current width and height of a control

8466609
division	addition
in addition when a user hovers over the division i display a link displaying delete.

8466699
for-loop	arrays
then in a for-loop of the same method i add objects to the arrays

8466743
free	malloc
address of the malloc a was incremented and then free a+1

8466743
free	malloc
its how exactly the malloc and free function work with each other

8466755
g++	gcc
perhaps i need to update gcc or use g++

8466760
free	malloc
all that can be said the free a+1 call is that it leads to undefined behaviour since a+1 has never been returned by malloc et al

8466764
width	height
my original intent is to use a bit vector of size width height which gives overhead of width height 8

8466764
width	height
the bit vector may be of size width or height or any desirable value even 0

8466764
next	except
after it is all 1s it is moved to next position then all the algorithm steps are performed except actual data movement

8466764
put	get
prefitch optimization is not difficult to implement just calculate indexes invoke prefetch and put indexes to a queue ringbuffer then get indexes from the queue and move data

8466770
free	malloc
free must be passed a pointer returned by malloc as per the standard

8466770
calloc	malloc
not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or

8466770
free	realloc
free or realloc the behavior is undefined

8466773
g++	gcc
edit after further inspection it seems that the missing link is the standard library which isn t surprising seeing as you are using gcc rather than g++ which will automatically link with the stdlib

8466790
getter	setter
however do i have to use the getter setter of a class within the class

8466794
mouseleave	mouseenter
thus i m using mouseenter and mouseleave together with settimeout for hovering behavior

8466794
mouseover	mouseout
everything works as intended except the following when i mouseout of one navigation header and mouseover another header quickly the submenu associated with the new header briefly appears then disappears

8466802
g++	gcc
you should use g++ because gcc is c compiler not c++

8466803
getter	setter
getter and setter are mandatory for others classes to access instance variables of a class to not violate the encapsulation principle which is quite important in oo programming

8466823
implements	extends
printwriter extends the class writer a class thinked to write characters while printstream implements outputstream an interface for more generic outputs

8466831
rss	feed
a few weeks ago i noticed that the rss feed on my live site was broken - i get a white screen of death

8466831
rss	feed
the only major difference i could see in the response headers was that my non-working production rss feed has this response header accept-ranges none

8466836
getter	setter
one of the motivations for getter setter is that the underlying data storage can change and things that implement the class won t need to be changed since it is encapsulated

8466836
getter	setter
so keeping that in mind using getter setter within the class makes future changes easier

8466836
getter	setter
instead of having to find all the places that alter the member directly you just have to change the getter setter

8466836
getter	setter
the more complicated the class the more useful it is to use getter setter within it

8466841
public	protected
you can access any variables private public or protected from within the class

8466849
free	malloc
how free and malloc are implemented depend on the implementation not on the c standard

8466849
free	malloc
the c standard explains what the functions do and it is up to each individual c implementation to provide conforming versions of free and malloc based on the descriptions of these functions in the c standard

8466858
int	chars	int	double
the scanf function on the other hand extracts primitive types int chars double etc. and explicitly delimited strings from the input stream

8466867
getter	setter
getter and setter provide a convenient place to convert values between the form in which they are stored in the objectÃ¢ s instance members and the form in which the outside world sees them

8466867
getter	setter
using getter and setter internally would muck that up because they d be getting used by both the inside and outside

8466886
getter	setter
it makes debugging more annoying because you have to follow the getter setter

8466886
inherited	subclassing
also if you design your class for inherited it may be better to go via an accessor if you want the subclassing to be able to alter the behavior

8466906
folder	directory
it seems that it is the application.css in the public directory that is being served on subsequent requests instead of the ones in the asset folder that you are working on

8466923
versioning	upgrade
i m writing a new versioning of my android app and upon upgrade i need to perform a certain task

8466931
width	margin
the point is you have to either set the width of the element and use margin 0 auto or set the margins of the element equal

8467012
strtol	strtod
to that end you can run strtol or strtod on the tokens and see if you succeed

8467040
serializable	deserialization
all the examples i can find for custom serializable involve implementing a constructor that will be called upon deserialization which is exactly what i want except that i don t want the function to be a constructor

8467044
alloca	malloc
i am not sure of alloca but malloc return s void and c++ unlike c doesn t support implicit conversion from void to any other pointer type

8467047
mouse	keyboard
you could also run a browser on your machine and simulate mouse and keyboard input like a regular input

8467048
punctuation	words
it will read strings separated by blanks which may be part of its attraction but it will include any punctuation that is included in the words

8467048
int	chars
it also safely changes the type of ch from int necessary for i o to chars

8467076
postgresql	mysql
at least mysql and postgresql do this i guess every backend does this

8467134
getter	setter
where can i read about const getter and setter

8467144
google-chrome	safari
for the record while both pochang and chris are correct that you need the content-range header to fix this problem in safari google-chrome requires one extra header that must be included for setting currenttime to work properly

8467172
post	get
the button to get to the list of pages to manage from the list of albums sends the id via post to hide the albumid and other parameters

8467178
audiotrack	audiorecord
my idea is to use android s audiorecord and audiotrack classes which according to my understanding read audio input from the mic and push audio output to the speaker

8467212
implements	extends
since hand is an abstract class it doesn t have to actually implements those interfaces but any non-abstract class that extends hand must do so

8467216
mouseup	mousedown
what i am trying to achieve is a scrolling loop on mousedown stopping on mouseup

8467241
int	chars
i m working on assignment here part of which requires me to parse int from a string that has groups of digits separated by any other chars

8467270
twig	smarty
twig or smarty would be perfect choice

wordpress	joomla
i am trying to modify a script that was developed to import article records from a joomla 1.5.x database into a wordpress 3.2.1 table for posts

8467349
wordpress	joomla
it is a script that migrates content from joomla to wordpress

8467349
wordpress	joomla
the issue i had with the script is that it did not maintain the unique identifier id in joomla and id in wordpress

8467349
wordpress	joomla
based on my understanding this makes it a lot more complicated much more work to deal with redirecting all the joomla permalinks over to the new and obviously different wordpress permalinks

8467349
wordpress	joomla
if the id was the same in wordpress as it was in joomla then some basic rewrite rules in htaccess would be enough to perform the redirections

8467349
wordpress	joomla
even though i ve used that messy method for my own site it is my wish to make this process work cleanly for other users who are on joomla 1.5.x and are switching to wordpress instead of upgrading to a newer joomla release which is a big process so many are just jumping ot wordpress like me

8467363
octal	binary
i am having difficulty understanding why this is as an octal digit consists of 3 binary bits

debian	linux
on linux distributions the package manager dpkg on debian does a good job for upgrading programs even for daemons

8467450
post	get
as you can see from the logs below the post does succeed as it should but for some reason the app executes a get to the exact same url at the same time

8467450
post	get
the problem does sound similar in scope to jquery ajax post causes an immediate get to the same url but this is using jquery_ujs and i don t believe i ve left any custom jquery code sitting around

8467450
post	get	submit	submission
and discovered that the post now did not go through but the get did confirming that problem seems to be that the ajax handler is picking up the link and submission it as a post properly but is not intercepting the get that the browser submit

8467450
post	get
now in restoring the script tag to its previous form and then disabling jquery-mobile i have tried the link again and it now does not submit the get but does submit the post

8467468
post	get
you can use this for get and post requests

8467469
int	double
i have structure that have 3 member s first is int second is pointer to that int and third is double pointer which point to second member to pointer

8467474
int	double
no in java if you use int the result of division would be again int you have to cast least one operand to double

8467506
cassini	iis
this is a difference between iis hosted service and windows or visual studio service host cassini

if i run this command in it s own file called for example test.php in my wordpress directory then it works fine resizes the image and saves it into the scripts folder as newtemp.jpg

8467688
width	height
the problem occurs because in the display the disk used in the mask has a diameter equal to the height of the image whereas the stand-alone disk has a diameter equal to the width of the image

8467691
folder	directory
files in a directory and then ultimately create softlinks in another folder to act as a video playlist

8467728
width	height
another option would be to wrap the images in a pane with automatic width and fixed height

width	height
modalbox.show .. b-gal-scripts ajaxgal.php title title overlayopacity .1 width width height height method post params src next dir dir img img ssimg next

8467741
boost	allocator
boost make_shared does some magic to allocate the reference count and the object in contiguous memory which saves on calls to the allocator and improves locality of reference

8467751
int	chars
if you want raw binary data first let me tell you that instead of unsigned chars you are better off using bigger containers such as long int or long long

8467770
content-length	content-type
but like mattias said you d probably want some data in the body as well so you d want the content-type and the data as well plus content-length would be larger

8467797
nsexception	nserror
slightly related not nsexception but nserror

8467818
ubuntu	debian
if you re on debian or ubuntu this is as easy as apt-get install apc

i have a div that is 100 width to it s container which is floating left and has a set pixel width and has a set pixel height

8467877
hash	salt
a bcrypt hash includes salt and as a result this algorithm returns different hash for the same input

8467889
put	get
note that you ll need a get put api for the queue with mutex protection to prevent threads 2 and 3 from stepping on each other

8467894
ccscene	cclayer
other than that ccscene cclayer and ccnode are virtually identical to each other

8467894
ccscene	cclayer
the reason why many examples instantiate the ccscene object inside the cclayer class is simply because of that requirement of cocos2d having to have a scene

8467898
ftp	smb	cifs	smb	cifs	afp	afp	smb
i know that these apps use a combination of the cifs smb afp ftp sftp and webdav protocols

8467908

if i put that code directly in a console application and run it it will get and list the iis express websites

8467975
versioning	upgrade
http upgrade is used to indicate a preference or requirement to switch to a different versioning of http or to another protocol if possible

8467975
ssl	https	starttls	smtps
this upgrade allows for a similar mechanism to starttls in other protocols ldap smtps ... so as to be able to switch to tls on the same port as the plain connection after exchanging some of the application protocol messages as opposed to having the entire http exchange on top of ssl tls without it needing to know it s on top of tls the way https works

that could be a bug in jcrop but you can write your code in a fashion that works on google-chrome firefox ie and safari

8468087
floating-point	integer
however both of these techniques will push your parser towards a point where it can t easily evolve if you want to expand the language later on for example to distinguish between integer and floating-point numbers to add strings or lists etc.

8468114
implements	extends
if you re interested in composing doctrine_cache_memcache for example suppose you d like to extends whatever provides the real work for _getdomain you would implements doctrine_class_interface instead

this is a reported webkit google-chrome safari bug children of parent with min-height can t inherited the height properties

8468131
put	get
if i put a min-height on my container i m not explicitly specifying its height - so my element should get an auto height

8468171
google-chrome	firefox
dragging an image from a web page gets complicated because firefox google-chrome and ie9 all give you a different set of formats

8468182

for-loop	arrays
the for-loop below attempts to dynamically call the method valueindollars for each element in the arrays as follows

8468422
int	chars
if i were you i ll use some array list of small int short or chars to store the values

8468431
puts	gets
the second gets the process id and the third matching on the end of a line puts it all together

8468454
int	boolean
it typically is composed from a number of boolean floats and int possibly arrays list between 5 and 100 different variables

8468475
filtering	grouping
i usually disable the filtering and put files where i want them so that the two structures remain in sync by default indeed any other way seems like madness if you want to have any kind of organisation of source code - i always grouping files for components inot separate folders

8468476
hide	show
i have sort of an imagemap which is basically a lot of absolutely positioned divs which when clicked will show or hide a tooltip

serializable	deserialization
so how does the deserialization code in java know what version of a class was serializable and stored vs the one that it is being deserialized into

8468541
next	except
my next guess is this your config above says everyone is forbidden access except when they re coming from 127.0.0.1

8468564
addition	multiplication
i m not sure whether you want to write a high-level library for working with long numbers for calculating primes or something or just implement the low-level operations addition multiplication for learning purposes

8468593
folder	directory
put your example1.txt file in that folder or change the working directory to the location of example1.txt and your code should output something

8468608
folder	directory
i would ve expected a glassfish logs folder but having searched the glassfish directory i don t see them

8468633
portrait	landscape
the list works exactly right except that when i rotate the screen from landscape to portrait the list repeats each element like 3 times

8468636
public	protected
if you make run protected or public in abstractinner and thus in inner as well instead of using the default visibility it will work as intended

8468638
int	chars
i tried casting each individual chars as a int performing the calculations and casting it back as a chars but i seem to get the same chars after encryption for different chars

8468640
hide	show
i created a script that hide show the menu and i added a image icon down.png

8468662
profiling	instrumentation
as i am relatively new to using instrumentation and profiling i m not exactly sure if this is normal

8468662
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
also i found that when a second uiviewcontroller is pushed onto the uinavigationcontroller stack allocated memory jumps to about 8.5-9 mb on the real device but only about 4.5 to maybe 4.5 megabytes tops on the simulator

8468692
min	max
the larger program uses dates input by the user to create the framework for the min max of the progress bar

8468710
ftp	telnet
the problem is i cannot install anything on that machine it s a corporate box but i am allowed ftp telnet ssh login etc

8468762
width	height
jquery provides several ways to find width and height depending on what you want to do

8468762
width	height
the plain width height methods get the css values

8468790
setinterval	settimeout
i know that the difference would currently be negligible due to inaccurate browser timers but for the sake of knowledge if nothing else is there any browser that supports setinterval and settimeout but requires that they be passed an integer value as a delay

8468791
serializable	deserialization
serializable on the other hand is used if you want to construct a binary representation of your object and then recreate the object instance using deserialization process

8468791
serializable	deserialization
however in this case only this given field in your entity is using serializable deserialization to put binary data into database column

8468814
accessor	properties
instead use the properties accessor which will handle the release and retain for you

8468848

8468871
min	max
updated code that creates array but isnt outputting the min max values

8468871
min	max
why isnt this working and how do i get it to automatically remove the min max value and then reoutput the array

8468871
min	max
current output of the code that doesn t seem to show the min max value

8468890
for-loop	loops
edit op clarified that r changes each loops and they want to avoid using a for-loop

8468898
children	parent
if your parent process has exited the children should get reassigned to init which periodically reaps its children

8468931
int	double
i d recommend int if that number does not contain a decimal point float or double if it does

8468949
children	parent
you re trying to get the children of a user and at the same time get all the other parent

8468949
children	parent
an easy way to list the children of a user and display the parent of each children would be

8468951
comparator	comparable
the easiest way would probably be to create a class that encapsulates the four values make the class implement comparable and define its comparator method via the integer

8468960
hide	show
you could use the approach i provided to find the other label and hide it but you would also need to override the success callback to show the original label again

8468976
sum	coalesce
though you may also need to wrap your sum s in coalesce ... 0 mdash

8468988
setinterval	settimeout
this is because the dom interface only accepts integers for the delay in settimeout setinterval -- yup these are defined in the dom not in ecmascript

8469013
hex	binary
means that the string you are giving represents hexadecimal notation so it will convert the bytes ab and cd from hex into binary 1010 1011 1100 1101 which is two bytes

associativity	operator-precedence
documentation of operator-precedence and associativity

8469378
maven	pom.xml
actually to do it properly it will require you to include the new version with a separate version suffix in the internal repository and to update the in your pom.xml . the only better way around this is to have someone else manage the dependency - either in the maven central repository or another repository location that you reference from your pom.xml

8469379
bazaar	git
among the possibilities are darcs bazaar git and mercurial

8469386
hash	md5
- hash md5 both user and password and compare it directly in the db

8469435
post	put
i m building a ruby web service which accepts post or put requests that tell it to do some work

8469476
octal	hex	octal	decimal
hex tends to be the preferred notation for addresses but octal not shown has a long history too but requires even more digits than decimal

8469602
int	chars	int	double
because when you are passing argument like int double chars etc

8469605
internationalization	localization
i use google app engine python and jinja2 and i d like to take advantage of webapp2 s feature for currency internationalization and localization ie store prices as a number and make the correct formatting using the builtin i18n method of webapp2

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
safari firefox google-chrome ie9

8469667
stdout	stderr
unless you re wrapping everything in giant begin rescue s and catching errors that way the best way to log errors is to catch all output from stderr and stdout with something like

8469673
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
then use a for-loop not a for-each loops and use the for-loop index to get the string for the first column and the arrays index the length of the arrays and just very simple math to get the index of the string for the second column

8469723
ddms	adb
adb does not show the emulator listed when i use adb devices the ddms perspective in eclipse does not detect any device either

8469838
for-loop	arrays
2 how do i correctly index through the _files arrays in a for-loop

8469902

this is working fine in ie but giving error in firefox opera etc.like

8487524
width	height
place your image in a div with the same width and height as your pic and give that div a background color

8487542
post	get
i send a post request from iphone to django and get csrf verification failed which i can t perfectly understand

8487547
youtube	vimeo
i applyed z-index to all elements and it works great but i need to embed videos from youtube vimeo or other.

8487561
width	height
add rows and columns and change the height and width properties of these object to resize as you want fixed value auto

8487578
vim	emacs
i suggest you pick one of them vim emacs mixing them with a plugin isn t something that great since i wouldn t expect all the functionality to be there

8487578
vim	emacs
vim or emacs are pretty fast without one emulating the other so you wouldn t need such a plugin

8487587
expander	itemscontrol
my xaml code assumes that you have a limited amount of space for the expander and you are showing that expander within an itemscontrol which gives its items as much space as they want

8487610
disk	ram
16gb of ram will be enough to serve the data if your hot set will all fit in ram or if serving rate can be served off disk

8487618
public	protected
now if i make the constructor of protectedconstructor class as public or protected then the code compiles fine with no error

8487618
public	protected
so then why is it necessary even for the constructor to be public or protected and not just have default access

8487645
highstock	dygraphs
i see that highstock is nice too but you shouldn t have any problems in adapting dygraphs to what you describe

8487659
getter	setter
i have a class in which i have 30 getter and setter method

8487678
public	protected
if you want to extends a class outside its package it must have a constructor that is public or protected because in java every constructor must call a constructor from its superclass

8487696
post	get
when you call this function you can use the static get and post properties of urlrequestmethod rather than just passing strings for a little bit of extra safety

8487737
versioning	upgrade
phpunit doesn t include selenium extension since versioning 3.6 and you have to install upgrade it manually

8487765
public	protected
you can have constructors which are public protected for internal used and even private

8487765
public	protected
the objectoutputstream class has a public constructor which takes an outputstream and a protected constructor which can only be used by a sub-class

8487811
versioning	upgrade
if you can upgrade to the latest versioning of firebird then you could use execute block and or execute statement to do it all in one statement and server side but with firebird 1.5 you have to settle for the long way one statement to get the current max then another one update the generator

8487812
puts	gets
i m making a program that gets information from a database and puts in a grid in an agenda-like way

8487820
folder	directory
if you use blue folder references for your resources these folder will also be created inside your application bundle while resource files in groups will simply be copied to your mainbundle s root directory

8487844
hide	show
also can i update the parent layout show or hide a button of the listview based on checking a radiobutton in the listview row

8487857
implements	extends
i managed to realize it on a 320x480 resolution by creating a class which extends a surfaceview and implements runnable

8487865
mouse	keyboard
it seems your xaml did not provide a place for interaction with the keyboard mouse

8487897
hide	show
another idea to solve the issue is getting the browser type by using code then you can show or hide the background images based on the type

8488013
post	get
read more on my blog post - hopefully the blog will get some good comments about it too

8488049
lambda	first-class-functions
moreover java will get lambda in it version 8 and this will solve the problem of first-class-functions in java so i suppose library writers prefer waiting for java 8 than using some kind of workaround

8488069
post	get
read more on my blog post - hopefully the blog will get some good comments about it too

8488090
portrait	landscape
now if user touches the imageview then set the frame of uiview in landscape mode otherwise in portrait mode

8488094
public	protected
the class adapter will derive from the legacy classes and expose public interface methods which will internally call your protected methods

8488109
titlebar	window
to allow these items to have their own representation the designers of msaa picked a two-level structure where objid_window represents the entire window and it has children that then represent things like scrollbars menubar titlebar and so on - if they are present

8488127
vim	emacs
you ll have the vim keys if you prefer that and you ll also have the power of emacs at your disposal

8488135
int	chars
here s what happens when fails to read an int when you type a dot and press enter whatever you typed stays in the stream including the newline chars

8488162
post	get
read more on my blog post - hopefully the blog will get some good comments about it too

8488191
apache	nginx
another option would be to use the diazo standalone proxy see diazo.org for development and then use diazocompiler to generate an xsl and deploy that into nginx apache for production

8488198
debian-based	ubuntu	ubuntu	debian
on debian-based systems debian ubuntu and such that s aptitude or apt-get

8488211
folder	directory
when folder structure is managed outside of xcode for example a cross-platform project which has project files for different versions of xcode visual studio and other ides all using mostly the same directory tree you normally want folder references

8488235
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu debian you can use

8488296
post	get
read more on my blog post - hopefully the blog will get some good comments about it too

8488335
nsstring	nsdata
i am sending an image to the server by converting the nsdata object into an nsstring object using base64 scheme by using..

8488357
for-loop	loops
a for-loop evaluates loops bounds once at the beginning of loops so you run off the end which explains your index out of bounds errors

8488363
folder	directory
my next task is to create another batch file which moves each file in a directory into the relevant date folder based on their date modified

8488364
width	height
there is also an overlay div class fondo height and width 100 so i can dectect when the background has been clicked i can not use directly the background div because the transition makes it have negative z-index

8488413
post	get
make the form submit a get request rather than a post

8488426
post	put	post	get	put	get
the requests might be get post put or delete and the response that comes back could be any type of content - it might be html json xml or an images document binary content or whatever

8488426
post	put	post	get	put	get
i ve no problem doing what i need with get and post - it s put and delete that are awkward since i can t support them directly with html

8488426
post	put
at the moment the implementation uses some server-side trickery and a hidden _method field on the form that allows post requests to be overloaded into put delete options whatever but ideally i d like to take that logic out of the server side and do the equivalent using javascript

8488441
lisp	scheme
one of the differences between scheme one lisp dialect so to speak and common lisp is that in scheme there is one namespace for variables and functions whereas in cl there are two separate namespaces

8488452
for-loop	loops
you may change the for-loop into a while loops that reevaluates count and don t increment index on the delete iteration

8488488
public	protected
have these public methods delegate to protected methods of the legacy classes

8488508
uiview	subviews
after that inside the scroll view add uiview as subviews

8488594
mouseup	mousedown
i do not get correct coordinates of the mousedown or mouseup events

8488594
mouseup	mousedown
no matter where i click inside the view the coordinate of left mousedown is always 0.000000 -1.996910 and left mouseup is always 0.000000 0.000000

8488594
mouseup	mousedown
mousedown and mouseup together makes one click

8488594
mouseup	mousedown
shouldn t the coordinates of the mousedown and mouseup equal

8488595
post	get
what you want to do is called prg or post redirect get

8488595
post	get
obviously it also works without post but using get for an action that modifies things is not really a good idea anyway

8488631
udp	tcp
difference between tcp and udp

8488654
sorting	filtering
the problem is that sorting paging and filtering should be always analyzed and applied by the web server and all the actions can be combined together

8488722
folder	directory
this error is thrown because databases directory fails to be created and when sql engine tries to open databases dbname.db file it can t find databases folder

8488728
opencv	emgucv
as jav_rock has pointed out you can still build a wrapper around the function or code he has pasted but one other option would be to use emgucv opencv which happens to be a complete wrapper in c# for opencv

8488730
post	get
i need some advice on how to get the mysql to respond to a select query from post table within 3 to 4 secs post have more than 1 million records

8488749
width	height
you can display map as per your requirement and you can change it s size by width and height and display other control with it

8488766
ienumerable	ienumerator
i know with .net ienumerable ienumerator are involved but how does vb6 asp classic do it

8488782
google-chrome	firefox
the click handler no longer triggers tested on firefox and google-chrome

8488827
post	get
doing it this way the browser will show the quote_done.php page a get request instead of the page requested with post

8488829
post	get
i looking for some conditional tag to get me the taxonomy in the current page.for example when i want to check the current page if it have the same post type that i want it i use

8488844
min	max
when using set_message you can t specify the lengths both min and max the way that you have done

8488851
width	height
i just started moving code related to things like detecting wall collisions to the ball and paddle classes to tidy up my main view a bit and realised that i d need to give these classes a way to know the views width and height

8488851
width	height
at the moment my work around is just to intialise a global variable inside the surfaceviews surfacechanged method that stores the width and height of the view like so

8488882
implements	extends
the difference being that they have to implements a particular named interface or extends a named class

8488889
onresume	onpause
i assume you should try implement onpause and onresume

8488901
superclass	subclassing
anonymous subclassing are generally used to either implement single-method interfaces or perhaps provide an override of a superclass method - both of these cases are more useful since other code can invoke the overridden behaviour via the method declared on the parent class interface

8488990
tablet	mdpi	tablet	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
edit i just beheld that op didn t realize that most phones have hdpi density while most tablet have mdpi density

8488994
gridview	repeater
similar methods can be used on repeater and gridview controls which work with earlier versions of .net 1.0 and 2.0 respectively

8489007
getter	setter
why dont you just use the getter and setter for this

8489016
listview	gridview
take look about asp listview or asp gridview

8489016
listview	gridview
if you can get a datatable or a dataset from your database then you just need to bind it to your listview or gridview

8489049

8489109
mapply	lapply
some similar specialized functions include lapply sapply and mapply

8489124
int	double
it works too when i first cast liste1 0 to an int and then to a double

8489180
int	double
because if you type 1 then it will be an int value not a double

8489180
int	double
int cannot be cast to double it can be only converted to double which is different operation even though it looks the same in code

8489180
int	double
so if you want it to be working with int 1 you have to cast it to int and then convert into double

8489193
uigesturerecognizer	uitouch
bool gesturerecognizer uigesturerecognizer gesturerecognizer shouldreceivetouch uitouch touch

8489201
centos	linux
i need to dynamically create a simple but nice slideshow from images on my linux server centos

8489477
int	double
strings and all the built-in numeric types int double etc implement so they can all be used fine without any action from you

8489494
maven	cobertura
what you could look at is moving the cobertura run out of maven default life-cycle and run it separately as required

8489654
screens	tablet
its working fine automatically resize the images for all screens resolution except in tablet screens size 1280x800

8489661
int	double
it s best to think of int as having an implicit conversion operator allowing it to be converted to double but if the type isn t known at compile time to be an int this won t be run

8489681
fadein	fadeout
now i want to add some effects to the images transition effects as we mostly have in slide shows fadein or fadeout

8489798
getter	setter
no need for getter and setter method

super	implements
why not implements your own touchesbegan in a uigesturerecognizer subclass -- intercept the message extract the information you d like and then pass the message along to super s touchesbegan

8489895
children	parent
of course clock is a parent element of the other two so maybe it overrides the children elements if i use the jquery code

width	height
chart.setsize width height see this example on jsfiddle and the reference

8489959
pascal	delphi
better perfomance can be obtained using buffered i o old pascal i o functions were designed long ago and may use small buffers better to use one of the buffered streams available today in delphi or asynch i o you pass the buffer to write to the os the call returns immediately and later the os will tell you when it had written the data

8490308
put	get
i think it giving type casting error as you store the value as string in put try to type cast at putting the value time or get the as string and then convert to long value but for type casting may be you getting type casting error in this so put into the try catch block and see the logcat details to detecting the error

lisp	smalltalk	forth	smalltalk
lisp ruby snobol forth and it s compile time metaprogramming smalltalk and it s reflection the untyped lambda calculus with it s property that everything is a function which kind of implies that assuming we could invent a machine which executes lambda calculus directly lambda calculus would be homoiconic and von neumann machine code would not when run on said machine

does anybody know if there s a way in java to set the value of an instance variable in a subclassing before calling the superclass constructor

8493432
superclass	subclassing
i have a brief schematic below of what i m trying to accomplish -- i need to set up the instance variables defined in the superclass differently depending on the subclassing type but i still want to be able to share common non-constructor code among different instances of the subclassing

8493462
width	height
apparently setting the mapview s width and height equal to the diagonal of the containing view solves this issue

8493474
range	max
max abs sum range i k +abs sum range m n

8493475
min	max
for increased speed one should check the best max and min for overlap before checking all possible max min pairs

post	get
i know this sound like a question for serverfault but i know that developers often get the blame when servers are struggling so i thought a post here might be useful to people who still use perl on the web

8493559
width	height
update per jimmy s recommendation i verified that calling pdfreader.getstreambytes returns a byte length equal to width height 8 since getstreambytes should be calling flatedecode

8493559
width	height
manually calling flatedecode and calling pdfreader.getstreambytes both produced a byte length of 1049401 while the width height 8 is 2544 3300 8 or 1049400 so there is a difference of 1

8493559
width	height
the fact that the width height 8 as stated earlier is off by 1 in comparison to the byte length when calling flatedecode makes me think these are all one in the same

8493562
google-chrome	firefox
there are also browser-specific plugins such as this for google-chrome and a few others for firefox

8493581
super	abstract
what you could do is make an abstract init method in your super class and call it in your super constructor before you call the setup method

superclass	subclassing
this way subclassing will be forced to implement init and you would know that that is the place to initialize any subclassing s members before they are used in your superclass

8493601
folder	directory
code explanation this is basically a recursive listing of directory so a dirlister objects lists files under the given root and if some variable is accessed with dotted notation it returns a dirlister assuming that that attribute is a folder under the root

8493613
width	height
so in the main.xaml the submain.xaml is allotted a certain width and height and the imagedisplay elements re-size and fit themselves perfectly without the help of code

itÃ¢ s also nice to create a class in groovy and have variables be public by default with getter and setter added at runtime saving a lot of boilerplate code

8497795
touchesmoved	touchesended
this also only seems to be a problem when taking touches directly from a touchesmoved or touchesended event object since my buttons respond to touches correctly

8498170
pull	push
this way you get a push scenario rather than a pull scenario thus you don t have to poll your endpoints for potential updates

8498220
hex	binary
when querying and reading such binary values the mysql functions hex and unhex will be very helpful as will writing your query values in hex notation preceded by 0x

8498220
hex	binary
reading data out is slightly slower - you have to call hex on all binary data read out of a query to get it in a useful format if your client api doesn t deal well with binary data php in paricular will usually determine that binary strings and will break them if manipulated without first calling bin2hex base64_encode or similar - but this overhead is about as minimal as character collation and more importantly is only being called on the actual cells select ed not all cells involved in the internal computations of a query result

8498246
