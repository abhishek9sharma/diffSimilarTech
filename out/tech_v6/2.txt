200026
onmouseover	mouseleave
at the same time add an onmouseover function to the window - this should get triggered when the mouseleave the flash element

200031
erlang	lisp
my recommendation from personal experience is to learn about lisp erlang or such functional languages and the philosophy behind them

200056
postgresql	mysql
is there any alternative to oracle s client software the provides the functionality of something like mysql s mysql or postgresql psql

200138
serializable	deserialization
wcf also allows more fine-grained control over the json serializable and deserialization if you desire it

200142
public	protected
edit one variant on this would be to make bar a protected nested class within foo with a public constructor

200170
boost	stl
a good start is the boost library of course because it covers most of the templates you seem to look around for when the stl runs out of gas

200244
int	chars
you use inputstreamreader.read chars int int and when you ve read all you want to create a new string from a chars array

200341
jar	war
heck you can store content directly in a war file which is basically a jar file with a few extra bits

200417
getter	setter
autogeneration of code getter setter etc much like intellij idea for java has

200470
firefox	safari
we have found out that firefox at least v3 and safari don t properly cache images referenced from a css file

200488
folder	directory
where web would be a sub directory in my themes folder

200577
junit	cactus
as you are dealing with a web service you would not need to use jakarta cactus and could get away with writing plain old junit tests

200581
jar	war
in a jar or war file and pull them at runtime

200593
jvcl	turbopower
this wasn t just used for some in-house components alone the repo also included some of the big component packages raize components jcl jvcl using their installer instead of the tool though devexpress quantum grid 3 and 4 turbopower asyncpro

200597
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you can use iqueryable t instead of ienumerable t then the select method should do what you want

200641
hide	show
include the calculated data in your regular page but hide it style visibility hidden then make it visible with a print.css media print as described by guido so it only show up when you print

200651
boost	stl
you should know enough about the subject to be able to effectively use template libraries such as the stl or boost

200700
hex	binary
if you need to be absolutely sure what s going on create the files in binary either using a binary hex editor or writing it out from a program

200724
width	height
it works fine when i apply a scaletransform on the template but that results in a control that s too small when it s actually used the width height auto resizes the control to the proper size and then the scaletransform is applied

200738
hex	binary
using the php pack function i have converted a string into a binary hex representation

200755
ienumerable	iqueryable
in a linq to sql class why are the properties that are created from the foreign keys entityset objects which implement ienumerable where as the objects on the datacontext are table objects which implement iqueryable

200755
ienumerable	iqueryable
i know that the reason this happens is the difference between iqueryable s and ienumerable s so why doesn t the matchplayers object in the first example implement the iqueryable interface to get the same benefits as the latter example

200798
strsplit	substr
re-reading your question again strsplit is not available in j2me but the same effect can be achieved with substr and indexof

200842
rss	feed
we ve created an rss feed for cooliris to open small example from it

200847
many-to-many	one-to-many
should handle one-to-many and many-to-many relations should handle inheritance support for lazy loading

200869
post	get
one great about this solution is that i maged to make it work with post and get requisitions

200909
width	height
you could try to bind the width and height of the control inside the template to the width and height respectively of the templated control at runtime

200909
width	height
these properties contain the width and height of a control after it has been rendered which can be different from what has been specified in the width and height properties

200935
csla	.net
if you are using .net you may want to take a look at csla .net by rockford lhotka

201026
nunit	nmock
there is a rather good book describing how to use nunit and nmock to do c# unit testing

201030
csla	.net
i would recommend csla .net by rockford lhotka

201044
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
change to sum average max or min anything that represents the actual data - it only applies to the one value so aggregate-functions are fine

201067
awt	swing
i was able to fix 99 of my awt applet redraw issues by switching to swing

201080
httphandler	httpmodule
generally this web-dependent assembly is also where my httpmodule and httphandler live too

201084
lisp	scheme
scheme immediately comes to mind a nicer lisp

201132
.nettiers	codesmith
most of the time i use types data sets and custom web services or i use .nettiers with codesmith

201171
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is worse complexity than mergesort in the worst case.

201171
quicksort	mergesort
but you can implement quicksort more efficiently than mergesort for almost any application other than ones dealing with sorting millions of items

201175
bash	tcsh	bash	zsh	zsh	tcsh
my general rule of thumb is if it is a one-liner or a for-loop to catch a bunch of files and do just a few operations to them i use bash tcsh zsh else i use python

201245
button	checkbox
row three will always have two radio button and two checkbox and those are in the html side of the page

201245
button	checkbox
i can loop through each item in the datagrid and i can access the radio button and the checkbox but the textboxes aren√¢ t there

201294
vim	emacs
while it doesn t launch from vim the way emacs does it provides vim like keybindings and behavior

201298
configobj	configparser
configobj is essentially a replacement for configparser with support for nested sections and much more

201317
vpn	lan	wan	lan
the client and server exist in the same organisation typically a lan perhaps a wan vpn situation

201352
inherited	properties
the size of the stack is a properties inherited between processes

201352
zsh	tcsh
if you can read or modify it in the the shell using commands like ulimit -s in sh ksh zsh or limit stacksize tcsh zsh

201367
sorting	filtering
dataset automatic sorting filtering

201377
min	max
for example i am trying to get a min date a max date and a sum in different instances

201400
bash	zsh
the obvious candidates for an interactive shell are bash dash zsh and pd ksh

201400
bash	zsh
pick whichever you like for interactive use i d tend to go with bash just because it s the standard on linux but they all have their merits and zsh in particular seems popular

201406
opera	safari
but somehow this seems to trigger a reload in safari opera and mozilla -- no matter what the event handler contains

201435
factors	mean
although the question asks for the largest prime factors it doesn t necessarily mean you have to find that one first.

201457
post	get
where the query string can be a specified get post variable or a string passed to the interpreter

201520
mouse	keyboard
i can figure out how to capture keyboard events and mouse events

201523
symfony	kohana	cakephp	kohana
check out projects such as -- in no particular order -- zend framework cakephp symfony code ignitor kohana solar and akelos

201560
int	chars
wp64.cpp 10 warning c4311 reinterpret_cast pointer truncation from const chars to unsigned int

201581
getter	setter
i agree with ya ll that they should be using getter setter and just set the _table to private

201585
inherited	properties
...is it possible to inherited a properties from one style into another style

201623
ant	maven
at any rate the maven conventions work just fine for ant so if you ve already got them in place just re-use the same structures

201683
ant	emma
the user guide has a good example of how to set up your build script so that you not only seperate the instrumented code from the execution but it s also all contained in the same so that you don t have to run a series of different targets but instead you can just do something like ant emma tests if ant tests was how you normally ran your unit tests for example

201696
getter	setter
i have a sessionhelper class that manages the session setter getter

201705
hash	md5
do i need to worry about collisions in the md5 hash value that gets produced

201705
hash	md5
bonus how many files could i have before i d start seeing collisions in the hash value that md5 produces

201774
webclient	webrequest
shawn wildermuth gives a great overview of the two options you have webclient and webrequest

201798
firefox	safari
i had the same problem but only in internet explorer i tested version 7 - not in firefox 3 or safari 3

201803
ilist	icollection
ilist is good but sometimes you may need icollection functionality or want to specify values that are readonly

201820
post	get
http was designed to do queries or searches through the query string thus the name and to get a form to post to a query string instead of the body you need to use a get method

201835
ienumerable	ilist
by using ilist you make this a requirement so that nobody can inadvertently return an ienumerable

201922
yacc	bison
since the code is 20 years old scrap down the parser syntax analyzer and replace it with one of the newer lex yacc bison or anything similar etc based c++ code much more maintainable and easier to understand

201922
boost	stl
if you have some time left try replacing data structures one by one to use the more standardized stl or boost

201950
postgresql	mysql
postgresql gets much better performance and this is coming from a former mysql partisan

201950
nginx	lighttpd
why not go with something light-weight like nginx or lighttpd

201969
jar	manifest.mf
this is a jar containing only a manifest.mf file whose class-path specifies the disk paths of your long list of jars etc

201970
post	get
there are a few ways round this make the search a normal html form and make itperform a get not a post and mentioned by nick

201993
rss	feed
my computer at home is set up to automatically download some stuff from rss feed mostly torrents and podcasts

201993
rss	feed
magpie rss for php can do caching but that s only to avoid retrieving the feed too much not really storing more entries

201998
free	malloc
they can be allocated deallocated and reallocated dynamically using the new delete operators in c++ and malloc free in c

202008
rss	feed
sounds like you want some sort of service that checks the rss feed every x minutes so you can download every single article item published to the feed while you are watching it rather than only seeing the items displayed on the feed when you go to view it

202033
istream	getline
you can use the std istream getline or preferably the version that works on std string function to get an entire line

202044
rss	feed
i think what you mean to say is that if you have a doget dopost method which contains code to build the data needed for the rss feed from scratch then each request triggers this fetching of data over and over again

202050
ienumerable	ilist
i m not sure i d do so for a shared class library though in general i d avoid exposing a keyedcollection in a public api instead i would expose ilist t in a public api and consumers of the api who need keyed access can define their own internal keyedcollection with a constructor that takes an ienumerable titem and populates the collection with it

202050
serializable	deserialization
regarding serializable there is also a performance problem that i reported to microsoft connect the keyedcollection maintains an internal dictionary as well as a list and serializable both - it is sufficient to serializable the list as the dictionary can easily be recreated on deserialization

202068
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
seeing as the majority of traffic to the hosted sites would end up at their top level domain this would result in only static media hits the html page with the embedded flash movie i could set up lighttpd or nginx to handle those requests and pass the django stuff back to apache mod_whatever

202075
min	max
256 bytes assuming 2048 bit key - 42 bytes min oeap padding 214 bytes max plaintext size

202095
mvp	presenter
it s generally a good idea to minimize the amount of things you do in a code behind and instead push logic into a presenter class and follow the mvp pattern for asp.net web forms development

202122
lxml	elementtree
lxml has support for cdata and api like elementtree

202174
outputstream	inputstream
it is much like an inputstream and outputstream but it allows reading and writing wherever you like

202187
bazaar	git
this might not be a viable option but perhaps you could use a distributed system like bazaar git or mercurial

202187
folder	directory
i know with bazaar the repository is simply a hidden folder added to the directory

202188
opensuse	linux
i have tested all my systems developed in delphi in windows xp on wine opensuse linux and they work perfectly

202195
trie	tree
this is quite an achievement that can t possibly be beaten by a search tree trie

202224
httphandler	httpmodule
another possibility for your threadabortexception is any code that runs outside the page request lifecycle on the server side such as httpmodule and httphandler

202250
trie	tree
okay so the naiive trie encodes string keys by starting at the root of the tree and moving down branches that match each letter in the key starting at the first letter of the key

202273
superclass	subclassing
i would like to know what file the subclassing resides in from the superclass

202293
rss	feed
i then add the rss feed to itunes

202303
folder	directory
if you re running windows use the junction utility from ms and map your share directory to the webcontent folder

202308
inherited	subclassing
each subclassing would need to have an explicitly implemented method that returned __file__ which completely defeats the point of inherited in the first place

202323
rss	feed
a valid rss feed or your internet

202344
rss	feed
is there any way to get numbers on how many people are reading an rss feed

202347
rss	feed
try the rss feed for the main page

202347
rss	feed
edit whoops as the comments rightly point out looks like it s an atom feed not an rss feed i should have double checked before posting

202347
rss	feed
i tried running the feed through feedburner to convert it to rss but vs still doesn t like it

202362
rss	feed
if you are hosting your own rss feed you can parse the iis or apache logs to find all requests for the feed and then do some processing to aggregate these per machine

202362
rss	feed
you can also use google s feedburner to generate an rss feed that basically redirects to your real feed

202366
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	ienumerator	ienumerator	icollection	ilist	icollection	ilist	ienumerator
i have found many pieces of documentations and recommendations about ienumerator ienumerable icollection ilist and their generic counterparts

202371
put	get
plus you get these little widgets that you can put on the page the yellow box on perlbuzz that gives the count of current readers

202416
rss	feed
it appears that is actually an atom feed and not rss so that is probably where the vs issue is coming from

202465
post	get
this is the story behind don t change data on get but only on post

202465
post	get
crawlers will happily follow get never post

202467
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
ilist icollection ienumerable

202547
opera	firefox
is there one set of proxy settings in windows used by all browsers probably ie s or would i have to write different routines for ie firefox opera etc

202573
inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
there are a couple of interfaces that you could implement that help with change tracking and undo inotifypropertychanged and ieditableobject

202654
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	idictionary	ilist	icollection	idictionary	icollection	idictionary	ilist
idictionary ilist icollection ienumerable

202658
superclass	subclassing
you can start with the unit which acts as a superclass then you can have a team as a subclassing of unit

202706
ubuntu	linux
i ve never been entirely satisfied with linux whenever i decided to install a distro like ubuntu fedora etc

202709
listview	gridview	gridview	formview
formview gridview and listview

202713
google-chrome	firefox
with google-chrome firefox etc

202755
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is a free database engine which is well scalable and widely used besides mysql

202762
vb.net	vb6
also they have something similar over at codeproject asynchronous processing - basics and a walkthrough with vb6 vb.net

202790
rss	feed
i have an ldquo rdquo and several other entities under my rss feed

202836
factors	mean
this depends on many factors when you refer to the cache do you mean the standard cache provided by asp.net

202934
subnet	packets
if necessary you can even make this a broadcast packets if you don t know who the clients are and they are on the same subnet as the server so long as the server isn t too chatty

202939
django	web.py
i already found out about django and web.py

202948
kde	gnome
you should know that using any theme that is not officially supported by gnome kde can have bugs

203008
opera	firefox
this function is used by firefox and opera to get their proxy settings by default although you can override them per-browser

203012
kde	gnome
with linux there s not only different window managers gnome kde flux openbox enlightenment etc etc there s different ui toolkits qt gtk+ tk wx etc etc different versions in common use and countless different ways of using implementing them

203012
ubuntu	linux
as for a nice integrated linux desktop environment - i would say the default ubuntu installation is probably the closest to this

203023
google-chrome	firefox
there s the prism add-on for firefox and google-chrome has this functionality built-in

203033
keydown	keyup	textchanged	keyup
in the combobox i handle the keydown textchanged and keyup events which fire in that order

203033
keydown	keyup	textchanged	keyup
if i go from keydown to keyup with textchanged skipped i check whether the character was a keys.q or keys.oemperiod

203036
folder	directory
the files in the install directory are inheriting their security attributes from the parent folder

203066
temp	tmp
the temp directory is usually located under the user profile both tmp and temp usually point here so copying files here will have permissions for that user

203090
put	get
what s a windows command line statement s i can use to get the current datetime in a format that i can put into a filename

203094
folder	directory
if you really want to move them to a different location creating a temp folder in the same place as the files to be patched would help the permissions stay the same assuming the directory is using inherited permissions

203171
post	put
and no i m not trying to put malicious bookmarklets in so or anything but i want to use markdown for my site and would like to post some bookmarklets i wrote

203226

203247
post	get
part of the query string in the url for a get or the data for a post

203256
maven	pom.xml
it s simply a maven plugin that generates the .project and .classpath file based on the contents of the pom.xml you just run mvn eclipse eclipse and you re done

203266
django	turbogears	pylons	turbogears
i would recommend looking at the wikipedia articles for django turbogears pylons etc

203266
turbogears	cherrypy
personally i like turbogears a lot since it is based on well-known components cherrypy for web serving and url routing kid for templates and sqlobject for object-relational mapping

203302
subtract	add
it is not possible to simply add or subtract a value as the dates do not have a regular gap between them

203358
tabcontrol	tabitem
i want to set a style on the first and last tabitem in a tabcontrol and have them updated as the visibility of the tabitem is changed

this also lets us address an issue with tabcontrol where it will display the content of a non-visible tabitem if none of the visible tabitem are selected.

203360
cobertura	checkstyle	checkstyle	cpd
this tool claims to support automatically integrating the output of pmd cpd findbugs checkstyle and cobertura into a single html report

203384

203399
postgresql	mysql
what is the best way to write a case insensitive query that is compatible with both mysql and postgresql

203410
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard and mouse hooks are what i find to be most valuable

203420
mouse	keyboard
i implemented a global keyboard and mouse hook during anappaday

203426
doc	rtf
i think i can use the rtf generation to create a doc-readable file that can then be edited using doc and re-saved

203428
postgresql	mysql
i m not sure if there is an equivalent for mysql but you can always do this which is a bit ugly but should work in both mysql and postgresql

203561
nsstring	nsdata
if you want to use cocoa nsstring and nsdata have methods for reading writing to file and nsfilemanager gives you file operations

203566
wordpress	phpbb
on one blog forum combination we hacked together the signup procedure so that people filled in one form to sign up to both wordpress and phpbb at the same time

203577
width	height
the real goal is to find the average width and height of a font character

203580
inherited	properties
another thought is you could inherited textbox and add properties to your custom textbox so the textbox handles it s own state

203630
switching	screens
to some extent this became handled in screens readers by the reader switching between a table mode and a layout mode based on what it saw inside the table

203642
int	boolean
i like to prefix my variables with what they re going to be str string int int bool boolean etc

203739
opera	google-chrome
it s the same in ff3 ie7 opera and google-chrome

submit	submission
download site submission tools use this spec to make it easier for authors to submit their software

203810
accessor	properties
the very first thing that i ask myself is did i have a good reason not to use a properties accessor to update that field

203810
accessor	properties
i know when a variable s the backing field of a properties accessor or temporary or an argument to the current method because my naming conventions tell me that

203883
mockups	prototyping
using photoshop to design your will also be wasted effort - far better to use evolutionary prototyping rad technique with css html - but still do pen paper mockups of your intentions

203913
internationalization	localization
it covers the application globalisation internationalization and localization options in detail with pros and cons and excellent examples and also topics i hadn t considered such as localising the deployment clickonce and setup projects

203933
strcpy	strncpy	fgets	strncpy	fgets	strcpy
functions such as gets and strcpy are replaced with their safer counterparts like fgets and strncpy which have a length argument to prevent buffer overruns

203966
directx	gdi
but you can do the trick by creating a converter class which will accept all output graphics from your gdi designed application classes and convert the format to fit the needs of directx or sdl classes depending what do you want to use

203966
directx	gdi
so i think you can do the same for converting gdi - directx or gdi - sdl

203971
inherited	properties
it also isn t possible to map l2s entities that leverage inherited which means that every entity must have properties for created-on created-by etc

204025
postgresql	mysql
what do i have to consider in database design for a new application which should be able to support the most common relational database systems sql server mysql oracle postgresql ...

204150
cpython	pypy
the global interpreter lock in the cpython and pypy runtimes preclude this option

204152
hash	md5
you can then use a javascript md5 library to generate a hash password by combining the random string and the password pwhash md5 randomstring+password

204180
versioning	upgrade
there s a general point here worth making i think that you can only automate db versioning and upgrade so far - the abstractions are very leaky

204186
interrupt	wakeup
however my code is not calling wakeup or interrupt to initiate these returns

204203
3des	sha	rsa	3des
rsa with 3des cbc sha

204279
vb6	vba
to make it even more confusing i do a lot of work with excel vba which is still vb6

204333
hex	binary
this project claims to have a reusable hex editor component be.hexeditor - that would probably be the best way to edit random binary data

204402
ioexception	objectoutputstream
private void writeobject objectoutputstream out throws ioexception

204402
ioexception	objectinputstream
private void readobject objectinputstream in throws ioexception classnotfoundexception

204412
post	get
by putting a breakpoint in the backend and holding a request there for 30 seconds i can see from trace.axd that the post is taking 3ms and the get is taking 4s

204442
sorting	filtering
the adjacency model also described on the page you link to provides for the most flexible sorting and filtering but with a significant performance impact

204447
concave	convex
have a search for no fit polygon on the web and see if you can find an algorithm for convex polygons it gets much more complex if you have concave polygons

204477
bazaar	trac	bazaar	git
slicehost + trac + subversion mercurial git bazaar

204537
put	get
or to really get some reuse going put the logic in a service

204606
128bit	64bit
however on 64bit systems there does not seem to be a standard 128bit integer

204747
listview	gridview
i m converting functionality from an asp.net gridview to a listview

204756
min	max
you might also want to take a look at changing the min max number of threads that tomcat will use to handle requests in conf server.xml

204757
svg	vml
its api will draw svg canvas vml depending on the capabilities of the browser

204776
put	get
you may be able to use usesubmitbehavior true and put a method get on the form

204778
django	web.py
also this post by the web.py author is a very good explanation of why i much prefer web.py over django

204794
ant	maven
so the first thing i do with a project is establish how it will be built java ant or maven

204831

204853
postgresql	mysql
i can t speak to the mysql postgresql question as i have limited experience with postgresql but my masters research project was about high-performance websites with cherrypy and i don t think you ll be disappointed if you use cherrypy for your site

204909
mbunit	nunit
testdriven.net - unit testing add on for vs that is fully integrated with all major unit testing frameworks including nunit mbunit etc.

204916
disk	ram
in short nginx is a fast and light webserver front-proxy with a unique module that let s it fetch data directly from memcached s ram store without hitting the disk or any dynamic webapp

204916
post	put
note that if your url scheme for the ajax traffic is well designed rest is best imho you can put most of the db right in memcached and any post which will pass to the app can preemptively update the cache

204965
hash	salt
in server s response displaying the form create a magic hash based on client ip + date time + random salt whatever

204982
rss	feed
the feed needs to be tranformed into rss from atom and there is a really good xsl stylesheet here that fits the bill specifically

204982
rss	feed
then you should be able to enjoy the rss feed from stackoverflow.com in you start page in visual studio that is of course if you are into that kind of thing

204988
post	put
still it s not ideal as it s custom and it s down to me to put it as near to the end of the post cycle as possible

205096
cpython	pypy
the same author that is working on jit in pypy wrote psyco previously which optimizes python in the cpython interpreter

205119
photoshop	paint.net
if this is something you will be doing on an occasional basis and doesn t need automating you can do it in an image editor that supports layers such as photoshop or paint shop pro probably gimp or paint.net too but i m not sure about those

205155
jquery	scriptaculous
is there a way to quickly create a work-a-like with the additional animation support in jquery scriptaculous or mootools

205157
cvs	svn
the cvs and svn command sets are very similar and require minimal adjustment

205178
prng	random
dev urandom is like dev random but when the entopy is exhausted a cryptographic hash is employed which makes the entropy pool effectively a stateful prng

205235
jobs	cron
also you could use them on the gae if that is the route you decide to take although you should keep in mind that the gae does not support cron jobs which can limit your functionality

205244
google-chrome	firefox
both mozilla firefox and google-chrome load the web site perfectly with no hassles

205251
queue	fifo
work items are queue up centrally and need to be processed in an essentially fifo order

205295
pull	push
from there on out you can clone and pull from the central repository and push to the central repository

205332
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the web site now loads perfectly in microsoft internet explorer and apple safari as well as mozilla firefox and google-chrome

205356
getter	setter
if you want an easy way to copy from type a to type b then you could try beanutils.copyproperties as long as the setter and getter of type a and type b match

205364
postgresql	mysql
mysql i am told can be optimized to do faster reads than postgresql but both are pretty ridiculously fast in terms of # transactions sec they support and it doesn t sound like that s your problem

205425
postgresql	mysql
on the db question i d say postgresql scales better and has better data integrity than mysql

205483
filesystems	ntfs
i also find this one useful when copying between linux filesystems and ntfs

205486
put	get
i get a little fed up sometimes with co-workers who excessively put everything into its own method or class or file and this becomes a nightmare to navigate

205527
jobs	cron	rss	feed
because i run a blog aggregator website which checks a large list of rss feed for new posts every hour so i will be happy if its possible to use google feed api or google ajax feed api instead of making the cron jobs to read the whole feed to know if its updated or not

205569
width	height
then you call glteximage2d or whatever passing it a pointer to the first pixel of the subimage and the width and height of the subimage

205592
folder	directory
i m assuming you have frompath an absolute path for a folder and topath an absolute path for a folder file and your re looking for a path that with represent the file folder in topath as a relative path from frompath your current working directory is frompath then something like this should work

205610
getter	setter
what finally convinced me was the fairly obvious point in retrospect that properties in .net are just syntactic sugar for getter and setter methods and those methods have a different name from the property itself

205612
accessor	properties
putting light weight properties accessor in up front saves a phenomenal amount of heartache should a bug arise involving the field you wrapped

205626
accessor	properties
it s much easier to debug a problem involving a field if it is wrapped by a properties accessor

205628
post	get
i might as well post the basic code i used to get everything i needed using wmi as was suggested here

205648
width	height
4.make the height and width 100

205649
postgresql	mysql
i say database because it is column-oriented a very different model from row-oriented databases like mysql postgresql oracle etc

205688
opera	safari
i know ie and gecko browsers support window.onerror but what about opera and safari

205726
vim	emacs
you can use pylint for such things and there seems to be a way to integrate it into emacs but i ve never done the latter b c i m a vim user

205774
vmware	virtualbox
i used to use virtualpc but i really hated not having any type of snapshot feature like vmware and virtualbox have

205800
mouse	keyboard
the functionality we need is to specify which application is shared and also to give the viewers permission to control the mouse and keyboard

205821
logmein	hamachi
i use logmein and hamachi for remote desktop and vpn solutions

205884
google-chrome	safari
webkit safari google-chrome etc now appears to support onerror

205902
post	get
you shouldn t trust anything that comes in over http - it s trivial to manufacture a get or post request

205959
boost	stl
in general if there s a basic library functionality that you want that s not in the stl the fix is to look at boost

205982
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
window.onerror catches all errors in ie and most errors in firefox but does nothing in safari and opera

205997
for-loop	loops
if you need the index rather than using a for each loops i would just use a for-loop that went through the indices so you know what you have

206012
hash	md5
i want to generate unique filenames per image so i m using md5 to make filenames.since two of the same image could come from different locations i d like to actually base the hash on the image contents

206134
pop-up	dialog
from a practice standpoint - excluding accessibility - modal windows provide an alternative that are less startling as say dialog boxes and feel less intrusive than pop-up windows

206134
pop-up	dialog
i think that when used correctly they provide a decent experience - if something has to get my attention then i d rather it do so without redirecting me from the page showing an ugly operating system themed dialog or a pop-up which my browser will likely block anyway

206146
getter	setter
there is no need for getter setter and no-arg constructors just to satisfy the tools

206153
queue	fifo
queue are for fifo order not random access order

206159
mouse	keyboard
to achieve a multiple selection tree control you will need to draw the tree items yourself and override the keyboard and mouse handling

206159
children	parent
don t forget to consider selection rules are parent and children allowed for example and don t forget to implement the keyboard shortcuts including selection using ctrl shift and ctrl+shift as well as the spacebar for selecting deselecting

206165
hash	md5
if you re still concerned using a combination of sha-1 plus md5 as another answer suggested gets you to a total of 288 high-quality hash bits which means you ll have a 50 chance of a collision once there are 2 144 files

206169
ninject	spring.net
microsoft s unity ioc container vs castle windsor spring.net ninject etc

206198
accessor	properties
but actually my properties is of type iplugininfo and a plugininfo type implementing iplugininfo is instatiated and returned in the info properties get accessor like this

206258
trac	bugzilla
has anyone implemented functionality within trac or using external tools to get the functionality of the bugzilla whine

206275
hash	md5
there are pairs of different files with the same md5 hash not theoretical

206275
hash	md5
for your application this means someone could upload two different images which would have the same md5 hash or someone could generate such a pair of images and publish them somewhere in the internet such that two of your users will later try to upload them with confusing results

206289
free	calloc
you d have to keep track of how many void were originally calloc d and iterate over them free-ing each one then free the original values variable

206296
free	malloc
i would malloc the individual pieces of the array i need and then free them when i m done i suppose

206296
free	malloc
you can t free something you didn t first malloc

206299
free	malloc
edit you re also asking for trouble by alternating between c++-style new delete with c-style malloc free

206299
free	malloc
it is okay to use them both as long as you don t delete something you malloc ed or free something you new ed but you re going to mix them up in your head if you go like this

206309
put	get
monorail and the related castle projects always seem a bit disjointed which will put off the less than expert developer just looking to get started

206318
fiddler	charles
aside from fiddler charles and poster firefox plug in

206320
folder	directory
i m using grep to get a list of all files and folder in the given directory but i don t know which of the values returned is a folder name and which is a file with no file extention

206325
sorting	filtering
the data layer returns iqueryable which permits the consuming layer to apply filtering and sorting expression on top of that

206325
sorting	filtering
the bonus is being able to specify a single getproducts method for example and then decide appropriately in the consuming layer how you want that sorting filtering or even just a particular range of results

206365
put	get
you would have to get them to upload the image to your server then put the jpeg on a page with javascript to call window.print

206409
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
every browser that supports xhtml firefox opera safari ie9 supports self-closing syntax on every element

206443
installation	upgrade
snapshots and rollbacks are nice too but i use them only occasionally really useful during installation upgrade tests

206443
versioning	upgrade
suppose you re developing a new versioning of your software and checking that the upgrade from the previous versioning works correctly.

206456
solaris	aix
the oda products are compiled for a number of operating systems including windows 32-bit sgi solaris windows 64-bit macintosh hp windows ce linux ibm aix

206484
put	get
i know that i shouldn t have to put locationid at the end of each one but i can t get the syntax even close to being correct

206496
free	calloc
also note though it is not illegal to use both new delete and calloc free in the same piece of code it is frowned upon

206497
ant	maven
the normal apporoach works the other way around you create your build based upon maven or ant and then use integrations for your ide of choice so that you are independent from it which is esp

206510
swt	swing
you already have the choice of swing and swt can you really do better than these two teams

206515
width	height
tmonitor has properties indicating the left top width height etc. so all the information you need is there

206534
filesystems	fat
is to move them to a fat filesystems

206534
filesystems	ntfs
then move again to ntfs filesystems

206574
put	get
to get a very rough estimation i could just put nslog calls on either side of the code i wanted to profile but it seems like the processor being otherwise very busy could skew the results

206575
int	chars
the only way i can think that this would cause a performance loss is that the compiler has to compare the entire int to 0 and then assign the bool appropriately unlike a conversion such as a chars to bool where the result can be copied over because a bool is one byte and so they are effectively the same or an integral conversion which involves copying some or all of the source to the destination possibly after a zero of the destination if it s bigger than the source in terms of memory

206642
swt	swing
i d go look at the source for the swing and or swt as they are already implemented

206643
put	get
my understanding is that you can store it prior to authorization but i could never get anyone that would put that in writing

206658
width	height
you can get the width and height from there too to know the dimensions

206674
profiler	shark
xcode includes an excellent profiler tool called shark . for some versions it s found in developer applications

206695
profiling	debugging
in addition to having seriously powerful real-time debugging capabilities phped from nusphere www.nusphere.com has a built-in profiling that can be run with a single click from inside the ide

206722
post	put
a separate post detailing how to put everything together is probably in order

206764
rss	feed
are there any popular mysql rss feed you guys can recommend

206939
hash	md5
next i need to update the md5 fields with the hash of the file contents

206941
google-chrome	firefox
now that firefox s awesome bar and google-chrome s omnibox address bars can be used to search the browsing history it makes it much easier for users to search their history for previously visited sites so having clean urls may help the user find sites in their history more easily

206941
google-chrome	firefox
since both firefox and google-chrome search for each space separated word typed into the address bar it could be argued that it isn t necessary for searching that the url be completely human readable but to allow the user to actually read the keywords they are interested in from the url the amount of noise should be kept to a minimum

206942
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql are very fast to connect mysql especially and thus usually connect on each request

207014
folder	dir
i think enso does this because they have a dir in their folder called chrome.

207020
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome browser is based on webkit as used by safari

207059
vim	emacs
or from emacs or vim you could run python -c import x where x is the name of your file minus the .py extension

207062
google-chrome	firefox
firefox also has the word google-chrome all over its code base

207112
wan	lan
for the lan wan you can use a combination of the following win32 api calls to tell you whether the remote connection exists without having to deal with a network time-out

207160
postgresql	mysql
bmdhacks is right that if you re using mysql or postgresql it doesn t matter as much since connections are pretty cheap

207350
accessor	properties
use the accessor to set up the private properties of the class in some known way instead of using the classes methods to do so

207424
maven	m2e
all my java projects are built with maven so i use maven to generate an eclipse project with classpaths etc already setup with a simple mvn eclipse m2e

207446
integer	fractions
the three subpatterns that are used more than once are the optional sign the digit sequence for an integer and the decimal fractions

207446
integer	fractions
notice that the decimal fractions pattern is the first place where we can reuse the integer pattern

207496
preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder	postorder	inorder
i don t see how my traversals could change at all since it is really only a matter of where i m proccessing the node that should effect the inorder preorder and postorder

207498
maven	m2e
i am running both maven inside the m2e plugin windows command line and my cygwin command line

207554
post	get
for get requests i can do this with ajax and jsonp but that doesn t work with post requests

207554
post	get
post to a copy on local subdomain with minimal response then get full response from central location with jsonp

207554
post	get
both post and get to a copy on local subdomain with json

207560
invokelater	invokeandwait
invokelater and invokeandwait really must be used when you are doing any interaction with gui components from any thread that is not the edt

207568
swt	swing
that said though i find swing easier to work with at a code level than swt

207648
aptana	radrails
after that you can install radrails from aptana s start page

207648
aptana	radrails
please refer to aptana radrails an ide for rails development published by packt publishing when using radrails

207652
klocwork	coverity
what i d like to know is how the commercial products such as klocwork and coverity stack up against these

207669
versioning	upgrade
according to him it should be very simple to upgrade from fancyupload2 to the new versioning once it s released

207678
cvs	svn
svn cvs very convinient integration

207704
sorting	filtering
enhanced version of content query web part that has the same functionality like a regular list web part views filtering sorting easy to use interface

207720
width	height
in my applications i have a lot of dynamically generated iframe and i want them all do a sort of autoresize at the end of the load event to adjust their height and width

207720
firefox	safari
i ve studied and tested tons of properties regarding document height in firefox ie safari documentelement.clientheight documentelement.offsetheight documentelement.scrollheight body.offsetheight body.scrollheight .

207720
firefox	safari
does someone have a real cross-browser at least firefox ie safari solution

207730
superclass	subclassing
the idea being i can easily create lots of similar subclassing from a number of superclass which have similar characteristics

207768
boost	stl
is there an elegant way to do this with less lines of code using stl functionality and not using boost

207824
public	protected
looking at preferences- javascript- appearance- members sort order it seems able to indicate whether a method is public private or protected but all of my use the default marker a blue triangle

207829
comparator	comparable
-it must be an ordered list currently synchronizing on an arraylist although not a sorted list not sorted using comparable or comparator but according to insertion order

207858
installation	upgrade
my only experience with 4 was trying an upgrade on the heavily-customised installation

207871
ubuntu	debian
i use ubuntu debian

207906
ienumerable	icollection
for example the icollection interface implements ienumerable while adding additional methods

207911
free	malloc
each malloc you do has a size-tag in it so you do not need to state the size of the chunk you pointed for free -routine

207989
width	height
yes nilesh - the height and width methods

207996
ffmpeg	libavformat
ffmpeg s libavcodec and libavformat are your friend

208003
std	ostream
returning from operator allows the chaining of operator like on std ostream s

208008
versioning	upgrade
2 edit i have upgrade my f# versioning to 1.9.6.2 and still the same consequence

208011
sudo	passwd
the root passwd is disabled and people have to use sudo to get root access

208033
width	height
the loading works ok except that it remains 0 because the width height never change from 0

208033
width	height
i had to override the width height get properties to make it work

208033
width	height
especially since the swf has multiple frames and the frames are of different width height

208033
width	height
why aren t width height working in the first place

208040
sudo	passwd
if you have ssh access via your certificates can t you log in via ssh and change the root passwd via passwd or sudo passwd when you need to do something else that requires the passwd

208044
sudo	passwd
we use the sudo only policy where i work but root passwd are still kept

208193
vim	emacs
as someone who uses vim for programming and works in an environment where most all of my colleagues use either vim or emacs for all of their work what are the advantages of ides

208233
vim	emacs
you can have all this and some more using separate tools or just a great programmable editor and extra tools like emacs vim as well but has a little less idebility imo

208234
hide	show
i also want to hide the form and show a thank you panel before the redirect takes place however it seems the asp.net engine just does the redirect without doing the 2 tasks before in the following code

208260
bash	zsh
in bash and zsh you can do this with brace expansion

208262
hide	show
i d therefore want to be able to access all instances of the plugin within the page and access their show hide validate submit functions in unison

208282
ubuntu	debian
if you are running on a debian or ubuntu system i suggest installing the authbind package which will allow you to grant your program permission to open privileged ports without actually having to give your program any other special permissions

208282
ubuntu	debian
if you re running on any other system i suggest installing debian or ubuntu

208292
put	get
put the spreadsheet on a confluence wiki where we can edit it via webdav and get locking and versioning

208299
vim	emacs
although i know with addins you can probably get a lot of this with emacs and vim

208409
hide	show
hide it client-side with javascript and then do the redirect or do two postbacks first postback to hide the form and show the thank-you and the second to do the redirect once the thank-you has been rendered to the screen

208449
jstl	taglib
as phill mentioned the display tag taglib is very good for this but it s actually really easy to do using jstl

208468
versioning	upgrade
what issues or refactoring did you have to do when you upgrade from asp.net mvc preview 5 to the newly released beta versioning

208471
hide	show
i m using jquery to hide and show elements when a radio button group is altered clicked

208503
tcombobox	tmemo
just put a tcombobox and a tmemo on a form and replace the code with this

208569
ant	maven
this means that your project should not rely on any ide-specific files to build but rather use an external build system like maven ant or even make or custom scripts

208588
getter	setter
in myactionclass you will have to declare the property next with its getter and setter

208601
getter	setter
this style of notation is more useful when you mix acessibility for the getter and setter

208601
getter	setter
you could also put an internal setter or even make the getter private and the setter public

208628
hide	show
any window that must be show above some other window specifies that window as its owner when being created - if you have multiple document windows each one gets its own set of owned child windows that you can dynamically show and hide as the document window gains and looses activation

208632
mouse	keyboard
this means that you are using the actual hardware network comms and all but with screen keyboard and mouse reflected to the screen

208707
min	max
each salary component has 3 rules associated with it a calculation rule calculate component as of another component or of a fixed number or a fixed number an eligibility rule whether an employee dept is eligible for a component and a constraint rule which limits tha max and min of a component

208728
ingres	mysql
where there is no mvcc mysql ingres it is a trick to get around locking problems that can slow performance or cause the locking system to run out of locks if not properly tuned

208728
ingres	mysql	informix	ingres
in mysql db2 ingres informix not sure about sql server sybase it can be used to bypass the lock management facility for performance

208730
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button are on off switches that may be toggled by the user

208730
opera	firefox
for me the following markup produces a checkbox which is checked in ie firefox and opera as you d expect based on the spec

208773
spweb	spsite
q when should you dispose spweb and spsite objects

208789
daemon	cron
then your cron job can just try to start the daemon every 30 minutes

208883
post	get	post	put	put	httpverbs	put	get
added a new httpverbs enumeration that contains the most commonly used http verbs get post put delete head

208883
post	put
for example the following snippet shows an action method that can respond to both post and put requests

208907
ftgl	sdl-ttf
that said when i had your problem i eventually went with ftgl as the way sdl-ttf produces an sdl-surface with its font rendered on it overcomplicated matters in my situation

208985
x86	64bit
i am on vista 64bit and i have a project built with x86 configuration

208993
pop-up	dialog
but when i try with ie7 vista the pop-up opens and closes after about a second without displaying the file download dialog

209008
drools	jess
good free rule engines for java is drools some people also like jess which is a clips clone

versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning look for bug reports post on the mailing list switch to another product

209110
hide	show
what i want to do is at run time show and hide one of these panes

209110
hide	show
whilst with the following code i can show and hide the view associated with the pane i can t temporarily remove the pane itself

209147
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
according to some - browser - statistics ie6 market share is still bigger than google-chrome safari and opera together nearly as much as ie7

209171
bash	tcsh
add it to your .cshrc file for csh and tcsh .profile file for sh and ksh or .bash_profile file for bash

209194
width	height
use a tween to tween the height from 0 to whatever height you want and width from 0 to whatever width you want

209242
hide	show
specifically i need to show hide items on a page depending upon whether the currently logged in user is part of domain groupa in active directory

209246
put	get
you need to get out the string call the function and put it s result in place as above

209353
g++	gcc
gcc g++

209353
perl	tcl
a scripting language bash ruby python tcl perl

209383
put	get
i could make a temp table to put the results in but because there are 80 columns so i would need to make an 80 column temp table just to get 2 columns

209384
delphi	oxygene
if you must move to .net yeah i know you didn t make the decision someone with less information did then i would suggest using delphi for .net or remobjects oxygene

209396
post	get
for me asp.net always worked fine -- if http request contains a valid post i can get to values using request.form.

209422
jobs	cron
we have cron jobs that run every minute and they don t have any noticeable effect on performance

209427
margin	height
to expand on mitchel sellers answer give your content div height 100 and give it a auto margin

209463
bash	tcsh
the tricky part of trying to do this is the fact that the user could have their shell set to anything sh bash csh tcsh and so on and each shell sets up its terminal environment differently

209463
info	dscl
on os x this info is stored in directory services which can be accesed either through the apis in directoryservice.framework or by using the dscl command line tool

209491
firefox	safari
this is only an ie issue as firefox and safari work just fine

209534
vim	emacs
please don t reply i should use ddd nemiver emacs vim or any other front-end i just prefer gdb as it is but would like to see its output with some terminal colors

209553
rss	feed
the final improvement was that if we did want to follow a specific app more closely say after making a change we could subscribe to an rss feed for that specific application until we were satisfied

209569
profiling	instrumentation
assuming you want to profiling a whole app not just a snippet of code and that your app is written in c c++ objective-c not ruby and that you re using xcode 3.0 or higher you should also check out the instrumentation application

209576
boost	stl
i also recommend you learn the stl and boost - the latter is especially useful when writing c++ apps in linux as you get libraries for threading file system regex etc

209576
boost	stl
this is how i got started in linux - i took a windows project and converted to use the stl boost and added a browser-based ui

209601
post	get
web applications using get and post allow users to create view modify and delete their data but do so at a layer above the http commands originally created for these purposes

209624
hide	show
dannysmurf gives you one example - ceditview - of a cview that creates a caret that you can show and hide

209705
wtl	atl
obviously there is no atl or wtl in the unix world.

209731
kde	gnome
ideally the solution should allow me to apply a look and feel that looks like the underlying windowing system ie windows lnf for windows gtk lnf for gnome gtk qt lnf for kde qt the default one for other platforms

209731
swt	swing
however swing with gtk lnf would be the best solution to avoid the hassle of swt native libraries and jgoodies extra jars also jgoodies lnf doesn t look as integrated as swing gtk under gnome

209732
put	get
however if i actually put an alert called inside this if statement like line 4 it becomes consistent and i get the result i want

209742
gentoo	linux
i would recommend you to start by using gentoo it should be hard the first weeks but after a while say 2 months and less if you have basic linux understand you will be able to use every distribution and you will know exactly what will happen and how on your system when you press digit something i think that you will be re-paid for this more time learn gentoo is a bit harder then other distros spent on gentoo

209770
min	max
each salary component has 3 rules associated with it a calculation rule calculate component as of another component or of a fixed number or a fixed number an eligibility rule whether an employee dept is eligible for a component and a constraint rule which limits tha max and min of a component

209779
rss	feed
i ll post it in the future so subscribe to this questions rss feed if you want to be informed of the update

209862
opera	firefox
this page displays beautifully in firefox but i get all kinds of problems when testing the site in opera or internet explorer mostly with the menu

209875
pthreads	fork
after posting about this problem online i got some feedback indicating that this should not occur on newer versions of linux since they implement the pthreads fork method using copy-on-write presumably meaning it will only copy pages that it needs to modify when it is required instead of the entire address space immediately

209945
ws-addressing	soap
has several protocols and technologies relating to it wsdl xsds soap ws-addressing

209945
put	get
for example to obtain a resource you use http get to put a resource on the server you use http put

209945
post	get	post	put	put	get
rest is a very simple in that it uses http get post and put methods to update resources on the server

209981
cpu	processors
this loop repeats infinitely until some state of some game element or input tells it to stop or quit. this approach keeps the cpu and graphics card pretty busy hence the market for gamer machines with fast processors and even faster graphics cards

210003
gridview	rowdatabound
then use the gridview rowdatabound event to discover the label and assign its text

210035
post	get
otherwise html entities will get converted to their character representation when the post is rendered

210081
tabcontrol	tabitem
note that the visibility of our tabitem will not be affected while that tabcontrol is in view so we can apply styles only when the tabcontrol visibility changes

210096
ubuntu	linux
if you are using ubuntu linux there was a patch added to the python-mysql package that added the ability to set that same mysql_opt_reconnect option see here

210105
hide	show
using states you can selectively show and hide components

210117
hide	show
instead of actually using roles to hide show certain controls i would suggest having another layer of permissions for each role and show hide based on those instead

210180
opera	firefox
edit i am on a debian box only on firefox i see this code i just tried opera this code doesn t appear in opera really strange never heard of firefox having such problems

210235
xsl-fo	xslt
you need an xslt transform for html to xsl-fo

210240
gentoo	linux
no solution here but as a datapoint it doesn t look at all like that for me firefox 3.0.3 in gentoo linux

210254
post	put
edit as noted in another post you can put something in the general version to give you a more useful error message if an unsupported cast is performed

210272
client-side	server-side
going beyond that it can become even more complex keeping your client-side script in sync with server-side support

210282
implements	extends
specificdto would extends or implements dto

210352
int	double
the js number representation is a standard ieee double so you can t represent a 64 bit int

210352
int	double
iirc you get maybe 48 bits of actual int precision in a double but all js bitops reduce to 32bit precision that s what the spec requires

210363
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
i thought i d let the exception bubble up as the exceptions thrown argumentexception or argumentnullexception by int.parse would be the same exceptions that i would throw in my method anyway

210371
ubuntu	linux
i can download the file just fine using firefox or ftp in passive mode on ubuntu dapper linux

210375
rss	feed
i have been attempting to write some routines to read rss and atom feed using the new routines available in system.servicemodel.syndication but unfortunately the rss20feedformatter bombs out on about half the feed i try with the following exception

210375
rss	feed
this seems to occur whenever the rss feed expresses the publish date in the following format

210400
freebsd	linux
the site says ratproxy is currently believed to support linux freebsd macos x and windows cygwin environments but i ve only used it on linux

210412
equals	gethashcode
as you are using at least .net 2.0 i recommend implement equals and gethashcode on stepdoc

210515
postgresql	mysql
i d like to find a very generic way of doing this that would work in mysql oracle postgresql etc

210564
prepare	pdostatement	prepare	execute
is there a way to get the raw sql string execute when calling pdostatement execute on a prepare statement

210643
pop-up	dialog
just calling click doesn t seem to do anything or at least it doesn t pop-up a file selection dialog

210685
post	get	post	put	put	get
restful web services chapter 8 section overloading post reads if you want to do without put and delete altogether it√¢ s entirely restful to expose safe operations on resources through get and all other operations through overloaded post

210685
post	put
in short replacing put delete in favor of post makes the api harder to read and put delete calls are no longer idempotent

210693
prepare	execute
the sql statement is sent to the database server when you do prepare and the parameters are sent separately when you do execute

210693
prepare	execute
you will circumvent the benefits of prepare queries by interpolating variables into the sql string before execute

210693
prepare	execute
internally if you use pdo attr_emulate_prepares pdo makes a copy of the sql query and interpolates parameter values into it before doing the prepare and execute

210711
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
in asp.net asp.net-mvc is there an equivalent of the html.actionlink helper for img tags

210740
integer	unsigned
so what i did here was casting m to a c 32-bit unsigned integer and retrieving its value back in python format

210765
phpunit	simpletest
write a shell script to run phpunit simpletest tests to be called by item 4a

210778
google-chrome	firefox
when i go to it in firefox or google-chrome it says connection partially encrypted

210824
post	get
curl -- gives you very good control over get post and many other attributes

210842
keydown	keyup
i ve been able to achieve keyboard triggering with creative shifting of focus in and out of the control between keydown keypress keyup events

210850
np-hard	np-complete
np-hard np-complete is a way of showing that certain classes of problems are not solvable in realistic time

210888
np-hard	np-complete
that doesn t mean that you can t solve a particular instance of an np-complete or np-hard problem

210979
width	height
i m not sure what part of the cycle you re trying to grab the height and width and is it of the loader object or the loaded content but you can can access the height and width of the loaded object using swfloader.loaderinfo.height and swfloader.loaderinfo.width

211034
command-pattern	memento
remembering object oriented design courses i immediately thought of memento and command-pattern

211043
kde	gnome
this happens to lock the screen in kde gnome too

211049
superclass	subclassing
but if the reopening and the definition are in reverse order you ll get that error because the class will already have been defined as a subclassing of object but is trying to be redefined or reopened with a different superclass

211051
width	height
edit so i took a debugger to the panel object and manually inspected the non-object properties and i didn t see anything that resembled width height

211051
awt	swing	width	height
edit 2 so swing classes are subclasses of awt classes so i imagine if you re able to find the height width of those the approach would generalize

211060
getter	setter
for things like trivial getter and setter share the comment between then and describe the purpose of the property not of the getter setter

211071
folder	directory
i have a vb .net 2005 winform application and each time i do an installer build it deletes overwrites the _svn folder in the directory

211078
tooltip	scrollbar
edit in response to the comments it sounds like you re trying to have the tooltip appear without affecting the positioning of existing elements and thus causing the scrollbar on the main window

211083
width	height
css specify the tooltip s width and height add overflow hidden or overflow scroll to it

211093
mp4	h.264
there s no real advantage to one over the other for a simple program either way x264 only takes a single type of input raw yv12 video and spits out a single type of output h.264 elementary streams or in the case of the cli app it can also mux mp4 and matroska

211095
width	height
generally you get the exact size of a component via the getsize method which returns a dimension object containing width and height but getwidth height should work too

211105
command-pattern	memento
q how to represent the steps in your app with the memento command-pattern

211145
versioning	upgrade
do i have to upgrade to a more powerful versioning of installshield

211151
width	height
you can use a hidden div positioned at 0 0 with width and height set to 100 as a yardstick to measure the client area of the screen

211154
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
it only checks for gif bmp jpg and png files

211198
getter	setter
it made life difficult to document setter and getter

211245
cvs	svn
before proceeding further i need to confess that all this was done in vs6 + cvs and of late svn

211306
traceroute	packets
traceroute transmits packets with small ttl time to live values

211306
traceroute	packets
by using small ttl values the packets will quickly expire so traceroute causes all routers along a packets s path to generate the icmp messages that identify the router

211343
gentoo	linux
for instance in gentoo linux you would do the following from the command line to get a list of possible package updates

211361
mvp	presenter
i still start by envisioning user actions that i want to implement if you ve got usecases that s a great way to start and using a mvp or mvc-ish model i start with writing a test for the presenter of the first screen

211385
tunnel	vpn
there is a vpn tunnel between the service s and the client s machines but they do not use the same active directory

211400
addclass	removeclass
best using addclass and removeclass in this scenario

211419
typedef	using-declaration
typedef names and using-declaration

211468
getter	setter
for things like trivial getter and setter share the comment between then and describe the purpose of the property not of the getter setter

211505
vbscript	vba
vbscript has a lot in common with vba so it should not take long create something usable and there is a great deal of help available for asp and vbscript on the internet

211535
openbsd	freebsd
also thanks for the tip about strcasestr and checking out other implementations from other sources like openbsd freebsd etc.

211564
extjs	mootools
personally i always used to say something like gallery or some other os script but recently i have found myself using more and more something like a simple php script which just spits our a list of images maybe 7 a page but relying on a javascript library such as mootools or extjs to provide all the functionality particularly for small or individual galleries

211566
pop-up	dialog
it all depends on the kind of pop-up from system s message box to custom dialog

211587
nsis	uninstaller
see nsis s page on add remove programs for more details on uninstaller registry keys

211658
apache	nginx
i do not know what your use case is but you may find nginx is a worthwhile alternative to apache as a load-balanced http reverse proxy in front of tomcat

211659
junit	jmockit
i want to use jmockit s incremental test runner instead of the standard junit test runners from within eclipse

211671
post	get
make sure that the request is a post request not a get

211673
openbsd	freebsd
for example of glib glibc openbsd freebsd etc

211674
hide	show
in windows explorer the file extension for links lnk is never show even if you have disabled the hide extensions for known file types feature

211722
versioning	upgrade
also if you want these settings to persist between assembly versioning ie be upgradable you will need to upgrade the settings on application startup

211911
xsl-fo	xslt
next unless some poor soul has already made an fckeditor xhtml - xsl-fo xslt for your xsl-fo implementation you ll have to make one

211911
xsl-fo	xslt
that involves learning xsl-fo xslt and xpath

211911
xsl-fo	xslt
so what s all this xsl-fo xslt stuff and all the other things

211911
xsl-fo	xslt
xslt formatting objects xsl-fo an xml vocabulary for specifying formatting semantics

211911
xsl-fo	xslt
anything as long as it isn t fighting html xsl-fo fop xslt and xpath

211941
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
we support ie fx but ideally a solution would work in opera google-chrome safari too

211949
dlsym	dlopen
on unixy platforms the equivalents are dlopen and dlsym

211951
dlsym	dlopen
you can use the posix dlopen dlsym dlerror dlclose functions in linux unix to dynamically open shared libraries and access the symbols including functions they provide see the man page for details

212006
put	get
if inside the same project i include this header from more than one cpp file i get an error saying multiple definition of test_ns testclass testmethod while if i put the method definition inside the class body this does not happen

212009
awt	swing
the thread dump showed that there are a couple of non-daemon threads notably swing s edt awt and a couple of websart related threads

212034
awt	swing
the console window is used to see stdout err of the webstart process as well as rudimentary log debug but has the side effect of created a top-level awt swing window

212053
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	heapsort
if you want to teach sorting algorithms then you should really be teaching quicksort mergesort insertsort and possibly even heapsort so that students can get a feel for the tradeoffs between various sorting methods

212072
quicksort	mergesort
it s also a great example of why simple solutions are not always the best which could lead into a discussion of more interesting and faster sorts like mergesort and quicksort

212088
awt	swing
however there are recurrent problems with leaks including within the implementation of awt and swing

212088
daemons	systemd
the webstart thread should all be daemons when there are no systemd windows console javax.jnlp services and other dialogs showing

212109
mouse	keyboard
what would be really helpful is a logging tool that keeps track of mouse and keyboard actions and possibly also stores the properties of components that have been clicked the aut is written in java

212142
toolbar	tabs
rather than spending hours choosing and customising a set of toolbar you have access to everything through the tabs

212143
versioning	upgrade
the business problem is really that they need an incentive to upgrade and so they keep adding new features who do you know that uses all the features of word and then they need to find ways to present those without making the application impossibly cluttered which was certainly happening in the previous versioning of office

212166
quicksort	heapsort
introsort short for introspective sort starts as a quicksort and switches to a heapsort if the recursion depth exceeds a level based on the logarithm of the number of elements being sorted

212173
expression-blend	silverlight
ok so see questions like this one and this one and the question i have is - does one have to use expression-blend to do silverlight development or can any of it be done with just visual studio

212173
expression-blend	silverlight
i haven t gotten started using silverlight yet and through my workplace s msdn i can get expression-blend without any issues but for my side work do i have to drop the 499 for expression-blend 2

212173
expression-blend	silverlight
obviously i m concerned that in order to get into silverlight development there s a huge financial investment involved and i already own visual studio 2008 - is it possible to do development without expression-blend or would that just be impossible

212219
rdf	owl
it features semantic data in rdf owl skos n3 syntax

212345
short	base
cycorp have a short description of how their cyc knowledge base derives meaning from sentences

212374
sudo	passwd
aside from the sudo policy which is probably better there is no reason why each admin couldn t have their own account with uid 0 but named differently with a different passwd and even different home directory

212387
google-chrome	firefox
if it runs fast in firefox or google-chrome then it s a javascript issue for sure

212387
google-chrome	firefox
we had a sharepoint page that took 10 seconds to render in ie and sub 1 second in firefox and google-chrome

212524
hash	md5
one option would be to store the hash sha1 md5 of the password instead of the clear-text password and whenever you want to see if the password is good just compare it to that hash

212535
hash	md5
otherwise use hash sha1 or md5 like others have said here

212550
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is in the title - ie is misbehaving and is saying that there is a script running slowly - firefox and google-chrome don t have this problem

212562
put	get
is there a good way to have a get and put ignoring case

212587
mouse	keyboard	onchange	onfocus	onchange	onblur	onfocus	onblur
we√¢ ve looked at various ways to utilize the onfocus onblur onchange keyboard and mouse events to attempt to solve the problem but still some issues

212589
hash	salt
c hash the combined password salt

212589
hash	salt
d append the salt to the resultant hash

212589
hash	salt
this approach means you don t need to store the salt separately and then recompute the hash using the salt value and the plaintext password value obtained from the user

212589
hash	salt
this using salt hash will provide the illusion of security more than any actual security

212589
hash	salt
since you need both the salt and the choice of hash algorithm to generate the hash and to check the hash it s unlikely an attacker would have one but not the other

212624
super	implements
the same will go for methods that implements an interface 1.6 and above only or override a super class s method

212629
put	get
would it be possible to implement your own map overriding put get methods

212693
int	chars
but for objects that are primitive types int chars etc. i think that compilers can be quite aggressive in optimizing

212758
post	get
is it for example possible to have an input form in an email and send the password as post instead of get

212762
width	height
i need generate thumbnails for a bunch of jpegs 200 000+ but i want to make sure all of my thumbs have a equal height and width

212809
hash	salt
if you want to make it more robust when a user verifies their email change the hex digest to just be a hash of the email address itself with no salt

212830
memset	malloc
piecewise construction of objects can also be a lot slower than one dirty great memset of the aforementioned malloc ed array of structs

212831
ingres	oracle	informix	ingres
the first informix sql-based dbms was released in 1985 so it also has longevity and pedigree similar to oracle db2 ingres sybase

212831
unix	aix	unix	solaris	solaris	aix
it runs on unix and derivatives solaris aix hp-ux linux and macos x as well as on windows xp vista etc

212900
yacc	bison
i ve used lex and yacc more usually bison in the past for various projects usually translators such as a subset of edif streamed into an eda app

212930
yacc	bison
one major difference is that antlr generates an ll parser whereas yacc and bison both generate parsers that are lalr

212930
yacc	bison
antlr is generally considered to be easier to use than yacc bison for precisely this reason

212944
geocoding	geocode
most of the services also restrict the number of geocoding queries you can make per day so it s ok to look up addresses of say new customers who get added to your database but if you run a batch job that feeds thousands of addresses from your database into the geocode you re going to get shutoff

212973
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog that pop-up change transport to smart device

212973
pop-up	dialog
it ll pop-up a connecting dialog when it disappears you get a list of processes on the device

213020
google-chrome	firefox
with that in mind here is what i ended up with seems to work in ie6 ie7 firefox 3 and google-chrome see new note at the end

213020
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this includes the more recent firefox and safari and opera browsers

213035
decoder	encoder
they also provide g729 decoder and encoder written in c

213107
inline	inlining
the second snippet works because you ve inline the definition of the function which means that even if the compiler doesn t generate any inline code for the function say you ve got inlining turned off or the compiler decides the function is too big to inline the code generated for the function definition will be visible in the translation unit only as if you d stuck it in an anonymous namespace

213146
int	chars
advice is to use class if it is expected t will always be a class with typename if other types int chars whatever may be expected

213157
vb6	vba
granted its been a while since i ve done classic vb6 and my vba experience is even rustier.

213169
put	get
you can put the guids in hidden spans inside the list element where you can get at them if need be

213186
post	get
this will get you the number of rows in a particular thread which i assume you ve pre-calculated which are equal to or earlier than the date posted the specific user post in question

213298
udp	tcp
how are the udp and tcp protocols used in mmorpg client server communication

213350
udp	tcp
anyway a combination of udp and tcp would be appropriate--you just need to ask yourself do i want reliability or speed

213359
udp	tcp
it s perfectly possible to do your own secure communications over udp you don t have to use tcp

213374
folder	directory
the resharper plugins are in the v4.1 bin plugins directory -- do i set my output directory to that folder run it then start another instance of visual studio

213380
hash	salt
the products i work on use something like a user name or phone number to salt the hash

213380
hash	salt
now if i know how to apply the correct salt to a password to generate the hash i d do it because a salt really just extends the length complexity of the hash phrase

213389
folder	directory
would it be wwwroot c the root virtual directory where the assets are hosted or the same folder that the assets are in

213425
superclass	subclassing
- subclassing need to know about the injections needed by their superclass

213449
perl	tcl
swig which has already been mentioned is a tool that helps automate the wrapping process it can take your c++ code and create a wrapper that allows it to be loaded into a number languages such as tcl perl python ruby .

213489
hash	salt
here is a simple example showing why it is bad to have the same salt for each hash

213510
int	double
this creates an expression tree for the lambda a function taking an int and returning the double

213530
post	put
bear in mind as i put in my earlier post that there is no guarantee that a path to the executable will exist or that it will be unique

213543
innodb	myisam
specifically myisam and innodb

213556
strstr	substr
if you are looking for a substr then strstr is very memory efficient

213563
apache	lighttpd	fastcgi	scgi
support for any other wsgi-enabled webserver or adapter including apache iis lighttpd mod_python fastcgi scgi and mod_wsgi

213568
pem	pkcs#12
backstory i have a pkcs#12 pkcs#12 certificate with a symmetric cipher password that i used openssl to convert to a pem

213568
tcpclient	sslstream
unfortunately it appears doing this doesn t include the private key which is what i need for making an ssl connection with sslstream tcpclient

213617
boyer-moore	knuth-morris-pratt
check into the boyer-moore and knuth-morris-pratt algorithms for more efficient ways of searching for substrings -- both as low as o n

213621
min	max
a where clause that uses a function other than min or max or an operator with an indexed key does not make available the access path that uses the index except with function-based indexes

213638
children	parent
but ultimately i d like to come up with an abstract parent datacontext in linq whose children can register which table types they want observed so i can have events such as beforeupdate and afterupdate but specific to types

213649
typedef	struct
if i have a typedef for a struct that makes use of it for some reason.

213730
hex	binary
instead i was able to write conversion code to convert binary to hex encoded strings

213779
hash	md5
good practice is storing only a one-way hash of the password in the database -- typically md5 or better sha1

213816
punctuation	words
what i want to do is check for duplicated words right next to each other but even if there is punctuation in between

213826
spweb	spsite
any reference to spsite and spweb obtained from the spcontext ie spcontext.current.site will still run under the privledges of the logged on user

213833
emacs	kate	geany	scite	kate	scite	kate	geany
i already used kate scite geany emacs vi and bluefish so those are not interesting

213897
int	double
hacked out of code for raising a double value to an int power - had to remove the code to deal with reciprocals for example.

213934
tapestry	wicket
alternative view technologies like wicket tapestry etc

213949
cvs	svn
you can still add other plugins to it as well for svn cvs etc

214050
int	double
instead of int one 1 one can surely use 1 but will that hold true for double pi 3.141..

214076
cout	cin
contrary to other claims the n character is mapped to the correct platform end of line sequence only if the stream is going to a file std cin and std cout being special but still files or file-like

214136
comparator	comparable
with a treemap it s trivial to provide a custom comparator thus overriding the semantics provided by comparable objects added to the map

214162
postgresql	mysql
at that point you should think about migrating the database to postgresql or mysql because they ll be able to handle concurrent requests much faster

214164
codeigniter	cakephp
although i personally love cakephp and i ve done many projects for clients running on shared hosts and it runs just fine if a light footprint is really important for you codeigniter would be my choice

214199
iequalitycomparer	iequatable
.net has this via iequalitycomparer for a type which can compare two objects and iequatable for a type which can compare itself to another instance

214271
stdout	fflush
and anything printed to stdout will be automatically fflush ed

214271
stdout	fflush	stdout	stderr	stdout	stdio	stderr	fflush	stdio	fflush
in other words is there some way i can tell stdio to automatically fflush stdout after every printf the way it automatically fflush stderr

214295
int	double
what are basic variable types like a string int or double

zlib	libpng
if you go with libpng you ll also need zlib and if you re using devkitpro you ll probably run into some missing functions from playing with the code for 5 minutes it looks like it relies on pow which doesn t seem to be in libnds. i have no idea what the official nintendo sdk offers in the way of a standard library - you might be in better shape if that s what you re using

i would like to use jquery s show hide feature to minimize the table but still show part of the top and bottom rows

215219
hide	show
if javascript is on then it hide the middle table rows and adds the show hide links

215238
hide	show
to get it to degrade nicely you d have to have all the rows show initially and then hide them with your jquery document ready function and also create the row with the link in

215251
many-to-many	one-to-many
edit tvanfosson changed from many-to-many to one-to-many since each venue is associated with a single city

i am looking for a way to display a modal window in wpf the same way as a window in cocoa can be displayed as a sheet it slides down from the titlebar in front of the main parent window

215457
titlebar	window
my guess is that this would be accomplished by having the modal window as a user control which is loaded into a panel when displayed and that this panel is the one which would be animated somehow from the titlebar

215473
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
os x has many webkit-based browsers safari shiira icab omniweb as well as firefox seamonkey camino and opera

215473
opera	firefox
even if you test with mozilla firefox opera and konqueror from kde 4 on windows you re not even close to covering most of the userbase

215473
webkit	gecko
that being said if you narrow your focus to browsers with support for modern css you ll find that there s only a few underlying engines trident ie gecko mozilla webkit apple khtml kde and presto opera

215473
google-chrome	safari
webkit used by safari shiira icab omniweb google-chrome epiphany-webkit kazehakase-webkit arora

215473
google-chrome	safari
rendering should be completely consistent across all os x browsers as they use the system-provided webkit library but safari and google-chrome on windows have very different drawing engines underneath and on linux there s both gtk+ and qt versions with different behavior

in java are there clear rules on when to use each of access modifiers namely the default package private public protected and private while making class and interface and dealing with inheritance

215498
antivirus	norton
it s been my experience that some security software like symantec s norton antivirus oftentimes prohibit their removal from a windows system via the add or remove programs utility going so far as to occasionally require a removal program obtained from symantec s homepage

215534
folder	directory
right click the desktop and navigate to new and then from the sub-menu select shortcut √¢ browse to the windows directory or folder and then to the system32 directory and click ok

215539
norton	mcafee
norton is not the only one that does this however mcafee and norton are the only ones who make it almost impossible to remove the software

215539
antivirus	norton
many other antivirus software that works just as well if not better than norton like avg avast and others do allow you to uninstall from the add remove

215539
norton	mcafee
norton and mcafee are some of the most invasive resource hogs that you can never get out of your system once installed

215545

215575
queue	fifo
implements a circular buffer style fifo queue

215579
getter	setter
for example if you were writing a cd player and wanted the go find info about this cd bit customizable rather than make those methods public you d put all that functionality into its own object and make just your object getter setter public

215579
public	protected
many languages find the hierarchical nature of public protected private to be too limiting and not in line with reality

215603
mouseup	mousedown
this will probably involve mousedown mouse move and mouseup

215749
google-chrome	safari
konqueror uses the same svg engine as safari and google-chrome - ksvg claims to be in beta

215754
objectdatasource	detailsview
this is off the top of my head but i believe you could connect your class to an objectdatasource component which would in turn connect to a detailsview control

215766
folder	directory
due to legacy issues i have two folder under app_code directory

215778
codeigniter	kohana
as a result several people took up a huge interest in getting their contributions in and while kohana is based on all the same principles and ideas as codeigniter the implementation is much better and much easier to work with

215794

216078
hex	binary
hex editors are made to view and edit binary files

216079
hex	binary
as for showing the raw binary values you need a hex editor like xvi32

216088
lisp	smalltalk
and some of them support functions as first class citizens languages in that area are ecl embbedabble common lisp iirc gnu smalltalk gst smalltalk has blocks then there are libraries for closures e.g in glib2

216088
haskell	ocaml
well or you can go learning ocaml haskell mozart oz or the like

216089
hex	binary
you could always open a file binary or text file there really is no difference in a hex editor and look at the raw binary data

216157
width	height
for things like width height you can verify them with is_numeric and with the rest you can run the values through htmlentities and construct your own tag from the information

216197
versioning	upgrade
that gcc versioning had some bugs so i upgrade to gcc 3.4.6

216232

216321
post	get
if you edit your post to give some more information as to what is actually in your arrays you might get more useful answers

216379
svg	vml
if you want to display a chart directly in your web page you could possibly use either vml vector markup language or svg scalable vector graphics

216379
svg	vml
vml is supported by ie whereas svg is supported by many other browsers although ie can display svg by means of a plugin

216379
svg	vml
google maps for example uses vml when running in ie and svg for other browsers

216379
svg	vml
both vml and svg use an xml format for defining the grahical charts you want to display

216381
postgresql	mysql

it makes it pretty straightforward to test things like if i click button a dialog b should be displayed or if i select option 2 from the drop-down all the checkbox should become deselected

216459
mouse	keyboard
if you have a linux or windows pc already then you probably have a monitor usb mouse and usb keyboard

216540

it s good one but better is to use some script language such as jsp php asp....and you can use simple post and get methods

216544
centos	linux
all coming from a flavor of linux called centos

here s one way to do it using mouseenter mousemove and mouseleave to trigger the necessary redraws

216724
stateless	stateful
but again the stateless tier has some sort of rule s that it uses to contact the stateful tier

216733
required	placeholder
working around it either required you to write the expression manually or to use a delegate as a placeholder

216733
put	get
the get expression is where you put your extension stuff orderbywhatever first etc.

your classes are just data structures none of them has any behaviour just getter and setter

216783
opera	firefox
using the data url in the img src doesn t work in ie but it does in firefox and opera

216805

say i want to copy the contents of a directory excluding files and folder whose names contain the word music

217102
post	get
post methods have post parameters but get methods do not

217119
client-side	server-side
not only that -- with most client-side models they have direct access to your server-side model which defeats the purpose of your server-side mvc

217119
client-side	server-side
this way you can build helpers on the server-side that sit between your client-side app and any existing controllers

217137
width	height
the application object has a hwndaccessapp that probably can be used with some windows api call to find out its width and height

217198
temp	tmp
many machines have multiple hostile users -- think shared web host -- and many scripts and applications need to safely create temp files and directories in the shared tmp directory

217230
ingres	oracle	ingres	postgresql	postgresql	informix	informix	ingres
my engine works on postgresql aka postgresql ingres db2 informix sybase and oracle - oh and ants

otherwise simply taking the first 8-10 characters of the guid or sha1 md5 hash of the guid is probably your best bet

217292
kate	kde	kate	kdevelop
and by extension any other kde program that uses kate as an embedded kpart kwrite quanta+ kdevelop

217307
ant	cruisecontrol
continuous builds with cruisecontrol ant and phpunit

217317
postgresql	mysql
long experience with java and databases an example post postgresql mysql oracle differences has taught me that the jdbc drivers we use in doing this work frequently have problems

217322
min	max
you have to do it in o n time because you need to loop through all n of the elements to check them because any one of the elements may be the min or max

217322
min	max
in other words you need to loop through all elements and do the max and min check like you have

217330
min	max
profile your code first to find the real bottleneck before you worry about optimizing your max min algorithms

217330
min	max
doing it all in one loop is more efficient than calling max then min which takes 2 n time

217330
min	max
the most efficient min max algorithm is one where min max is recalculated every time an element is added or taken away from the list

217330
min	max
getting the min max in that structure is o 1 or o log n depending what tree style you use

217409
objectdatasource	detailsview
once you have that class definition you can connect it to a form via an objectdatasource component and a detailsview control

217440
reentrantlock	reentrantreadwritelock
jdk 6 even contains information about reentrantlock and reentrantreadwritelock

217463
pop-up	dialog
when a fatal crash occurs in my code the crashrpt dialog box pop-up and when i enter my email address and click the send button it takes me to a save file dialog box where i can save the zipped package and the account specified in the install function never receives an email

217508
min	max
although it s still an o n algorithm you can do it 25 faster that is the proportionality constant is 3 2 vs 2 by comparing adjacent elements pairwise first then comparing the smaller to min and the larger to max

217514
disk	ram
when the size of the array to be sorted approaches or exceeds the available primary memory so that much slower disk or swap space must be employed the memory usage pattern of a sorting algorithm becomes important and an algorithm that might have been fairly efficient when the array fit easily in ram may become impractical

217514
disk	ram
for example the popular recursive quicksort algorithm provides quite reasonable performance with adequate ram but due to the recursive way that it copies portions of the array it becomes much less practical when the array does not fit in ram because it may cause a number of slow copy or move operations to and from disk

217528
post	put
i agree with the post advocating for embedding your enum in a class but there are cases where it makes more sense to not do that but please at least put it in a namespace

217594
config	ini
we have done loading config files based on the same server_name server_port combination but found that it s another file you have to maintain plus we weren t sure on the speed of parsing ini files although having extra cases for each server may be just as slow

217600
ingres	postgresql
i did some work on this back when i was a researcher under michael stonebraker - you know the professor who came up with ingres postgresql etc

217607
concave	convex
edit by the way this method works with concave and convex polygons

i m working on a custom cms for my own use and was thinking about implements a plugin system so i could extends the code a little easier

217672
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
since your container is a list but with some other things i would inherited from list and add your additional properties to your subclassing

217683
vim	kate
in bash and vim i use lucida typewriter but in kate scintilla eclipse and netbeans i currently use lucida casual a proportional font

217708
config	ini
being php parseing it is nearly eg the file needs to be opened closed etc as fast as having the code at the top of each script and much faster than ini and xml config solutions

217783
pseudo-class	visited
links appear as visited when the browser chooses to apply the visited css pseudo-class

217783
pseudo-class	visited
i think a better solution would be to tweak the page style so the visited pseudo class renders the same as the link pseudo-class

217785
public	protected
what if i change my mind and want to see the public protected private stuff separated out into groups first and then grouped by member kind

217814
min	max
examples from t-sql include min max and sum

217827

jboss	glassfish
you won t go wrong with either glassfish or jboss

217899
client-side	server-side
it s up to you to choose this or the client-side approach as mentioned in the comments here just wanted to point out that server-side is still possible

217910
config	ini
the creators of the .net framework want you to use xml-based config files rather than ini files

217921
temp	tmp
temp tmp input i never really use foo and bar

217980
int	chars
for example if i want to send over a 32 bit int or a 4 chars string

217998
width	font-size
if textbox contents were returned with line-breaks representing where word-wrapping occurs that result will be dependant on style font-size width of the textbox etc. rather than what the user actually entered

218003
boost	stl
i was wondering if there is a native c++ or stl boost function which will search a cstring for a specified string

218004
udp	tcp
typically for tcp udp comms you always convert data to network byte order using the htons function and ntohs and their related functions

218013
boost	stl
it s not stl or boost but since you have two cstring s it seems the most reasonable method to use

218031
mouse	keyboard
so as others pointed out you will have to talk to the 8042-compatible keyboard mouse controller directly

218031
mouse	keyboard
unless it s a usb keyboard mouse and 8042 emulation is disabled where you would need a usb stack but you can use the boot protocol for the keyboard mouse which is simpler

218047
post	get
you d need to post any and all constructors in the class to get a definitive answer

218081

you ll also get this error if you try and add a datasource and your project doesn t have any datasources in the project s root if you ve put all your datasource classes in a subfolder

218294
cvs	svn
if you don t have cvs svn at work there are free options available

218326
hide	show
you may have to tweak the code and hide show the rectangle but basically this is it

218398
equals	icomparable
i used icomparable originally because i needed to sort them on certain criteria but overriding equals worked perfectly for .contains

218417
post	get
if you do this though make sure so set the method parameter to get as the default method for prototype ajax requests is post

218435
equals	gethashcode
also remember if you are going to override equals that you need to also override gethashcode as well

218438
postgresql	mysql
i would look into mysql and or postgresql

218441
accessor	properties
bear in mind that while taking the value for comparison inside your handler code you might get into an infinite loop you call the properties accessor which calls the aop handler which calls the accessor and so on so you might need to reflect into the class containing this properties to attain the backing field

218476
scrollable	panels
since i m currently on the road i cannot try this but have you tried playing around with cancontentscroll and or wrapping the scrollable content into a panels as suggested by the scrollviewer overview on msdn

218488
boost	stl
boost or stl tr1 from vs9 with featurepack are also possible

218527
cvs	svn
the only options i m aware of that meet your requirements are cvs and svn

218540
hide	show
in card layout you can add multiple panels in the same place but then show or hide one panel at a time

218543
cvs	svn
i ve used both cvs and svn to great effect for home projects

218543
cvs	svn
although svn is generally seeing greater use throughout the industry if you don t have any problems with cvs i would worry too much about the distinction

218544
solaris	aix
it s great to have the newer tools in your toolbox but if you don t know the old school way then you re going to be in a world of hurt if you re ever on a aix solaris hp-ux etc system which doesn t have the newer tools and may not even have bash

218544
centos	linux	centos	solaris	solaris	aix
and i do as much work as possible on our linux centos 5 system simply because the tools on it are still newer than anything i can find readily packaged for aix solaris is somewhat better

218558
hash	md5
the function hash can be any hash function for example the function md5 from digest md5

218563
clistctrl	cdialog
i have an mfc clistctrl in a cdialog and i need to add to the clistctrl the tap and hold behavior

218613
spweb	spsite
i really need to find the source of these spsite spweb leaks and fix them but i can t just start editing code that may or may not be the source of the problem

218625
cpython	ironpython
these are implementation details of cpython so this probably does not work in other implementations of python such as ironpython and jython

218628
post	get
http basically i know there are more has two methods to request data get and post

218640
spweb	spsite
take a look at troubleshooting spsite spweb leaks in wss v3 and moss 2007

218699
sproutcore	cappuccino
an interesting comment in another thread compares jquery dojo prototype mootools sproutcore and cappuccino the question was removed

218760
children	parent
the parent div in this example will not expand to contain its floated children - it will appear to have height 0

218855
hash	md5
assembly version is the intended mechanism for this but you could roll your own by comparing an md5 hash of the gac assembly with the md5 of your latest version

218907
submit	submission
we all know the good old disable the submit button trick but what are the best ways to handle multiple submission server side

218911
sorting	grouping
does anyone know of a good extension to tablesorter or specific configuration that enables tablesorter to keep child rows grouping together with the parent row even after sorting

218959
typedef	struct
i only had to change the first typedef to a struct

218972
spweb	spsite
also it is unneccessary to dispose of certain spsite and spweb objects if they are obtained from the spcontext class

219072
spweb	spsite
make sure all custom code properly disposes spweb and spsite objects using this

219110
web.py	cherrypy
what do i need to know install and do if i want to run a web framework say web.py or cherrypy on my basic cgi configuration

219116
versioning	upgrade
i would still say upgrade from vb6 directly to .net 3.5 actually .net 3.5 sp1 and vs2008 as long as your client operating systems support that versioning of the framework otherwise you will need to choose the lowest common framework versioning which very well may be .net 2.0

219124
fastcgi	scgi
flup is another way to run with wsgi for any webserver that can speak fastcgi scgi or ajp

219131
put	get
it s pretty painless if you get past the put the certificate in the store and give the correct user access to it part

219139
boost	stl
does the stl or boost already have such an adapter class

219154
mouse	keyboard
in particular check out adam chapweske s resources on keyboard and mouse programming

219224
post	get
on advantage of doing it this way is that you can change from a get to a post without changing the url

219231
put	get
i hope once you put this data in db after that all you will get delta of information not 25 gb of flat file

219305
versioning	upgrade
that is if i link against versioning 4.3.2.100 my program should still work if the user upgrade bigcorp s app so that the .dll is versioning 4.3.3.20

219305
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
continuing my previous example my build machine has versioning 4.3.3.20 installed but i want the .dll it generates to be compatible with installation that haven t upgrade and only have versioning 4.3.2.100 installed

219335
installation	upgrade
update april 12th 2010 with the release of team foundation server 2010 the installation and upgrade procedures have improved a lot

219363
width	height
make sure your height and width properties are defined for each cell of your table

219373
put	get
if you put the values in the .resx file by default they get compiled into your assembly or a satellite resource assembly

219431
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
what i need to know is how to close a datareader or if there is a need at all to close that is specified in the selectstatement attribute of the sqldatasource or objectdatasource tags

219506
mouse	keyboard
some elements require more than simple mouse keyboard interactions due to the complex rendering carried out by extjs

219506
hide	show
note that the display none check is necessary because once an error field is show and then it needs to be hidden extjs will simply hide error field instead of entirely removing it from the dom tree

219541
filtering	grouping
instead of a factory that returns a grouping object consider filtering adding some filtering objects that require less granular configuration

219599
super	implements
then in 6 months when your app is super famous and getting dugg and slashdotted and you decide you need more than a single connection all you have to do is implements some pooling in the getconnection method

219620
hex	binary
in terms of representing arbitrary binary data as text base64 is more efficient than plain hex

219628
put	get
but the put and get functions require a default value and i do not want to spread default values all over the source files

219704
interbase	firebird
interbase and firebird developer s for visual studio .net

219704
interbase	firebird
firebird - interbase .net mono providers

219706
jar	manifest.mf
we get around this problem by deploying a main jar file myapp.jar which contains a manifest manifest.mf file specifying a classpath with the other required jars which are then deployed alongside it

219706
folder	directory
so if you deploy the main jar into some directory and then put the dependent jars into a lib folder beneath that the manifest looks like

219729
cairngorm	puremvc	flexunit	puremvc	flexunit	cairngorm
if you re already using an mvc framework like cairngorm or puremvc flexunit should integrate pretty painlessly

219834
interbase	firebird
i do not recommend using a driver designed for firebird as interbase and firebird have somewhat different sql syntaxes and differ in other features as well

219835
accessor	properties
compare to the same for properties vs fields since properties before the same function as events encapsulation via accessor

219917
rss	feed
an rss feed of the last 15 errors from the log

219922
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
either autoresetevent or manualresetevent

219922
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
the difference between the two is that autoresetevent lets one thread proceed each time it is set while manualresetevent releases all waiting threads on set

219929
getter	setter
having a setter and getter isn t really any better than having a variable at that level of visibility

219929
public	protected
therefore you could just make the variable itself protected and the reader public

219929
getter	setter
that said setter and getter are an indicator of bad oo--are you sure you need them

220026
actionscript	mxml
i am attempting to import mxml files that i developed with emacs into a new project in flexbuilder...i have created a project and manually added all my mxml and actionscript files into flexbuilder

220050
hash	salt
also add a salt to the password before you hash it

220066
client-side	server-side
you ll need something like cometd on the server side and a client-side library that groks server-side push

220075
mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
so a few questions for the cruisecontrol.net folks the msbuild folks and the mbunit folks

220075
mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
should mbunit tests be part of the msbuild file or the cruisecontrol.net file

220077
hash	salt
the way i see it i will have to either allow the client to receive the hash + any salt information or use a separate pin password and allow the client to receive the hash+salt for that password

220081
post	get
if you are reading out of your textarea post you can use the explode function using the newline character as your separator to get each line in the variable as a new element of an array then you can do explode on your array elements

220082
hash	salt
the real solution is to hash salt and then store the passwords

220089
jboss	glassfish
glassfish v3 still in beta has a microkernel so is jboss 5 architecture

220089
jboss	glassfish
books and other 3rd party products are available for jboss but not for glassfish

220157
client-side	server-side
so you could server-side customize hack the wp_list_pages function but here s a client-side option if you so choose

220164
xslt	xquery
i think i heard all those limitations were adressed in the xslt 2.0 specification sadly ms decided not to implement it and promote xquery instead

220179
mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
however whatever route you decide to go i d still recommend to not add the mbunit as part of your build step but add it as a separate step in cruisecontrol.net

220184
post	put
the servlet api has no way to extract the file from the post put

220187
rss	feed
what i want to do is similar to word clouds built from a url or rss feed that you find on the web except i don t want the visualization

220204
public	protected
variables aren t subclassed at all they don t go into the dispatch table but public or protected variables can be hidden by local variables

220229
getter	setter
i should get default getter and setter without writing any code but overriding a default getter or setter is as easy as declaring get fieldname or set fieldname functions with the behavior i want

220257
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
both safari 3.1 and firefox 3.1 well the current alpha and possibly opera 9.6 support true type font ttf embedding and at least safari supports svg fonts through the same mechanism

220273
width	height
both div s contain data that varies in height and width

220277
post	get
i get by with sifr for display type headlines titles of blog post etc. and using one of the less-worn-out web-safe fonts for body type like trebuchet ms

220310
codeigniter	kohana
both codeigniter and its php5 only fork kohana contain implementations of the activerecord pattern

220362
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
the local web server doesn t care whether you use opera safari firefox ie to connect to it

220434
int	chars
btw both 0 and 0 are int s in c and either one will be converted to chars when stored in a chars variable

220439
cos	sin
i think it has something to do with the old sin and cos methods and the amount angle that the triangle has been rotated but i m a bit rusty on that stuff

220440
doc	rtf	wordprocessingml	rtf
of doc ooxml rtf wordprocessingml

220463
subtract	add
the classical arctangent gives you an angle normalized to -90√¢ r +90√¢ degrees however so you have to add or subtract 90 degrees from the result depending on the sign of the result and the sign of vx

220465
png	ico
i was wondering how i would be able to use a 256x256 png file in the ico file used as the application icon and show it in a picture box on a form

220482
memset	calloc
because on these systems neither memset nor calloc can clear out a struct that contains pointers correctly

220535
getter	setter
one that no one has mentioned is being forced to write unit tests for classes that are brainless getter and setter

220538
xslt	xquery
saxon is the xslt and xquery parser --

220560
vbscript	vba
is it possible to do this with word vba or vbscript

220561
post	get
this is the blog post i used to get all the info needed

220563
cvs	svn
cvs - svn import is pretty shaky really it s a one-off thing probably not that many individual people work on it enough to really care about making it perfect

220563
cvs	svn
going from another scm system to cvs and then to svn sounds like a recipe for useless history data and frustration

220563
cvs	svn
i ve only done it a couple of times and really the best part is once you re done you re in svn and never touch cvs again

220594
free	realloc
consequently realloc has probably free the original memory and then you pass it the same pointer again and it complains that you re freeing the same memory twice because you pass the original value to it again

220642
vim	emacs	mouse	keyboard
vim and emacs do not take full advantage of my screen mouse and keyboard

220642
geany	scite	geany	gedit	kate	scite	kate	gedit	kate	geany
i ve heard of scite eclipse gedit medit nedit gvim gemacs kate geany gnotepad ozeditor etc

220664
kate	kdevelop
also for a more development oriented tool you could try kdevelop whose default editor is kate but you can change for any other editor implementing the ktexteditor interface

220686
jboss	glassfish
after using jboss from the very beginning and then switching to glassfish in the last 6 months i can honestly say that glassfish is fast reliable and full-featured

220699
put	get
if i put the prog_delegate back in and remove everything else i get the exception back

220710
vim	emacs	mouse	keyboard
vim and emacs do not take full advantage of my screen mouse and keyboard

220750
mergesort	timsort
timsort is an adaptive stable natural mergesort with supernatural performance on many

220764
int	chars
in my experience the uuid broken up into two int will still be more efficient than using a chars field

220805
icmp	tcp
the browser uses the tcp ip protocol to communicate with the server the http requests when you use ping it uses the icmp protocol and seems the server behind a firewall that drops the icmp echo requests

220824
firefox	safari
browsers it looks okay in for example firefox for os x safari for os x

220839
pthreads	fork
it is quite easy to fork for exection of another program and redirect that one s stdin out under pthreads provided to you by cygwin i don t know about plain dos windows though

220855
g++	gcc
by default gcc g++ prints a warning message with the line number only

220855
g++	gcc
i am looking for the option by which g++ or gcc associates the build warning messages with the warning ids so that the warning messages can be identified easily without parsing

220856
nunit	mstest
to do anything in nunit or mstest you have to decorate methods with a testfixture or testclass attribute

220878
rss	feed
slashdot s rss feed is

220878
post	get
if i download the xml file directly i only get a few of the post from today

220878
post	get
however if i subscribe to the feed in google reader and keep scrolling down in their infinite scroll interface it seems like i can get an arbitrary number of slashdot post from the past - maybe i can get every slashdot post ever

220878
rss	feed
how does google reader retrieve an unlimited number of posts from an rss feed

220885
rss	feed
for rss they also have the benefit of having multiple people subscribing to the same feed

220886
icmp	tcp
ping packets as others have stated are a different type of packet than html packets - ping packets are icmp ip while html are tcp ip

220886
icmp	tcp
all kinds of stuff in between you and the website could choose to block the icmp packets while allowing tcp packets through

220889
rss	feed
to do the same you would have to poll the rss feed you want at regular intervals and store any unique articles you find locally

220899
put	get
you can do joins and sorts in the dbms but if you don t want to put too much pressure on dbms - just get sorted data out of it and merge it using two ssis merge join transforms

220922
elf	coff
it runs on a number of platforms and supports more than just elf files i believe it also supports coff and a few others

220931
apache	lighttpd
apache lighttpd and many other web servers can also function as reverse proxies

220977
glassfish	resin
the biggest bonus of using apache in front of glassfish tomcat resin jetty whatever is the versatility it grants you

221065
ncover	nant
nant together with the nant contrib extensions seems a bit more flexible in handling oss tools like nunit ncover etc while the fact that msbuild can build vs solutions is a big plus for it

221065
mbunit	nunit
i found light weight xunit.net mbunit or nunit to be far better suited for unit testing

221141
public	protected
the approach i take is to check arguments and throw exceptions on publicly visible members - any by publicly visible i mean outside assembly boundaries so any public protected or protected internal method on a public class

221165
hash	md5
using these guids as the primary key for the object seems a reasonable idea and i ve followed delicious and connotea in using the md5 hash of the guid

221165
hash	md5
you ll see the md5 hash in your browser status bar if you mouse over the edit or delete buttons in a delicious or connotea book mark

221165
hash	md5
where e4a42d992025b928a586b8bdc36ad38d ais the md5 hash of

221165
hash	md5
for me an advantage of this approach as opposed to using an auto incrementing primary key generated by the database itself is that i have to do a lot of links between objects and by using md5 hash i can store these links externally in a file say as the result of data mining scraping then import them in bulk into the database

221165
hash	md5
in the same way if the database has to be rebuilt from scratch the urls to the objects won t change because they use the md5 hash

221191
junit	jmock
most of my testing is done using junit and jmock

221249
hash	md5
multiple strings can produce the same md5 hash

221298
free	malloc
you should not free the memory as you didn t malloc it yourself

221337
keydown	keyup
for all your keydown keyup keyboard needs use the jquery hotkeys plugin

221345
width	height
im quite new to image manipulation but this is fine for getting simple values like width height aspect ratio etc but what i cannot work out is how to retrieve the physical file size of the jpg expressed in bytes

221345
hash	md5
final solution including an md5 hash of the image for later comparison

221404
post	get
if you want to get a callstack of the crash what you really want to do is post mortem debugging

221413
rmagick	jmagick
if you need to go further the simple gradient imagemagick and one of its wrappers like rmagick or jmagick for java could be useful

221434
google-chrome	firefox
until recently i had this working fine in firefox 2 3 ie5 6 and google-chrome

221448
post	get
the api is implemented as an asp page that accepts get or post params and returns xml after a user has been authenticated

221448
post	get
be aware that the http send adapter can only post data - it cannot use the get verb

221483
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
there are four public methods defined equals gethashcode gettype and tostring

221554
rss	feed
i m creating several rss feed from a database to publish things like job openings volunteer opportunities and links in general

221580
rss	feed
but i d be guessing that aiming for the last 48 or so hours would be safe - seeing as a lot of users would be running stand alone rss readers that will need to hit the feed to pull down whatever is current

221601
post	get
in the php script that is the target of the request pull out of the parameters from the _ post or _ get

221639
free	malloc
after all not just gc is not deterministic free is as little deterministic as malloc is

221639
free	malloc
it might as well try to combine smaller free memory blocks surrounding the free d one to a big one and this behavior is not deterministic nor is the runtime for it sometimes free won t do that and malloc will do that instead on next allocation but nowhere is written that free mustn t do that

221639
free	malloc
in a critical realtime system you might even replace the system standard malloc free with a different implementation maybe even writing your own one it s not as hard as it sounds

221639
free	malloc
for me gc is a plain convenience thingy it is to get programmers away from focusing on sophisticated malloc free planing and instead having the system deal with this automatically

221639
free	malloc
if i need a more sophisticated memory handling i d maybe write my own malloc free that works as desired and most deterministic and write my own reference counting model on top of it

221639
free	malloc
reference counting is still manual memory management but much more comfortable than just using malloc free

221639
free	malloc
your malloc free implementation can have a function finddeadobjects that searches for all objects with a retain counter of zero that have not yet been released and free them at a later point when you are in a less critical part of your code that has more time for such kind of tasks

221667
mouse	keyboard
then one would see the question here how do i detect if s was used to inject mouse keyboard input

221790
int	double
for each type of property int double varchar etc. add a value table

221804
min	max
i need to find the min and max value in an array

221814
ant	maven
i am assuming that you are neither using ant nor maven to create your .war file

221871
inherited	subclassing
you could put what you have into an inherited method and then wrap the results in each subclassing

221907
min	max
it doesn t unfortunately have min and max methods but it does have a toarray method from which you could then run the min and max methods

221916
implements	extends
however unfortunately an enum cannot extends a class but it can implements an interface so the best you can do at the moment is define an interface which includes the getfieldname method and have all your enums implements this interface

221918
implements	extends
enums can implements interfaces but not extends since when compiled they translate to a java.lang.enum

221953
mathml	tex
likely not what you wanted to hear but after trying mathml i went back to tex as it s far more readable and compact than the xml representation

221984
pop-up	dialog
i have a command that pop-up a dialog and from the dialog i do some work like collecting data from the used range of several sheets

222007
client-side	server-side
the thing about webforms is that it s very easy to make a page that performs really bad because it encourages you to do a lot of simple updates server-side that really should be done client-side

222019
prepare	execute
when running the above java example i see 5 pairs of prepare and execute commands in the mysqld log file

222019
prepare	execute
moving the ps assignment outside of the loop results in a single prepare and 5 execute commands of course

222019
prepare	execute
how does hibernate execute prepare statements to take advantage of the cacheprepstmts setting

222023
post	get
we don t run the most popular blog but we did get good amounts of traffic for some of our post

222024
vb.net	vb6
however you might be able to find a msaccess to vb6 translator their syntaxes are roughly similar and from there there are vb6- vb.net translators and even vb.net - c# translators

222060
rss	feed
i know that the number of people using igoogle for rss feed viewing is going up and there is a max display limit of 9 entries there

222060
rss	feed
many other rss feed displays are limiting at 10-15 entries

222060
rss	feed
i find that an rss feed unless it is specifically an all encompassing feed by nature is usually a small quick-hit update of what is going on or what is available

222080
httphandler	httpmodule
going to rewrite the httpmodule as a httphandler and bind it to .aspx so it doesnt interfere with webresource.axd

222165
children	parent
begin by removing all the floats and clears from both the parent div and children divs

222165
width	height	children	parent
if that doesn t work remove all padding and margins and give the parent div and children divs each a width of 100 leaving in your height of 100px

222183
migrate	upgrade
if you want use this wizard to upgrade the back-end to sql express then manually migrate to another db platform

222188
folder	directory
is there a way of configuring svn to create the _svn folder outside my working directory

222220
for-loop	arrays
if i iterate using a for-loop i have to account for the missing indexes and just copy the keys to a new arrays but that seems clumsy

222234
public	protected
assuming that you are talking about using _declspec dllexport dllimport on a class or class member yes you can do that and it should give you the expected result - the static data would be accessible outside your dll and other c++ code could access it provided that that c++ access specification public protected private wouldn t block outside access in the first place

222266
int	double
wrote i m reading binary data written by another program from a file and outputting int double

222266
int	chars
basically it s easy to convert from a chars to an int of various sizes

222307
turbogears	cherrypy
most python web frameworks cherrypy turbogears is what i know already include a way to dispatch requests to specific classes based on the contents of the url or the user input

222367
websphere	ibm
websphere message broker is ibm s flagship esb which runs ontop of mq

222370
vb.net	vb6
with this in mind should someone who is approaching .net for the first time using vb.net and with a vb6 background be encouraged to get into the mindset of having to work with compile-time type checking because that s the best practice in the clr

222411
dictionary	map
you could potentially store several separate dictionary - one for i ve only got one element direct mapping then i ve got two elements map to a pair struct with the two references in etc until it becomes silly - quite possibly at about 3 entries - at which point you go back to normal lists

222415

plus my java objects all have getter and setter whereas the as3 equivalents do not which means the public private accessors are different in any case

222513
kate	kde
i prefer kate part of kde as it features a built-in terminal as well as many features you would expect from an editor inside an ide like code folding and regex search replace

222513
vim	emacs
many people also recommend vim or emacs both of which are probably available through your distro s repositories

222513
g++	gcc
your compiler should probably be gcc - on a debian system installing the g++ package as well as build-essential should be enough to get c++ going build-essential should contain the gcc package required for c development

222545
awt	swing
it s pretty straight forward as long as you re using one of the standard java windowing libraries swing awt

222606
mouse	keyboard
i need a way to detect mouse keyboard activity on linux

222682
width	height
i m not sure if this applies for swf loading but whenever i m loading content i cannot access width and height before the whole thing is loaded

222682
width	height
so make an event listener that listens when the loading is completed and then read the height width

222702
post	get
good luck and be sure to post a follow-up if you do get results from the google group which i have posted on before and received feedback very quickly

222714
valgrind	gprof
among others you should also have gprof and valgrind or something in it s class

i m not using a gridview formview detailsview or any other rad type object which persists the key value by itself and i don t want to use any of them

223029
interpreted-language	compiled-language
a compiled-language will generally run faster than an interpreted-language so i think ruby and php start behind the eight ball but it really comes down to how you use the language and how you structure the code

223045
put	get
multiple workspaces on a single machine numbered changelists developer branches integration with ide visual studio eclipse slickedit ... many build variants composite workspaces integrating some fixes but not others etc i ask because if all folks are doing is get and put from the command line git has that covered and so do all the other rts

223104
client-side	server-side
the javascript could be slotted into the client-side validation the c# info could be used for a reflection load call for server-side validation and the sql expression could be used for database validation

223119
client-side	server-side
server-side validation because client-side code can be bypassed or modified and so can t be trusted

223173
mp3	ogg
i ve got two directories containing 20 gb of music files mostly mp3 some ogg and i would like to detect all duplicate songs

223184
ready	each
the nice thing about this is that i can more easily update the libraries and just use the -rxyz specifier for the externals definition to avoid pulling in newer versions than i m ready to accept and still have only one copy of each file version in my repository

223184
folder	directory
just to make it clear in the bin debug directory i don t want another layer of libs systemhooks in there and all the files presently being copied to the bin debug libs systemhooks folder needs to be copied to the bin debug folder instead

223312
post	get
if i change to urlrequestmethod.post and append some data to req.data then the header is sent but the receiving application requires a get not a post

223355
folder	directory
svn external keyword for project directory was well defined also lib folder still contained proper version of libraries trunk version

223435
try-catch	exception-handling
the only way to log exception-handling irrespective of idisposable is try-catch and then to re-throw in the catch

223435
try-catch	exception-handling
you would have to wrap every call at your api s public boundary with try-catch in order to log that the exception-handling came from your code

223474
ssl	https
or do i need to use https ssl to accomplish this

223477
ssl	https
if you are concerned about security use https with ssl encryption.

223485
ssl	https

223494
rss	feed
think about a situation where you might want to display the information as an rss feed instead

223517
hide	show
for modulea show hide option

223558
serializable	deserialization
your case might be slightly different if you re attempting to pass a strongly-typed dataset as the desktop s serializable may not match what the device wants for deserialization

223570
pygtk	pygobject
gst-python isn t coupled with pygtk at all - it just happens to share a common object model pygobject and a way to help generate bindings

223640

223737
yacc	bison
interesting question - i have a parser that can be compiled with bison byacc mks yacc or unix yacc and i don t do anything special to deal with resetting the grammar whether it fails or succeeds

223761
post	get
i have an api consisting of asp.net webservices callable through get post soap

223761
post	get
i m thinking of dropping soap support since our php clients mainly use the get post methods and the .net clients don t mind either way

223768
superclass	subclassing
i don t think you can do what you want without changing either the superclass method signature or the subclassing list declaration

223774
quicksort	mergesort
in contrast i d show quicksort and mergesort being very good divide and conqueror algorithms and both also very fast

223774
heapsort	shellsort
algorithms i d not use as their concept is harder to get are shellsort radixsort heapsort and bucketsort

223774
quicksort	shellsort
you might mention the little sister of shellsort insertionsort which is basically a shellsort where the step width has finally reach one but only because many quicksort implementation use inesrtionsort as fall-back sort once the recursion gets too deep or the remaining data set to sort recursively gets too small .

223789
vbscript	vb6
this is actually a sample written in vbscript for printing crystal 8.5 reports but the syntax is the same for vb6

profiling	debugging
and especially won t find beyond zend debugger a debugging protocol and definitely won t find any other extension that does profiling

223920
ati	nvidia
you won t get the performance of modern ati or nvidia chipsets but they aren t that bad either

223961
folder	directory
nb it seems very odd to have your library solution folder inside an include directory which are really intended for .h or other #include d files

223966
getter	setter
have a getter and setter in the application delegate to determine and perhaps set to be kvo-compliant

224013
filtering	grouping
filtering the grouping by grouping that have more than 1 element

224041

224090
ubuntu	linux
i am currently running gdb version 6.7.1 on ubuntu linux and working in a c++ project

224104
ada	pascal
but pascal has repeat - until and while for each scenario and if i remember correctly ada has another construct that lets you quit in the middle but of course that s not what you re asking

224108
post	get
there s no reason you can t include additional post or get for that matter parameters

224108
disk	ram
asp.net 2.0+ spools uploaded files to disk as they come in to avoid preloading the entire request into ram

224180
post	get
this is what the get and post super globals are for

224214
translation	localization
i m not sure how comprehensive an answer you re looking for but if you re really just using string string pairs for your localization and you re just looking for a quick way to load resource .resx files with the results of your translation then the following will work as a fairly quick low-tech solution

224214
translation	localization
csv or excel interop you could also instruct your translators to store their translation content in excel saved as xml then use xpath to retrieve your localization info

224215
do-while	break
lets you break out of the loop in the middle rather than at the start while for or end do-while

224223
innodb	myisam
a better solution is not to use myisam for tables where the data is constantly changing - innodb is much more bulletproof and as paul correctly points out you can use transactions on innodb tables but not on myisam

224234
stringstream	ifstream
i m using an istream which could be stringstream ifstream or a user-defined stream type and i need to know if in the case of an ifstream it was not opened in binary mode so i can throw an exception

224266
pop-up	dialog
the command line options appear to be the same but one difference is that tortoiseplink pop-up a password dialog if you don t have a keypair for your server

224315
komodo	notepad++
i m looking into some different editors like komodo edit notepad++ but i m wondering what tool has the ability to one click ftp for me

224337
put	get
i have to put a button on each page to get the values from a previous page rather than simply having fields auto-populated

224352
button	checkbox
note that the s around the radio button and checkbox line up correctly

224388
visualvm	jprofiler
jconsole visualvm or other profilers such as jprofiler will also show you the threads and their stacks however if you don t want to use any external tool i think ctrl-break will give you what you re looking for

224409
bazaar	git
git mercurial and bazaar are distributed control systems that operate of the idea that you aren t always connected to the net and that there need not be one central version of the repository

224436
folder	directory
svn export is like a checkout but w o the .svn folder and w o the ability to do subversion work in that directory

224438
robocopy	xcopy
use robocopy or xcopy to filter out the .svn folders

224471
minimum	max
meaning if you have a fancy javascript effect that displays a div that s supposed to be on top of everything e.g lightbox multibox etc.. onclick of a certain element and that div overlaps a your div get s to be displayed as if it s under the on this case a max and minimum z-index doesn t work

224479
inherited	properties
unfortunately this then lead to the issue that enherited classes in the entity framework cannot have navigation properties all navigation properties must be on the base entity so inherited is going to prove to be non-usable for our needs

224496
submit	submission
do i build the application itself to act as though it s always offline submission everything to a local queue of sorts that s owned by a local class essentially abstracting away the online offline thing and then have the class submit things to the server as it can

i use borderlayout 90 of the time while nesting boxlayout and springlayout

224551
cvs	svn
i mainly used cvs and svn happy and content then i started researching distributed source control as there was lots of fuss made about dsvc

224551
pull	push
you may also setup a http server run push and pull via ssh

224551
pull	push
also have really neat option of getting together with your coding buddies and simply startup http server run it over localhost and your mates can push and pull while you doing a code sprint

224578
equals	gethashcode
it is very important that your values that you store override the gethashcode method and the compiler will warn you about equals so override that as well

224598
int	double
this probably isn t worth it for things like float double etc since they are stored verbatim under protocol buffers - but there may be savings for things like int simply due to how it packs ints.

224600
int	chars
why is the input argument an int when what you want to store in an array of chars

224702
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
a connection transaction such as sqltransaction is tied directly to the db connection such as sqlconnection which means that you have to keep passing the connection around - ok in some cases but doesn t allow create use release usage and doesn t allow cross-db work

224784
unix	aix
all application execution in a unix linux mac os x aix etc. environment depends on the executable search path

224791
subtract	add
store the difference and add subtract it from the sleep interval at the end of this loop sleep delay can go too long or too short

224793
addclass	removeclass

public	protected
you can have private protected and public inheritance in c++ which will determine what derived classes can access in the inheritance hierarchy

224995
spaces	delimiter
if the string always contains 4 numbers delimiter with spaces then it could be done with sscanf

225002
versioning	upgrade
as i understand weblogic has a feature called parallel deployment to eliminate downtime during ear versioning upgrade

225016
ati	nvidia
with windows 7 probably going to rtm next october and directx 11 with it would it be worth waiting for directx 11 s explicit gpgpu features meaning it will be cross-platform ati nvidia not windows linux mac whatever

225022
outputstream	inputstream
cat method that pipes an inputstream to an outputstream

225043
nfa	dfa
regexes are usually implemented as one of two algorithms nfa or dfa that correspond to two different fsms

225053
nunit	mstest
testdriven.net has the ability to test nunit mstest etc with team coverage which you already have since you have team system dev

225064
ncover	testdriven.net
testdriven.net will also work very well with ncover

225064
ncover	nant
you can get some very nice html reports out of ncover and you can integrate it with nant

225098
hash	salt
sha1 hash of the filename + a salt or if you want of the file contents

225130
post	get
i m tryint to post to a ado.net data service but the parameters seems to get lost along the way

225130
post	get
if i replace method post with method get and webinvoke method post with webget everything works but now using post all i get is

225150
innodb	myisam
one of my projects use the myisam engine in mysql but i m considering changing it to innodb as i need transaction support here and there

225197
post	get
if you re still having problems try copying the project and seeing if you get the same behaviour and at a last ditch attempt post a bug for eclipse it may take a while for them to fix but at least you know that you re being heard

225225
inotifycollectionchanged	ilist
another option is to create your own class that implements ilist and inotifycollectionchanged then you can attach and detach events from within that class or set olditems on clear if you like - it s really not difficult but it is a lot of typing

225268
bufferedreader	ioexception
the key is to try to close the bufferedreader even if an ioexception is thrown

225274
rss	feed
i m trying to get the dates from entries in two different rss feed through feedparser

225315
bash	tcsh	bash	zsh	zsh	tcsh
that works in bash zsh and tcsh and probably other shells too.

225315
bash	tcsh	bash	zsh	zsh	tcsh
if the path it gives back doesn t include the directory that has git-upload-pack you need to fix it by setting it in .bashrc for bash .zshenv for zsh .cshrc for tcsh or equivalent for your shell

225360
spaces	delimiter
this groups all white spaces as a delimiter

225375
folder	directory
my project has two source directory that are both built and then some files are copied into the output folder

225382
rss	feed
parsing of dates is a pain with rss feed in-the-wild and that s where feedparser can be a big help

225494
filesystems	ntfs
you can encrypt a file on a ntfs filesystems

225534
width	height

225655
ironruby	ironpython
ironruby and ironpython do not work on the xbox 360 because they are based on the dlr dynamic language runtime and the dlr makes heavy use of system.reflection.emit types which are not currently available on the xbox 360 .net framework a modified version of the compact .net framework

225662
versioning	upgrade
it was about the beta 2 but i have upgrade to the release versioning and it s still a problem

225662
width	height
add a height and a width to

225668
folder	dir
i have app_themes in my root dir and then i add a theme to that which is a folder which i rename

225675
post	get
jeremy hylton s blog post is suggestive about the causes but i don t really understand cpython s implementation well-enough to figure out how to get around this

225716
post	get
i think in terms of keeping people happy during post switch over one of things to get across early is just how private a local branch can be in git and how much freedom that gives them to make mistakes

225723
drwatson	minidump
if your app crashes get drwatson to generate a minidump run drwtsn32.exe check the minidump checkbox get that dump sent to you and then load it up in windbg

225776
postgresql	mysql
not sure about mysql but postgresql pg_dump has a command to just dump the schema without the table contents so you can see if you ve changed the schema any

225838
gmail	hotmail
for example imagine what happens if a bot starts going around stealing twhirl passwords or hotmail gmail yahoo paypal from applications that run on the user s desktop

225923
put	get
they both do o n searches over the list to try and find the key which pretty much defeats the purpose of a hashtable hashtables are generally constant time for get put

225958
inherited	properties
when you select an html element in the wysiwyg designer you can use the css properties window to see all css rules and their corresponding settings including the cascading settings inherited from the various css rules

225985
hash	md5
entering each name as some hash value of the name suppose md5 - 32 bits

226070
children	parent
it s possible that in the future someone will count on the fact that fks usually prevent deletion of parent when there are children and not realize that your use of on delete cascade not only doesn t prevent deletion it makes huge amounts of data in dozens of other tables go away thanks to a waterfall of cascading deletes

226070
children	parent
otoh if i place the deletion of the parent and all its children in a procedure then it is very easy and clear for anyone to see exactly what is going to happen when i issue the command

226172
innodb	myisam
we know about the tools available for myisam table repairs but cannot find anything for innodb

226192
int	chars
what you d get in the above example would be the returned value which is an int cast into something string can understand most likely a chars

226249
width	height
you can then set width and or height as you like

226253
versioning	upgrade
the c++ redirector was never upgrade for versioning 9 of symbian os

226346
internationalization	globalization
here are some web sites dedicated to internationalization and globalization

226357
serializable	deserialization
another option is to group like settings together into their own classes and then use xml serializable deserialization to store and retrieve instances of these settings classes to and from the database

226357
serializable	deserialization
this doesn t specifically provide advantages above and beyond a key value pair other than you don t have to yourself perform any type conversions this is done behind the scenes as part of the serializable deserialization process - so it still does happen

226357
serializable	deserialization
also in a pinch you can direct your settings to come from database tables or the file system without altering your serializable deserialization code this is very nice during development

226362
mouse	keyboard
not a keyboard shortcut but with your mouse you can use forward and backwards buttons on your mouse to go to previous locations in your code and return to your current location

226401
gentoo	linux
well try it out yourself grab a gentoo or other linux distro or try out the singularity project from microsoft research

226422
innodb	myisam
one of the big ones to watch out for is that is much slower in innodb than myisam

226448
cvs	svn
i m trying avoid giving examples of actual software used cvs svn ant etc. because i d like to avoid the use xyz s feature to do this and concentrate more on general practices

226467
postgresql	mysql
i think storing your sessions in a database like mysql or postgresql will involve the least headaches especially if you already have a db for whatever it is your app does

226512
multiplying	add
well if we assume that an add subtrack operation costs 1 then multiplying costs 5 and divide costs about 20

226515
division	multiplication
multiplication is faster division is more accurate

226519
division	multiplication
floating-point division is generally especially slow so while floating-point multiplication is also relatively slow it s probably faster than floating-point division

226523
postgresql	mysql
i m working on this package while we support traditional session handling through files we also support database mysql postgresql sqlite etc

226546
vb.net	vb6
support for vb6 has ended but vb.net is still very much alive and gaining new features

226559
vb.net	vb6
vb.net seemed a lot different from vb6 when i last used it though

226564
folder	directory
i m wondering if it s possible to point iis to a shared windows folder that exists on another server and have that folder serve as the root directory for iis

226593
cruisecontrol	teamcity
i ve used both cruisecontrol and teamcity extensively

226593
cruisecontrol	teamcity
for a one man shop teamcity is far easier to setup and configure than cruisecontrol

226602
vb.net	vb6
when vb.net was created microsoft wanted developers to be able to import existing vb6 projects into .net

226602
vb.net	vb6
that was only feasible if the vb6 functions and method calls had matching functionality in vb.net

226646
folder	directory
in an app server the current working directory is usually the bin folder depends on what app server you use etc

226658
versioning	upgrade
btw i still have no idea what an unsafe expression is - nor why it continually asks to upgrade to jet 4.0 sp8 when it already has been i verified that it was updated by checking the file versioning

226663
rss	feed
i want to use jquery to parse rss feed

226708
versioning	upgrade
the microsoft.visualbasic.compatibility namespace is exclusively for use by the vb6 upgrade wizard may be removed in future versioning and should not ever be used for new development

226738
vbscript	jscript
but you may want to build your own simple solution since you√¢ ll have to modify the codeproject project to support objectivec instead of jscript vbscript c xml and c#

226744
rss	feed
use google ajax feed api unless your rss data is private

226765
put	get
i have a proof-of-concept test that uses staf to start a vm image from a pool of images install the application under test run the rrafs test and put the results on a web server for others to get at

226774
int	boolean
when using int as boolean this isn t true

226783
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
so if you do not use the dumpformat you will stick to checkout all branches tags from svn and adding them to git bazaar mercurial manually via script

226809
opera	safari
opera and ie maybe safari

226823
google-chrome	firefox
when i use some icons near links using background-image and padding-left on the links the icons display nice on firefox and google-chrome but in ie6 they take a kind of gray background and sometimes the flash strangely

226867
postgresql	mysql
if this is a public facing web application which is expected to receive hundreds of orders every day you ll probably want to run a mysql or postgresql server alongside it on the same server

226867
postgresql	mysql
if you re looking at hundreds of thousands of orders you ll most likely want mysql or postgresql running on a separate server

226867
postgresql	mysql
if you ve got all coders who are just starting out or who have experience with mysql or postgresql then obviously that makes more sense

226885
mouseup	mousedown
if you are referring to the webbrowser control s document property type htmldocument it only has events for mouseup mousedown etc but not keyboard events

226930
folder	dir
i would try turning off indexing for the temporary asp.net files folder located in your windows dir microsoft.net framework whatever version folder

226932
.nettiers	codesmith
serious answer .nettiers for codesmith might help you out

226934

hide	show
often times i need to surround a block of html and related server controls with a panel that i can show or hide based upon some ui logic in the code behind

227064
hide	show
in this situation i usually just set each tr to runat server and show hide each of them individually but there must be a better way

227089
post	get
the question is how do i get access to close the access file before the step to post the file executes

227239
boost	stl
the callstack is entirely stl boost code

227239
boost	stl
bad idea with stl boost containers

227256
getter	setter
typically entities that don t really do anything but contain getter and setter for private members mean you re working with an anemic domain model

227304
awt	swing
the getname is used in tostring methods when setting the names of child components inside a composite parent component and in awt and swing debug logging code

227304
awt	swing
i suspect strongly that the getname method is also used by some awt swing testing frameworks

227318
int	boolean
the configuration data takes all forms boolean int floats and strings

227325
vbscript	jscript
it will also generate vbscript perl and jscript

227368
nsstring	nsdata
it s nice to add convenience methods to commonly used classes such as nsstring or nsdata

227448
vb.net	vb6
vb6 and vb.net has optional parameters in method

227448
vb.net	vb6
vb6 vb.net way of saying shift xltoright allows passing value of a specific parameter by name

227453
hash	md5
generate the hash sha1 md5 etc for a key and hardcode the hash in your application

227457
post	get
i need to get a summary where type x and a summary where type y separately...let me post a better example

227459
int	chars
how do i get the ascii value of a chars as an int in python

227545
folder	directory
how can i get a file that is copied to the debug bin directory to also be copied to the testresults folder

227555
accessor	properties
the big issue is that as mmalc said the code the sets up the properties default state should not go through an accessor because it leads to all sorts of nasty issues

227555
accessor	properties
in the above case init is not responsible for initing the properties state and it is completely safe even necessary for one to use the accessor in the init method

227555
accessor	properties	accessor	superclass	superclass	subclassing
admittedly this does impose additional restrictions on your code for instance subclassing with custom accessor for a properties in the superclass must call the superclass accessor but those restrictions are not out of line with various other restrictions common in cocoa

227644
websphere	ibm
paid at my day job i administer an ibm websphere mq messaging system with several hundred nodes and have found it to be very good

227708
hide	show
say for instance to dynamically show or hide a related control

227708
client-side	server-side
i came up with a way using asp.net 2.0 callback mechanism ajax with a combination of client-side javascript and server-side logic in the code-behind

227717
stdout	stderr
so to be clear i want to launch a text based process psexec actually and read the output from that command stdout stderr etc into a variable rather than have it directly outputted to the console

227754
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
firefox safari and opera provide the non-standard xmlserializer api so you could do something like this

227847
debian	linux
i m used to debian linux where my command history is automatically saved when i log out so that when i log back in i can press up or ctrl-r or whatever and have access to my history

227900
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
the last step free is easy you always and only return to free a value that one of malloc calloc or realloc returned to you √¢ anything else is a disaster

227938
versioning	upgrade
so if you re doing a minor versioning upgrade to one of your apps the main application also goes up by a minor versioning number

227942
objectdatasource	formview
in some cases usually when an objectdatasource is involved i ve had to override the values set by the formview control by doing something like this

227946
post	get
querystring seem to have only get parameter not post

228001
getter	setter
but note that if you don t have any domain logic then you will end up with anemic domain objects bags of brainless getter and setter which is how some shops claim to do soa service layers

228073
notepad++	regexbuddy
previous developer recommendations have led me to discover great tools like notepad++ and regexbuddy so i m really looking forward to your answers

228079
division	multiplication
pointer arithmetic isn t very fond of division or multiplication

228134
inherited	properties
i then want to make an awesomedragonimmunetofire object so i make a new child of the awesomedragon awesomedragonimmunetofire inherited properties from awesomedragon and put immunetofire as a properties with a value of true

228134
put	get
is the best solution to override instance values upon object creation immediately put the position value on awesomedragonimmunetofire to the current get value of position

228154
hid	keyboard
unfortunately the new leopard hid apis have the ability to peak at keyboard events as they pass by but not to intercept them so you can t build your own application-level device handler unless it s ok that the key events are also going to the appkit as well

228248
floyd-warshall	dijkstra
in other words first find the shortest distance between each pair of vertices you can use dijkstra s algorithm or others but with those small numbers 100 nodes even the simplest-to-code floyd-warshall algorithm will run in time

if you re willing to do a little coding you want to take a look at qtkit the quicktime framework for cocoa

228448
onclientclick	checkboxlist
depending on how you are populating your checkboxlist this might be as simple as adding an onclientclick attribute to the listitem for that checkbox that calls your function with the same value assigned to the label say oncheckboxclicked this label

228470
swt	swing
netbeans is based on swing while eclipse uses swt

228589
postgresql	mysql
i work with mssql mysql and postgresql regularly using .net java and php

228589
innodb	myisam
be sure you are defining your tables to use the innodb storage engine instead of myisam which is designed for speed.

228625
pdcurses	ncurses
longer answer use a ncurses ncurses on unix pdcurses on windows

228625
pdcurses	ncurses
ncurses should be available through your package manager and both ncurses and pdcurses have the exact same interface pdcurses can also create windows independently from the console that behave like console windows

228750
innodb	myisam
also innodb is slower than myisam unless myisam is blocking for a huge select

228757
typedef	struct
while a typedef will enable you to write it without the struct keyword

228757
typedef	struct
thus you ll be able to use mystruct everywhere you want to avoid adding the struct keyword and still use mystructtag when a typedef won t work forward declaration

228812
postgresql	mysql
i am using sql server and interested in mysql and postgresql as well

228827
printf	atoi
itoa was a non-standard helper function designed to complement the atoi standard function and probably hiding a printf most its features can be implemented in terms of printf

228850
ord	chr
to do things the way you re used to treating letters as numbers you can use the ord and chr functions

228882
post	get
this blog post has a good rundown of what you need to do to get it working

228923
int	chars
you somewhat cheated because you sent an int to a function waiting for a chars and wrongly sent the number six when the chars value of 6 is not 6 but 54 in ascii

228992
bazaar	svn	pull	push
on further option which i consider is to use bazaar to push our updates to the sftp server and then pull the updates from there but unfortunately there is no working svn plugin for bazaar available on windows

229010
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
why is this not working at firefox google-chrome and safari

229022
unicode	ucs
however java s native character encoding is unicode utf16be sixteen-bit ucs transformation format big-endian byte order

229028
width	height
otherwise if you re just watching for the div to resize when someone resizes the window wouldn t it just work to attach the resize listener to the window and then check if the div had been resized store the old values of width height and check them on resize

229028
width	height
finally you could consider using watch on the width height properties although i don t know whether this is fully browser-compatible think this might be mozilla-only

229041
client-side	server-side
forget client-side and use the classic postback and add or remove the listitems server-side

229072
decltype	auto	auto	nullptr
microsoft c++ compiler vc10 provide c++0x features lambda decltype auto r-value reference and nullptr

a popular tool for the gcc toolchain is gcov together with the graphical frontend lcov

229139
put	get
1 on page load get width of your div and put it in a global variable

vb6	vba
so why do vba coders use named parameters if vb6 coders rarely do even though they use essentially the same language

229199
many-to-many	one-to-many
bear in mind that the one-to-many relationship can be represented through the many-to-many most simply by adding a field there to indicate the type of relationship

229631
pull	push
you may need to get the user who is using the spreadsheet to run a macro that will push the data out of the spreadsheet instead of you running a process to pull the data from the spreadsheet but usually it is quite doable

229635
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
ie6 works under os x without windows fonts aren t quite right but it s enough for everyday testing and you can get it 100 perfect under virtualisation parallels vmware virtualbox

229671
for-loop	loops
how could you implement a for-loop that wasn t just syntactic sugar for a while loops

229680
jsf	wicket
innovative technologies spring hibernate wicket jsf ws rest ... - taking new dependencies is strongly frowned upon

229723
for-loop	loops
if you know how many time the for-loop is going to execute you can literally copy and paste the contents of loops

229724
maven	pom.xml
all i did was use the official maven eclipse plugin and add this to my pom.xml

229736
for-loop	loops
basically the c and java javascript and lot of c-derived languages for-loop is indeed syntactic sugar for a while loops

229763
ubuntu	linux
in linux it is as slow as in windows in the same machine ubuntu 8.04 x64

229838
width	height
change your overflow to auto and define the height and or width of the element

229915
for-loop	loops
putting the whole thing in a for-loop makes it neater and ensures that the iterating isread is called each loops

229917
int	chars	int	boolean
byte chars int short boolean float are all stored in 4 bytes each

229922
for-loop	loops
in ada and i believe most other algol-derived languages the terminating condition of a for-loop is evaluated only once at the beginning of loops

230090
int	chars
also worth noting mode values of _accesss const chars path int mode

230139
put	get
if they use the moodle wysiwyg view the html would just get put into one line with no breaks

230146
inherited	subclassing
i ve made a class which inherited from usercontrol but which i only want to use as a base for subclassing

230208
daemons	systemd
so far we ve had zero issues as a result of this process except when the build server kicks in while our source control systemd also known as the daemons spawn see so many of my recent remarks performs a large multi-file check-in

once you have the offset you can simply add subtract depending on which way the conversion is going to get the appropriate time in either timezone

230318
vim	gedit	vim	emacs	emacs	gedit
also different editors and ides use different tokenizers and highlight rules and js is one of more dynamic languages to parse so try opening the file in emacs vim gedit with js plugins .

though not the most popular way to run a webserver strictly speaking javascript is not only implemented on the client-side but there are also server-side javascript engine platform combinations too

230425
folder	directory
you could instead change the current working directory before running the program to the desired dll folder

versioning	upgrade
solutions seem like they can be upgrade by incrementing the versioning number but it doesn t seem to modify things like content types and columns--especially if they re in use

i think you re nearly always better served by learning a technology better rather than learning a crutch unless the tool is something where you can put in simple info and get out a lot of boilerplate code

230601
disk	ram
if your ram usage is high though windows can swap this out to disk

230712
disk	ram
on the other end of the equation unused ram sometimes will get swapped out to disk on most oses

profiling	benchmarking
you can use the pear benchmarking package for getting timing and profiling information

231225
int	chars
i ve used this to associate two tables where one used an int but associated it to a chars field in another table

231332
integer	unsigned
very simple as your counter is a 16 bit unsigned integer it can not have values bigger than 0xffff as that value is still valid you need to have some value that extends beyond that as the guard

231367
rdf	owl
i am using rdf in my project and what we have done is use owl to define an ontology for the rdf data and give it some structure

231395
put	get
if its a h1 tag it will put it in the h1 column and if its a title tag it will get put in the title column

231448
client-side	server-side
because of requiring the presence of a service update we never considered performing any client-side xslt with msie6 and instead performed transformations server-side when the client browser was msie6 and relayed the transformed content

231490
charat	indexof
when people call length indexof and charat methods they re interested in the character position not the byte position

231596
vbscript	vba
you can use getstring in vba which will return the recordset separated by any value you like comma dash table cells etc. although i have to admit i ve only used it in vbscript not visual basic

231602
hash	salt
or is it just hash and possibly salt

231608
int	chars
the overhead is due to including a chars object reference and three int an offset a length and space for storing the string s hashcode plus the standard overhead of simply being an object

231614
min	max
i added a static member function dump which creates a table of elapsed times sorted by timing category specified in timer s constructor as a string along with some statistical analysis such as mean elapsed time standard deviation max and min

231675
jgit	egit
i was asked by shawn pearce you may know him from his git and egit jgit glory √¢ he is the hero that takes over maintanance when junio is out of town to come in to help him train the google engineers working on andriod in transitioning from perforce to git so android could be shared with the masses

231713
memcpy	memset
initializing something just to memcpy memset over it not so much

231747
post	get
lastly they re all available as post get inputs to your page so you should be able to look at them all as long as you assigned them different names

231755
put	get
depending on how much effort you want to put into it you should be able to get somewhere

231755
rsa	aes
if it s a recent well-regarded method such as rsa or aes you re probably out of luck

231774
post	get
do not be tempted to use request.param because it can be used to apply cross-site request forgery on your application an attacker could lure user into issuing a get request which your application would interpret the same as it would interpret a post one which is usually not a good thing

231810
post	get
you can use findcontrol and pass the textbox id to get an instance of the textbox when post back

231821
vb.net	vb6
i am working on a vb.net winforms app that was upgraded by visual studio originally 1.0 or 1.1 from vb6 code which was itself upgraded from vb5

231824
google-chrome	safari
if you can get an enterprise lock-in then multiple browser support can become less of an issue if your customers are all companies using internet explorer then why build the site to look good in safari or google-chrome

231824
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i don t think i could see a logic to testing across all browsers as i initially fill out a form or do some other basic functionality as it could be a big productivity drain to test across at least a few browsers ie 6 7 firefox 2 and 3 opera 9.5 safari and google-chrome if one wants to get all the big boys and at least a couple o s as safari on a mac can be different than safari on windows which is a lot of tests even for just one or two pages

weblogic	oc4j
oc4j orion will continue to be supported however the weblogic release is the future of the platform

231860
datalist	objectdatasource
efficient data paging with the asp.net 2.0 datalist control and objectdatasource

231861
mouse	keyboard
if it was more than a few hours 3 then i could see it if you tend to optimize what you are doing at any moment when you are programming do you try to optimize where the mouse keyboard and monitor all are

231889
dynamic-languages	typechecking
on the other hand a simple compiler for a fully dynamic-languages will need to do some form of typechecking anyway

231914
profiling	debugging	profiling	benchmarking
when i need to optimize resources on any script i try always to analyze profiling and debugging my code i use xdebug and the xdebug profiling there are other options like apd and benchmarking profiling

monitors under the simultaneous command of one keyboard mouse pair and i still

231937
hide	show
i am trying to show and hide an inline element eg a span using jquery

231973
portrait	landscape
the features i m looking for in particular are to print landscape or portrait without user intervention

232009
portrait	landscape
i haven t found reliable ways to control the print options from within a page either so relying on your users to change from portrait to landscape or to set or adjust margins or turn off the print headers and footers just doesn t work in the long run - you ll end up annoying them and creating more headaches for yourself when they can t or just don t follow instructions

232023
int	chars
obviously the binary value of an int containing the binary int of another chars doesn t mean that the decical does the same

232055
clistctrl	ccombobox
possibly faster than ccombobox with drawitem would be an owner data clistctrl

232113
width	height
an inline span like you mention has no specific height or width though it does have an opacity

232117
acrobat	indesign
using their server side modules you can have a designer create your document in indesign or illustrator then programattically drop in the dynamic fields on top even using acrobat to place the fields

232134
cvs	svn
i ve used cvs and svn in the past and tfs source control provides me with everything i need

232213
pop-up	dialog
it s not the greatest for example i think you have to make sure itunes.exe is running in a desktop session and several commands can cause dialog to pop-up and block your automation but it does let you do things like create new play lists and add songs

232227
width	height
if display inline-block was well supported you could change the style to inline-block and then animate the width or height but unfortunately that won t work very well these days

232230
folder	directory
the application totally behave like a normal asp.net application except for the directory or folder where users can create pages

232290
int	boolean
public boolean containssum int nums int sum

232308
opensuse	linux	opensuse	centos	centos	linux	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos
it is a good idea to keep practicing linux on vbox for windows in advance before switching using one of pclinuxos centos opensuse ubuntu

232345
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
it appears that mono.addins was influenced by system.addins sharpdevelop and monodevelop

232351
put	get
i ve even found that the best way to write technical documents -- which i generally dislike doing -- is by doing some interesting coding even if it s prototyping or experimental or otherwise throw-away to put me in the right mode and just get my brain working

232370
daemons	launchd
an alternative and more complex solution would be to create a small windows service or unix daemons that checks periodically to see if there are updates this service can download the update and launchd the installer

232382
division	modulo	division	multiplication	multiplication	modulo
so you want to use as little division as possible in favor of multiplication or modulo

232382
subtraction	addition
not shown are subtraction addition and comparison operators cause they blow all of these out of the water

232430
filtering	grouping
the problem was that the user being authenticated was a local account and by default local accounts have a filtering token with the builtin administrators grouping having a deny acl

232435
children	parent
how do i restrict the choices for parent.favoritechild to only children whose parent is itself

232444
datarow	dataview
load your two-dimensional string array into an actual datatable system.data.datatable and then use the datatable object s select method to generate a sorted array of datarow objects or use a dataview for a similar effect

232468
realloc	malloc
also obviously in real code you d check that the return from malloc realloc isn t null

232486
emacs	aquamacs
i ve used slime within emacs as my primary development environment for common lisp or aquamacs on os x but are there other compelling choices out there

pull	push
the clients are part of a product that will be installed in the wild and phoning home to push and pull data

232558
ienumerator	idisposable
i noticed that the generic inherits from idisposable but the non-generic interface ienumerator does not

232559
int	boolean
the functional spec is f int int - boolean not f string string - boolean which is kind of the domain of indexof

232562
for-loop	arrays
the actual extraction has to use a for-loop though as far as i can see array.copy requires the source and target ranks to be the same and buffer.blockcopy only works for value type arrays

232563
min	max
i have exhausted the various settings of margins padding sizes min max locations anchors.

232602
ienumerator	idisposable
ienumerator t does inherit idisposable however whereas the non-generic ienumerator doesn t

232602
ienumerable	ienumerator	ienumerator	idisposable
even when you use foreach for a non-generic ienumerable which returns ienumerator the compiler will still generate a check for idisposable and call dispose if the enumerator implements the interface

232607
ienumerator	idisposable
having ienumerator descend from idisposable ensures that it can clean up when enumeration is complete

232616
ienumerator	idisposable	implements	extends
with c# 1.2 introduced in vs2003 - there s no 1.1 bizarrely foreach began to check in the finally block whether or not the iterator implements idisposable - they had to do it that way because retrospectively making ienumerator extends idisposable would have broken everyone s implementation of ienumerator

232616
ienumerator	idisposable
if they d worked out that it s useful for foreach to dispose of iterators in the first place i m sure ienumerator would have extended idisposable

232644
children	parent
and if you were trying to access the children from the parent you would do

232666
ienumerable	iqueryable
because of this a jagged array is iqueryable ienumerable because you can iterate over it to receive an array at each iteration

232666
ienumerable	iqueryable
whereas a rectangular array is not iqueryable ienumerable because elements are addressed in full dimension 0 0 0 1..etc so you won t have the ability to use linq or any predefined functions created for array in that case

232684
width	height
add width and height as attributes to show dialog function and the set them to the dialog and dialog-content elements on line 68

232695
filesystems	ntfs
the first part of mark bessey s is somewhat correct however even on modern versions of windows with modern filesystems ntfs for example you can still run into problems

232696
free	malloc
free uses the malloc chain to free the block that was allocated which does not necessarily have the same size as the array you requested

232750
put	get
therefore you could put the items the user has picked into a table then join from this table to the table containing the price then use the set function sum to get the total price

232756
free	malloc
then figure out when the memory that is about to be free d was malloc ed

232770
post	get
then in the code you see if the editingby is greater than 0 you can warn userb that usera you know the userid is editing the ticket like so does when someone post an answer and you are writing yours or when you get a new badge for example

232833
for-loop	loops
in the reviewer s ideal language you just well hack some ugly code crying because you don t have a for_while loops or c s for-loop

232888
post	get
by using conditions on your routes you can map both the login form which is a get and the form submit which is a post to the same path

232931
lisp	smalltalk
learn ruby learn groovy learn smalltalk learn lisp learn the differences between then both in theory and in practice

232960
lisp	smalltalk
smalltalk comon lisp python javascript all have very interesting ways of implementing oop

233004
inject	interceptor
you can leverage inversion of control containers like castle windsor to inject logging auditing into the commands without having to change your application at all using the interceptor pattern

233013
haskell	ocaml
i m very curious how other languages php ruby java lua ocaml haskell handle recursion and why they handle it that way

233018
multiplying	transpose
if we could change it to something else for instance if we were to transpose the matrix and multiplying the other way around then it would be very easy to get a more succint and probably elegant way

233024
equals	gethashcode
or implement your own wrapper that overrides the equals and gethashcode

233038
allocator	stl
2 - transfert allocator ownership which happens without your consent when using allocator and or deallocating inlined code or stl

233142
multiton	singleton
actually there is a variant on the singleton called multiton or multiplton or something like that

233166
addition	multiplication
you have an addition in either case but in the second one you have no multiplication you avoid the cpu time needed for one multiplication

233166
multiplying	add
as cpus can do more and more in a single assembly command ages ago a compiler really had to manually fetch the address multiplying i by four and add both together before fetching the value statements that used to be an absolute truth ages ago are nowadays more and more questionable

233168
actionscript	mxml
the difficulty with flex is to understand how a mxml component maps the equivalent pure actionscript class

233171
swt	swing
is there an example of some functional swing or swt wrapper

233188
width	height
if you go to the link in both ie and firefox resize width until 800 is displayed in the green box top-right and resize height until the scrollbar at the right is enabled you can see the problem

233197
free	malloc
also make sure you link statically with the runtime libraries and do not try thing such as allocating memory ptr malloc 1024 in a module and then releasing that memory in another module free ptr

233206
children	parent
threads have different contexts and stacks and generally the parent thread is not required to stay there and wait for the children to finish so that it could catch their exceptions

233232
sudo	passwd
hardcoding a passwd in an expect script is the same as having a passwordless sudo actually worse since sudo at least logs its commands

233288
put	get
note i have put the t with extra spaces otherwise they get stripped from the question

233379
titlebar	window
i can think of trying to subvert mouse messages if there s a mouse-down on the titlebar though nc hit-testing doesn t at first glance seem completely obvious in winforms and i can think of responding to move messages in some way which restores the window position

233457
folder	directory
it applied on the c windows directory while i called the command from the wwwroot folder

233561
postgresql	mysql
i would require you go with mysql or postgresql if you don t need the advanced featuers of oracle

233618
mouse	keyboard
edit after peeking at the kernel source actually patch history it looks like linux at least gathers entropy from keyboard presses mouse activity interrupt timing but not all interrupts and block device request finishing times

233618
mouse	keyboard
on a virtualized system i suspect that mouse keyboard events would be pretty low and thus not contribute to the entropy gathered

233687
hash	salt
that s why using salt random bits in your hash is the way go

233687
hash	md5
i suppose you re aware of the attacks against the md5 and sha-1 hash

233687
hash	md5
in md5 there s actually possibility of hash collisions where as sha-1 is supposedly still secure but there are also rainbow table attacks against both of the hash

233687
hash	salt
generating a hash with salt user id and time stamp sounds feasible for your solution

233719
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
is there a similar way of reading the clipboard in firefox safari and google-chrome

233819
width	height
querying the svg s xml content server-side determining a suitable width and height and then dynamically adding the width and height attributes prior to returning markup to the browser would be your best bet

233895
versioning	upgrade
the problem reports and solutions suggests that i upgrade to the latest retail versioning of visual studio team edition for software testers which is not right

233936
hide	show
i basically want it so that when they click choose option 2 the options 1 div hide itself and the options 2 div show itself and then gives the second link the selected class and removes the class from the image link

233985
width	height
where each brick s width and height is q the brick s current location of the upper left corner is x1 y1 and the new brick location is x2 y2

233986
apache	nginx
are you using apache or nginx in front of your mongrel s

234017
post	get
here s a post to get started

234122
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
also i think you ll find that safari and opera behave like firefox in most circumstances

234180
mouse	keyboard
i need something to capture and record mouse and keyboard events in addition to coded events

234181
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
i have a sorted collection of objects it can be either sortedlist or sorteddictionary i will use it mainly for reading so add performance is not that important

234285
firefox	safari
if you don t expect -moz properties to work on safari and filter on firefox you can ignore that warnings

234309
cifs	smb
so you can use remote desktop connection to connect to the server but cifs smb shares is not working

234378
accessor	properties
specialname is more than properties accessor event add remove methods count here as well that s why you have to check the names as well

234394
int	chars
then you could use int egers rather than chars acters

234423
x86	64bit
if you decide to go this route be sure to install opencv version 1.0 and install it to c program files opencv if you are on vista 64bit or mklink opencv c program files x86 opencv from the correct directory or else opencvdotnet will not install

234437
int	chars
that being the case you can save yourself some additional programming and pain by giving the cards int values 1-13 instead of chars values

234591
tolower	toupper
it is suggested in this so post that c# is more efficient with toupper because microsoft optimized it that way. but i ve also read this argument that converting tolower vs

234591
tolower	toupper
toupper depends on what your strings contain more of and that typically strings contain more lower case characters which makes tolower more efficient

234591
tolower	toupper
is there a way to optimize toupper or tolower such that one is faster than the other

234639
tolower	toupper
i can t say whether toupper or tolower is faster though

234681
inherited	properties
i have a custom control that inherited from webcontrol and implements ivalidator but i also want to have a properties for validationgroup

234698
int	double
my func is mapped to a c# .net method which takes a double or int as parameter

internationalization	translation	internationalization	localization	translation	localization
are you looking for a tool to help you with string externalization alone internationalization or to help you manage the translation localization workflow

234700
translation	localization
are you planning to do the localization translation in-house or outsource it

234724
serializable	deserialization
i ve been using java for 3 years now and serializable deserialization is fairly trivial in that language

234731
snmp	mib
depending on the library you use and how it hides the details of interacting with snmp you may have a hard time finding the correct parts of the mib to change and even knowing what or how to change them to do what you want

234732
put	get
the same as c++ except that the bullets the gun parts the tools you use to put it together the hospital you get taken to afterwards and the ambulance that takes you there are all owned by the same company

234735
hide	show
in my specific implementation i added custom metadata attributes to methods and properties and i had to invoke a securitymanager.test method in each secured function as a final layer of authorization securitymanager.test was normally invoked to determine whether to show or hide pieces of a form and determine which buttons were visible in the ui

234742
bash	tcsh
what is the equivalent to the tcsh setenv function in bash

234752
ftp	telnet
often heard as in freela casts a tac nuke at shub-internet for slowing her down. a forged response often follows along the lines of shub-internet gulps down the tac nuke and burps happily. also cursed by users of ftp and telnet when the system slows down

234768
jsf	stripes	struts	stripes
i also came from a struts and jsf background into stripes

234768
jsf	stripes	struts	stripes
i went from a large enterprise environment that used mostly struts and jsf on newer projects to a smaller environment that did all their j2ee in stripes

234768
jsf	stripes
if i had to start a fresh new project and i had my say i would choose either stripes or jsf

234892
csla	.net
with asp .net mvc ajax jquery out now would there be any use for the csla framework which is strongly object oriented in web apps

234909
hl7	x12
i have some edi messages x12 hl7 etc ... stored in an oracle database

234914
bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
standard image formats bmp png jpeg tiff

234970
csla	.net
in a recent episode of .net rocks rocky lhotka talks about the upcoming version ov csla will have mvc support

234976
folder	directory
it was using the c winnt system32 or the asp.net temporary folder directory

234999
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
let me guess in netbeans it was loading it from the file system which is case-insensitive whereas when running it from the desktop it was in a jar file which is case-sensitive

235080
hide	show
application c show and hide a form repeatedly

235114
int	double
another thing to try if you know the number of objects beforehand is to use the hashmap int capacity double loadfactor constructor instead of the default no-arg one which uses defaults of 16 0.75

235126
mouse	keyboard
and you may find this page of firefox s default keyboard and mouse shortcuts useful another version of same information

235126
opera	safari
keyboard shortcuts for opera and safari

235142
getter	setter
in this i have a sessionvars class which does the grunt work for session state getter setter

235142
getter	setter
i then also add getter setter for specific types especially string since i often prefer to work with string.empty rather than null for variables presented to users

235142
getter	setter
i deploy on a web farm at work so added checks to my code in the core layer to see if the object is serializable another benefit of encapsulating the session getter and setter

235155
inherited	properties
fwiw this same issue exists in vb.net with the exception being that microsoft specifically overrides and then hides the forecolor and backcolor properties inherited from the generic control object to do nothing

235161
profiler	visualvm
in particular i d suggest using either netbeans profiler or visualvm which comes with java 6 but i see you re stuck with java 5

235169
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
back in school on of my instructors said for business applications all you need to know know add subtract multiplying and divide

235185
hide	show
the toolkit primarily includes fancy controls especially ones with dhtml effects show hide mimic animation

235194
stringbuilder	stringwriter
you can do this with a stringwriter writing the value directly to a stringbuilder object

235259
ant	cruisecontrol
here s an article on configuring phpunit to work with ant and cruisecontrol not that hard

235268
gridview	detailsview
if you are using the gridview or detailsview control the datacontrolfield objects that are automatically created for example when the autogeneratecolumns property is true are not stored in the publicly accessible fields collection

235310
range	max	range	min	min	max
show max min average for the time range

235345
queue	fifo
do we create a deamon that churns through a fifo queue

235373
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve been trying to modify the following menu to make it look indentical in ie firefox and safari google-chrome but i can t seem to get it to look right in safari google-chrome

235373
google-chrome	safari
when viewed in safari or google-chrome notice that the menu is ignoring the padding

235384
put	get
stories that get added as the project go on get put into the right group and handled as appropriate for that group -- if it s current release enough detail to work with if later just the title as a placeholder

235387
postgresql	mysql
both postgresql and mysql are good options especially if you can use those in your production environment

235405
google-chrome	firefox
at least ones with bug trackers firefox google-chrome chromium etc

235515
children	parent
currently we have a view that maps children to levels in the hierarchy and a nasty query that does the heavy lifting to connect parent with their children

235532
jar	manifest.mf
that entailed doing a number of things unfortunately the package with the incorrect manifest.mf still had the log4j jar specified in the bundle-classpath and that seems to override the import-package list

235533
google-chrome	safari
has anyone been able to create container-specific master pages for safari or google-chrome

235555
squash	branch
one thing that i like about git is that it allows a person to easily squash all the changes made in a branch when pulling the changes back into the master branch

235564
public	protected
the messagequeueexception has no public constructor only the standard protected constructor for an exception

235573
post	get
if you really want to prevent access via bots make the link to it a post instead of a get

235603
pop-up	dialog
the basic file upload feature that s in the html specs results in the browse... button that pop-up a file open dialog and uploads the raw file data as is to the server

235609
webalizer	urchin
are you not keeping your www access logs and running them through an analytics program like webalizer or awstats or fancy alternatives like webtrends or urchin

235672
fgets	ftell
if you are certain that the new line will be the same length as the old line you can open the file in read write mode use r+ as the second argument to fopen and call ftell to save the position the line starts at each time before you call fgets to read a line

235685
getter	setter
i mean if they re a pojo one class setter should take the other class getter as arguments

235699
multiplying	addition
bit shifts are so simple where a multiplying could be a shift and an addition that this makes sense

235744
jar	war
the war will get updated and place a jar in the web-inf lib containing the pre-compiled jsps

235744
jar	war
you can also just work with the ojspc jar directly and avoid trying to configure the oracle compilejsp task the code below takes a war file and pre-compiles the jsps in it

235788
hash	md5
to elaborate there are 16 bytes in an md5 hash

235814
kate	kde
there s also kate if you run kde

235855
width	height
i m trying to get a background image of a html element body div etc. to stretch its entire width and height

236001
free	malloc
my understanding is that in unix when memory is free the memory doesn t get returned back to the operating system it stays in the process to be used again for the next call to malloc

236012
free	malloc
malloc does not normally return the free memory to the operating system

236018
serializable	deserialization
it is my understanding that the performance degradation you get from overloading the session is due to the overhead of serializable deserialization not storage size

236058
public	protected
putting huge java comment section headers for the public private protected fields constants etc throughout your file

236097
int	chars
in gnu emacs chars seem to be ordinary int

236098
rss	feed
have an rss or atom feed with update info

236111
free	malloc
on linux with glibc the memory is actually always returned to the os above a certain size glibc malloc uses mmap for big allocations controlled by mmap_threshold and in that case free calls munmap which frees automatically the reserved memory

236137
cout	cin
for example printf and scanf both are faster then cin and cout significantly the fopen syntax is a lot more friendly for binary types and they also tend to produce smaller exes

236148
put	get
if you put any of their code in your box then you have to make sure you are operating within the terms of their license and they will almost certainly make you jump through some hoops to get yourself approved by them

236152
versioning	upgrade
then we had to support several different ecel versioning and upgrade of our content between them

236172
boost	stl
preferably using the stl or boost

236197
listview	gridview
with the listview + gridview control il quite complex because this control thinks in column so you have to create a template for every column and switch the read-only template with edit template for every cell

236221
smtplib	imaplib
you can build one using email for generating and parsing mail imaplib for reading and managing incoming mail from your mail server and smtplib for sending mail to the world

236229
getter	setter
your getter setter should do what they say on the tin

236229
getter	setter
bringing this back to the question do you ever bother looking at where the getter setter code is when reading it

236229
getter	setter
if your getter setter methods aren t getting and setting then describe them as something else

236231
packets	multicast
if several independent instances of my application are in use on the same network they could each use their own multicast address - but if they don t they will be able to coexist anyway they ll just have a small amount of overhead ignoring each others packets

236323
int	double
i need to compare the int part of two double for inequality and i m currently doing this

236323
int	double
if i used math.truncate instead of a cast to int would it still be accurate to compare the two resulting double values for equality

236335
integer	unsigned
if being signed is the problem i can solve this by making the integer unsigned but this would only be a temporary solution as the next iteration yields 938043756000 which is far above the 4294967296 limit

236337
free	malloc
malloc uses also mmap particularly for large allocations where a whole chunk of memory can be easily returned after being free

236339
gif	bmp
you can try it online provided you can transform your bmp into a gif first

236340
int	double
edit realized that if you are comparing int parts of double casting to int values first runs the risk of overflows should your double be outside the range that could be represented as int

236355
packets	multicast
you should have some logic in your application to handle foreign packets to alert the user through logs or some other mechanism that your application has detected multicast packets from another app with instructions on how to change the configuration

236387
for-loop	loops
i would ideally like to do it in one while of for-loop but i m not sure how to tell that loops what the order of the fields is going to be so it can fill all 8 or 6 strings correctly

236411
int	chars
is_int returns true if the argument is an int type ctype_digit takes a string argument and returns true if all the chars in the string are digits

236439
int	double
the point is i need to compare the int part of two double and i m just casting them to int and then using but as someone pointed out in one of my earlier questions this could throw an overflow exception if the double can t fit into the int

236439
int	double
so the question would be is it correct to use the operator to compare two double that have previously been rounded to 0 or should i stick to the casting to int method and catch a possible exception

236476
pop-up	dialog
the problem is that when showing that dialog box it causes another validation event because it s considered losing focus on the control again and you end up with an infinite loop of dialog pop-up

236534
google-chrome	safari
i ve just had a look at the webkit google-chrome safari √¢ source

236534
quicksort	mergesort
contiguous arrays of non-numeric type are stringified and sorted using mergesort if available to obtain a stable sorting or quicksort if no merge sort is available

236536
folder	directory
unpacking all .zip files within a single deeply nested directory structure may require only on stack but you need to shorten the threshold a bit to account for folder in the .zip etc

236550
serializable	deserialization
this is designed to be side-by-side compatible with regular .net approaches such as xmlserializer datacontractserializer but is much smaller than xml and requires significantly less processing cpu etc for both serializable and deserialization

236584
daemon	cron
i d say that if your server can handle the load but not in real time i d build a queue on the server and have a cron job or daemon process the images outside of the request

236603
children	parent
nested set trees are one parent to multiple children

236616
coalesce	isnull
a particular nasty t-sql example is the use of isnull use coalesce

236631
awt	swing
swing and awt

236632
post	get
what s the most succinct way using linq to sql to get a result set showing for each tag or post the aggregate number of post or tags assigned to it

236652
debian	linux
i am trying to use timerfd_create and timerfd_settime under debian linux lenny

236709
uniq	grep
-name .java | xargs cat | grep import java | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -100

236739
ienumerable	ilist
havn t check the nulls and off-by-one cases and ilist ienumerable differences but you should get the idea

236779
ready	each
work in small iterations say 2 weeks have ready application by the end of each and single iteration your testers should be happy to release the results to your customers

236783
agile	sprint
if you want to prove that agile works i d probably vote for using the sprint to show what release early release often means

236792
min	max
has min and max number if lines

236811
width	height
the recommendation of the developer explicitly freeing up the memory used in image manipulation is sure just to make absolutely sure not to have a memory leak as bitmaps can be straining on the memory side of things height width bit depth 3 + 1 if you have an alpha channel

236826
onchange	onkeydown	onchange	onkeyup	onkeyup	onkeydown
in general for text inputs you want to use onkeypress onkeyup onkeydown events not onchange for this type of autocomplete

236838
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	unix	bsd	unix	solaris	solaris	bsd
i d like this to be as platform-independent as possible meaning it has info that s relevant for any linux distro as well as bsd solaris os x etc but the unix systems that i use the most are os x and debian ubuntu

236873
stdout	stderr
what follows below is just the core runtime.exec plus 2 thread to listen to stdout and stderr

236984
yacc	bison
you could again convolute the heck out of it to avoid that but it s probably even better to avoid regex s altogether here and handle it by parsing one field at a time perhaps by using a recursive-descent parser or yacc bison or whatever

237001
getter	setter
a simple java class that takes an object and test all the getter and setter methods

237001
getter	setter
i do think you should avoid getter and setter methods as much as possible but as long as they re around and it takes two lines to test them it s a good thing to do it

237022
istream	getline
use getline istream string to read in a full line at a time not including the eol

237028
for-loop	loops
the truth is python performs the above two steps anytime it wants to loops over the contents of an object - so it could be a for-loop but it could also be code like otherlist.extend mylist where otherlist is a python list

237028
for-loop	loops
when the for-loop tries to loops over the generator object the function resumes from its suspended state at the very next line after the yield it previously returned from executes the next line of code in this case a yield statement and returns that as the next item

237038
fileinputstream	filechannel
reading files using java nio s filechannel and mappedbytebuffer will most likely result in a solution that will be much faster than any solution involving fileinputstream

237048
min	max
now find the max of the winners and the min of the losers

237048
min	max
from above finding the min or the max of n elements takes n-1 compares

237048
min	max
n 2 for the initial compares + n 2 - 1 max of the winners + n 2 - 1 min of the losers n 2 + n 2 + n 2 -2 3n 2 - 2

237091
versioning	upgrade
did sql express 2008 just install all the bids bits i need without requiring me to upgrade my local versioning of sql server

237114
children	parent
you want your parent to know their children but not the other way

237140
subclass	accessor
the benefits of this are that each subclass doesn t have to define its own set of fields and can still access the key and value by their accessor

237140
subclass	accessor
if a subclass truly needs to define its own behavior for the accessor it can implement the map.entry interface directly

inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
bloch warns against calling overridable methods item 17 from classes designed for inherited as it leaves the superclass vulnerable to changes made by subclassing

237144
cvs	svn
sometimes the sources come deliveded in the .jar file of the lib sometimes as a seperate download my favorite and sometimes i have to create a seperate cvs svn dir where i can checkout the sources

vim	emacs
this was done for powershell and i was curious if there was any similar functionality implemented for emacs or vim

237291
vim	emacs
a fellow developer i work with wants to use either vim or emacs for the low overhead without running visual studio

237291
vim	emacs
in essence he would like to be able to write tests edit code in emacs or vim then just run nant scripts to compile the code and run the tests

237316
multiplying	multiplication
multiplication is kind of like multiplying two two-digit numbers except each digit is in base 2 32 instead of base 10

237316
addition	multiplication
an addition requires two adds instead of one and a multiplication would i think require four multiplies instead of one

237319

postgresql	mysql
or is this just because of the versions i am using php 5.2 mysql 5.0 postgresql 8.1

237387
setinterval	settimeout
as a matter of best-practice try not to use strings as parameters to settimeout and setinterval because that will invoke eval .

237410
mouse	keyboard
i have this vague feeling that beos used to let one pair a mouse and keyboard and have separate active windows and inputs

237472
vim	emacs
also whichever editor you prefer vim or emacs learn it back forth

237495
disk	ram
now this is offset quite a bit in a typical streaming scenario because the block that is read from disk is going to still be in memory when you hit the next read we are doing sequential reads here after all - so you wind up paying the ram - l3 l2 cache latency price on the next read but not the disk- ram latency

237524
disk	ram
in our case the real reason for doing this was to save space on disk and reduce time spent on disk - ram transfers and that 1 3 savings made a huge difference in effective disk performance

google-chrome	safari
since google-chrome uses webkit it has the same rendering engine and dom support as safari not necessarily the same revision of webkit though

237660
google-chrome	safari
by testing in safari you can generally get by without worrying about google-chrome

237660
google-chrome	safari
however because google-chrome uses a different js engine there may be a few incompatibilities with safari

237990
drawimage	todataurl
html5 can export its content as png file using todataurl and it s possible to paint any element on canvas using drawimage so it should be possible to create paint it on canvas and export as data url

238057
int	double	int	chars
we had used in c++ and in c i guess compiler-defined literals to type int numbers as short or long int real numbers as float or double or even long double and chars strings as normal or wide chars

238057
int	boolean
i d guess it s very similar to .net s decision to make every primitive a struct including boolean int etc. and have all structs derive from object

one way you could do this is to create a new uiview and then when the button is pressed add that new uiview as a subviews therefore making it what you see

238536
jquery	simplemodal	google-chrome	firefox
i tried to override the settings in the default stlyesheet that comes with the simplemodal jquery plugin with containercss which is working fine in ie7 but not firefox or google-chrome

238591
rss	feed
it s pretty nice we can do things like get an rss feed for an app to watch for a few days when we make a change

238608
filesystems	ntfs
my understanding from the mercurial book is that mercurial should handle filenames in a case-insensitive manner on a case-insensitive filesystems such as ntfs which is what i m on

238652
jruby	mri
i run capistrano tasks using mri rather than the jruby interpreter

238655
tcplistener	tcpclient
in my past experience with tcp ip and the tcplistener tcpclient classes there is not much of a way to force the listener to drop it s connection until you drop the client connection

238692
sequence	permutation
it only works if there are no duplicate elements in the sequence if there are it misses some permutation and doesn t end in the correct perumtation

238739
profiler	vtune
you could use a sampling profiler like intel s vtune to obtain a measure of how many cpu cycles are being consumed with a minimum amount of disturbance on the system being measured

238741
gif	png
how can i put a gif png image on a bitbtn component

238744
gif	png
bitbtns don t accept gif or png images

238749
ssl	https
with ssl https the host name will be in the clear obviously as it has to find the server but the other parts of the url should be safely encrypted

238767
post	get	post	put	put	get
my preference would be that the username password only be accepted via post so that it doesn t appear in the url at all but you could conceivably encrypt and encode the password so that it could be put in a get request

238770
inherited	properties
it allows you to beget new instances of any object extend them while maintaining a live prototypical inherited link to their other properties

238894
subtraction	addition
z is what determines if the adder does subtraction or addition

238894
subtraction	addition
if it s 0 it means subtraction and i want to convert y to two s complement then just do regular addition

238996
opera	safari
it works as expected clicking the label focuses the corresponding input in firefox3 safari opera and ie6 7 and it passes validation but i m just wondering if there are any known reasons accessibility

239007
quicksort	heapsort
quicksort is really hard to beat if you can hold things in memory and heapsort is quite effective for massive data set ordering although i personally prefer to use b+tree type implementations for the heap b c they are tuned to disk paging performance

239048
folder	directory
the web server will need the images to be stored in a web folder root or virtual directory to interperet the url to a local file location

239063
prng	random
is it possible to have two prng functions producing same random numbers at the same time

239076
portrait	landscape
i m not 100 sure if it s possible but have you considered using different view controllers for landscape and portrait

239086
onclick	onsubmit
the main thing to notice is the removal of the event attributes onclick onsubmit or onkeypress from the html

239103
int	chars
is there no native function in c# to go from a chars to int without making it a string

239137
inherited	subclassing
an abstract class is used when you have some base functionality that you want subclassing to inherited but it wouldn t make sense to instantiate the base class

239138
post	get
as long as the necessary key value pairs are preserved at each redirect either by get or post everything will operate correctly

239145
hide	show
using expressions to hide and show objects is the correct way of achieving this sort of functionality

239232
portrait	landscape
some of the pages would look better if they were printed in landscape mode rather than portrait

239261
portrait	landscape
i think your question is not so much about using css to define print styles but to force the print as landscape rather than portrait

239493
content-disposition	content-type
i d use the file name the server supplies in the response headers content-type or content-disposition depending on what you expect

239496
min	max
ideally i should be able to specify which keystrokes can be sent and control rate random min max

239507
swt	swing
swt is an alternative to swing though there is a degree of interoperability between them

239525
smartsvn	tortoisesvn
nice tools are tortoisesvn explorer plugin smartsvn vss-lookalike and commandline flexible

239528
allocator	stl
don t let memory allocator failures crash your legacy stl application

239532
spaces	delimiter
you can change delimiter cut -d would use a spaces as a delimiter

239588
put	get
am i right in saying that the worst that can happen is that new entries may get put into the wrong place which actually i can live with

239611
ienumerable	iqueryable
you could look into writing your own extension method like the one in omer s library but using iqueryable instead of ienumerable to support server-side execution

239622
versioning	upgrade
followup #2 figured i d try to upgrade the oracle client drivers but 10.2.0.1 is apparently the highest versioning available for windows 2003 server and xp clients

239622
post	get
if i manage to get to the real cause of this i ll update the post

239653
inherited	properties
you cannot do that on that way but you can access a properties s setter method from a derived class so you can use inherited for the purpose

239655
inherited	properties	public	protected
you can achieve to this by making a public properties in your settable class that will inherited from the real class that will have a protected property.

239674
updatepanel	scriptmanager
if you re getting that from an updatepanel set enablepartialrendering to false in the scriptmanager for the page and then it should give you the actual error

239728
jboss	weblogic
you just package your application in a war file web archive and provide that war file to the appserver tomcat jboss weblogic ... that will unpack the war and deploy it automatically

239817
folder	directory
for code in the app_code directory it s compiled on a per folder basis

239860
width	height
swf width 455 height 200 backgroundcolor #123456 framerate 25

240021
width	height
personally i view any html attributes like height width or the inline style attribute to be bugs

240024
wmv	ogg
strange thing is it works for example for wmv videos with yuv on their ouput only this ogg decoder has a problem with it

240029
inherited	properties
2 split the set from the properties with an inherited interface

240033
organization	naming
normally i use a naming scheme that puts common reusable components into a namespace that reflects our organization and project-specific components into a namespace tied to the project

240033
organization	naming
my inclination is to go the organization naming route and create an organization project name space for this application

240036
getter	setter
simply define the getter in one interface and create a second interface that has both the getter and the setter

240064
punctuation	words
i would prefer to avoid using punctuation and reserved words in table and column names and not use the square brackets

240150
post	get
if you re using that means you accept post get and cookie but it s mainly the first two we re interested in

240159
post	get
_post if data is being updated somewhere if the action has a side-effect _request otherwise and if you don t care whether or not the data comes via get post or any other method

240162
asterisk	pbx
an example of this type of approach is used in the asterisk pbx via the ztdummy module

240167
post	get
lately i ve been trying to be more diligent about using get only for read-requests post only for write-requests

240167
post	get
to that end i think using _get for get requests _post for post requests makes my intent much more clear in my code

240169
post	get
unless you have a good reason to do otherwise such as the search engine mentioned by michael it s probably better to use _get and _post for their respective methods instead of _request to avoid any ambiguity or confusion over possibly having the same argument name in the get and post data

240212
free	malloc
what is the difference between new delete and malloc free

240220
free	malloc
malloc free just allocate and release raw memory

240221
free	malloc
malloc free simply allocate memory from the heap

240222
free	malloc
new delete is c++ malloc free comes from good old c

240222
free	malloc
malloc and free coming from the dark ages before oo only allocate and free the memory without executing any code of the object

240226
free	malloc
malloc and free are c functions and they allocate and free memory blocks in size

240226
free	malloc
malloc and free are nonetheless more low level as they just reserve a chunk of memory space which will probably be associated with a pointer

240239
free	malloc
the only similarities are that malloc new both return a pointer which addresses some memory on the heap and they both guarantee that once such a block of memory has been returned it won t be returned again unless you free delete it first

240239
free	malloc
malloc free only ever allocate and free memory

240256
post	get
indirectly he doesn t talk about php itself but does say that you shouldn t accept both get and post for forms. the reason is that it s easy to use get requests for csrf attacks but not so easy to use post

240273
lisp	scheme
today lisp is a family of programming languages including common lisp and scheme which are standards with various implementations each and also clojure arc and many others

240308
free	malloc
whether they call malloc free is implementation defined

240308
free	malloc
malloc free

240308
free	malloc
malloc free can not be overridden legally

240308
free	malloc
technically memory allocated by new comes from the free store while memory allocated by malloc comes from the heap

240324
free	malloc
the global new and delete can be overridden malloc free cannot

240375
webkit	gecko
gecko and webkit based browsers really like their units

240388
kerberos	ldap
it is using gss api jndi to connect to active directory ldap server using kerberos

240421
implements	extends
you extends the behavior by sub-classing adesignerhappyimp which forces you to implements all the abstract members

240471
versioning	upgrade
the client code was also all versioning 1.1 of .net so we d have to upgrade all the client code

240499
post	get
you can try using post and get methods for transferring user inputs within php scripts

240608
client-side	server-side
just because it looks like it might be doing something special its not all that happens is it post s back with some info about what caused it so you can do things like handle client-side events in server-side code

240692
httpconnection	downloading
i am trying to downloading an xml.gz file from a remote server with httpconnection in java but i am getting an empty response

240709
post	get
see post redirect get

240709
post	get
you want the code that s handling the post to redirect to a get when it s work is done as refreshing a get will not resubmit form data

240755
put	get
if i put in a value of .5pi or less it works but otherwise i get the incorrect result

240790
quad	uniform
however if you want uniform distribution the probability of having a point in one of the triangle must be equal to the area of the triangle divided by the area of the quad

240833
concave	convex
can the polygon be concave or is it guarenteed to be convex

240864
profiling	benchmarking
as well as the other suggestions which are good - profiling and benchmarking are very important i d say that if jformula is doing anything significant within each method call then the boxing unboxing when making the call is likely to be insignificant

240881
public	protected
if the base class member variable is protected or public than you can just refer to it by name in any member function of the derived class

240881
getter	setter
there is also something to be said for keeping all member variables private and providing getter and setter as needed

240886
versioning	upgrade
files were named after those versioning - so if my upgrade script got the database versioning 10 it just took all files from 11.sql to n.sql and applied each one of them incrementing database versioning number at the same time

240887
int	chars
symbol public virtual int __thiscall cwnd create chars const chars const unsigned

240889
post	get
i was originally going to agree with joseph bui on the grounds that it would be more processor efficient to use the post method instead web standards dictate that if the request is not changing data on the server the get method should be used

240903
rdf	owl
i m looking for a library that can deal with rdf and owl data

240917
installation	upgrade
another advantage to this is that we can keep various installation at different functionality levels for different customers yet when we do upgrade all the scripts are in place and ready to run

240948
google-chrome	firefox
right now i am printing them directly to a webpage and it works properly in google-chrome and ie 7 but not firefox

240948
google-chrome	firefox
does anyone know what firefox would be doing differently than ie and google-chrome

241005
post	get
i actually have a call in to the sqlce team directly to find out if there is a count limit on this i ll post back when i get a reply likely later today though with pdc ongoing it might be longer

241044
sequence	permutation
in all cases to meet the constraint you probably need to test all permutation of the sequence

241112
rss	feed
i recently introduced html into some rss feed that i publish which up to now only had plain text no markup and i was wondering which method is better use character encoding such as htmlspecialchars or just encapsulate everything in cdata

241167
dictionary	map
i suppose you could create a map dictionary to maintain an external intuitive mapping

241239
pecl	pear
wamp server comes with pecl pear

241258
instances	transient
i had failed to mark my controller with the transient lifestyle so i was getting the same instances back on each request

241396
put	get
as a first step i am looking for a good way to get a number of ms software products xp vista server 2003 2008 office 2000 2003 2007 ... to put on some vms in my testing setup so i can start to play around

241414
put	get
you ll have to put it somewhere but you get to keep the original in case like e you mess up regularly on your regexps

241468
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
if you can t find any on-line crerate a gif or bmp or png image for each char

241503
rss	feed
this is just a short snippet from kuler rss feed

241526
rss	feed
i ve been tasked with build an accessible rss feed for my company s job listings

241526
rss	feed
i already have an rss feed from our recruiting partner

241526
rss	feed
so i m transforming their rss xml to our own proxy rss feed to add additional data as well limit the number of items in the feed so we list on the latest jobs

241527
folder	dir
i believe the minimum you need to have a wp show up in the new part of the webpart catalog you need the dll in the bin folder bin in the web dir not the 12 hive or in the gac and a safe control entry

241527
folder	dir
if this doesn t work you can try adding a .webpart file to the wpcatalog folder in your web dir

241568
apache	lighttpd
perhaps look into something like lighttpd if apache iis isn t fast enough

241575
django	turbogears
django could be an option but doesn t seem as flexible as turbogears

241595
google-chrome	safari
the problem browser at the moment is safari and google-chrome

241595
google-chrome	safari
the problem seems to be webkit based browsers with safari and google-chrome being the problem i d presume that konqueror may suffer the same fate but at the moment i don t have a linux install at my disposal

241621
nstableview	nssplitview
i generally use an nssplitview with a single column nstableview in the left pane

241621
nstableview	nssplitview
a pattern i also use is to make the nstableview slightly shorter than the nssplitview and have buttons at the bottom add delete etc

241648
.htaccess	httpd.conf
using your example urls and building on what i said before i d say to use this code in your httpd.conf or .htaccess

241713
google-chrome	safari
it looks like safari on my os x at least - which should be default settings and i assume google-chrome don t allow 3rd party cookies by default

241715
post	get
i don t want a cookie to store the session as it should get lost when the user gets out of the post cycle

241760
int	chars
int chars

241787
sorting	filtering
if you are new to .net you will want to learn about the list collection and the flexibility it will give you in respect to sorting filtering and iteration

241882
width	height
what i did was start with 640x480 and increase the width and height by 80 and 60 respectively until it failed

241882
width	height
jpg mvideocontrol.getsnapshot encoding jpeg quality 100 width + width + height + height

241883
octal	decimal
the fix ahem was to convert the pid to a string representing its value in octal rather than decimal making it impossible to contain a 9 and unnecessary to address the underlying problem

241894
fgets	fread
what is it about fgets implementation that makes it so horrible on large files vs fread

241897
int	boolean
i need an int count variable or boolean odd even variable to track the row

241908
integer	unsigned
if you want the biggest unsigned number within one of the standard integer types why not

241908
octal	hex
but groups of four which is another power of 2 gives the humans a lot more mental computing power than octal hex is based on 4 bits which is also a power of 2

241908
octal	hex
octal is rarely if ever used you can tell someones age if they think octal instead of hex

241908
hex	binary	octal	binary	octal	hex
i am from the hex generation but have worked with those from the octal generation that struggle with hex because they cannot get from octal to binary to hex in their mind

241908
put	get
back to four bits though the biggest symbol for a single bit is 1 put that number in each storage location you get 1111 four ones

241908
octal	hex
just by looking at those four ones you should be able to in your mind easily see the octal and hex version of that same number 17 octal or f hex

241908
hex	binary
so when you want to think big numbers and math on a computer you have to think binary or hex

241908
subtract	add
essentially the add subtract integer math functions in the computer allow you to have n+1 bits

241908
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
the problem is multiplying and divide which even today many processors do not support yes many have no fpu and only do add and subtract sometimes multiplying but divide is rare

241908
multiplying	subtract
multiplying and divide take a lot of electronics the trade off is you can do them with adds and subtract in software

241908
integer	unsigned
so when i saw you taking 64 bit integers the unsigned long long is often 64 bits and multiplying four times that means you need 64 5 or a 320 bit integer to store your answer you were trying to put that answer in a 64 big result which quite often depending on the compiler and computer will happily do and will truncate the upper bits leaving you with the lower 64 bits of the result which can easily look smaller than any of your operands which is what i had thought you might have done at first

241908
subtraction	addition
because of the relationships between addition and subtraction and base systems you can play some tricks

241908
subtract	add
well there is no such thing as a subtract circuit you instead add a negative number so instead of 7 - 1 it is really 7 + -1 it makes a difference

241908
integer	unsigned
the compiler first looks at that -1 and thinks ...11111 binary then it looks at the equals sign and the other side oh you want a to be all ones it sees that you have a signed integer and an unsigned but the conversion is to just move the bits over so you are saying above that you want a 0xff

241908
int	chars
other compilers will look at that -1 and see it as a 32 bit or these days maybe 64 bit signed int constant and then when it evaluates the equals into an 8 bit unsigned you will get a warning that you cannot store -1 in a signed or unsigned chars without a typecast

241908
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
supposedly there are tricks to do add and subtract well duh those are easy but also multiplying and divide

241942
inherited	properties
if your class did not have any child properties that you wanted to expose then instead inherited from typeconverter

241949
width	height
i want to change item s height and width according to a slider but as far as i know there s no measureitem method as clistbox

241983
post	get
i think you d be best off switching the script to a post method as most edit-in-place uses will be too big to use get practically

241983
post	get
if your ajax url is a php file i m fairly certain it should be able to access the session without needing to pass it in either a get or post array

241999
feedback	review
can anyone recommend a good software design review collaboration tool that allows multiple parties to give review feedback in parallel

242008
post	get
since you say jeditable uses get i can only assume you re using the loadurl option since the jeditable uses to save the changes and always uses post

242115
haskell	sml	haskell	scheme	haskell	ocaml	sml	scheme	ocaml	sml	ocaml	scheme
having scheme sml ocaml or haskell on your resume suggests you are a very well rounded programmer and quite a thinker

242157
lisp	scheme
i worked through most of it earlier this year and used common lisp simply because i didn t have scheme available don t ask

242157
lisp	scheme
as has already been noted scheme is a lisp-1 language whereas common lisp is a lisp-2

242173
uiview	calayer
additionally on the iphone every single uiview is backed on a layer i do not believe there is anything on the iphone s screen that is not in a layer so i don t understand why you are worried about using animation on something that is not a calayer

242215
post	get
if it s not selected it won t appear in the request get post in php at all

242219
disk	ram
i would use whatever server hardware you can afford 1 2 3 machines with plenty of ram and disk space and use virtual server or vmware server

242254
rss	feed
it wouldn t be too good if you were parsing any old rss feed but because the data is from adobe kuler you can be pretty sure that it s not going to vary enough to break your app it s a trusted enough source

242254
rss	feed
so yeah the rss feed are probably the easiest way of interfacing with kuler

242317
free	malloc
seeing as malloc free normally involve extensive data structures that exist in userspace free ing memory when your program ends can actually be a performance drain

242317
free	malloc
of course free ing at other times is usually beneficial as further malloc s can re-use the space you free and free might even unmap some memory which can then be used by other processes

242324
overlay	z-order
for example if you have a floating div with a higher z-order overlay on top of a select - the select element will still render on top of the div

242432
post	get
check out this post on how to enable get query strings together with segmented urls

242432
put	get
you may get the uri you submitted has disallowed characters error if you simply put anything the user enters in the uri

242479
jar	war
i would definitely just create an executable jar that embeds jetty and uses your war

242546
kerberos	ldap
one might want to define kerberos access to more than one ldap server

242551
awt	swing
tools- palette- swing awt components

242564
for-loop	arrays
i recommend using plain old for-loop but you should consider different arrays lengths

242599
vxworks	qnx
python agents works on qnx vxworks - and most problems we have was to port properly threading and network related parts of our code

242663
hash	salt
also don t forget to use a salt to help protect the hash against dictionary attacks

242680
cvs	svn
if you are generating your diff from a version control system then take a look at the vcscommand.vim cvs svn svk git integration plugin

242682
postgresql	mysql
for mysql and postgresql only though

242683
direct3d	directdraw	direct3d	directx	directx	directdraw
i believe directdraw the old school way of doing 2d in directx is obsolete so i guess you must be using direct3d

242684
hide	show
in case you need possibility to hide and show scrollbars dynamically you could use

242700
classname	inherited
new-style classes inherited from object and must be written as such in python 2.2 onwards class classname object instead of class classname

242705
width	height
also floating elements more often than not needs to have width an height attached

242731
folder	directory
basically i get the header paths to be equivalent by making a directory named externals in my iphone project root then a directory named with the appropriate name myframework in the externals folder

242735
perforce	cvs
as cvs bonsai or perforce scm bugzilla provides a

242810
cvs	svn
i will never use svn again for a personal project - ya its great compared to cvs but isn t even in the same class as the modern breed of distributed version control systems

242810
bazaar	git
bazaar vs git

242864
postgresql	mysql
schemabank a web-based saas vendor can turn your er design into sql statements for mysql and postgresql

242879
boost	stl
stl s auto and shared in boost c++0x pointers may help

242894
cublas	cufft
when writing cuda applications you can either work at the driver level or at the runtime level as illustrated on this image the libraries are cufft and cublas for advanced math

242915
client-side	server-side
and are there cases where it s better to use server-side sproc or client-side inline linq queries

242953
cpu	processors
on a 32 bit cpu a 64 bit integer will be more processors intensive to perfom calculations with

242991
rss	feed
i produce a feed reader and when scraping feed always prefer atom over rss

243011
int	double
as an aside at my company we have a number of these custom types defined as standard for lists of strings double int and so on

243017
ssl	https
if you find an easy way to factorize numbers that large you break e-mail signing and ssl https for example

243071
websphere	ibm
i can t find it in websphere and i m getting tired of googlin around ibm pages

243074
appkit	nsanimation
appkit provides couple examples as well nsanimation retains itself in startanimation and releases itself when the animation is done

243112
csv	tsv
if the database isn t sql server and doesn t support xml natively another option would be to use a basic xslt to transform the xml into csv or tsv

243130
filtering	grouping
while on the intranet site we may use a more robust grid control in our case the devexpress grid control this allows the user to sort grouping filtering and add remove columns without putting an excessive programming burden on the developer but delivering a better user experience when it comes to working with the data

243170
mouse	keyboard
at each application tick i query the current state of the keyboard and mouse and wrap them in individual classes and data structures

243170
mouse	keyboard
for the keyboard it s an array of my keys enum one item for each of the keys that are currently pressed and for the mouse it s a class containing coordinate delta s and bools for each buttons pressed

243179
websphere	ibm
we are running apache ibm http server 6.0.2.0 in front of websphere 6.0 on linux

243197
redmine	bugzilla
i have used jira too hard bugzilla too rubbish and fogbugz too expensive and i think redmine is fantastic

243275
lsp	principles
public inheritance must model the liskov substitution principles lsp

243328
redmine	trac	redmine	mantis	trac	mantis
of the open source ones trac python redmine ruby mantis php and my own bugtracker.net c# all have their fans but i think with the open source ones there is a tendency to pick the technology as well as the application

243332
many-to-many	one-to-many
but it does depend on those many-to-many one-to-many relations being 2-way

243356
integer	unsigned
note there is still the issue of signed unsigned which can t always be avoided and the fact stl use its own integer types std vector size_type but all the remaining code should not mixing

243356
integer	unsigned
some bugs are created by comparing unsigned type to signed types mysterious loss of precision or integer under overflow

243356
int	chars
the source of the bug is mixing different types converting unsigned chars into int for example thus this kind of mixing must be avoided

243388
put	get	puts	gets
use http methods semantically - get gets put puts delete deletes etc.

243484
serializable	deserialization
in theory my preferred approach to deserialization is chain of responsibility write factories capable of looking at serializable data including the type header and deciding for themselves whether they can construct an object from it

243503
vxworks	qnx
use a real time kernel such as vxworks or qnx

243515
post	get
this will get you an image as the result of a post -- you may not like it

243518
post	get	post	put	put	get
we usually use only two methods of http get and post but there are some more delete put etc

243525
mouse	keyboard
why are you querying the state of the keyboard and mouse with each tick

243525
mouse	keyboard
a much better and traditional solution would be to capture events fired from the keyboard and mouse

243531
fortran	ada
c c++ ada and fortran yes fortran are supported as well as some others

243650
diffmerge	winmerge
i tried two different diff merge software winmerge and diffmerge and the files are exactly the same

243714
udp	tcp
the internet protocol ip represents a standardization higher up the stack and has several different flavors tcp udp etc

243714
ftp	telnet
the introduction of the transmission control protocol guaranteed packet delivery defined communication contracts that opened us up to a whole new set of services ftp gopher telnet http for the application layer

243727
hex	binary
there s no option for binary constants in c or c++ but it s a bit clearer in hex

243729
hex	binary
hex values make it easy to see the underlying binary representation

243772
octal	decimal	octal	hex
there s a direct mapping between hex or octal for that matter digits and the underlying bit patterns which is not the case with decimal

243772
hex	binary
as a vestige of my 8-bit days i find hex a convenient shorthand for anything binary

243783
hex	binary
generally the use of hex numbers instead of decimal it s because the computer works with bits binary numbers and when you re working with bits also is more understandable to use hexadecimal numbers because is easier going from hex to binary that from decimal to binary

243783
hex	binary
it s much more simple to pass from hex to binary

243800
hide	show
i have an area of the screen that can be show and hidden via javascript something like show hide advanced search options

243814
folder	directory
i have copied by .net 2.0 web service project to the server and have created a virtual directory to point to the necessary folder

243860
post	get
this avoids having to get or post to the script and the images will have manageable filenames

244000
post	put
i am trying to post and put files to a feed but i am getting a 400 error saying that the content type must be application x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart form-data

244020
hex	binary	octal	binary	octal	hex
i find it maddening that the c family of languages have always supported octal and hex but not binary

244021
hash	salt
at least let me believe that it s hidden in a nice salt hash somewhere where you can t retrieve it ever

244036
folder	directory
second test your code on a directory you created under your own user folder

244054
ssl	https
https requests are the same as http only using ssl certificates

244099
ssl	https
i think https is a hosting issue you have to configure the keystore with your certificates or certificate chains setup your ssl tls map your dns settings also done for http and go ahead

244138
gw-basic	qbasic
i started off programming in basic on the zx81 then basica gw-basic and qbasic

244164
gif	png
i need to resize png jpeg and gif files

244217
free	malloc
this can be done safely if you are using heapalloc heapresize and heapfree functions but cannot be done using c runtime library eg malloc free resize

244217
free	malloc
but if you don t have a good reason you should stick with malloc free resize functions

244233
octal	hex
hex and octal have the property that they are powers of two so they map groupings of bit nicely

244253
rdf	owl
edit my main target is rdf owl skos in n3 notation

244272
portrait	landscape
however i haven t tried it since the 2.1 f w was released but when i tried this in 2.0 i found that the setting was lost after a rotation from portrait to landscape

244286
cout	ofstream
if you want a cout that writes to a file use an fstream particularly an ofstream

244294
qsort	bsearch
occasionally the perceived overhead of the function-call-per-comparison associated with using qsort or indeed bsearch is too great

244294
quicksort	heapsort
this would be good anyway - they are excellent - but more programming pearls also includes a library of simple algorithms written in awk including insertion sort heapsort and quicksort

244296
mouse	keyboard
if you simply query your keyboard and mouse every tick i can guarantee you ll run into problems

244300
puts	gets
the database needs to be reset before each test for proper isolation - a failing test that puts in bad data could cause false failures on tests that follow and it gets messy if you have to run tests in a certain order for consistent results

244375
mp3	ogg
the obvious option here would be to use mp3 or ogg vorbis

244481
xls	ods
i want to use google spreadsheets to store data online so multiple people can enter and maintain data then publish or export csv xls ods the sheet for their application

244482
ubuntu	linux
developing a heavily xml-based java-application i recently encountered an interesting problem on ubuntu linux

244493
serializable	deserialization
so i tried basic java serializable but from a basic test i conducted this somehow becomes a very costly operation building a bytearrayoutputstream an objectoutputstream and so on same for the deserialization

244550
floating-point	integer
you may have to be careful about precision errors but there are ways of finding the integer square root which do not require floating-point computation

244550
floor	sqrt
edit btw you can prove that floor sqrt 8ii+1 -1 2 isqrt 8ii+1 -1 2 where isqrt x floor sqrt x is integer square root and the division is integer division truncation

244584
cout	ofstream
cout ofstream etc

244592
r-tree	quadtree
if this is too much of a cheat i d recommend the quadtree as another answerer did or the r-tree

244703
put	get
you can run a get on foo to put it into the hibernate session and then replace it with the object you created elsewhere

244709
children	parent
their web page demos their application which allows you to traverse through a tree structure with parent children siblings visually displayed around the node you are examining

244755
folder	directory
i can automatically publish the .dll to the bin folder of the virtual directory but i cannot figure out how to push the .aspx pages and images to the server without manually using sharepoint designer

244770
versioning	upgrade
if you re using oracle 10g to store blobs upgrade to the latest versioning since c blob performance is massively increased

244773
gridview	detailsview	gridview	formview	formview	detailsview
i usually switch to the design view when dropping user controls and also when attaching events of some of the heavy controls like gridview formview detailsview etc

244803
scipy	sympy
i saw there is sympy for python and i just could use it with scipy but i d lost the conversion toolbox thing

244819
put	get
practical approach write a test for two threads doing put get operations in never-ending loop validating the result on every get

244827
rss	feed
i generate an rss feed very simply using linq to xml

244871
post	get
the next question you re going to post on is going to ask how you get lazy loading on one-to-one associations

244876
actionscript	mxml
remember mxml gets converted to actionscript by the mxmlc compiler before the actual compilation commences so a declarative swfloader or any other declarative element for that matter is just a short-hand way of creating something instead of coding it by hand

244908
hash	salt
the only meaning is that you are adding something to your password before you hash it similarly to adding salt to your meal -

244910
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
the subclassing s method overrides the superclass s method by definition of inherited

244950
hash	salt
maybe because salt goes well with hash

244999
robocopy	xcopy
besides xcopy robocopy and teracopy that have already been suggested you may also try out total commander

245054
hide	show
inject the new content with a hide or animate width method show in the other answers

245078
width	height
calculate width of strip times height of overlapping distances to get areas

245170
authorization	access-control
if you want to prevent some people from committing to something they are not supposed to be committing to you can use repository-level access-control or path-based authorization

245207
matlab	simulink
from my quick google search i didn t find anything comparable to matlab s simulink

245208
lambda	first-class-functions
boost bind lambda and function do offer first-class-functions

245237
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
apache mod_python or nginx lighttpd fastcgi

245290
cvs	svn
i ve used both svn and cvs a little bit but will need to choose one for a new project i will be starting

245295
int	double	int	chars
in java for example there are primitive types int bool double chars that aren t proper objects

245295
int	double	int	chars	int	boolean
that s why java has to introduce int boolean double and chars as first-class types

245297
bazaar	git
you may also consider using a distributed vcs one like git bazaar or mercurial

245303
bazaar	git
having said all this i recommend you also explore some of the distributed vcss like bazaar mercurial and git

245323
cvs	svn
that being said i think svn is better in every other respect and you probably shouldn t start a new project with cvs

245361
ienumerable	iqueryable
iqueryable implements ienumerable so right off the bat with iqueryable you can do everything that you can do with ienumerable

245361
ienumerable	iqueryable
basically you should usually not have to care one way or the other if it is an iqueryable or an ienumerable

245383
cassini	iis
however when running outside of cassini in the ide the iis process did not have permissions to access to the private key store

245414
spaces	delimiter
would parse each line in myfile.txt ignoring lines that begin with a semicolon passing the 2nd and 3rd token from each line to the for body with tokens delimiter by commas and or spaces

245444
tax	shipping
similarly you can export the data once but split it it into system data that s not frequently changed but is necessary for correct operation stuff like tax or shipping rates etc. test data that s easily identifiable and operational data that needs to be moved from db version old to db version new last week s orders

245489
post	get
but why do you need the form name are you going to have more than one form on your .aspx page if not you can get the whole post back js code for the control that will do the post back submit using page.clientscript.getpostbackeventreference and use it to set the onclick attribute of whatever you will use to submit the page

245546
cvs	svn
svn over cvs is almost a no-brainer

245546
bazaar	git	bazaar	perforce	perforce	accurev
however you would be remiss not to at least consider what dvcs s have to offer git hg bazaar or if your budget allows there are commercial tools with excellent reputations accurev perforce

245573
ironruby	ironpython
the purposes of dynamic include interoperability with dynamic languages and platforms such as com c++ and dlr ironpython ironruby

245603
integer	radix
because you know that you re dealing with integer values you can get o n sort times radix sort and the hash table will also use o n time

245688
int	chars
weird is a pointer to an array of 6 pointers to functions each accepting a chars and an int as argument and each returning a pointer to a pointer to void

245746
floating-point	integer
if both operands are integers the division operation is an integer division otherwise it is a floating-point division

245793
int	chars
chars int int

245793
int	chars
chars or int float float

245793
int	chars
chars + int int

245793
int	chars
signed int + unsigned chars unsigned int

245793
division	addition
this is because the integer division is performed first then the result is promoted to float for the addition

245801
goto	break
there is no straightforward way to break out of nested loops without a goto

245814
put	get
i even put the assemblies in source control so other new developers get them without having to think about it

245826
move	drag
basically the best thing i ve seen for this sort of thing would be either flash or java that let you drag the nodes around and it would auto stretch move expand based on tension values on the edges

245840
folder	directory
rename .html to .htm in a folder which has directory and sub directory

245871
versioning	upgrade
you may need to upgrade to the most recent versioning of jython or eclipse

245932
maven	pom.xml
i use the option allowtimestampedsnapshots in my project s pom.xml to allow timestamped snapshots but i assume that the 3rd party module bar is not timestamped unless i build it myself as maven still complains about unresolved snapshot dependencies

245944
mouse	keyboard
the obvious would be a killer keyboard mouse and multi-monitor rig.

245958
mouse	keyboard
nice to have a couple monitors fast machine good keyboard mouse etc but i usually find i can be a lot more productive in front of the puta if i move away from it first

246029
postgresql	mysql
at least postgresql mysql and sql server 2008 have spatial query capabilities

246032
mvp	presenter
this runs contrary to the view being independent and ignorant of the presenter and therefore undermines the mvp pattern

246054
pop-up	dialog
this kludge should pop-up the dialog for you however

246056
pascal	delphi
you can do similar things in c c++ with typdef in java with static final or in delphi pascal vb with const but be careful in those and many other languages symbol means something different

246065
lisp	scheme
in my humble experience macros in scheme are to used as much as in other lisp like common lisp or clojure

246074
srp	principles
the obvious sign is when your class ends up looking like a big ball of mud which is really the opposite of srp single responsibility principles

246097
post	put
i am put in mind of a few members i ve had for other services that had addresses in countries i had never heard of that even the woman at the post office couldn t tell if they were formatted correctly

246111
suppressfinalize	finalizer
to be on the safe side if you are designing such a class which holds an unmanaged resource you can write the same object-freeing code in both dispose and finalizer method but if you do so always use suppressfinalize in your dispose method because it will prevent the finalizer method from being called if your object is already on the finalization queue

246121
pop-up	dialog
can i make svnkit pop-up a password dialog

246165
libjpeg	libpng
you can generate jpeg and png files from c using libjpeg and libpng respectively

246177
post	put
this is a bit of a hobby horse of mine as i ve had a few issues with websites in other countries that simply refused to let me put in a non-numeric post code and i had to resort to faxing over my address information as i couldn t fill in the online application form

246177
post	put
i d be tempted to offer the standard house number + street combine them different languages put the house number in different places so separating them out is not a good idea imho unless you know how to reassemble them correctly plus sometimes you ll end up with a house name instead of a number town and zip post code possibly with an optional county state field

246227
hide	show
there s an option to hide the version so it will display only nginx but is there a way to hide that too so it will not show anything or change the header

246251
public	protected
stick a private protected internal or public before the function declaration

246273
inherited	properties
the data input forms all had controls that inherited from textbox and these were bound to properties of an object entering data immediately validated it and the box was a light pink if validation failed and a light green if it passed

246304
debian	linux
this isn t a standard part of linux but is included with many distributions aptitude install sysnews on debian

246390
put	get
while it would be nice to code review everything it s difficult to get folks to put in the proper time especially those new to formal code reviews

246437
perl	tcl	gmp	bigint
if you want to do it in code you should use an arbitrary precision library facility like java s biginteger perl s math bigint tcl s math bignum or of the many multiple precision arithmetic libraries that are available for c like gnu gmp or mpi

246451
google-chrome	firefox
this should now work with internet explorer firefox v12+ and google-chrome 28+

246455
int	boolean
because you have to test on the click you can t use the model s way of doing this so you should try overriding the jtable s public void changeselection int rowindex int columnindex boolean toggle oolean extend method

246471
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade to dapper drake make sure to reformat your ext3 partition with the dapper drake versioning of the e2fslibs and also do a bad block check with that this might take several hours on big partitions

246487
children	parent
ensures that you don t have an orphan entry with no parent and depending on usage if you define a cascading delete when a parent is deleted all its children will also be deleted

246492
children	parent
prevents accidental deletion of a parent that has children or ensures that the delete cascades to delete the children also

246533
entity-relationship	diagram
normalization and creating types based on how they fit into the db schema or the entity-relationship diagram

rss	feed
i am writing an rss feed for fun and was looking at the spec here

246577
rss	feed
to put it another way if i conform to the spec but using json instead of xml is it a usable rss feed

the reason for this is you already know the syntax and that vb.net is not enough like vb6 to make it as easy a move as you might expect

246666
int	double
work with varchar int double other than datetime values

246673
decoder	encoder
the encoder as opposed to the decoder will know the length of the input data and be able to figure out whether to output nothing or at the end

246685
getter	setter
we use the getter to alert us of cases where code that has explicitly flagged what it is going to read in order for the base class to be able to call it only when those properties change and gets it wrong and we use the setter for property change notifications dirty-flag handling validation etc

246787
children	parent

the socket and datagramsocket classes available in the java.net package are implicitly ip sockets for tcp and udp respectively

246952
post	get
this post says it s a mission impossible to get through

246973
min	max
you then include items 2 and 3 in the select list for your query and item 2 must also be wrapped in an existing no-effect aggregate function like max or min

246998

the width and height of the loaded swf as defined by the fla it was created with can be found in the loader object in which you ve loaded the swf into

247143
int	double
the difference between anint and nint seems to be the return type where anint returns a double precision value but nint returns an int

247171
int	double
for aint an explicit cast from double to int will achieve that result

247185
int	double
for the other two i think you are right that the only difference is the return type nint returns an actual int while anint returns a double fortran real that happens to have an integral value

247207
ant	maven
failing a good maven plugin perhaps i can embed an ant task into my maven build

247229
lisp	scheme
but honestly all the useful macros i ve defined are stolen from paul graham s on lisp and are generally easier to write with defmacro define-macro in plt scheme

247235
hide	show
instead of dynamically adding columns could you define them at the outset and hide show them as needed either with visible false or setting the cssclass of the control header footer to a class with display none

247259

247379
hash	salt
you should also salt the hash

247438
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but even more importantly is that in every browser that it is tested on ie 7 firefox 3 safari and google-chrome the browser completely hangs as it is propagating the dropdownlist items

247516
put	get
regardless of how you end up doing your get request - vanilla javascript prototype jquery etc - make sure that you put a mechanism in place to combat caching

i fixed a gif transparency problem by switching to png

248077
pascal	delphi
long time ago before there was electricity and auto-mobiles you couldn t simply use c-generated .obj files in a pascal or delphi application and vice versa without explicitly wrapping them in a dll and taking care of the calling method and parameter sequence and parameter compatibility or calling out to another executable

248088
ati	nvidia
ati and nvidia do this sort of thing with their graphics drivers for linux

248099

if you start with two datetime instances that differ by 37 minutes and 54 seconds before you push them into xml they will still differ by 37 minutes and 54 seconds after you pull them out of the xml

248113
hash	md5
in addition you may want to md5 hash the file and compare it before initiating the download no need to update if the file has no changes this will help with point #2

248121
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
even though it is cumbersome i actually use a few classes that check the database versioning and run the necessary scripts either installation of sqlexpress installing the database or doing upgrade

248222
int	chars
i realize you may get into a problem with similar signatures but if you re passing objects instead of base types string int chars datetime etc this will be less of an issue

248268
for-loop	arrays
if you initialise your arrays to 0 starting from the end of the arrays that s right make a for-loop to do it the errors might go away

248268
free	malloc
i m not sure about how this can be done portably except of course for using malloc and free

248309
put	get
if the library has an init function then you could put the check there but then the client would have to supply the api to get the size of its off_t which generally isn t how libraries work

248315
firefox	safari
this seems to work perfect in ie however i get strange results in firefox safari the repeater works for n number of times and then the text seems to get cut off disappear in the repeater see the attached image

248406
swt	swing
for myself gui-builders for swing or swt never worked that well that s why i code layouts myself using layout managers

248418
jsf	seam
seam is fixed jsf based on annotations

248427
vsto	add-in
i could use a vb6 add-in to draw the menus and forward the calls via interop but then why would i even write a vsto add-in in the first place

248538
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
i used to do build a lot of uis using gridbaglayout but for years i ve never seen an office-environment ui that couldn t be built with nested borderlayouts gridlayouts and the occasional boxlayout or flowlayout

248580

vsto	add-in
if you put a debug.write statement as the first line in your vsto add-in does it take 15 seconds to show up in the debug window

248757
sudo	passwd
you might be able to set up an account that cannot login use setuid to change your program s id temporarily when needed and have sudo set up to not prompt for passwd but always allow access to that account for specific tasks

248757
sudo	passwd
it s been awhile since i ve done much unix development so i m not really sure whether it s possible to set up sudo to not prompt for a passwd or even if there is an api for it but as a fallback you could enable setuid to root only when needed

248769
folder	directory
save this automatically saves a local copy in my default directory which is also the folder i have setup using subversion with tourtise svn

248774
width	height
mark is very likely right that the content loader info object will contain the correct width and height

248774
width	height
another idea is to create a movieclip based on a rectangular shape set it s alpha to 0 place it at x 0 y 0 and match it s width and height to stage

248786
getter	setter
you must have a getter and a setter even if you never intend to use deserialization to turn xml into an object

248814
inline	inlining
note that in the last two links about criteria for inlining the one about structs not being inline is out-of-date

post	get
i ll post my 8 bit code which is working and my 4 bit code which i m trying to get to work

one that lets you subtract the tail byte and add a head byte to get the checksum of a block 1-byte forward

249012
subtract	add

249012
subtract	add
add the byte subtract from the tail to the list of new bytes in the patch

249043
super	abstract
given that i would think the better approach would be to define abstract methods in a super class for your types

249043
super	abstract
a method on the super class can house the boiler-plate method code and delegate to the concrete implementations via the abstract methods for the individual type s behavior of that method

249064
ironruby	ironpython
it seems natural that we would look at some of the nice dynamic web languages ruby python etc and with things like ironruby and ironpython i started seriously investigating

249153
awk	ksh
you can use the ksh builtin pattern-substitution syntax to do this you don t need to use sed or awk or anything

249155
profiler	yourkit
however if i were you i would use a profiler like jconsole comes with jdk or yourkit to measure what is happening

as long as the local directory exists i ve got my working copy svn or working folder vss set up

249200
post	get
i need a webserver to serve up very simple post get requests as json

249314
inline	inlining
now i like vb in all it verbosity but i m just a bit worried that writing sub...end sub inline could get a bit messy i can see some merit in inlining when you are writing c# when you only have to use something like c .... and you can cut out a lot of code

249319
hide	show
i ve always been curious to see if i can show hide or change a notifyicon created by another application via a c# application

249332
opensuse	linux

you can use ie developer toolbar for ie or firebug for firefox or the integrated inspection tools in google-chrome to inspect which rules are applied to particular element or modify the style of an element on the fly

249422
xming	x11-forwarding
you can also enable x11-forwarding in ssh and use say putty to open up different x applications running on the suse box this if i remember correctly requires some sort of a x server to be running on the windows box and for which i have been using xming

249439
int	double
i would love to see this feature in some language not only so that function foo could return a double or an int or a string but also so that foo could return a structure or objects of different classes

249463

249498
int	double
int are stored with the right-most bit being 1 and each bit to the left being double that 2 4 8 ...

249513
subtract	add
for lower uppercase you need to add subtract 32

249516
integer	unsigned
ah the link patrick posted includes this the typedef name uint_leastn_t designates an unsigned integer type with a width of at least n such that no unsigned integer type with lesser size has at least the specified width.

249532
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
if the 3rd party component does not support the standard asynchronous programming model i.e it does not use iasyncresult you can still achieve synchronization using autoresetevent or manualresetevent

249565
perforce	svn
if you have experience with both perforce and subversion and you don t believe that there are any advantages or believe that svn has advantages over perforce i d like to know why as well

249589
perforce	svn
i agree with the previous yuval - having worked with perforce and svn both in gui and command-line mode i prefer svn

249589
perforce	cvs
however the company i worked for at the time switched from the free cvs it was using to perforce

249604
perforce	svn
perforce has the a bit different model than say svn

for many of the cases where subversion trumps perforce many people seem to prefer the distributed systems like git bazaar mercurial these days

249652
addition	multiplication
assuming addition and multiplication are both counted as a single operation this function performs o m n operations

249664
public	protected
start with public methods and when code coverage is given by higher level tests turn them protected and remove the tests

249664
public	protected
inherit a class with a testable interface making protected methods public

249664
public	protected
it seems that junit automatically changes protected methods to be public but i did not have a deeper look at it

249703
stdout	stderr
is there some way i can figure out what they re writing to stdout and stderr in a readable way

249703
stdout	stderr
this question is only focused on getting access to stdout and stderr of the running process after starting it

249752
stdout	stderr
seeing what is being written to stderr and stdout is probably not going to help

249752
stdout	stderr
if it is useful you could use tee 1 before you start the script to take a copy of stderr and stdout

249776
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
if you use inherited you can see a superclass as providing an interface for the subclassing

249818

if you want to pass the same variables by both post and get then you can always use request which contains parameters from both post and get

249885
post	get
if you want to test on whether the request was sent post or get then you can either

249908
nant	cruisecontrol
i m currently using nant cruisecontrol to automate the tests and need something i can recreate on the fly based on the current live legacy content

249982
switching	screens
apart from the above at the absolutely lowest level excluding chip-level that you can go is to call the interrupts that switching to the various graphics modes available - there are several - and then write to the screens buffers but for this you would have to use assembler anything else would be too slow

249991
firefox	safari
so i tried getcomputedstyle in firefox 3 and safari 3

250038

250103
division	multiplication
complex multiplication and division follow fortran rules

250103

range reduction is done as part of complex division but there is no checking whether the result of a complex multiplication or division is nan + i nan with an attempt to rescue the situation in that case

250106
hash	whirlpool
whirlpool is a royalty free hash algorithm that has as yet not shown any weakness

250117
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
one compromise solution might be to have vms either virtualbox or vmware or parallels so that you can fire up a virtual solaris windows mac and or linux box to test it - that will show you how your site looks in the default browsers on each plus you can make sure things actually work through a non-local connection

250117
opensolaris	vms
if your base os is opensolaris you can even use zfs and use snapshots in order to rollback your vms back to their base state after each test run

250160
int	chars
typedef std istream_iterator int chars std char_traits ptrdiff_t is_iter

250193
getter	setter
note that it doesn t work with xmlserialization as you need getter and setter on all xmlserialized properties. you can override this but it seems like too much work for little effort

250234

251509
getter	setter
the validation code for getter n setter only fires if the domain object is modified from the ui

251582
listview	gridview
i would think you could define the accordianpanes in the itemtemplate then bind an inner gridview or listview inside each row

251586
qscrollarea	qmainwindow
the qscrollarea is just a widget that you put in a frame or qmainwindow

251619
equals	gethashcode
as the dictionary adds and checks existence of each item it uses both equals and gethashcode functions but has to rely on the equals function when the hashcode is less unique

251619
equals	gethashcode
by providing a more unique gethashcode function it excerises the equals function far less often

251632
ironruby	ironpython
i d have to say that it isn t so much about the individual language ironruby or ironpython as it is about the style of development that they enable

getter	setter
the only one besides the aforementioned singleton and its partner in crime the factory wouldn t be a gof it would be setter and getter when applied to an object s native properties

251995
getter	setter
setter and getter applied to member variables are functionally identical to public member variables

251995
getter	setter
a getter without a setter is more like a public final member variable--but at that point why not just use a public final member variable they do no more harm.

251995
getter	setter
with a setter and or getter you are still exposing your inner member structure to the outside world for instance you ll have to refactor other classes if you find you need to change a int to a long and you are almost assuring that some code that should be inside your object is instead being placed outside

252031
disk	ram
that space is equivalent to computer resources like ram hard disk etc

252034
free	malloc
unmanaged clean up after yourself malloc free

252050
width	height
i think if we can specify percentage width or height as we do in css html then we can adopt this cross-resolution policy

252053
versioning	upgrade
if a new versioning of the 3rd-party library is released it s usually easy to apply your customizations to it allowing for critical upgrade

252071
bazaar	svn
personally i ve been recently forced to use ide integrated source control in both eclipse and visual studio and eclipse after using tortoise svn wincvs and bazaar on the command line

252115
wan	lan
it looks great for inter-machine cluster lan wan communication between applications but i m not sure if it is suitable in architectural and current implementation terms for use as a software bus within one machine

252132
rss	feed
an alternative is to have the program generate an rss feed and direct the user how to subscribe to it

252132
hide	show
also once a new update is generated show the update toast for about a minute then hide it automatically and change your systray icon to something different

252153
free	malloc
malloc and free

252191
udp	tcp
while there are use cases i would guess they re much less common than guaranteed delivery - just like tcp seems to be used significantly more than udp

252193
unix	solaris
we are an all unix shop solaris linux

252250
put	get
if you do get them to specify their own smtp server make sure you put a send test email button on there so they can test it

252285
postgresql	mysql
asp.net pretty much requires windows server 2003 but if you re feeling adventurous you could probably use linux or macosx with mono free for your database engine you can use mysql free postgresql free ms sql 6000 or one of many others

252393
getattr	setattr
then iterate them explicitly and use setattr new attr getattr old attr

252473
int	chars
the ctypes stuff has all the c-type data types int chars short and so on and can pass by value or reference

252490
modifiers	sealed
the worst that can happen is that a new version of the base class will add a member with the same name as the deriving class in which case there will just be a compiler warning saying you should use the new or override modifiers or the base class is sealed which is a design no-no if the class has already been released into the wild

252518
free	malloc
the way it stands now a new or delete will behave as efficiently as malloc and free

252587
versioning	upgrade
ultimately though you ll want to check out your specific versioning information regarding upgrade to make sure you ve considered any versioning specific compatibility issues

252649
linefeed	delimiter
have the web service emit a string buffer where cells are delimiter by the tab character and rows by a carriage return linefeed

252650
strncpy	memcmp
then i believe you can get the good memcmp functions if you pass const char match 64 instead of const char match into the function or strncpy match into a 64 128 256 whatever byte array

252654
disk	ram
this will usually be a physical ram page but could eventually be a page in the page file on the hard disk or it could be a page in a memory mapped file on the hard disk

252667
int	chars
in the example above each element in the array consists of 10 bytes which is the smallest amount of memory that can hold either 10 chars s or 1 int

252680
listview	gridview
on my team we connect our middle tier to objectdatasources and then all of our gridview listview etc.

252680
listview	gridview
then from there you can connect any of your data-view controls gridview listview etc... to the data source

252681
antivirus	mcafee
my conclusion here is that mcafee antivirus is active with at lot of memory in use

252738
equals	gethashcode
for what it s worth that s not the only mistake along the lines of being too close to java personally i d rather equals and gethashcode weren t in object and that you needed specific monitor instances for locking too.

252740
awt	swing
as i said java gui toolkits might not feel native inside osx or even on windows but they sure work on both platforms you could use either swing or awt

252783
typedef	struct
using a typedef avoids having to write struct every time you declare a variable of that type

252785
ienumerable	iqueryable
see also what s the difference between iqueryable and ienumerable that overlaps with this question

252789
ienumerable	iqueryable
reactive programming for .net and c# developers - an introduction to ienumerable iqueryable iobservable and iqbservable

252792
strcpy	malloc
it makes a duplicate copy of the string passed in by running a malloc and strcpy of the string passed in

252792
free	malloc
the malloc ed buffer is returned to the caller hence the need to run free on the return value

252802
strdup	malloc
if the allocation failed it sets errno to enomem and returns null immediately setting of errno to enomem is something malloc does so we don t need to explicitly do it in our strdup

252810
typedef	struct
as greg hewgill said the typedef means you no longer have to write struct all over the place

252810
typedef	struct
update note that there are also highly-regarded c projects where this use of typedef to hide struct is considered a bad idea the linux kernel is probably the most well-known such project

252817
int	chars
i know i can tell the compiler if i want a value to be interpreted as a certain numeric type as int 32 bit signed this way appending an i type chars to the constant value

252825
hash	md5
so using a secure hash like sha256 md5 has collisions and is slow by comparison i can process about 30mb sec on my ho laptop

252852
postgresql	mysql
support for oracle hsqldb mysql db2 postgresql mssql and derby

252860
super	extends
josh bloch also has a good explanation of when to use super and extends in this google io video talk where he mentions the producer extends consumer super mnemonic

252867
typedef	struct
gtk+ aside i m not sure the tagname is used anything like as commonly as a typedef to the struct type so in c++ that is recognised and you can omit the struct keyword and use the tagname as the type name too

252962
integer	unsigned
how do we scanf or otherwise parse this numeric string into an unsigned 64 bit integer type in c++

253024
versioning	upgrade
maybe you could distribute a new software versioning and then you want to upgrade the database when a client is actually starting to use this new software

253083
implements	extends
you have to use explicit interface implementation in order to implements both and the generic form extends the non-generic form

253194
ant	maven
vim has good support for writing little macros like running ant maven builds

253259
kerberos	ntlm
this method works for both ntlm and kerberos authentication

253306
ironruby	ironpython
in the case that there is a significant portion of common code i would suggest looking into python and ruby as implementation languages as there are cocoa bindings for those languages on the mac and on windows with the use of ironpython and ironruby you could use reuse that code in a .net application as well

253320
hash	salt
would make more sense to generate a random salt for each hash and store it in a separate field

253327
post	get
to understand i am planning to write a email client which would make restful get call to the server to fetch the emails and post to send an email

253375
stdout	stderr
i had to resort to using popen and checking stdout and stderr and then parsing those

253426
switching	screens
i want to pass in the strategy for printing output in a tcl function so i can easily switching between printing to the screens and printing to a log file

253454
folder	directory
for .net i set the config file to deliver mail to a folder then you can have the automated test inspect the directory and files

253463
redmine	trac
i previously used trac to manage my projects but i switched to redmine

253463
redmine	trac
redmine uses textile markup but trac uses markdown so i had a couple of troubles there

253477
put	get
if you want to get super fancy about it put this in your .vimrc

253523
move	drag
for example i d like to know if i had a page that fit on the screen would my page elements receive mouse move events when i drag my finger

253549
post	get
i have the following code which works just fine when the method is post but changing to get doesn t work

253625
getter	setter
it can also be arguably valid to turn off coverage calculations for trivial getter and setter those that simply set or return a member variable with no other checks or side-effects

253628
udp	tcp
monitor a variety of services on tcp udp

253640
innodb	myisam
i think exactly what happens will be dependent on which database engine you re using there may even be differences between innodb and myisam in mysql

253703
hash	salt
edit to help defeat rainbow attacks -- where the attacker has retrieved your hash passwords and finds suitable matches that hash to the same values -- consider both using a random salt unique to each user s hash password and a fixed salt that is part of the algorithm not the data

253703
hash	salt
this should invalidate the rainbow tables since even knowing the user s salt and the hash algorithm the values in the attacker s rainbow tables won t map onto your hash passwords because of the addition of the fixed salt in the algorithm

253711
hash	salt
that means add a salt preferably a different salt for every user and think of using a sha2 hash function or maybe ripe-md i have not looked at that much

253722
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the replace is for cross-browser compatibility opera and ie add quotes to the url and firefox google-chrome and safari remove quotes

253820
vim	emacs
next i wanted to learn vim or emacs

253837
dbf	dbase
when you say dbf table are you referring to esri shape file dbf files which are in fact dbase files

253852
ready	each
in agile their is some up-front planning -- perhaps gathering large grain understanding story titles -- so that reasonable releases can be described but each release is planned independently and we delay discovery of the details until we are ready to begin implementation of that release

253883
wtl	atl
technically you do not need a global _module instance since atl wtl version 7

253883
wtl	atl
earlier atl wtl code referenced _module by this specific name and expected you to declare a single instance of this object

253903
expander	togglebutton
you need to retemplate the togglebutton within the expander s template .

253903
expander	togglebutton
so that you can template bind the background brush set on the expander all the way down through the expander s visuals and into the togglebutton s visuals using two templatebindings

253990
textmate	gedit
setup gedit to be almost like textmate

253993
public	protected
if i want all public internal and protected properties but not private properties i can t find a way of doing that

254005
ubuntu	debian
if you are on ubuntu debian plain old emacs with ruby-elisp package isn t bad

254023
aptana	radrails
i prefer aptana radrails on both mac and linux

254026
punctuation	words
it just replace bounds start end of string transition from words chars non punctuation by single quote

254086
division	multiplication	division	addition	addition	multiplication
there are no trig functions just some multiplication division and addition

254092
cvs	svn
tailor a python program which lets different version control systems interoperate simply calls the external programs cvs and svn when working with repositories of those formats

254130
mouse	keyboard
however i think most flash developers and especially those who make games rely on the fact that keyboard input is caught by the flash application regardless of where the mouse is

254135
redmine	trac
trac or redmine are both pretty good

254142
post	get
3 change your ajax code to add a variable to the get or post

254146
rss	feed
heck if you use google docs rather than excel you can even publish the thing as an rss feed and get it anywhere

254160
minix	linux
this book is written by tanenbaum the main guy behind minix which is what linux was based on

254184
pop-up	dialog
i know validation is possible using javascript but i would like the user to only see .drp files in his pop-up dialog

254194
extjs	prototypejs
i ve been using extjs+prototypejs for a while now and it helped me a lot to work into the extjs code with having the more familiar prototypejs along for the ride as well

254229
execl	fork
the hard part is that my popen2 uses fork and execl to start the process and assign the streams to stdin and stdout of the child processes

254250
typedef	struct
to prevent these problems it s a good idea to typedef your classes and struct in c++ too even though at first glance it appears to be unnecessary

254276
next	except
first off i know next to nothing about language theory and i barely know any other languages except java but i had an idea that i think would be cool but i need you guys to tell me

254288
post	get
if you post the error you get it might be easier to diagnose your problem

254299
opera	safari
what about opera safari chrome..

254361
stdout	stderr
the trick here is that createprocess has a parameter where you can pass stdin stdout stderr of the newly-created process

254374
hash	md5
for larger files you could compute a md5 or sha hash of the files

254435
floating-point	integer
however most real code is not this way and real performance benefits from a caching system often come from being able to cache common integer and floating-point data structures not huge quantities of pointers

254437
folder	directory
for recursive directory uploads your best solution is using chrome 11 s new folder upload api

254441
persistent	transient
it turned out that if a dataresult was created with a transient subobject and the subobject was persistent the dataresult hashcode was changed

254493
organization	naming
the advantage to this is visual organization in sql management studio you can get the same thing by putting everything under one schema and naming tables with a single identifier

254510
width	height
you can enter any width and height values and it will shrink stretch accordingly

254518
hash	md5
i would use a hash of the file s contents using md5

254594
x86	64bit
i ve seen somewhere that the best mix on x86 cpus is to use a 64bit os and 32-bit applications

254635
executable	upx
pythoninstaller comes with built-in support for upx and uses it to compress the executable but they are still really huge about 2 7 mb

254641
public	protected
it only operates on public properties though no protected or internal members and no fields

254732
client-side	server-side
edit in our shop client-side sendmail only works if the site is trusted and i can t change that due to security requirements nor can i switch to server-side sendmail

254748
for-loop	arrays
my own recommendation would be to use an indexed collection then use a for-loop with an appropriate index calculation here one could use a random number generator if necessary with an integer arrays or some other technique for verifying that the same index value is not used twice if you have to do this in actual practice

254781
groovy	gsp
i haven t done this in a while for jsp but frequently use a similar technique in gsp groovy grails server pages

254864
getter	setter
i ask because i don t believe i ve ever seen this style before for if or loops but i do see it used for getter and setter in c# properties like

254874
inherited	properties
it is protected because dgv inherited the properties from control

254993
hide	show
in other words just hide the button that the user presses and show the other two

255005
gif	bmp
just like gif jpg emf wmf bmp

255073
typedef	struct
then for each pointer you ll need to use marshal.ptrtostructure to dereference the pointer into a pcredentials struct instance sorry i cannot find the typedef for pcredentials anywhere i ll assume you have it - and if you do don t forget the correct marshalas attributes and structlayout attribute when you do define it

255082
codeigniter	cakephp
i have narrowed it down to cakephp and codeigniter

255095
klocwork	coverity
so it depends on whether your priority is quality checking findbugs coverity or security vulnerability analysis klocwork or fortify

255109
uiview	subviews
i went ahead and wrote my own uiview with a uiimageview subviews that uses an nstimer to switch between images

255117
klocwork	coverity
we use findbugs pmd coverity and klocwork because they all have different strengths and we are paranoid

255124
solaris	bsd
you can follow tpgould s link to the solaris source or it s easy to find the source online from any linux or bsd distribution

255212
diffmerge	winmerge
which illustrates the concrete settings of diffmerge and winmerge for msysgit and gitk

255235
factors	matrix
the matrix can scale down by a factors of ab.mag 2 remember the matrix are only calculated once per a b meaning that it s better that finding them is slower than the actual check itself

255284
appkit	nsimage
appkit is not available on the iphone nor is nsimage

255292
int	double
int decimals double and other numeric value-types can be compared to 0 zero with a simple test

255316
trac	bugzilla
i also like mylyn and tasktop to work with bugzilla trac to manage projects

255362
clang	llvm
i am not a compiler guy but when i get frustrated with some limitation of llvm or clang it is usually pretty easy to dive in and change it

255474
opera	safari
mozilla safari and some recent versions of opera actually implement an almost standards mode which is dedicated entirely to transitional pages

255476
wxpython	pyqt
it would simply be a browser gui instead of a wxpython pyqt gui

255481
versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade the application easily and all users have the same versioning of the app running

255481
awt	swing
qt gtk wxwindows java awt swing xul -- they all suffer from the same problem the resulting gui doesn t look native on every platform

255485
cvs	svn
2 a version control system cvs svn git

255501
installation	upgrade
easier to manage no installation required on user machines upgrade need only be performed on server side and are immediately available to all users

255507
typedef	struct
if a future standard allowed you to declare a struct elem without a struct qualifier or appropriate typedef the above program would fail because elem is being used as an identifier for an int

255518
sorting	grouping
displaytag - for generating sophisticated html tables that includes data paging grouping sorting exporting etc

255530
stdout	stderr
using gcc -v --help produced a very long listing of options from sub-processes actually 1001 lines on stdout and 14 on stderr on my mac ppc g4 and macos x 10.4.11

255608
cvs	svn
all our corporate projects are controlled by cvs but i want to use svn for my personal documents and tortoisesvn as client

255644
lsp	principles
this conflicts with my long-time believing in lsp liskov substitution principles

255682
profiler	xperf
on windows you can use the profiler built into visual studio or the xperf tools from the windows organization

255738
serializable	deserialization
the serializable deserialization aspect

255741
ada	pascal
i m a complete ada newbie though i ve used pascal for 2-3 years during hs

the file doc.xml contains the generation of the reports with emma cpd checkstyle etc

255822
cvs	svn
you can try cvs or svn subversion

255841
children	parent
to move a folder and its children you have to update all the records that use the same parent to the new parent

255896
getter	setter
reinforce the cohesiveness of transactionmanager by centering its api around transaction steps like inittransaction persisttransaction ... avoiding any getter or setter for any transaction instance

255905
postgresql	mysql
i work with mysql and postgresql databases

255907
put	get
what do i need to put into the property text so i get the unicode character u0d15 displayed on the button

x86	64bit
make sure to download the x86 edition for 32-bit computers and the x64 edition for 64bit computers oses

255958
ilist	icollection
it is specifically important when looking at framework library classes - in your example for instance it highlights the idea that this class can be treated as either an icollection or an ilist without the developer having to know that ilist is actually an icollection

255988
jquery	simplemodal
i ve been quite happy with the jquery plug-in simplemodal

256027
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
the only differences are sqlcommand oledbcommand and sqldataadapter oledbdataadapter

256027
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
in this case sql query string is also the same for both databases but there is the difference between the type of cmd sqlcommand oledbcommand

256040
client-side	server-side
you can t just do this in html because an html page only does stuff client-side and you can only delete files server-side

256046
hash	md5
insert into example hash value md5 hello

256092
bazaar	git
bazaar is a distributed version tool just like git but is imo simpler to setup and use

256099
client-side	server-side
there s two parts - client-side and server-side

256106
serializable	deserialization
maybe if you find serializable and deserialization esoteric

256117
min	max
i don t even want to try to count the different flavors of sql that exist so i try to keep functions especially non-standard extensions out of my sql code except for things like sum or min max

256118
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
for those who might call out sqldatasource and objectdatasource you don t always have to have them declared in your .aspx.cs or .aspx.vb

256146
post	get
i ve seen the examples and the blog post regarding anonymous methods but i don t get them yet

256234
serializable	deserialization
all the necessary serializable deserialization is contained in the web service client - meaning when control is returned to me after calling the client the entire xml string contained in the soap response is not available to me - just the deserialized components

256241
ant	maven
ant and maven are there

256241
versioning	upgrade
not the latest versioning but that s easy enough to upgrade

256243
profiling	debugging
first turn off all the profiling and debugging switches

256245
internationalization	translation
the recent gwt is also great for building weblication with ajax it translation the java code into javascript with internationalization features etc

256305
width	height
let s say you want an array of width height the most efficient way is to just use a single dimensional array

256321
agile	sprint
if this is an agile project using scrum xp etc. then presumably you are working in iterations or sprint

256326
put	get
get the last 24 hours of logs count the number of requests to each article and put those numbers in the database

256359
put	get
put is often described as the edit method as by replacing the entire resource with a slightly altered version you have edited what clients will get when they next do

256359
post	get
the html5 spec defines get and post for the form element

256362
backtracking	greedy
solutions using a lazy or greedy dot will always lead to a lot of useless backtracking when the regex does not match the subject string

256376
aptana	radrails
you can use either eclipse with the aptana plugin and then install the aptana radrails plugin or you can use aptana as a stand-alone application

256434
xml-rpc	json-rpc
json-rpc and xml-rpc in c c++

256444
trie	tree
a search on the boost main page suggests they have a splay and avl tree but not a trie

256498
dictionary	map
and the interface of a dictionary data structure in java is map

256511
skip-lists	tree
my question is - why would you ever want to use a skip-lists over a binary search tree

256529
rss	feed
what further confuses me is that i am using the same xmlreader code to parse rss feed from external websites in this application without problem

256591
public	protected
using reflection it is further enforced that child object has no public methods nor any package or protected methods except those inherited from isolatedobject nearly all of which are final

256591
getter	setter
no getter returning stale cached thread data and no setter changing object state while another method is acting on it

256628
jquery	scriptaculous
i ran into this problem with scriptaculous before i switched to jquery and discovered a beforesetup animation callback

256634
for-loop	loops
but if i put the services in a loops a simple for-loop

256639
powerpc	thumb
look at bundling on ia64 dual instruction sets on arm thumb register windows on sparc the count register on powerpc

256667
websphere	ibm
ibm is now trying to implement a technology called embedded websphere with java

256672
coalesce	isnull
i think coalesce function partially similar to the isnull but try it

256678
implements	extends
this architecture scales extremely well and is very easy to implements and extends as soon as you understood the basic principle

256698
postgresql	mysql
i m a postgresql fan too and this is something that has always frustrated me about mysql when i have had no choice but to use it

256713
cvs	svn
and unlike svn cvs you don t have to be connected to the grid in order to be able to commit

256713
cvs	svn
you can set up a local svn cvs server but that wont work with the grid server

256761
vim	emacs
a hack that would end the vim emacs flame war

256778
profiling	instrumentation
of course using a profiling makes your code slower but that is unavoidable when adding any kind of instrumentation

256812
int	chars
in c# a string is an array of chars and since a chars is basically an alias for 16bit int you can probably get away with storing arbitrary binary data in a string

256826
post	get	post	put	put	get
rest is a principle and atom is how you convey bulk of data when it needs to for post put requests and get responses

256826
ssl	https
it is obvously ssl https

256826
ssl	https
i can t currently remember how xmlrpc deals with but with jsonrpc implementation that i have it is trivial - you merely change http to https in your urls to jsonrpc and it shall be going over ssl enabled transport

256830
margin	height
note the the height of the first and the top margin of the second will need to be adjusted to suit your needs

256838
rss	feed
it also supports rss feed which would enable some form of notification to individual files

256997
children	parent
searches for a parent tag t would then match all descendants of t t tags whos parent is t children of t grandchildren of t etc.

257039
rss	feed
for example you could use xslt to automatically transform xhtml into an rss feed or another xml format

i got a javascript that runs very well on firefox and safari but refuses to run on ie

257132
ant	maven
it has built-in support for maven and ant if you use those but if not you can simply write your own batch file shell script

257152
hex	binary
if i have two things which are hex can i someone how append their binary together to get a value

257276
getter	setter
default snippets suck but customizability shines searching for usages and going to declarations eclim grep ctags generating getter and setter java_getset or eclim automatic imports eclim

257279
firefox	safari
firefox safari and co

257304
int	chars
a chars is just an 8-bit int

257305
mouse	keyboard
you ll need to create a window with sdl_setvideomode to get mouse and keyboard events

257305
mouse	keyboard
i don t think you ll have luck trying to sdl_wm_grabinput the mouse and keyboard without a window

257306
min	max
you can choose to do min or max or some other tiebreaker if you want

257321
firefox	safari
when firefox and safari encounter this ambiguity they return the text of the selected option

257346
int	chars
in c++ chars are interchangeable with int and you can compare their values directly

257354
rss	feed
i d say the answer is having an rss feed be nothing more than another view of your data

257354
rss	feed
this means that your rss feed is simply an xml representation of the data in your database

257355
rss	feed
an rss feed is just an xml document that conforms to a specific schema

257359
x86	64bit
on an x86 platform usually double is 64bit and long double is either 64 or 80 bits which gives you 19 significant figures if i remember right

257366
rss	feed
here s a simple asp.net 2 based rss feed i use as a live bookmark for my localhost dev sites

257377
rss	feed
an rss feed is just an xml document formatted in a certain way and linked to from a web page

257410
unsigned	short
unsigned short s

257417
emacs	jedit
i think you re either stuck with some emacs variant or jedit

257524
width	margin
like eoin said you need to put a non-breaking space into your empty spans but you can t assign a width to an inline element only padding margin so you ll need to make it float so that you can give it a width

257533
versioning	upgrade
there s no upgrade path to newer versioning of windows mobile for this device and i doubt i ll be getting any newer devices any time soon

257577
joomla	oscommerce
i do a lot of work on sites that run joomla oscommerce drupal etc and so i have created a lot of custom components plugins and hacks etc

257651
min	max
first use datetime.subtract to determine how many minutes seconds whatever between your min and max dates

257661
post	get
if you re sending i d be checking to see that nusoap is sending via post rather than get you ll probably have to dig into the code to see

257709
packets	multicast
this is done for scalability reasons - it wouldn t be a good idea to allow one host to originate multicast packets which are propagated to every ip address on the internet

257779
opensymphony	webwork
opensymphony webwork

257790
tapestry	wicket
there s also wicket a very decent comparison of wicket and tapestry is available here

257790
jsf	wicket	jsf	tapestry	tapestry	wicket
tapestry and wicket in particular seem to be gaining ground while everyone seems to have a horror story about jsf

257849
filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs	xfs	btrfs
linux and some filesystems ext4 xfs btrfs and ocfs2

257849
solaris	sunos
os x solaris sunos and probably other unixes

257849
filesystems	xfs
most linux systems have xfs_mkfile which works exactly the same way and not just on xfs filesystems despite the name

257849
ubuntu	debian
it s included in xfsprogs for debian ubuntu or similar named packages

257849
filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs	xfs	btrfs
most linux systems also have fallocate which only works on certain filesystems such as btrfs ext4 ocfs2 and xfs but is the fastest as it allocates all the file space creates non-holey files but does not initialize any of it

257952
vsts	tfs
vsts 2008 test edition home btw there s a link to a trial vpc w tfs vsts suite on the right-hand side

257953
width	height
safari will expand up to a width of 800px unless the width is already greater than 800 in which case it maintains that width and only modifies the window height

257954
disk	ram
edit - yes virtual memory is memory blocks copied to disk because the ram is full

257954
disk	ram
there is a conflict here - the more ram you use for cache the more other memory you have to swap out to disk

257989
filesystems	fat
make sure you understand the structure of the filesystems and pick one that allows for extending - i know that ext2 is fairly easy to extend by another block group and fat is difficult to extend need to append to the fat

257992
kde	gnome
unfortunately while konsole of kde doesn t use this key gnome terminal does so the f1 key becomes inaccessible to my application

258132
width	height
the difference was that i am not allowed to have a decimal number for the width or height of images in the postscript but rather only integers

258133
post	get
how can i parse the query string get post parameters sent to an application s manifest in .net

258137
mbunit	nunit
luckilly most unit-testing frameworks like xunit.net nunit and mbunit have their own stand-alone testrunner

258150
disk	ram
then of course the hardware and os have multilayer caches on chip-cache sram cache dram cache ordinary ram working set and backing store on disk

258212
hash	md5
the file names are md5 hash exactly 32 hex characters long and are being kept in a tree structure that looks like this

258275
folder	directory
i m trying to run a command-line process which is extraction of a .7z archive on a file that lies in a temporary folder on the windows user temp directory

258305
bazaar	git
there is a great and exhaustive comparison tables and charts on git mercurial and bazaar over at infoq s guide about dvcs

258318
mvp	presenter
i would assume only the presenter should know of the session as that object is the closest thing to a controller in mvp

258338
stdout	stderr
assuming that the process writes errors to stderr stdout you could set useshellexecute to false and redirect stdout stderr

258338
stdout	stderr
there is an example on msdn here stderr and here stdout

258338
stdout	stderr
if you need to read from both stderr and stdout and use waitforexit then things get more interesting - usually involving either a few threads or async methods

258338
stdout	stderr
one other final option is to use pipe redirection in the command - - this pipes stdout into out.txt and pipes stderr into stdout so this also goes into out.txt

258356
google-chrome	safari
check on google-chrome safari

258366
uiview	calayer
if you are just repeating the same pattern over and over again you are likely to find the best performance is implementing a custom uiview calayer uicolor that knows how to draw what you want rather than placing visually identical layers or views next to each other

258387
stdout	stderr
i don t know if it is any better but i ve just been looking at something similar using threads to read both stderr stdout like below

258400
width	height
you can also make it overflow auto and give a maximum fixed height and width that way when the text or whatever is in there overflows it ll show only the required scrollbar

258440
post	get
well if the user arrived to the previous page by post as opposed to get and reposts the page the server is going to process the request again

258445
uiview	calayer
in another attempt i tried a very simple small 20x20 calayer object as a sublayer of my uiview s layer property but that didn t show up

258461
subtract	add
whereas with ints you can add to or subtract from the value this makes no sense for functions

258500
getter	setter
a property is a single attribute-like name that wraps a collection of setter getter and deleter functions

258517
width	height
why not simply using percent width and height on your html page for your flash object

258540
mvp	presenter
i am doing something like this in my mvp implementation i inject an icookiemanager isessionmanager icachemanager iconfigurationmanager iredirector into my presenter which are implemented by classes that wrap the functionality for this

258555
multiplying	add
i guess what you did is calculate that .000694 is about the value of a minute and you are multiplying it by the number of minutes you want to add 31 in the example although you said 30 in the text

258625
post	get
example vulnerabilities default gpc array merge-order means that cookie values override get and post so can be used for xss and http attacks

258625
post	get
example countermeasures reconfigure array merge-order from gpc to cgp so get post overwrite cookie not the other way around

258645
yacc	bison
gnu s replacement of the yacc parser generator is named bison

258684
websphere	ibm
if you want rock solid commercial support and integration to just about anything ibm s mq series now websphere mq provides all the features described in your requirements

258736
post	get
it has to be sanitised and validated so why should you care if it came in the form of a post a get or a cookie

258775
children	parent
for example given a lazy parent- children relation and an instance x of parent i d like to know if x.children is already loaded without triggering the query

258779
inherited	properties
when you need to pass a value to a form such as a filter inherited from another control or another form for example just add the corresponding properties for your form and add your value to this properties

258790
ecdsa	rsa
asymmetric cipher rsa with 4096 bit key i believe that is the maximum in .net or ecdsa with 571 bit key but that is only supported in .net 3.5

258812
hide	show
i would like to manipulate that .xap file through the use of javascript in the browser to show and hide user controls based upon java script events

258813
implements	extends
extends system.runtime.serialization.formatter implements system.runtime.serialization.iformatter

258983
inherited	subclassing
thusly all the constructors of my subclassing have the parameters or the classes they inherited from

259038
post	get
start issuing commands to the server through the post request and get the corresponding rtsp stream as part of the get response

259038
post	get
update #3 ok in the light of the above the magic value of 48 02 02 00 is clear 48 h is for http_response the next 02 is the length of the following data the next 02 is called post_not_received meaning that the post request did not reach the server within a second from the corresponding get request

259080
bluej	greenfoot
i think greenfoot is better than bluej for 8-years old

259130
int	double
i cast an unsigned int to float then to double and back to float

259144
hide	show
also a method is added to show hide the views...this could will probably get more advanced robust with animations etc...but this show the basic idea

259151
mouse	keyboard
there is x11vnc x11vnc allows one to view remotely and interact with real x displays a display corresponding to a physical monitor keyboard and mouse with any vnc viewer

259151
ssl	https
it has built-in ssl encryption and authentication unix account and password support server-side scaling single port https and vnc mdns service advertising and tightvnc and ultravnc file-transfer

259246
multiplying	add
if you pass in mask instead of nbits and use bitshifting instead of multiplying or dividing and change the tail recursion to a loop this will probably be the most performant solution you ll find since every other call it will be nothing but a single add it would only be as slow as alnitak s solution once every 4 maybe even 8 calls

259249
jquery	scriptaculous
i ve also developed ajax applications using js frameworks such as jquery prototype and scriptaculous

259286
istream	getline
the istream returned by getline is having its operator void method implicitly called which returns whether the stream has run into an error

259323
mvp	presenter
the mvp pattern which is usually the one that ms promotes is more geared around the presenter ie your wpf form having more control and thats fine too..

259336
http-get	http-post
a http-get request should be without side-effects while a http-post may have side-effects and thus can t be cached

259409
postgresql	mysql
from the looks of it the major choices are postgresql mysql or firebird

259460
postgresql	mysql
if you aren t sure if you want to use mysql or postgresql i suggest trying them both out

259460
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is more compliant but if you re comfortable with mysql and you re using an orm you should probably use that

259461
getter	setter
it would use an inner class to hold its properties and i would require all data access to pass in and out of getter and setter

259461
getter	setter
these would in turn call the getter and setter on the inner class

259517
postgresql	mysql
i cannot propose any db not knowing your specific needs but if you want to use a free software which excludes oracle and you re not already experienced with mysql you should try postgresql which is more powerful than mysql

259575
pop-up	dialog
is there any way to have the jfilechooser or maybe another file selection dialog display inside a jpanel and not pop-up above it

259582
hide	show
next use the showwindow api function specifying either sw_hide or sw_show to hide or show the window respectively

259591
cpython	ironpython
we re using ironpython not the more usual cpython

259599
ant	maven
you could use ant maven to check it out of a repository and move it into the correct location

259600
folder	directory
do i need to create a directory structure somewhere on the server that includes my project_name w vendor trunk branches and tags subfolders import that into my repo and then import the code from the vendor into the vendor folder

259616
vb.net	vb6
there s already a lot for vb6 programmers to learn in moving to vb.net

259688
stdout	stderr
it looks like you are redirecting stdout to your log file but not stderr - would suggest adding 2 1 to the end of the command line to ensure you re not missing any error information from the log

259730
inherited	properties
how can i access the inherited properties of the base class sproperty1 through com

259774
post	get
note when automatically redirecting a post request after receiving a 301 status code some existing http 1.0 user agents will erroneously change it into a get request

259889
post	get
the button for the image shows the image in the preview section but when i actually post the data i only get some text back like the tags are getting messed up

259947
client-side	server-side
you should then hydrate the objects into a different class on the client-side than on the server-side

260056
dictionary	map
i m trying to figure out if there s a reasonably efficient way to perform a lookup in a dictionary or a hash or a map or whatever your favorite language calls it where the keys are regular expressions and strings are looked up against the set of keys

260056
dictionary	map
i can think of a naive way to implement this in which i iterate over all of the keys in the dictionary and try to match the passed in string against them but then i lose the o 1 lookup time of a hash map and instead have o n where n is the number of keys in my dictionary

260058
doc	odf
now most every project can be saved as one file like doc ppt and odf

260058
firefox	safari
firefox and safari with a cumbersome extension

260058
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
firefox opera and safari support it without gaffes

260062
pop-up	dialog
i d like to create a pop-up dialog box in silverlight in which i can manipulate controls enter data and return a value

260077
trie	tree
if the class of regular expressions you ll be using is more restrictive you might be able to use a data structure such as a trie or suffix tree

260148
lxml	libxml2	lxml	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
if you have libxml2 and libxslt installed then also install lxml

260148
elementtree	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
it provides a nice easy-to-use binding for libxml2 and libxslt and it also implements the elementtree

260148
lxml	libxml2	lxml	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well

260168
hex	binary
you can add attachments as binary but you ll have to manually do that with a hex editor or create a tool and support for it by clients might not be as good

260197
pop-up	dialog
using pop-up to create a dialog class

260200
obiee	microstrategy
the top contenders are obiee oracle bi enterprise edition formerly siebel analytics and microstrategy

260206
submit	submission
you can add an additional datasource for submission send to sharepoint library and add a rule to your submit button before the save close rules

260236
hash	md5
i know that php has md5 sha1 and the hash functions but i want to create a hash using the mysql password function

260264
disk	ram
edit in response to the edit the lag you re describing sounds like your machine is out of ram and is swapping to disk rather than you being video card limited

260277
skip-lists	tree
transactional red-black tree are comparable with transactional skip-lists

260295
subtract	add
currently you add subtract 5 whenever the event fires and that s not really predictable

260335
geocoding	geocode
geocode all the addresses with google s geocoding

260375
ant	cruisecontrol
i use ant to build delphi applications called from cruisecontrol

260405
vim	emacs
for keyboard centric apps like vim and emacs the fact that i can use them comfortably unaltered should be fairly impressive

260423
profiler	visualvm
for runtime metrics use any profiler such as visualvm netbeans profiler or the eclipse tptp tools

260430
distance	polygons
though if you want to calculate within a certain distance from a zip you need to think about if you are going to use the zip centroid or a polygons representation of the zip code

260446
disk	ram
fast disk will make a difference also lots of ram as much as you can

260446
disk	ram
something like a sun ultra 20m2 or hp xw4550 2nd gen opteron based with 4-8gb of ram and a couple of fast disk would be about as quick as you can get and will run vm s quickly

260453
innodb	myisam
you have to specify that the tables are innodb because myisam engine doesn t support foreign key

260485
direct3d	directx
since managed directx is not being supported any longer by microsoft this is a good way to use managed code with direct3d

260487
int	double
you can process these however you need depending on whether you re intending it for double or int or whatever

260582
int	boolean
int real or boolean is converted

260582
put	get
i would read that as varnull cannot be converted to a tdatetime to put into the field and hence you get the exception that you re experiencing

260608
testcase	fixture
the django folks offer a subclass of python s standard unittest testcase class that populates a database with a known fixture -- a known set of data rows

260608
testcase	fixture
this testcase subclass allows to write a typical-looking testcase that exercises the database with the known data fixture

260642
post	get
first check to see which file is selected from the post or get it s unclear what action the form is taking from your post

260678
int	chars
in practice this means that 7 an int type is different from 7 a quoted chars of string type

260678
int	chars
php javascript and other dynamic scripting languages are usually weakly-typed in that they will convert a string 7 to an int 7 if you try to add 7 + 3 although sometimes you have to do this explicitly and javascript uses the + chars for concatenation

260710
subclass	abstract-class
except that abstract-class can t be directly instantiated only extended so the use is therefore always from a subclass s constructor

260722
hash	md5
this will hash mystring and store the md5 sum in md5str

260730
rss	feed
find the best design blog s and stick them in your rss feed

260731
daemons	launchd
this will launchd the gconf daemons

260731
daemons	launchd
if the d-bus environment vars are not set the daemons will not launchd

260741
keydown	keyup
keyup is usually a good time to respond to any action that is going to have an effect on a document but keydown would be better if it s a game where the user wants immediate effect

260744
public	protected
the constructor s of an abstract class can have the usual access modifiers public protected and private for internal use

260744
public	protected
which of protected and public is the correct access modifier to use since the abstract type seems to indicate that technically a public constructor will act very much protected

260755
subclass	abstract-class
abstract-class the constructor used in subclass must explicitly call

260779
public	protected
since the abstract type seems to indicate that technically a public constructor will act very much protected

260779
initializer	class-method
an abstract class cannot be directly initializer by calling its constructor however any concrete implementation will inherit the abstract class-method and visibility

260779
public	protected
actually the abstract class s constructor can only be called from the implementation s constructor so there is no difference between it being public or protected

260826
public	protected
since the abstract type seems to indicate that technically a public constructor will act very much protected

260826
public	protected
for abstract classes this constructor scope public or protected is not of much difference since the instantiation is not allowed even if public

260826
public	protected
since it is meant to be invoked by the subclass it can invoke either public or protected constructor seamlessly

260827
easymock	powermockito
powermockito is an extension to easymock that allows mocking of static methods

260829
hash	salt
second if you must store credentials prefer rather to stored passwords using a non-reversible salt cryptographic hash so if you data is compromised the passwords cannot easily be reverse-engineered and there s no need to store a decryption key at all

260830
folder	directory
familiar microsoft outlook features are supported including rich text folder and directory catalog

260878
gif	png
you may fall foul of file formats ie reportedly only supports it s .ico format whilst most everyone else supports png and gif images and possibly caching issues both on the browser and through proxies

260891
cas	opensso
i would look at a system such as cas or opensso either of which will redirect users to the login page without any need to enter a url

260915
free	malloc
firstname is a pointer to an array of char which is not being allocated by the malloc only the pointer is being allocated and after you call free it doesn t erase the memory it just marks it as available on the heap to be over written later

260950
realloc	malloc
if you want to grow the array dynamically you should use malloc to dynamically allocate some fixed amount of memory and then use realloc whenever you run out

260955
serializable	deserialization
things like and are mainly used during serializable the exception being which is set during deserialization as well as queried during serializable

260972
memcpy	memmove	memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy	memmove	strcpy	strncpy	memmove	strncpy
standard c provides strcpy strcat strncat strncpy memmove memcpy etc

260972
strcpy	strncpy
it makes sense to use strncpy over strcpy for safety if you don t know the source string will fit inside the destination buffer

260976
cpu	affinity
the only exception is when you set a thread affinity mask to a single cpu - then you can be certain that if the thread executes at all it runs on that single cpu

260981
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
if you re using c things are a lot harder yes malloc realloc and free are the tools to help you

261079
int	double
you can think in bytes int double and other higher level data types

261115
post	get
if you post the modem carrier goal etc you might be able to get more specific help

261138
mbunit	nunit
on the other hand i seem to remember that asp.net mvc has unit testing options for ms test nunit and mbunit

261140
tabcontrol	tabitem
i don t believe that the wpf tabcontrol can be brought to fade from one tabitem to the next since it is not equipped to display multiple tabitem simultaneously

261163
stdio	fflush
fflush only fflush the buffering added by the stdio fopen layer as managed by the object

261189
gif	png
for image to be able to construct itself from a stream the data must be in one of the supported standard image formats gif png jpeg etc

261277
boost	stl
i recommend nicola bonelli s answer to be accepted. that s part of the stl and doesn t require using boost if your code doesn t use boost thanks to the commenters for pointing this out

261280
lisp	scheme	erlang	lisp	erlang	scheme
i m also working on article about using emacs as development environment for many languages - c c++ java perl lisp scheme erlang etc.

261290
nunit	mstest
does mstest have standalone gui similar to nunit that lets me use it and run test without visual studio

261292
width	height
i will probably be bashed by css purists here but using a table with 100 width and height works in any browser and does not require browser-specific css hacks

261378
installation	upgrade
i have a tool which automatically creates installshield installers installscript not msi and my main problem at the moment is that when upgrading an installation i need a way to prevent features from being upgrade

261378
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
during the installation i want to check the versioning of a exe-file installed on the target system and depending on this i want to be able to exclude a specific feature from the set of files being upgrade

261388
rss	feed
if you want to generate a feed of elements that already exist in html one option is to modify your html markup to use hatom and then point feed readers through an hatom- atom or hatom- rss proxy

261408
ubuntu	debian
what ubuntu debian packages do i need to install

261410
getter	setter
getter and setter are a bodge to get around this

261410
getter	setter
this isn t just a best practice thing either serialization in c# will rely on properties not getter setter so not using properties could lead to all sorts of problems in the future if you need to serialize your classes

261434
getter	setter
i made a custom valueobject class with properties getter setter and i need this class for data binding of elements on form

261435
getter	setter
prior to that it used a slightly different naming scheme for getter and setter which naturally can still be used with properties or for plain old attributes

261435
getter	setter
the typical getter has the same name as the attribute the setter is the attribute prefixed by set as per java s convention

261436
awt	swing
where have you been writing a run method what kind of application are you writing swing awt console etc and what s your development environment

261450
onchange	onblur
validation occurs in the onchange event rather than the onblur

261522
vim	emacs
what is the command to match brackets in emacs the equivalent of the command in vim

261586
radiobuttonlist	datalist
how to get the values of the radiobuttonlist which will be selected in nested datalist to use it in multi insert later

261596
hide	show
edit you can also use .toggle instead of .show to show hide

261601
min	max
i need to hide a windows form from the taskbar but i can t use ws_ex_toolwindow because i need the system menu and min max buttons on the form s title bar

261603
xstream	jibx
i am trying to weigh up whether to use an automatic binding program like the one supplied in jaxb or jibx or whether to manually write my own classes and use something like xstream for marshalling unmarshalling

261619
min	max
and windows menu and min max buttons are still visible

jar	war
i do not want to start a long and endless holly war on the question but from my experience - if you can use tool that generates all code for you and do not require jar dependable

261812
internationalization	localization
for more details for resource bundles check out java internationalization localization with resourcebundles

261873
post	get
i have a website in asp.net c# which receives some data via get post

261938
actionscript	mxml
if everything that can be accomplished in mxml can also be accomplished in actionscript and many things are easier to accomplish in actionscript loops conditionals etc why take the time to learn mxml

261958
allegro	sdl
i ve done lots of games in c++ before using sdl sfml allegro etc etc but never gotten around to using the network libraries

261958
udp	tcp
i ve read about the arguments between tcp udp so i don t want to start a war like that here

262000
int	double
we can safely assume the vector only contains pods usually float s and sometimes double s and int s

262005
google-chrome	firefox
check that site with firefox or google-chrome they have js debuggers

262013
versioning	upgrade
i got tired of trying delphi every year hoping that i will find a stable versioning to upgrade from my good old delphi 7

262041
128bit	64bit
if you just need very large numbers you could use long 64bit or even decimal 128bit floating point

262080
bazaar	git
5 - git bazaar hg - bazaar and hg have their tortoises so good for windows even though i m not sure about maturity git would be linux only for the time being even though it is very good and much better and easier to use than a couple of years ago

262090
width	height
i understand that you can use getimagesize to get the actual pixel height and width of an image in php

262101
ironruby	ironpython
ironruby ironpython on .net and .net is gaining the dlr - dynamic language runtime

262158
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the simple html below displays differently in firefox and webkit-based browsers i checked in safari google-chrome and iphone

262158
firefox	safari
in firefox both border and text have the same color #880000 but in safari the text gets a bit lighter as if it had some transparency applied to it

262174
hide	show
a combination of css and javascript can then be used to show and hide portions of the hierarchy of the tree or menu

262197
int	double
the problems these days tend to lie in the int to float and float to int and not single to double and double to single as you have specified above

262228
jsfl	fla
you cannot run jsfl from command line but compiling a fla file should be possible

262251
cvs	svn
but other source control products cvs subversion microsoft team foundation source save server svn do not support shared files

262346
int	chars
i am storing a dash and an x so that explains the chars and anyway you won t be doing int arithmetic on the phone numbers i guess so it makes little sense to try to use a numeric type

262362
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu linux with gnome running my swing application by double clicking on the jar file in gnomes file browser leads to errors because required libraries that are dynamically loaded via the java plugin framework residing in subdirectories are not found

262372
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
you have to tell either the objectdatasource what object to use or the sqldatasource what stored proc to use

262412
min	max
advantages of this design is that it s easy to count how many items a given user has it s easy to compute things like min and max for a given property you can enforce a foreign key for the referential property etc

262427
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested in firefox 3.0.1 and google-chrome 0.3 and just as a disclaimer i know this is not cross-browser functionality no ie

262436
jar	manifest.mf
i believe if you add to the jar a meta-inf manifest.mf file containing a classpath attribute with a value specifying the relative paths to the jars you need i m not sure whether they are space or comma separated that might work

262439
free	malloc
hey i am trying to create wrapper functions for free and malloc in c to help notify me of memory leaks

262439
free	malloc
does anyone know how to declare these functions so when i call malloc and free it will call my custom functions and not the standards lib functions

262442
kerberos	ntlm
i figure if we changed the sharepoint authentication to kerberos instead of ntlm it would solve the issue

262476
sorting	grouping
when your query implicitly generates a temporary table for instance while sorting or grouping by this can use a lot of memory

262479
free	malloc
if you define your own functions for malloc and free and explicitly link that with your applications your functions should be used in preference to those in the library

262479
free	malloc
in other words you d have to implement the internals of malloc and free yourself

262481
free	malloc
not only it lets you specify custom malloc and free but will also identify the caller by the return address on the stack

262481
free	malloc
define malloc and free as wrappers to the original allocation routines in your executable which will override the version from libc

262486
versioning	upgrade
i don t know if there are readily available versioning of stl that do this already but it s worth sticking to the library functions so that when you upgrade to a versioning that does this optimization is there for you without you needing to make any changes

262508
uiview	subviews
the main difference between my example and the apple example is that my views are not full screen i have a container uiview which contains both subviews and i am applying my animation to the container layer instead the root view layer

262583
pop-up	dialog
i only want the keypress events that belong to the document i don t want to hook events for pop-up windows or other dialog boxes

262623
firefox	safari
if you only need it to work in a couple browsers you could use -webkit-border-radius and -moz-border-radius which would let it work in safari and firefox respectively

262674
postgresql	mysql
for off-the-shelf software say mysql postgresql instead of sql server oracle you still have to do many considerations

262706
bash	zsh
however i have started using zsh for all of my scripts and i have found it to be far superior to bash in terms of scripting

262714
allocator	stl
i ve considered the use of a custom allocator and placement new to place a regular stl container into a shared memory segment

262798
innodb	myisam
does anyone know how much memory myisam and innodb use

262798
innodb	myisam
i know innodb is heavier than myisam but just how much more

262826
lisp	scheme
i d like to generate these in scheme or a lisp of your choice

262846
rtos	qnx
my suggestion is to review the message passing primitives that qnx rtos www.qnx.com supports before making any decisions

262878
jsf	tapestry	tapestry	struts
if you re writing a web app use the contextloaderlistener in web.xml so that it creates the applicationcontext and you can later get it from the servletcontext regardless of whether you re using jsp jsf jstl struts tapestry etc

262886
scheme	racket
use racket formerly plt scheme

262886
scheme	racket
the racket ide is an excellent starting point for all things scheme including sicp

262934
for-loop	arrays
i know that in javascript creating a for-loop like this is costly as it computes the arrays length each time

262935
cobertura	emma
code coverage tools cobertura clover emma etc can identify holes in your branches but not in the quality of your test datasets

262983
post	get
if you are asking whether it is possible to send parameters via both get and post in a single http request then the answer is yes

262983
post	get
one such example is sending authentication credentials in two pieces one over get and the other through post so that any attempt to hijack a session would require hijacking both the get and post variables

262983
post	get
so in your case you can use post to contain the actual soap request but test for whether it is a soap request based on the parameter passed in get or in other words through the url

262997
post	get
as you can see you can only use one method post get etc... however due to the nature of how various languages operate they may pick up the query string and assign it to the get variable

262997
post	get
ultimately though this is a post request and not a get

263011
post	get
an http post which is different from an http get is a separate logical call to the webserver but it still defines a uri that should process the post

263011
post	get
at the point where your application takes control from apache during a post you should have access to both the get and post variables and be able to do whatever control logic you wish including replying with a soap protocol instead of html

263035
free	malloc
if you are only talk about memory that you have under control that you malloc and free on your own you can take a look on rmdebug

263063
submit	submission
html specifies in the form submission protocol how a browser processing a form element should submit it

263063
post	get
if the service is practically defined by means of a html form then you cannot use a mix - you can t even use post if the form specifies get and vice versa

263068
stdout	stderr
you have to spawn a new copy of the shell that uses the upgraded environment and has access to the existing stdin stdout and stderr and does its reinitialization dance

263079
division	multiplication
use integer division and multiplication

263097
multiplying	add
take the integer portion of number 30 using the int function and multiplying it by 30 to get your lower bound then add 30 to that number to get your upper bound

263117
ubuntu	linux
i m not a great linux expert but i m comfortable running my ubuntu desktop

263137
rss	feed
rss 2.0 formatted syndication feed utilize the rfc 822 date-time specification when serializing elements like pubdate and lastbuilddate

263142
bluej	greenfoot
it has links to bluej alice and greenfoot all already discussed as well as a couple of other resources

263144
min	max
you can handle the day render event to handle the binding of the individual days and record min max values

263164
ubuntu	debian
but if your team has ubuntu experience maybe debian would be better choice for server infrastructure if you do not need the bleeding edge set of applications

263173
ubuntu	debian
also ubuntu basically just grabs the existing versions in debian unstable and polishes them a little before releasing them

263175
merb	ruby-on-rails
i am looking for a backend solution for an application written in ruby-on-rails or merb to handle data with several billions of records

263206
ssl	https
also if your site will be using any ssl certificates you want to plan for this by calling the script via google s https connection

263267
folder	directory
is there a way within the .net framework to check to see if two different shared folder are actually pointing to the same physical directory

263283
mbunit	nunit
edit the guide by carel lotz uses mbunit for unit tests see his earlier document version for nunit though you can replace the mbunit with nunit pretty easily if you follow the nunit help files

263333
opera	firefox
don t care if it works in firefox opera ..etc

263350
rhel	suse
i think if you intend to install software from oracle ibm or other big vendors they may require you to use rhel or suse for support

263350
ubuntu	centos
fewer companies support ubuntu or centos

263350
ubuntu	debian
assuming you do not want to use 3rd party or big vendor software then you should take advantage of your familiarity with ubuntu or debian and stick with it

263350
ubuntu	debian
if your sysadmin is any good he should be able to learn ubuntu debian in no time

263370
int	chars
i m reading the c++ programming language and in it stroustrup states that the int value of a chars can range from 0 to 255 or -127 to 127 depending on implementation

263390
rss	feed
but it s being replaced by feed and feedreader rss and atom

263410
ncover	fxcop	ncover	cruisecontrol
as for the automating of your tests with reporting and integrating with nunit fxcop ncover fitnesse etc - i think the best free tool out there is cruisecontrol .net

263411
lisp	smalltalk
you should learn those patterns that are useful in your language many gof patterns aren t needed in lisp or smalltalk for example learn their advantages and disadvantages understand the constraints of your system and make the choice that best fits your needs

263434
cpu	processors
processors type intel r pentium r d cpu

263477
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a page with a gridview and a objectdatasource control

263564
jobs	cron
you might also want to get one of the users whose cron jobs are working to do it as well

263569
vim	textmate
vim with the help of a few plugins rails.vim project and fuzzy file finder textmate really makes for a good--and cross platform--editor

263647
pop-up	dialog
in access you could hit shift-f2 and it would pop-up a nice dialog to edit your text in

263679
notepad	textpad
other than that most notepad replacements textpad notepad+ offer a find in files as well

263680
memcpy	memmove
you chould be able to easily create a couple of apis that use memcpy memmove and take char s which will work everywhere and likely be faster than the non-std

263689
pull	push
as i understand it regular twain is a pull not a push from the scanner

263758
min	max	min	median	median	max
you might keep around max min mean median and possibly compute error bars for the data you display to the user

263766
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
you should try using a qgraphicsview qgraphicsscene qgraphicpixmapitem instead of the scroll area and label

263766
qgraphicsview	qimage
for example you have a .ui file with a qgraphicsview on the gui called qgvimageview and a qimage called image .

263791
folder	directory
in this case the export directory doesn t need to be in the www folder at all

263794
ftp	smb
if you are looking for something a little more push oriented then look to a scanner or mfp that supports ftp smb email etc

263796
firefox	safari
with firefox safari and other gecko based browsers you can easily use textarea.selectionstart but for ie that doesn t work so you will have to do something like this

263797
gridview	objectdatasource
when you are using an objectdatasource or any other datasource you set the datasourceid for your gridview not the datasource

263816
sum	coalesce
i tried using coalesce around the sum but that didn t do the trick and i didn t really expect it to

263843
put	get
you might get an error with the call to put but calling it a second or third time should make it work

263887
spweb	spsite
the spsite and spweb objects actually wrap the com objects which is why they fail in your 32-bit process

263938
opera	firefox
it works with ie but not with firefox or opera

263966
ubuntu	centos
in this respect ubuntu is less desirable on a server than rhel or centos which stick to more mature versions

263974
post	get
in the first case the data are passed to the script via get in the second via post

263988
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
sadly java.util.date and java.util.calendar were poorly designed leading to this sort of confusion

264029
forth	ada
ada and forth

264036
floor	sqrt
if you want to find an integer square root of an integer floor sqrt i it s best to use an integer-only approximation routine right

264043
actionscript	mxml
i find it much easier to write mxml classes with embedded script than trying to make an actionscript file

264084
g++	gcc
calling gcc as g++ or in your case mingwin32-g++ will also get the right language and will link the needed library

264156
profiling	debugging
this is a good thing to do once you get into debugging and profiling your project since you can really see where the compiler is doing the right or wrong thing

264165
int	boolean
it only accepts return values of type boolean int floats arrays structures dates or binary data

264180
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
won t work in older browsers of course and firefox shows false while opera google-chrome safari and ie show true

264216
google-chrome	firefox
here is the weird part in firefox and google-chrome - everything works

264222
firefox	safari
that s very strange - it looks like firefox safari are expanding the draw area of the embed but somehow flash is not getting the message that it needs to render the new pixels

264286
gridview	objectdatasource
i am working on an asp.net page with a gridview and an objectdatasource

264286
gridview	objectdatasource
i can set the typename for the objectdatasource and attach it to a gridview

264293
metaphone	soundex
if it isn t in the array try comparing the soundex or metaphone value of the misspelled word with the words in the array of correct names to find the correct way of spelling it

264307
cruisecontrol	teamcity
i m obviously looking at all the big names like cruisecontrol teamcity etc etc but the biggest consideration to me is ease of setup and to a lesser extent memory footprint

264321
getter	setter
i also prefer classes with simple constructors and property setter getter for configuration over classes with lots of parameters in the constructor

264345
folder	directory
this will find all matching files folder starting in the current directory and perform the action on them svn delete

264400
datalist	linqdatasource
basically i am binding a linqdatasource to a datalist

264406
put	get
you can t because there s no installer redist for the debug runtime and in fact the software license forbids distributing it so you d be breaking the eula even if you did get something put together

264406
allocator	stl
i believe with the msvcp stl implementations the debug verions also omit all the allocator pooling that is usually done so that a leak checker can show exactly the block you d think and not some larger chunk of memory that it s been sub-allocating but that means it makes more calls to malloc on top of them being much slower

264414
gridview	repeater	gridview	sqldatasource
i ve got a repeater and its sqldatasource nested inside a gridview templatedfield

264414
gridview	repeater
the repeater s datasource selectcommand is set using the formatstring of an eval from the gridview

264419
children	parent
child applications inherit the asp.net setting from the parent so all children will have the new setting

264427
gridview	rowdatabound
rowdatabound is ideal for these situations where you want to alter data in a gridview based on values in the result set

264431
gridview	rowdatabound
for gridview s its the rowdatabound event that is ideal for altering display of values based on other values in the result set

264431
gridview	rowdatabound
again this is an educated guess since i ve typically done this with the rowdatabound event on gridview s

264447
post	get
read this blog post on which files you need to be able to run debug flavor of your app and where to get them

264453
pop-up	dialog
there s a google group and rails plugin which replaces the basic confirm pop-up with a modal dialog box

264518
cpu	processors
an external interrupt line connected to a timer circuit will wake the processors back up at regular intervals and which point the cpu checks to see if it has been asleep for long enough and if not it goes back to sleep

264535
perforce	svn
i m also interested in performance metrics for cruisecontrol with other version control systems -- such as tfs perforce svn etc.

264576
move	drag
select the folder files that you want to move then right-click them and drag them to where you want to move them

264581
cruisecontrol	teamcity
i ve some experience with using star team for continous integration - though using teamcity not cruisecontrol

264615
folder	directory
this is a lot of manual labour creating backup folder release folder recreating the directory structure and try to track what functionality that goes into what release

264633
put	get
the session id will get put into the uri but the custom data will stay in memory on the server

264642
post	get
creating a new instance of the iwebbrowser2 and simply navigating to the current url isn t a valid solution as post -variables of course doesn t get carried over

264654
google-chrome	firefox
just to let you know firefox and google-chrome consider all ajax request as non-cachable

264743
cvs	svn
prevent committing the generated .java files in the cvs svn repository

264758
getter	setter
you have to use concrete types instead of interfaces in setter and getter

264766
firefox	safari
my code works great in ie8 firefox and safari

264787
getter	setter
why setter and getter are evil

264843
versioning	upgrade
when you upgrade the versioning of your current container

264869
getter	setter
of course you don t have to make the values publicly accessible you can make them only accessible via setter getter methods and by only having getter you can avoid them from being altered after object creation

264926
width	height
instead of retrieving the width and height of the image before drawing why not cache these values when you load the image

264945
width	height
this is just a workaround but you could try to create placeholders initially for the flash objects like div s with the corresponding height and width and only load the movie via something like swfobject when it first becomes visible

264957
jboss	weblogic
if i understood your problem correctly mymdb listens to a topic on weblogic and you want to use an additional jms destination provided by jboss defined in a deployed configuration file and identified by its jndi name by default deploy jms jms-ds.xml only contains the configuration for the jms provider and connection factories -- no data sources

264959
udp	tcp
i run mono servers dealing with giga-bytes of udp tcp data processing related tasks and couldn t be happier

265002
glassfish	weblogic
if you tell me which container you re using i may be able to help you specifically i have done this successfully before on weblogic websphere glassfish and jrun

265041
cpu	affinity
set thread affinity to a specific cpu so you don t get switched between cpus

265146
versioning	upgrade
i m now trying to compile a 64 bit versioning without having to upgrade to c++ cli

265151
swt	swing
at first when i read gui framework i thought you meant swing or swt but i see you mention struts so i guess you mean presentation framework

265151
jsf	tapestry
it is quite easy to get up and running with struts+spring+hibernate or jsf or tapestry and so on

265151
appfuse	spring
i use struts2 with spring and hibernate and sitemesh which was an appfuse project to start with and it has served me well

265164
vb.net	vb6
the short answer is that vb6 and vb.net and consequently c# are separate but related languages

265164
vb.net	vb6
how to switch a large app from vb6 to vb.net

265171
debugdiag	debugging
edit i m aware of microsoft debugging sdk and i also just found out about debugdiag

265211
spaces	delimiter
stackoverflow would use token there should be a spaces between the quotes but the autoformat is removing it to specify spaces at the delimiter between multiple takes although is more commonly used

265259
prepare	execute
you might need to copy a set of statements from profiler due to the prepare + execute steps involved

265326
put	get
i do not use a parameterised query - i just get the parameter values from the user and put them directly into the sql

265372
client-side	server-side
asp.net validation controls also provide two ways of validation server-side or client-side

265372
client-side	server-side
this client-side server-side detection and validation is done without extra work by the developer

265395
expression-blend	silverlight
i have expression-blend 2 service pack 1 and cannot create a silverlight 2 project

265395
post	get
if i get a response there that works i ll post it here in case anyone else ever has this issue

265478
hide	show
i have some html jquery that slides a div up and down to show hide it when a link is clicked

265513
cassini	iis
apparently iis handles this but cassini doesn t

265530
hide	show
my problem is that everytime i drag one groupbox on top of the other hide show groupboxes upon listview catagory select the base groupbox auto-parents the second groupbox i just dragged on top

265552
folder	directory
in particular notice the use of the web-inf directory folder

265562
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
since there are two different open-source libraries sharpziplib and dotnetzip library to handle writing extracting files from a zip file why worry about doing it yourself

265593
versioning	upgrade
the company i work for uses an asp.net grid component from a commercial vendor but won t upgrade the buggy old versioning we have to a newer versioning because of cost

265616
aptana	radrails
i use eclipse with aptana radrails

265676
rss	feed
then you can get the yahoo pipes data as an rss feed and do as you want with it

265679
subversive	javahl
i use subversive 0.7.5 with the native javahl 1.5.3 r33570 connector

265689
pop-up	dialog
they should pop-up up a dialog informing the user that administrative rights are required to complete whatever task it was that they were attempting

265692
fink	macports
also if you re building postgres from source you might have better luck using a os x package from fink or macports

265707
put	get
it has been awhile since i used that particular setup but subclipse will automatically add a new non versioned file - one that hasn t been versioned or put in the repository yet meaning you shouldn t get your error

265714
short	base
short answer here is the list of base controls

265742
vmware	esx
we use vmware esx 3.5 and are very pleased with it

265764
inherited	properties
mostly xml but when i have a bunch of beans that inherited from a common class and have common properties i use annotations for those in the superclass so i don t have to set the same properties for each bean

265857
textmate	gedit
here s an excellent guide on how to turn your gedit into a linux textmate

265876
put	get
you could put the connection string in the connectionstrings section of the web.config and then have nhibernate get it from there

265878
getter	setter
you can do this by implementing the translation in the getter setter methods of the bo so that the private variable is in utc and thus when it is stored back to the database it is already in the form you need

265883
min	max
i have a com+ data service that is configured to use object pooling with a min and max pool size of 1

265889
post	get
second the http requests both get and post need to be formatted so that they get proxied properly

265889
antivirus	mcafee
are you using mcafee s antivirus by any chance

265889
post	get
also it appears that real invented its own way of doing the same thing but the basic design is very similar - get for the downstream link post for the upstream with some magic cookie in this case the guid to tie the two together on the server

265889
post	get
either way the post should get to the server and in your case it seems like it doesn t

265889
post	get
by the way since the problem seems to be with the post request not going through the proxy how about posting that request in addition to the get

265922
folder	directory
i generally create a new working directory named branch set up the source control to monitor the branch and pull to the new folder

265922
put	get
i also put in an exculusion filter on the trunk build so it does not get kicked off by a check in to the branch our branches usually reside within the trunk realm of checking for changes

265923
post	get
now i know a difference between parameters in a url and a post parameter some browsers may misbehave if the url is too long so it is not a good idea to stuff hundreds of parameters in a url even if your app can respond to a get request

265952
put	get
form method get will put all the form s input into the url

265979
free	malloc
the last argument to safearraygetelement is a pointer to the memory that will hold the result so the contents of l the pointer returned by malloc will just be overwritten which is why free gives you a crash

post	get
this isn t an answer to your question about get and post but in a situation like you are describing it is quite often easier to store the more complex data on the server and associate it with a session id or a user account rather than putting it into the url every time

265990
post	get
post or get should be chosen mainly for their semantics

265990
post	get
on the other hand many vulnerabilities exist because unsafe operations are accessible through get requests as well as post

266012
post	get
it would be legal to send a message-body in a get request like forms using post do

266075
perl	tcl
some nice examples in ruby perl and tcl can be found at

266106
organization	naming
i m mostly just curious but can see situations where more flexible naming rules could improve code organization

266143
debian	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos	redhat	fedora
in my experience the following should work the debian family including ubuntu and the redhat family including fedora and centos

266143
redhat	fedora
building rpms for fedora or redhat or centos draft documentation rpm guide

266143
ubuntu	debian

toolbar	tabs
and out of that 12 inches overall perhaps two full inches are taken up with browser toolbar tabs rows of bookmarks and the statusbar none of which have anything to do with the web app i m interacting with

266161
stdout	stderr
try making sure stdout and stderr have somewhere to go

266199
mouseover	mouseout
i m trying to do a very simple button that changes color based on mouseover mouseout and

266199
mouseover	mouseout
click i m doing this in prototype and the weird thing is if i used mouseover and mouseout

266233
int	chars
all primitive types things like int chars bool and even should just work as keys in a hash_map

266244
google-chrome	firefox
currently i m using the api for screen readers to scrape from ie but that doesn t work for firefox or google-chrome or etc

266258
hex	binary
well you can always write code in binary or hex or some other representation

266289
hex	binary
these raw hex binary values are the machine code

266357
spaces	delimiter
i have been trying to tokenize a string using spaces as delimiter but it doesn t work

266364
hash	md5
i ve got a db table where we store a lot of md5 hash and yes i know that they aren t 100 unique... where we have a lot of comparison queries against those strings

266364
hex	binary
my question is this is it wise to keep the data as hexadecimal strings or should i convert the hex to binary or decimals for better querying

266427
stdout	stderr
well you could probably extend replace the existing console view and add an option to write to stdout stderr

266427
stdout	stderr
if you re talking about a java-program and you want it to open a new console window for stdout stderr you will probably have to modify the jdt launcher

266427
stdout	stderr
i find it much more convenient to have stdout stderr in the eclipse console

266466
versioning	upgrade
even upgrade in vista between versioning is pretty much a complete reinstall

266505
cpu	processors
i seem to vaguely recall that in old versions of windows early xps and 2000s cpu utilization was considered from total of two processors so a single thread wasn t able to make it past 50 unless it was the idle process

266549
mvp	presenter
the way the mvp triad works is that in presenter i have a constructor that takes both imodel and iview and wires them up

266575
pop-up	dialog
when i click on the configurations tab i get a pop-up dialog for the password

266576
post	get
this helpful post shows you how to get the record count

266585
google-chrome	firefox
the error doesn t occur in firefox or google-chrome

266634
disk	ram
templates are discouraged because of the concern for generated code size small amount of ram and disk space

266657
submit	submission
if you do get rejected ask apple to remove the first submission and instead of replacing the binary on the rejected app submit it as a new application with a newer version number 1.1 etc

266668
submit	submission
for example a user submit a simple html form and then an gwt app shows up in the next page how can i get the form submission info into the gwt nicely

266699
int	chars
also converting an int to a chars will only give you from 0..255 or -128..127 depending on the compiler

266756
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
it allows you to right click on a test method mstest nunit mbunit etc and select run in debugger

266780
post	get
the path of the php file requested in the original get or post is essentially the working directory of that script

266782
min	max
not so sure about the off-kilter min max close icons

266785
free	malloc
that said memory leaks are caused by those system calls that allocate memory by means of malloc and leave the application the responsability to free the memory once the returned data has used

266868
getter	setter
this results in obvious performance gains for simplistic functions such as getter and setter

266869
post	get
if it s a web application form submissions etc make sure the forms will work using just http get and post

266871
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
openfiledialog savefiledialog etc

266871
folder	directory
will cause the current directory to change if a different folder was selected

266890
getter	setter
and being less readable is quite a stretch if it s limited to things like getter and setter

266902
int	chars
hence things which do not have a specific size like chars are the same size as an int

266906
put	get
edit workaround - if you put on the you can get the border to appear but it has to be a different colour - just use one that s as close to the others as possible

267003
sqldatasource	formview
inside each of these user controls is basically a formview control and a sqldatasource control that displays values from the database

267016
integer	fractions
this capitalizes on the fact that sql server s internal representation for datetime and smalldatetime values is a two part value the first part of which is an integer representing the number of days since 1 jan 1900 and the second part is a decimal fractions representing the fractions portion of one day for the time --- so the integer value 0 zero always translates directly into midnight morning of 1 jan 1900.

267030
folder	directory
i repeat all the files from the directory tree end up in one folder

267030
folder	directory
i need it to copy the tree of folder and directory into the destination folder

267032
g++	gcc
try using g++ instead of gcc

267033
put	get
i am ordering by number of projects in each category to show the categories with the most projects on top - thus i would like to split projectsbycat in two - if i put all the odd numbered categories on the left and the even numbered categories on the right i think i will get a reasonably sane view

267039
g++	gcc
gcc is the c compiler while g++ is the c++ compiler which also links in the required c++ libraries

267062
udp	tcp
i would use a local socket with negative acknowledgment udp if the bit rate is going to be too high for tcp although i would try tcp first and confirm that it is a problem

267065
put	get
put your files some that sharepoint can get them

267079
system.in	system.out
how about using system.out and system.in

267099
g++	gcc
gcc serves as a frontend for g++ when compiling c++ sources

267099
fortran	ada
gcc can compile c c++ objective-c fortran ada assembly and others

267099
g++	gcc
by default g++ does this but gcc does not

267124
google-chrome	firefox
it s slower than i would like at 2-3 seconds in firefox and google-chrome for each popping up but it s entirely unworkable in ie taking easily 7-8 seconds for each time it pops up and loads

267124
google-chrome	firefox
i m thinking it has to do with ie s handling of the updatepanel because the same code is much faster in firefox and google-chrome

267159
post	get
could you also post your updatepanel code so we could get more details

267191

you want to set the display style property to none to hide or null to show

267237
public	protected
i ve got several methods that are protected or private for good and valid reasons these private protected methods are moderately complex and the public methods in the class depend upon these protected private methods functioning correctly therefore i need a way to test the protected private methods

267245

in java the hashmap implements the map interface while the dictionary does not

267397
interbase	firebird
i ve only worked with sql server oracle and interbase firebird

267408

alternatively you could modify the metaclass of your test object to make the private protected methods public just for that object

267412
boost	stl
as for stl as well as boost their goal is to provide portable and reasonably efficient data structure and algorithms

267434

with quicksort and timsort directly available there s no reason to write a sort

267437
mouse	keyboard
here s a ms kb article about a mouse hook in c# which appears to be expanded to a keyboard hook in this article

267469
free	malloc	free	strdup	strdup	malloc
you could use the macro preprocessor to redefine malloc and free to use the mem package ones but i recommend against it because it won t redirect library calls to malloc like what strdup does

267580
x86	64bit
if the caller is 32-bit and not 64bit or set to msil programfiles will resolve to c program files x86

267654

if the sidebar had a fixed height i could put a containing element before the main content float it right and give it a suitable width and height and then use absolute positioning to put the sidebar on top of the pre-made space

268096
children	parent
at a later stage i would fetch parent and populate the children and save

268961
formview	detailsview
the data component like formview and detailsview are so generic-looking that it s ridiculous

it is insecure unless perhaps you ask the user to point to the wanted directory with a folder browse dialog if we remain in the above logic.

269015
opera	firefox
neither firefox nor opera at least provide this info

unsigned	short
did you try to use ushort unsigned short

269143
allocator	stl
it is used a lot by the stl for things like allocator and iterators

269152
unsigned	short
the value of ffff for a short is -1 but the value of ffff for an unsigned short is 65536

269152
unsigned	short
in this case you should make sure you are using an unsigned short if you are sure that all of your values will be positive

children	parent
don t visit children if the parent is set to not visible

269207
implements	extends
i have implements a sax parser in java by extends the default handler

commonly check anything that passes between an inputstream outputstream and a reader writer

269262
yacc	bison
it s a yacc bison like implementation for c#

269268
addition	multiplication
my main concern is how i would implement things like addition and multiplication

269269
jms	jta
you can have most j2ee features such as jta jpa jms jsf with no full stack j2ee server

269269
jboss	geronimo
you can also have no cost full stack server such as glasfish geronimo or jboss

269277
addition	multiplication
once you have the digits of the number in an array you can do addition and multiplication exactly as you would do them longhand

269289
int	double
could be an int float double etc

269299
addition	multiplication
if your target architecture supports bcd binary coded decimal representation of numbers you can get some hardware support for the longhand multiplication addition that you need to do

269316
objectdatasource	detailsview
in visual studio i have set up a detailsview and an objectdatasource which connects with my bll

269350

269491
put	get
i m trying to get data from a sharepoint list and put it into some flex graphs

269496
inherited	subclassing
inherited extend the functionality of a class by creating a subclassing

269496
superclass	subclassing
override superclass members in the subclassing to provide new functionality

269496
superclass	subclassing
make methods abstract virtual to force subclassing to fill-in-the-blanks when the superclass wants a particular interface but is agnostic about its implementation

269523
children	parent
i ve got a page class in my .edmx ado.net entity data model file with with parent and children properties

269525
getter	setter
if a property is of type or address you can make it dirty without calling the setter method calls only the getter method

269553
inherited	subclassing
when a subclassing inherited from a subclassing it typically inherited both the implementation and the interface

269600
inherited	subclassing
remember that inherited means the subclassing gains the methods as well as the data

269619
hide	show
and furthermore why do you load a second page when all you seem to want to do is to show hide content dynamically

269662
int	chars
basically once you start having to deal with pointers as in int chars things get ugly

269700
superclass	subclassing
just switching from a superclass to an interface means changing nearly every subclassing in the system

269713
hash	salt
these are basically stored as a plain text username a password hash and an associated salt for this hash

269713
hash	salt
algo salt hash

269713
hash	salt
where the salt is a plain string and the hash is the hex digest of an sha1 hash

269713
hash	salt
so far i ve been able to ascertain that asp is storing these hash and salt in a base64 format

269713
hash	salt
perhaps you can take the algorithms above and the known password and salt above and produce the hash on your system

269716
ienumerable	ilist
generic list implements ilist and ienumerable both are non-generic

269718
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
you only use the datasourceid if you re using a sqldatasource or objectdatasource control for your binding

269719
hide	show	children	parent
allain is correct it is better to operate only on the parent then use css selectors to show or hide the children flip + - images etc

269749
createfile	getlasterror
what is the value of getlasterror after the call to createfile

269949
outputstream	inputstream
you should use inputstream outputstream and to handle xml documents not reader writer and string

269963
post	get
your question might get better answers or be answered by you yourself if you placed some output inside of those logic tags and post both the output and a bit more of the context actual parameter values -- what is result

269986
put	get	folder	directory
i need to from within vbscript get the latest version of all files in a set of folder and put them into a local directory so that other operations can be performed on them

269996
zlib	libpng
i ve incorporated libpng and zlib into my c software for a microcontroller project due to their nicely liberal license which permits such use without requiring me to disclose any of my code it s very similar to bsd mit apache but with no attribution requirement

270009
put	get
the closest you can get is to put a delegate on a queue for the other thread to execute but that assumes that the other thread is cooperating about this

270046
serializable	deserialization
now ideally we would like to use the same client and server side objects for different message formats xml and amf and have a pluggable serializable deserialization layer

270133
subtract	add
yes you d always have to add one though you may be able to add one to the end date or subtract one from the start date to also get this effect

270154
for-loop	loops
just create a simple for-loop count from 1 to 1000 and read the file inside loops over and over but do not create and destroy the objects inside loops just focus on the reading part

270161
spweb	spsite
ensure that this object or its parent such as an spweb or spsite is being properly disposed

270177
fadein	fadeout
i have a bunch of images that need to rotate in and out one at a time every 2 seconds with fancy jquery fadein and fadeout

ncover	nant	ncover	testdriven.net
gallio provides tool support and integration with ccnet msbuild nant ncover pex powershell resharper testdriven.net typemock and visual studio team system

270258
multiplying	subtract
but before going into any algorithmic details about adding subtract multiplying let s find some data structure

270258
division	multiplication
you can also implement multiplication and division by using your plus and minus operators but that s very slow because that would recalculate results you already calculated in prior calls to plus and minus in each iteration

270258
std	ostream
then make your class useful by befriendig std ostream

270265
subtract	add
a better analogy would be we don t teach our kids to use calculators to add and subtract why teach programmers to use an ide to program

270286
fileinputstream	bytearrayinputstream
wherever they re using fileinputstream use bytearrayinputstream instead

270290
gzipinputstream	bytearrayinputstream
wrap your byte array with a bytearrayinputstream and feed it into a gzipinputstream

270300
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
edit i have got a surprise discovery the add subtract and multiplying operations for short s actually return int

270329
dia	visio
i was just wondering how many experienced programers out there actually map out their process or algorithms in a program like ms visio or gnome dia

270370
pull	push
if you want to ensure that every changelist gets reviewed after checkin then you could see if code collaborator will play nicely with your source control system and automatically make a review task after each checkin push or pull

270398
folder	directory
for eclipse typically all you need to do is set up a folder somewhere within your source code directory

270398
folder	directory
for instance if the directory containing your source is src then you can create a src resources folder to place your images files in

270398
folder	directory
you can also place the image file within the same folder package as the class trying to access it if you wish example place the image.png in the com.mycompany package with the com.mycompany.foo class that needs to access it and call getresource image.png but i ve found it s easier to keep resources like images and other files in their own special directory outside of the class folder -- they re just easier to manage that way

270435
int	double	int	chars
it used to be generally recommended best practice 1 to use pass by const ref for all types except for builtin types chars int double etc. for iterators and for function objects lambdas classes deriving from

if i put in york and somewhere that happens to be a valid postcode i should get that result

270603
rss	feed
when building the deals project we didn t include an rss feed of deals to our customers didn t provide an alert signup for people who are looking for specific deals and probably missed several other opportunities to give people information the want need in a convenient to use format

270619
lisp	scheme
lisp has been mentioned but i think scheme in particular plt-scheme is in some respects as good a choice as ruby python perl php

i have a windows xp machine and a linux machine running ubuntu

270629
mouse	keyboard
i share the keyboard mouse from the windows machine via synergy

if it has invokerequired method and it returns true then the active-x object will also expose a begininvoke method

270778
gwt	dwr
we looked at some other packages - dwr gwt but either there was too much dependency on javascript or required ui components to be present in the java classes

270783
int	chars
after that the 4 chars code can be treated as an int key

270810
int	double
i think the original poster is trying to create an object wrapper around simple types int double etc etc so constraining t to class would perhaps not work for what he wants

271107
int	chars
signed chars short int

271143
int	chars
theoretically chars int and long could all be 1 byte in which case char_bit must be at least 32

271146
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
because of that and your chain of else if statements i m assuming you want to give the user a choice of whether to add subtract multiplying or divide

271146
int	chars
to do this i would define choice as a chars chars instead of an int and would get the user to type in one of these four chars to be assigned to the choice variable + - or

271190
width	height
there are a large amount of types in the bufferedimage int width int height int imagetype constructor but which one should i use

271204
put	get
all the types get converted to ansi strings before they are put into the ostringstream buffer

271229

in the case above you can drag the console window by the tab outside of eclispe and you open another window you can move around like a cmd prompt

271646
subclass	accessor
hiding the filtering logic in your business logic layer but kicking off the query in the display logic layer. then write a custom resultset subclass that has an accessor that runs the query and does the desired filtering

271649
int	chars
if you want to use an elegant ie ugly minimalistic approach you could make a loop of sorts to parse each line basically using strchr to first find the chars then the next space then using atoi to convert each number into a real int and then using some pointer hackery to push them all into the structure

271654
spaces	delimiter
now that works only if the delimiter is a spaces

271658
width	height
to calculate the height of an owner drawn string s given a certain width w we use the following code

271690

i fixed this the problem was that i was attaching the onclientclick of the radiobuttonlist instead on the individual radio buttons

271733
punctuation	words
the second column is the text that has been pre-preprocessed just words no punctuation normalized so as to be easier for your like approach

271739
filtering	grouping
you could try to grouping your tests into folders are they called filtering

271740
rss	feed
if you can process an rss feed then

271772
post	get
when i move it to a sub folder of the existing site and try to open the global.asax in the browser ti tells me that this extension is prohibited even though the application configuration is - as far as i understand - identical to that of the sharepoint site and allows get head post debug for .asax

i am using multicastsocket to receive udp multicast packets

271800
packets	multicast
i really want to distinguish if the packets was really multicast

271800
packets	multicast
update currently it seems like unicast packets just sent to that port also end up in the multicast sockets receive binding to devices also gives me no better results

271879
post	get
as soon as i get a look at it i ll post it here in more detail but off the top of my head i believe this was the way i did it

271913
packets	multicast
i m a bit fuzzy on the details but a multicast packets will have been sent to the ip port combo you subscribed to and this info will be in the packets somewhere assuming you managed to have a clear path of intermediary routers that understand multicast

271913
packets	multicast
i don t think you have any way of knowing if the packets was really multicast someone could always forge one since there s no real security built in

271952
debian	linux
you can find more commands at the debian gnu linux faq

271965

272131
rss	feed
i have a website that draws rss feed and displays them on the page

272188
cpython	ironpython
an interesting option for me is to integrate cpython unit testing of python code and code coverage of python code with visual studio 2008 through plugins something similar to ironpython studio

272197
wordpress	phpbb
one option is openid which you can integrate into phpbb wordpress and mediawiki

272197
wordpress	phpbb
a second option is to set up an ldap server which you can also integrate into phpbb wordpress and mediawiki

272212

i m not sure off the top of my head if mysql does this but postgresql certainly does

272277
implements	extends
i ve had good luck with bitmap indices when manipulating a lot of data in memory using custom data structures but they are kind of awkward to implements over a third-party database that doesn t have a good postgresql-like api for extends their index structures

272409
folder	directory
i know i can use a virtual directory to reference an includes folder outside of web root but doesn t that still allow direct access to that directory via the url

272428
put	get
given 2 classes animal and elephant which inherits from animal my understanding is that you would get a run-time errors if you try and put an elephant into an array of animals and this happens because elephant is bigger more specific than animal

272492
sorting	grouping
i ve been able to get my dynamic grouping down and then the sorting except now my generated linq-to-sql sql order by statement is backwards from what i want it to be

272492
sorting	grouping
i think i need to figure out how to get at the result returned from the linqdatasource when the sorting event is fired in the listview so that i can then append my grouping order by clauses

272492
sorting	grouping
currently i m overriding the linqdatasource selecting event to provide it s result and do the dynamic grouping there but then the result is modified by the sort on the listview and i was thinking there must be some way to get at that result during the sorting or sorted event

272522
postgresql	mysql
mysql + postgresql

272576
rss	feed
one of my test usercontrols is an rss feed control

272597

folder	directory
also in vs2005 it s under the platformsdk folder inside the vs2005 directory whereas there doesn t appear to be any such directory on for msvc6

272653
public	protected
making it protected instead of public will at least prevent outside objects from calling it

272762
put	get
you can do that if you have the correct hibernate ids of the objects you re working with calling a get and then merging your copy with the one hibernate just put into session

272775
executable	upx
in general if you want to keep the size of your executable down you can use upx to perform exe compression

272803
super	extends
now there are already several parsers which all extends the same class but were designed to read logs from a single threaded application no fragmentation - from original system and use a readline method in the super class

272803
super	implements
so what can i do with the super class so that it can manage the fragmented logs and ensure change to the existing implements parsers is minimal

272828
versioning	upgrade
most of the time testing is an exact copy of the live system except that errors are turned on when a new versioning is about to be moved live it s replaced with the new versioning before live is to detect upgrade issues

272918
outputstream	inputstream
inputstream or outputstream of an

272941
vb.net	vb6
i ve done development in both vb6 and vb.net and i ve used adodb objects in vb6 to handle recordset navigation the movefirst movenext etc

272973

273322
g++	gcc
in gcc g++

273337
put	get
get db data and put into a table

273347
g++	gcc
but 12 years later i can t persuade either gcc or g++ to give me any kind of warning for assigning a literal to non-const char so it isn t all that loudly deprecated

273350
post	get
louis gerbarg suggested in this post that i use html5 cache manifest to get this working however following the w3.org docs does not appear to work for the iphone

273448
for-loop	loops
you see a while loops that iterates down is faster than a for-loop that iterates up

273534
hide	show
my question is are there more generic better ways to handle permissions applied to a form element on the page than writing a security method check per page to enable disable hide show proper controls depending on the permissions allowed

273536
opera	firefox
for several browsers like firefox or opera it is just a matter of copying the original program directory elsewhere and upgrading

273543
versioning	upgrade
at least they did include an upgrade wizard to upgrade source from one versioning to the next it worked for most of our code

273685
lisp	scheme
the lisp to scheme thing involved a rename

273698
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux

273711
width	height
i thought of taking all of these images and concatenating them by creating an imagedata object of the proper total concatenated width with a constant height and using setpixel for the rest of the pixels

273729
gif	png
printing a png or gif would be much easier -- just extend the printdocument class and use the normal print dialog provided by windows forms

273734
mantis	bugzilla
i prefer a website bug tracking system like mantis or bugzilla if you want to host it yourself or something like fogbugz if you want to outsource it

okay- i added extended properties to the datatable columns with the proper data type and checked them on the gridview s rowdatabound event in a loop from 1..numcolumns

273893
sage	maxima
if you want free mathematics software look at maxima or sage

273962
width	height
then compute a resize ratio by taking min maxwidth width maxheight height

273994
vb.net	vb6
wouldn t vb6 to vb.net be the biggest example of this

it all starts with the cpu or processors

274020
division	addition
the instructions cpus can execute are fairly basic and simple addition division negation read from ram place in ram read from register and so on

274024
google-chrome	firefox
this works in internet explorer and in google-chrome but does not work in firefox

274024
google-chrome	firefox
and now it works fine in firefox as well as continuing to work in ie and google-chrome

debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
the winner is gnu linux debian ubuntu in a landslide

274371
jquery	scriptaculous
i d learn to use jquery or even go directly to the prototype library check out scriptaculous

274433
free	malloc
a memory leak is when memory is dynamically allocated eg with malloc and all references to the memory are lost without the corresponding free

274440
hex	binary
the correct utf-8 encoding of those is unicode binary hex

274457
iboutlet	ibaction
i hooked everything up using iboutlet and ibaction

274484
getter	setter
if i am exposing my dto type in a service how do i use the getter and setter without creating a round trip for each get set operation on the client

274487
int	double
the closest is system.math.round which is only for rounding numbers of types decimal and double to the nearest int value

274530
http.sys	httplistener
2 as you say an embedded web-server - herhaps httplistener - but note that this uses http.sys and so requires admin priveleges or you need to pre-open the port

274553
mp3	wav
i need help converting wav files to mp3 format in vb6

274567
many-to-many	one-to-many
..that shows how to deal with one-to-many and many-to-many relationships

274582
mouse	keyboard
it makes it very easy to give someone access to your desktop including allowing them to share control of your mouse keyboard and it works well through firewalls you just get an access code from the other party you paste it bang

274605
nunit	mstest
that s why we use nunit instead of mstest

274623
cvs	svn
the diffstat utility is a nice tool for getting some simple metrics from the output of cvs svn or other diffs

274630
superclass	subclassing
so it s when you assign an object of a subclassing to the superclass

274630
superclass	subclassing
the superclass knows nothing of the additional information in the subclassing and hasn t got room to store it so the additional information gets sliced off

274647
folder	directory
step 2 change directory to extensions folder within the profile folder created in step 1

274653
vsto	add-in
i have verified that the add-in is not inactive or disabled and i have tried to repair and uninstall reinstall vsto several times

274725
firefox	safari
the prob is this script works in safari and ie but not firefox

274738
getter	setter
i m not sure why it s a problem that exposing a dto type as a service would cause use of its getter setter to do a round trip

274738
getter	setter
if the service is a remote service the returned dto is serialized anyway and your getter setter will get the copy of the values

274745
hide	show
hide all groupboxes then show groupbox based by index of selected listview

274756
versioning	upgrade
if you re going to do this ensure that when people buy your product that they will get free upgrade to new versioning for a year or some other period of time so that they don t feel like they got ripped off when a new versioning comes out 2 months after they bought a copy

274756
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
also ensure that you support old versioning so that those who don t want to upgrade just want bug fixes can do so without risking breaking their current installation with new versioning of the software

274758
versioning	upgrade
for example if ms released new versioning of visual studio every 3 months with a new .net versioning c runtime etc then we would spend a good portion of our time just dealing with the upgrade which would not be good

274761
getter	setter
i d do the latter approach since it s a convention that helps me to see at a glance whether a private member has a public getter setter or not

274764
gmail	hotmail
so that the chances of my mail messages ending up in the spam junk folder become less i was thinking that this must be one the rules used by spam filters on popular webmail services like gmail yahoo and hotmail what do you think

274773
dns	spf
investigate adding an spf record to your dns zone file

274816
hide	show
this way all hide show mechanics will be handled by it

274880
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
actually we don t even know if you are talking about js on the browser validation of upload field you can no longer do it at least in a simple way with ff3 or on the server side neither firefox nor opera nor safari upload the full path of the uploaded file

274891
int	chars
i think that statement accesses the third row of the usermask array then accesses the maskelement th pointer in that row and since that is an int pointer it can point to the beginning of an int array think chars strings which i assume it is doing and that array is sub-indexed by user

274917
versioning	upgrade
it is also worth noting that if a user decides to upgrade to the full versioning if you do not have some mechanism in place to transfer over the existing data you will likely see a negative reaction from your users

274923
folder	directory
in every iis web i would have a virtual directory called custom which points to a different folder for each web

274923
folder	directory
update i d like to point out that this virtual directory custom is not suited to contain an inherited web.config - that web.config would be valid only for the custom folder which doesn t contain aspx ascx files

274964
firefox	safari
javascript performance can be a real pain unless you are using the latest versions of safari or firefox 3.1

274977
public	protected
it suggests a somewhat sophisticated pattern to fully deal with the issue have a protected copy constructor a protected pure virtual doclone and a public clone with an assert which will tell you if a further derived class failed to implement doclone correctly

275017
gridview	repeater
with a repeater i assume i d then have to loop through the form values on postback and with a gridview control i d have to override onrowdatabound and on postback some other method

275034
accessor	ivar
while the objective c 2.0 documentation states that the synthesized accessor on the modern runtime will synthesize the ivar on first use

275034
accessor	properties
while i could implement my own side storage for the data backing my properties i would much rather use the mechanism that synthesized accessor are using

275042
free	malloc
in c this happens when you malloc to a pointer and let that pointer leave scope without doing a free first.

275042
free	malloc
by proper use of malloc and free anyone who looks at your code will be at ease

275092
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this function works on ie opera and safari but somehow is ignored in firefox

275105
rpm	yum
i ve seen many people recommend centos and it does seem like a good server distro but i m not a big fan of rpm yum

275113
keydown	keyup
in your game view define the keyup and keydown methods

275113
keydown	keyup
note that the keydown and keyup events are actually defined on nsresponder the super class for nsview

275151
ubuntu	centos
for example i don t think that the ubuntu apache install is a radical hot new version but pretty much the same version as is installed on rhel or centos

275183
std	ostream
in your example cout uses your to convert your x1 object using a user defined implicit conversion to a pointer which is then output by ostream s cout is of class std ostream which takes a void

275239
moq	typemock
i m going to be looking into moq and typemock etc soon

275273
lisp	scheme
so first - is drscheme and plt scheme really the tools i need to learn lisp and or scheme

275327
textarea	textbox
a bunch of libraries of controls and other resources the typical window frame combobox listbox image container textbox textarea a wysiwyg-y richtextarea etc. these are the province of flex

275394
post	get
i decided to post what i did to get my solution working

275407
avr	microcontroller
if you are looking for a microcontroller or similar my advice to you would be to check out either an avr pic arduino or beagleboard

275407
avr	microcontroller
avr s and pic s are types of microcontroller that you can program with c or asm however you will need some type of prototyping board or similar to achieve anything

275428
short	base
the short answers is that you slice the object by assigning a derived object to a base object by value the remaining object is only a part of the derived object

275454
restrict	shared
most shared hosts don t use a true medium trust environment because it restrict some things that are just too vital

275465
ssl	https
with https the ssl connection is negotiated before any of the http headers are sent to the server including the host -header that tells the server for which virtual host the request is actually intended

275492
jquery	simplemodal
how about simplemodal for jquery

275521
hide	show

postgresql	mysql
how easy is it to transition from one db sqlite to another mysql or firebird or postgresql under sqlobject

275578
vmware	virtualbox
i ve found vmware fusion works the best but there are free open source alternatives such as virtualbox if you just want to get your feet wet

275646
octal	decimal	octal	hex
there s no such thing as a variable that stores a hex value or a decimal or octal value

275646
octal	decimal	octal	hex
hex octal and decimal are just different ways of representing numbers to the compiler

275703
folder	directory
from there find the point of divergence and work your way back to the assembly folder prepending a .. everytime you pass a directory

275797
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
for opera firefox and safari you can use the following function

275811
return-value-optimization	nrvo
to avoid these inefficiency smart compilers may apply the return-value-optimization or the nrvo optimizations but there are cases in which they can t -- multiple returns

275819
return-value-optimization	nrvo
by the way i can t take credit for the information about return-value-optimization and nrvo

275828
public	protected
the custom method can be written in the code behind file but has to be declared public or protected

275894
stdout	stderr
os.popen3 - stdin stdout stderr

275920
post	get
i have added a wildcard mapping to the .net isapi dll as suggested in other blog post but get the following error when i access the root of the website

275931
fadein	fadeout
i see fadein fadeout and animate but i don t see anything like flash

275939
post	get
when you start to get many duplicates you can post there a simple list of bugs you are working on

275947
width	height
in .menuitem so height and width are taken into account

275996
integer	unsigned
if you just said this is always true for an unsigned integer so the loop will be an infinite loop

276021
wxpython	pygtk
ui python people are slow and python is great for uis using wxpython or pyobjc on mac or pygtk

276030
printf	strtod
as we all know global data like the locale settings affecting the numeric decimal point printf and strtod are using is evil

276052
disk	ram
what s your preferred way of getting current system status current cpu ram free disk space etc. in python

276063
tunnel	vpn
even though the mtu at the switch is 1500 you can have situations like tunnel through a vpn that wrap a few extra headers around the packet- you may do better to reduce them slightly and go at 1450 or so

276065
prepare	bindvalue	prepare	execute
note that this way with prepare statements will automatically escape all that needs to be and is one of the safest ways to execute mysql queries as long as you use binbparam or bindvalue

276072
post	get
how can i get the size of the item added into the post to add_to_cart

276087
google-chrome	firefox
this is happening in both firefox and ie 7 although not in google-chrome

276089
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade your app to use .net 4.0 then your long term users aka previous versioning will end up having to install a whole new versioning of the framework

276096
udp	tcp	sctp	tcp	sctp	udp
if you have not done so yet it could be a good idea to look at some recent alternatives to tcp udp like sctp or dccp

276096
udp	tcp
they were designed for niches where neither tcp nor udp was a good match precisely to allow people to use an already debugged protocol instead of reinventing the wheel for every new application

276137
udp	mtu
that being said if you want to achieve low latency and can tolerate loss using udp with an overall packet size set to the path mtu be sure to set the payload size to account for headers is likely the optimal solution esp

276167
innodb	myisam
with mysql you can specify different engines like innodb myisam etc

276184
cpython	ironpython

276206
hide	show
to simplify things i m just checking to see if those fields whose name ends in surname are empty and then show hide appropriately

276217
versioning	upgrade
perhaps it s because of feature-creep in the later versioning or because of some compatibility which the newer one doesn t support or just because there isn t enough of a difference to upgrade for etc

276217
versioning	upgrade
what makes the older versioning preferable what would need changing for you to upgrade

276224
client-side	server-side
someone will hate this solution but as far as i know the only way to retain state data server-side is viewstate - session - page.transfer or client-side cookies

276242
profiling	benchmarking
if you implement it in that way and then later need to speed it up then you can use benchmarking profiling to locate the bottleneck and either link to a compiled language for that or optimise the algorithm

276252
inherited	properties
therefore when you request its attributes you are getting the ones defined at car even if you requested not to go up in the inherited chain as the properties you are querying is the one defined in car

276272
gridview	sqldatasource
when you can slap an advanced gridview onto a page along with a sqldatasource and bind it directly to a stored procedure you throw your test automation out the window

276285
redmine	trac	redmine	mantis	redmine	bugzilla	trac	mantis	trac	bugzilla	mantis	bugzilla
we evaluated trac bugzilla mantis lighthouse and redmine fogbugz wasn t an option due to the incredibly high price and decided that we like redmine the best

276304

276400
gif	png
i will limit the file extensions to the most common images like jpg jpeg png and gif

276491
post	put
this makes it easier to send snippets in e-mail post on blogs put in comments etc

276519
for-loop	loops
two extra details of the for-loop which were not in the simplified conversion to a while loops above

276519
goto	break
if the condition is omitted it is always true resulting in an infinite loop unless a break goto or something else break the loop

276532
versioning	upgrade
you need to have the full versioning of visual studio 2008 installed in order to upgrade to service pack 1

276603
sorting	grouping
if you had an array of 10 million objects in only a few grouping then sorting is not a reasonable option

276623
jboss	glassfish
do we need to run in a java ee container like jboss or glassfish

276635
uilabel	uitextview
ok i ve answered my own question a uilabel placed on top of the uitextview will also hide the insertion point but can still become the first responder and get input

276645
free	malloc
most libc malloc implementations work by storing a header before each returned memory block which has fields to be used by the free call which has information about the size of the block as well as a magic value

276657
getter	setter
should i only include the difficult algorithm that i implemented or any code i wrote for a pojo that had 300 properties and whose getter setter were generated using ides

276660
jquery	jqmodal
using jquery and jqmodal i have tried this kind of thing using a custom confirm dialog

ready	each
with berkeley sockets each time you read or write your application will block until the network is ready which could make your application unresponsive unless the network i o is handled in a different thread

276693
width	height
what is the best way to change the height and width of an asp.net control from a client-side javascript function

276699
width	height
you can do it through css height width or on some controls directly on the control itself

276710
client-side	server-side
older versions of opera do on the client-side and i think an ancient test browser of some sort possibly viola and a few form-parsing components on the server-side but not the php built-ins

276767
nunit	moq
there are examples using nunit as well as mocking frameworks such as rhino.mocks and moq

276769
g++	gcc
i m able to get access to a list but i get a bunch of warnings when compiling with -wall with g++ gcc 4.2.4 the generated c++ code that say

276785
inherited	properties
perhaps it was done this way since controls inherited the font of their container and tracking individual font properties changes would be more work than tracking a wholesale font change

276789
width	height
once you have the control you can set the height width as needed

276804
post	get
as doofledorfer said you are likely to get more specific advice if you post schemas

276806
free	malloc
it s quite likely that free will not return pages to the operating system under the assumption that your program will malloc more memory later

276806
free	malloc
but if you free first malloc might re-use the free memory instead

276829
partcover	opencover
opencover - successor to partcover

276829
ncover	ndepend	ncover	dotcover	ndepend	dotcover
ndepend can import coverage data from ncover dotcover visual studio 2017

276842

update opencover has replaced partcover

276844
ncover	testdriven.net
i use the version of ncover that comes with testdriven.net

you might as well put any value lower or greater than 128 to get different intensities shades of gray

276908
public	protected
1 for the public facing site and the others for the two protected areas

276917
filtering	grouping
the axis will be getting evaluated independantly so the filtering statement on grouping will be looking at only the members in the where clause

276993
put	get
we manage 5 000 desktops in a large enterprise and what we did to get the app on all of the machines was create a simple msi file that put an icon on the desktop you could put it in the startmenu or whatever i guess

277000
mouse	keyboard
if you don t get rid of it the only way to give it focus again is to use the same keyboard shortcut or the mouse which is what we re trying to avoid....

277004
int	double
like you could select all of the int in the block and then search and replace to double for example

277016
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
this renders fine on internet explorer firefox google-chrome opera netscape and konqueror

277057
hash	salt
the salt is incorporated into the hash encoded in a base64-style format

277057
hash	salt
the checker function knows this and pulls the hash apart to get the salt back out

277149
post	get
i have an asp.net mvc project and i have a single action that accepts get post and delete requests

277172
post	get
this post may help you to get started how do you write a c# extension method for a generically typed class

277186
pull	push
git does use origin by default when you do things like git push or git pull

277186
pull	push
then you can simply do git push or git pull to update instead of git push unfuddle master

277197
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
when sending 1 menu item it renders html that is absolutely correct in firefox and ie but really messed up code in safari and google-chrome

277197

my question is how do i get asp.net to send the same html and javascript to google-chrome and safari as it does to firefox and ie

277209
createfile	deviceiocontrol
since you only need the application b to communicate with the service a why don t you just use createfile and deviceiocontrol with a defined set of ioctls

277218
post	get
the method attribute of form elements in html4 xhtml 1.0 will only accept get or post

277233
g++	gcc
when executing gcc from the command line g++ is the c++ compiler while gcc is the general c compiler

277239
int	double	int	chars
because the types are being promoted chars - int float - double if there is no declaration of the function at the time you call it the arguments could not be passed at the right places in memory anymore

277239
int	chars
edit thanks to chris for pointing out that chars literals like a are always of type int in c

277253
nunit	mstest
then just right-click on the class on the method on the project on the solution and use the test options that testdriven.net provides including if you have mstest test with - team coverage which runs your nunit tests with the mstest coverage tools including giving the colorization back into the ide to show which lines executed

277259
subtract	add
you can add or subtract date-periods with english-language style phrases via the strtotime function

277268
hash	salt
what i think rick was trying to say if that if an attacker knew you were using the sha1 algorithm for hashing and the salt you were using they could make a mapping of hash to passwords to attempt to retrieve passwords

277290
google-chrome	firefox
so to address this issue the best way i see is to do like visual studio firefox google-chrome roolup your own tab control with your theme.

277306
boost	stl
i ve used both for the same project boost is better integrated with the stl and especially c++ exceptions

277316
listview	gridview
when the number of items added to the gridview exceeded the listview height the vertical scroll bar did not appear as i specified in the xaml

277327

i want to show or hide additional next and previous buttons if my primary next and previous buttons are off screen

277336
g++	gcc
for gcc g++ i found this perl script useful

277351
integer	unsigned
my actual requirement is x x + d where x must always be between 1 and 12 before and after the summing and d any unsigned integer

277402
ncover	ndepend
we used ndepend and ncover to provide the raw information to calculate the metric

277426
width	height
i think it s going to come down to if the x y position of the component is beyond the width and height of its container and so on up through the parent containers until you reach your top level application.

277437
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3 and google-chrome show only the default source

277444
innodb	myisam
the major difference is that innodb supports transactions whereas myisam doesn t

277445
innodb	myisam
the main difference is that innodb supports transactions while myisam does not

277445
innodb	myisam
myisam has typically been considered faster at searching but recent innodb improvements are removing this difference and improving high concurrency workload performance

277445
innodb	myisam
innodb support transactions whilst myisam does not

277445
innodb	myisam
myisam does table level locking while innodb can do row level locking

277450
next	except
next if the measures are taken at regular intervals replace the timestamp with the difference from the previous timestamp except for the very first tuple for a sensor of course. for example if all measures are taken at 5 minutes intervals the delta between two timestamps will usually be close to 300 seconds

277452
innodb	myisam
myisam and innodb also store their data on disk differently

277461
udp	tcp
if you need any level of reliability from udp or require two-way connections you will end up needing just about everything from tcp so you might as well go with that to start with and let the network stack take care of it

277474
haskell	scheme
if it was up to me i d teach scheme haskell or f# but since he d rather learn something that can be useful in his job as a fiscal consultant programming excel

277478
superclass	subclassing
the superclass has got some initializers say initanimal the subclassing has some initializers say initdog

277499
superclass	subclassing
however it should be stated that you should have a very good reason for doing this and that it should be very well documented that the subclassing may not use the same initializer as the superclass

277499
superclass	subclassing
that way each animal and true subclassing of animal can handle their designated initializers themselves and won t have to rely on superclass behaving in such a specific non-standard manner

277511
innodb	myisam
the most important difference between myisam and innodb is that innodb supports transactions and foreign keys

277511
innodb	myisam
innodb is slower than myisam for most uses but can perform faster in certain conditions due to a better locking mechanism

277527
vbscript	vba
in addition it is a very short step from vba to vbscript

277528
client-side	server-side
you have either client-side or server-side caching and these are discrete in that they have no knowledge of each other

277543
put	get
these are interesting as we all get a sense of the investigation and thought that was put into your answer

277564
bluecloth	rdiscount
i ve done a bit of research and decided to use rdiscount instead of bluecloth

277564
bluecloth	rdiscount
rdiscount seems to be much faster and more reliable than bluecloth

277596
jms	jta
if the answer is no because i need jms or jta then i resort to an application server

277596
websphere	ibm
any time i negotiated with ibm it was always ended up costing twice as much as a weblogic equivalent but corporate policy dictated websphere had to be used

277598
innodb	myisam
myisam supports non-standard-sql fulltext indexing which innodb still does not

277602
vb6	vba
vba is vb6 in terms of runtime at least

still new to the world of linq and i need some help flatening a list of parent that have children into a single list of parentchild s

277638
division	modulo
while calculating the hash table bucket index from the hash code of a key why do we avoid use of remainder after division modulo when the size of the array of buckets is a power of 2

277707
innodb	myisam
you can have more information about myisam innodb in mysql documentation

277713
integer	fractions
the integer portion of the number is for the date and the fractions is for the time

277795
innodb	myisam
here is a description of differences between innodb and myisam

277795
innodb	myisam
differences between innodb and myisam

277812
haskell	scheme	haskell	ocaml	lisp	scheme	ocaml	scheme	erlang	lisp	erlang	scheme	erlang	ocaml
ocaml haskell erlang and all free lisp and scheme implementations that i know of do not have concurrent gcs

277818
loops	while-loop
note that since the while-loop will only update fig_handles when it is run you will always have at least 0.2 seconds delay until loops catches the modification of fig_handles.continue_loop

277839
required	placeholder
i then go to the content pages and add new placeholder for the plaintext equivalents and add text as required

277844
vb.net	vb6
several points about vb.net versus vb6

277867
width	height
that still needs sum width height bytes-per-pixel of all the strips

277877
union	distinct
be aware that union is an implicit distinct on the result set

277884
post	get
i know that i can just use the string values post or get for the request type but i could have sworn there was a constant somewhere in some class in .net that contained the values

277884
post	get
out of curiosity i was wondering if anyone knew what class these string constants for get and post were in

277891
put	get
i tried being intuative in using a master page with content place holders but i couldn t get the placeholders to grow to say nothing of not being able to put a text box where i wanted one

277895
notepad++	scite
notepad++ is another scintilla -based as scite source code editor

277907
onkeyup	onkeydown
you can then override onkeydown onkeypress and or onkeyup to handle the key press before any of your controls

277944
int	chars
in a nutshell the file has a header consisting of several int bytes and fixed-length chars arrays followed by a list of records which also consist of int and chars

277944
pascal	delphi
in any other language i would create struct s c c++ or record s pascal delphi which are byte-by-byte representations of the header and the record

277961
post	get
i don t see that mentioned in the initial post but assuming that is the case as it would get much more complex if the header has optional args and different sizes

278040
post	get
so the process becomes much smoother for your users and you get the post in a form that doesn t require you spend thousands of dollars on developing or buying conversion code

278082
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql

278121
translation	localization
its my understanding that the recommended approach to localization in wpf is to use the locbaml tool to extract the localizable items into a csv file translation the items into the desired language and regenerate a new sattelite assembly from this csv file

278134
vb.net	vb6
if you have an automated vb6 to vb.net tool and vb6 itself please save the code as a vb6 project and do convert the code

278148
internationalization	globalization	internationalization	localization	globalization	localization
internationalization or globalization is the design and development of a product application or document content that enables easy localization for target audiences that vary in culture region or language

278149
switching	screens
our application pops up when an internet connection is made and after prompting the user to accept the downloads we d like to switching back to the home screens while we do our stuff

278166
width	height
once you have an image object loaded from its source the height and width and size and all ancillary properties are read-only

278167
vb.net	vb6
your vb6 code has to call windows api functions to do the work and vb.net code has to do the same

278174
textile	bbcode
for my site we went with textile but i ve found that bbcode tends to be the language that most people already know

278194
globalization	localization	translation	globalization	translation	localization
globalization is about producing a map from strings or identifiers to translation in other languages while localization is about using that map to find the correct translation

278194
globalization	localization
globalization happens during development localization happens at runtime

278212
addition	modulo
say that n and m are known and you re looking for x under addition modulo k

278225
width	height
in winforms if you contain the image inside a picturebox control the picturebox control can be set to zoom to a particular height width and the image should conform

278234
actionscript	mxml
javafx script from what i ve seen is quite similar to actionscript and not at all like mxml

278266
put	get
and i don t care if you outsource to india china or the guys down the street - if you re not specific you re likely to get something that will meet the bare minimum of what you put on paper but not what you wanted

278269
clistctrl	ccombobox
you need to use a ccombobox which is basically a combined cedit and clistctrl

278288
ubuntu	debian	dpkg	apt
you have the debian derived systems like debian ubuntu which use .deb and the apt dpkg family of management tools

278288
rpm	yum
you have the redhat derived systems which use the .rpm format and the rpm yum family of management tools

278288
rpm	yum	dpkg	aptitude
ideally learn the command line options to do this for yum and rpm and then dpkg and aptitude and you ll have most bases covered

278288
ubuntu	debian
i think the most important thing to remember is that it s generally a mistake to mix packages from different distributions or releases in the same system even if they use the same package format do not install debian .deb files on your ubuntu system or suse rpm files on your fedora system unless you really understand what you re doing

278297
pull	push
sql server reporting services supports both on-demand pull and event-based push delivery of reports

278317
arrayiterator	arrayobject
arrayiterator arrayobject and

278373
feedback	review
have frequent review and demos of the system as it is being developed give feedback on what you see and re-evaluate the value of the system and the quality of the development that you see

278374
unix	bsd
it is part of bsd unix not sure if it is standard

278422
octal	hex
be warned that the vt102 documentation generally uses octal so keep an ascii table handy if you re using hex

278423
printf	strcpy
functions such as strcat strcpy and printf can easily overwrite the end of their target buffers leading to spurious runtime errors and security vulnerabilities

278476
getter	setter
why force the getter alongside the setter

278487
implements	extends
check out the class equalshashcodetestcase you can extends this and implements createinstance and createnotequalinstance this will check the equals and hashcode methods are correct

278488
integer	unsigned
you are given a 32-bit unsigned integer array with length up to 2 32 with the property that more than half of the entries in the array are equal to n for some 32-bit unsigned integer n

278507
datalist	repeater
while customizing a couple of the modules for some internal use i was a little surprised to see that instead of having apis that returned data via your typical result set that was bound to a datagrid datalist repeater that the apis returned an xml node collection that was then passed to an xslt transformation and rendered on the page that way

278523
int	boolean
i ve replaced to boolean value with an int shakecount

278527
superclass	subclassing
i d rather not manage the extra objects floating around to assure that all superclass features are part of a subclassing object

278527
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
i d rather have inherited to be sure that each subclassing is an instance of it s own class plus is an instance of all superclass too

278529
rss	feed
could you maybe do this with rss feed

278550
rss	feed
for example it would be trivial to turn that grid into an rss feed or write a program to scrape that data periodically and send a more pressing alert

278572
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
inherited is a good thing when the subclassing really is the same kind of object as the superclass

278572
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
that said as you note there are too many real-life class hierarchies where the subclassing inherited from the superclass out of convenience rather than bearing a true is-a relationship

278572
superclass	subclassing
so it s unsurprising that a change in the superclass will have side-effects on the subclassing

278596
jar	manifest.mf
to clarify the question is not about how to write manifest headers into the manifest.mf file in a jar that is easily googleble

278597
nswindow	nscell
view nsview and subclasses of course nscell and subclasses nswindow and subclasses

jboss	glassfish	jboss	weblogic	glassfish	weblogic
most of my experience is on weblogic but i have used jboss and glassfish

278820
division	modulo	division	multiplication	multiplication	modulo
for example this method is a neat way of doing this test without using multiplication modulo or division operators

278850
getter	setter
with say a 2d point class and the desire to extend it to higher dimensions you would presumably have to add at least z getter setter modify getdistance and maybe add a getvolume method

278887
internationalization	localization
i m guessing that you mean localization or internationalization or i18n

278893
post	get
other browsers don t post the nested forms since it s invalid html and don t get the error

however resin is immature and i would avoid it relative to glassfish or jboss--i found it problematic to deploy and support

279006
postgresql	mysql
many databases are supported postgresql mysql sql lite etc

pop-up	dialog
which will pop-up the print dialog when the page loads see this post for more

279137
getter	setter
the property getter and setter of an explicitly implemented interface property has an unusual attribute

279229
public	protected
the public start will call the protected that will be ovveride in the abstract class

279248
getter	setter
bunch of properties and locking at the property getter and setter level looks wrong

279342
superclass	subclassing
you can then treat an instance of ferrari as either an instance of the ferrari subclassing with getengine returning the turboengine or as an instance of the car superclass when getengine will return an engine

279414
installation	upgrade
been trying to upgrade my subversion installation but due to what i believe are limited rights i m using hosted linux account i m not able to properly . configure and compile the source code see posts post1 and post2 if very interested

279421
button	checkbox
however when it prints out i need it to print with the square checkbox style rather than the round radio button style

279421

if i can t get this working i m gonna have to create a checkbox to shadow each radio button use javascript to keep the checkbox and radio button in sync and css to show the one i care about in the proper medium

279431
postgresql	mysql
preferably this would be a sql statement that would work under mysql postgresql oracle etc

279446
spaces	delimiter
popular choices for delimiter include spaces tabs commas semi-colons vertical-bar characters and tilde

279455
gridview	rowdatabound
in the gridview s rowdatabound event i m selectively hiding links in some gridview fields based on the query results

but on postback when i don t call databind but the gridview stays populated through viewstate the data displays but the rowdatabound event obviously doesn t fire and my links don t get hidden

279548
16-bit	64bit
edit 3 doing the math you d need to use 16-bit keys in ecc to generate 64bit signatures which is very weak

279607
ready	each
this code would fire on document ready attach an event handler to each input with currency as its class and then do the replacements

279652
hide	show
if you want to show or hide them place them inside of a div and show or hide that

279727
tcombobox	tmemo
as tstringlist is a descendant of tstrings it is compatible with the lines property of tmemo items of tlistbox and tcombobox and other vcl components

pyopengl	pyglet
i am looking to do some tinkering with opengl and python and haven t been able to find good reasons for using pyopengl versus pyglet

279942
pyopengl	pyglet
if you re starting out i d try pyglet first and then switch to pyopengl if you feel like you want to get closer to the metal

280017
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
the view also implements touchesbegan touchesmoved to allow dragging

280041

post	get
use above statement to leave post or get array intact and use new individual vars

280138
post	get
or use below to update post or get array vars

280139

are you talking only about getter and setter that have no extra logic and thus effectively directly expose the member or any get-set pairs

280155
passenger	thin
i ve used straight mongrel i ve used mongrel clusters behind apache i ve looked at thin and i m becoming very intrigued by passenger

280155
jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius	mri	rubinius
i ve looked at mri ruby enterprise edition rubinius and jruby

280170
postgresql	mysql
are there technical political reasons you need to use either mysql or postgresql

280188
config	ini
see this question how to read config file entries from an ini file and this followup help improve this ini parsing code in which i figured out how to do the parsing myself

280188
config	ini
also this article was mentioned cross-platform ini config files

280194
mouse	keyboard
react to any keyboard mouse mouse

280216
actionscript	mxml
my question is this should i just keep going with the flex tutorials and work my way through mxml and actionscript

280216
actionscript	mxml
is it the same with mxml and actionscript

280218
inline	inlining
even if you mark a function inline it is actually still up to the compiler wither it will actually do the inlining it is just a hint

280247
mouse	keyboard
this underlined letter is called the accelerator key and is standard in windows applications so that you can use the alt-key and that letter to quickly select the menu item and then submenu item with the keyboard rather than with your mouse

280294
hide	show
to have 2000 and xp menus show accelerator keys right-click an empty spot on the desktop choose properties click the appearance tab and under effects uncheck hide underlined letters for keyboard navigation until i press the alt key

280295
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
how to design a dropdownlistfor that can have multiple selections using checkbox

280342
tstringlist	tlist
i d probably say if you want backwards compatibility use tstringlist and if you want forward compatibility perhaps the option to change that list of strings to say list of int64s in the future then go for tlist

280453
std	ostream
a similar example of using this is when you derive from std ostream but don t want random people to write into your stream

280494
aggregate-functions	sum
i have a group by clause in a sql statement and need to use an aggregate-functions to minus all the values in each group instead of adding like the sum function

280571
stdout	stderr
i am confused about how popen redirects stdin stdout and stderr of the child process in unix

280580
phpunit	simpletest
my main reason for using phpunit over simpletest is that it has great phing integration

280628
stdout	stderr
if you want to capture the stderr too that s possible but then you ll need three pipes and a select loop to arbitrate reads between the stdout and stderr streams

280690
post	get
i need http get and post both of which are not simply reading writing files on the filesystem they need to run custom .net code

280730
ndepend	fxcop
i have written ndepend cql query to enforce a few rules that are hard to implement in fxcop

280732
serializable	deserialization
all you have to do is create your model objects put some annotations on the fields to let the serializable know how you want the field to be serializable element attribute what name etc and the call the deserialization process

280750
content-length	content-type
you have the content-length in the header and additionally there is the content-type in the header of the file part each file has its own header which is the purpose of multipart encoding

280750
content-length	content-type
server-side check the header content-length content-type .

280840

look in cpu affinity for more details

281024
redhat	fedora
in centos which is redhat enterprise edition with the serial numbers filed off and so therefore pretty close to fedora we did this using kickstart files

281035
ubuntu	centos
i m considering a virtualization host and multiple client os ubuntu and centos being the top 2 candidates - that way once i get the client configured as i want it i can save it off for reloading as needed

281081
mouse	keyboard	hid	keyboard
i m looking for a way to connect a windows mobile device to a pc via bluetooth and have it show up on the pc as a hid device keyboard or mouse

281107
des	aes
looking though the code with reflector it looks like the algorithm is des if the key is 8 bytes long and aes rijndael otherwise

281142
getattr	setattr
in c++ instead of a getattr setattr pair it is common to provide two overloads of an attr function

281225
kde	gnome
for example emacs runs pretty much contrary to every interface guideline on os x or windows and probably even gnome kde and it s not going away any time soon

281241
versioning	upgrade
we haven t been able to use linq yet because we re still on 2.0 and haven t been allowed to upgrade to a newer versioning

281286
post	get
i have a support ticket open with apple dev support for the same problem and fwiw i ll post their recommendations if and when they can get my toolchain working

281354
put	get
using cvs keyword expansion you could put in the file and it will get replaced with the date of the last checkin

281400
folder	directory
if they are other resources such as graphics perhaps you have a customer-specific set of folder under one directory

281443
google-chrome	safari
webkit safari google-chrome browsers insert an extra text node at the end of the body tag

281469
getter	setter
what you might be able to do is provide both a getter and a setter but throw a notimplementedexception in the abstract setter decorate it with the appropriate attributes and document so that no one uses it unless the setter has been property overridden

281488
integer	unsigned
the queue is implemented as a circular buffer unsigned queue maxlength and it stores integer indices into a table of states

281488
queue	fifo
i could also expand the states in a different order so in this case it s not really important if i break the fifo properties of the queue

281512
tiff	png
i am having issues converting a png to tiff

281521

this guy seems to have worked around the problem by extracting the tld from the jar modifying it placing it in the war s web-inf directory and adding an entry to his web.xml like this

281587
firefox	safari
firefox and safari were ok with that ie wasn t so it s possible that whoever wrote the code didn t even know it was a problem

281595
x86	64bit
as far as hardware int64 will be more efficient on an x64 and ia64 than x86 because the 64bit processors have 64bit registers to perform the operations on them

281606
udp	tcp
why does udp have a length field in the header and tcp does not

281606
udp	tcp
i am guessing that the length of the segment in tcp is inferred from the ip header but one should be able to do the same for a udp datagram

281642
freebsd	linux
the stability is huge factor for me and freebsd makes up where linux and windows leave you wanting

281651
memcached	apc
there s all kinds of downsides to using temporary files mainly it s slower and if you really need a way to store the buffer before outputing it go look for memcached or apc cache

281667
cassini	iis
more answers for cassini v iis here

281688
cassini	iis
the xp version of iis has limitation that are not present in the server version that cassini side-steps

281688
cassini	iis
the only argument i know against is that there are a couple very rare edge cases where the cassini built-in server doesn t exactly mimic iis because you re using odd port numbers

281688
cassini	iis
i doubt you ll ever run into them and using cassini as the primary dev environment does not preclude developers from also having access to iis on the machine

281688
cassini	iis
in fact my preferred setup is cassini first for most small work then deploy to my local iis for more in-depth testing before moving code back to the shared source repository

281786
cpu	processors
if your database is using 3-20 cpu and the final performance is still unacceptable it means that you don t lack processors power since it is most of the time idle

281798
disk	ram
you ll need lots of ram but if your db is only a few hundred mb then you d be skipping the heavy disk io

281802
cvsnt	tortoisecvs
firstly i d recommend using tortoisecvs as it has better cvsnt support

281812
inline	inlining
inlining won t affect heap usage as the same allocations and deallocations would occur for the inline code as would occur for the non-inlined version

281823
cvs	svn
there s a general clean code practice that says that one should never keep removed code around as commented out since it clutters and since your cvs svn would archive it anyway

281846
superclass	subclassing
you can interpret a subclassing as an instance of a superclass but not vice sersa

281882
junit	testng
they are built using junit or testng and interact with the system under test using something like selenium that hits the web pages as if they were users

281890
ant	maven
not using ant or maven workarounds

281944
emacs	aquamacs
under emacs btw you mentioned aquamacs go with emacs.app instead i then specify via the preferences to have option command and command option

281996
put	get
when you put them all together you basically get something where you can write plain text in one end and get encrypted binary data out having stored it in memory temporarily of the other end

281999
png	ico
i have an ico file that contains a 48x48 and a 256x256 vista png version as well as the 32x32 and 16x16 versions

282019
getter	setter
preferrably without loads of getter setter

282045
ndepend	fxcop
tigraine has mentioned fxcop - there s also ndepend which is somewhat different - a code analysis package which can identify design issues

282046
hide	show
show and hide do just that

282048
getter	setter
if you need to save memory i would make getter and setter that manipulate bits of internal integers or similar

282095
width	height
i think ie before version 6 incorrectly included borders and padding in width and height

282107
chmod	chdir	chmod	mkdir	mkdir	chdir
can t you just do this by creating the dir with mkdir then chmod it 777 the change directory with chdir and then create the file touch

282118
button	checkbox
i know that you can use a checkbox control and set it s appearance property to button but it doesn t look right

282127
post	get
note that you can also get comments made by the user but users can t comment on their own post so the comments through a post are different and mutually exclusive

282127
post	get
it seems reasonable to me that i should be able to get a page of all the comments added to all of a user s post

282162
phpunit	simpletest
simpletest and phpunit which i prefer

282164
implements	extends
you d have to implements a custom collection or perhaps extends bc to implements queue item priorities

282202
inherited	properties
since the form inherited control class it is sufficient to call mousebuttons properties directly

282205
serializable	deserialization
apartments are essentially lightweight running com servers with a serializable deserialization mechanism called a message pump where calls get serializable and queued for a single thread

282221
bazaar	git
is there anything like those front-ends for one of the distributed vcs bazaar hg git

282233
serializable	deserialization
make user that you version the serializable and that the object that does the deserialization throws an exception if the version it tries to read is not backward compatible

282233
serializable	deserialization
it would be a bad practice to have the serializable and deserialization all over the code

282241
mouse	keyboard
ideally it would be a tool that records mouse clicks and keyboard presses and takes screenshots at that point of time

282267
width	height
in real space i gained a couple inches width but i lost a lot off the height

282267
width	height
for the life of me i can t seem to find an actual measure of screen height and width other than diagonal which could be anything depending on the diagonal angle

282271
mouse	keyboard
could then give keyboard and mouse

282279
folder	directory
i then tried running it outside of the release folder in the bin directory and what do you know it worked

282292
width	height
the ratio of the resolution width height should be the same as the ratio of the physical dimensions

282332
sitemesh	stripes
we want to keep moving forward with our new stuff using tomcat stripes and sitemesh

282342
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode and equals shouldn t be in system.object - not everything s suitable for hashing

282392
unsigned	short
lots of nasty little bits of c poking through in particular all the conversions between short int unsigned etc..

282421
emacs	aquamacs
not sure if you re totally married to using emacs from the terminal but another option is to use carbon emacs my favorite and aquamacs very mac-like

282445
explode	implode
for all it s otherwise excellentt list handling i miss php s built-in explode and implode

282448
int	boolean
nearly all of the web service functions specify a response that includes an int to indicate success really a boolean and an error message string

282460
versioning	upgrade
how can i determine current versioning of my repository to see if i need to upgrade it svnadmin upgrade

282489
width	height
here s what i ve got so far can i avoid a static width height for the content

282490
spaces	delimiter
i m a bit daff when it comes to cars but could you not specify the major brand as the delimiter as opposed to spaces

282502
factors	mean
what are the factors to be considered while profiling i mean the best practices

282519
singleton	facade
one solution is to use a singleton and have one or both of the application and facade register with that singleton

282576
merb	ruby-on-rails
in ruby-on-rails one would use admin categoriescontroller is this similar in merb or is this another recommended way of doing it

282580
bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
when that vector based file is rendered to a bitmap based format - bmp png tiff jpg etc.

282616
profiler	yourkit
yourkit is an excellent profiler for java and will integrate nicely with eclipse

282635
g++	gcc
you can check what gcc g++ do by using the -s option

282635
g++	gcc
gcc and g++ more or less behave the same in this case

282643
codeigniter	cakephp
on the other hand i ve never played around with codeigniter so i can t recommend cakephp over codeigniter

282659
glassfish	weblogic
i downloaded a free glassfish server from sun then as i am an oracle developer downloaded the latest jdeveloper which comes with a weblogic server from bea oracle

282659
glassfish	weblogic
i want to write a soap interface to my oracle database 10g can i get away with the glassfish server why should i used a weblogic server and how does this differ from the oracle application server for j2ee apps

282697
factories	presenter
my solution for both is to use a factories for views that will allow the caller to access and pass messages to the new presenter

282698
ssl	https
your best bet in this scenario is to use an iframe which contains an https ssl page that just contains thelogin control

282708
post	get
you might have to do some messing around to get stdin to read from get post etc

282730
georss	kml
the easiest way to do this is to select to xml and then transform the data into georss or kml

282764
spaces	delimiter
the values of the other fields in each line contain no spaces so a spaces delimiter works fine for them

282798
ssl	https
i d recommend getting an ssl certificate and requiring https any time users submit a password to your website

282811
cassini	iis
i don t think it simulates either tbh it just a web server for local development where iis is not an option based off cassini

282818
typedef	struct
in c++ you cannot name a function the same name as a class struct typedef

282825
put	get
dont get me wrong i believe rails has brought very good ideas to the mainstream like convention over configuration but has this oversimplification just put this line of code and .

282831
firefox	safari
i am trying to see what are the gotchas in using xmlhttpwebrequest such that it works for safari firefox and ie

282835
hash	md5
a simple hash function md5 sha1 whatever accumulates the bytes of the object to create a 4-byte number

282857
width	height
if you want the line to be just a simple horizontal or vertical line put another panel disabled so it doesn t pick up any mouse events on the main panel set its height or width to 3 or 4 pixels or whatever you want and bring it to front

282947
vim	notepad++	vim	emacs
but if you re used to notepad++ you ll probably find it as hard to move to vim as you would to emacs so maybe your proposed solution is the best one

282950
lisp	scheme
also if you are doing scheme you don t say which lisp you are referring to i second the recommendation of drscheme

282951
for-loop	arrays
he she also points out that a temporary arrays is created and thus is slightly more expensive than a normal for-loop

282988
vim	jedit
i just use vim or jedit

282992
daemons	systemd
of course the immediate answer for most situations is yes and i am a firm believer that a process should correctly cleanup any resources it has allocated but what i have in my situation is a long-running systemd daemons that opens a fixed number of file descriptors at the startup and closes them all before exiting

283011
opera	safari
i m trying to process a credit card transaction in .net and it works perfectly in safari opera and ie

283024
free	alloca
is it possible to free memory allocated by c s alloca explicitly before the current function exits

283039
free	alloca
but all the blocks are free when you exit the function that alloca was called from just as if they were automatic variables declared in that function

283041
free	malloc
just use malloc free if you need to explicitly free it - those functions are usually heavily optimized

283074
int	chars
use the simplest column types possible chars int

283088
pop-up	dialog
if you need to edit the text i would then either pop-up a editor dialog or send the data that is stored in content to an textbox on your form for editing

283090
pop-up	dialog
i d like to pop-up a simple dialog with an editor box to let user enter some value then just return

283151
coalesce	isnull
you also could read an article which compares coalesce and isnull

283170
spaces	delimiter
i m trying to read in a spaces delimiter textbox data exactly like the tags textbox in a new stackoverflow question such as this into the model

283177
versioning	upgrade
you don t really want to upgrade the system versioning of sqlite on mac os x

283190
formview	linqdatasource
i am connecting to it with a linqdatasource and binding with a formview

283206
websphere	ibm
my application communicates with another system via ibm websphere mq

283248
strcpy	strncpy
edit good suggestion from healthcarel - use strncpy rather than strcpy

283255
hash	md5
while i might be totally misunderstanding you maybe it s a good idea to treat a vector as a byte stream and do some know hash on it sha1 or md5

283278
strcpy	strcmp	strcpy	strncpy	strncpy	strcmp	strncmp	strcmp	strncmp	strncpy	strncmp	strcpy
using non-limited string functions such as strcpy or strcmp instead of safe versions like strncpy and strncmp

283308
free	malloc
iif this is a c program which uses the function make sure you allocate with malloc and free with free

283312
int	chars
int get_string const chars buffer

283316
opera	safari
this only occurs on ie6 and ie7 but not ff2 ff3 opera latest nov 12 2008 or safari again latest

283374
put	get
it also allows iteration over the keyset without locking it takes a copy at the start of iteration and get operations can generally be interleaved with calls to put without blocking it uses fine grained lock striping iirc

283398
serializable	deserialization
serializable and deserialization should do the trick

283400
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
in terms of general concurrency utilities - .net has always provided a bit more than the basics which java used to provide in terms of mutex manualresetevent autoresetevent and readerwriterlock

283405
jboss	glassfish
i think glassfish is a better j2ee app server to start with than jboss

283405
jboss	glassfish
jboss is a big and quite complex application and glassfish is smaller and i find it easier to understand

283441
put	get
commonly you might want to do a related get and put in close succession and if another thread is looking at the same values you have an immediate thread race

283450
boost	stl
the advantages of the second method is that you can take use your compilers pre-compiled header support plus you can wrap stl #includes in pragmas that disable some warnings for example some boost headers will cause warnings when compiling at level 4

283451
jboss	glassfish	jboss	weblogic	glassfish	weblogic
i don t know glassfish or jboss particularly but both the oracle and weblogic application servers will provide a fully integrated suite of functionality including soa security grid clustering systems management and development tools over and above just the standard j2ee container

283454
instances	transient
transientobjectexception object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing

283520
cpython	ironpython
note there was a mission by some of the crew at resolver systems to allow you to use cpython bindings with ironpython called ironclad but this is in its early stages and i think they will concentrate on getting things like numpy working first gui toolkits will always be the last and hardest

283566
boost	stl
stl boost are neatly arranged in namespaces so they don t ever cause any mix-ups or overlaps either

283686
post	get	post	put	put	get
it also helps if you understand the basics of http - for example the request methods put post get delete head and so on

283686
post	put
the error you pasted means that the header content-length is missing with your request and most servers if not all expect it to be send when you issue put or post because those are assumed to be data changing create update

283695
avr	microcontroller
the arduino board is based on an 8-bit avr microcontroller for which the .net micro framework isn t even available

283722
g++	gcc
if you mix code compiled with gcc and with g++ see graeme s answer

283737
pop-up	dialog
this code is called by a pop-up window that displays this file or gives a open save dialog in internet explorer

283751
post	get
i have the problem that php replaces all spaces with underlines in post and get variables

283754
ftp	telnet
telnet ftp passwd fsck rlogin

283757
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i usually test when designing using opera and firefox and my collegue who used a mac tested it in safari too

283757
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
if you design using the standards and test using relatively standard compliant browsers like opera firefox and safari and then add the dreadful hacks for ie preferably using conditional comments allthough it is nonstandard and proprietary it s fortunately and correctly regarded as commendt by real browsers so you won t break the working code you have less problems

283774
client-side	server-side
also those cookies would be accessed both via javascript client-side and php server-side

283779
folder	directory
what is left visible is everything in the target directory besides these two folder the generated jar file for example

283859
cassini	iis
i m working on vista and i d prefer not to install iis i d rather just us cassini for local testing

283908
client-side	server-side
you don t really need more than one anyway - just use one to store an id client-side and store everything you need stored server-side against that same id

283957
post	put
we have a rest api which clients routinely post and put data to

283962
sorting	filtering
it gives us ajax sorting filtering paging all server side

283985
width	margin
as suggested by arief you must specify a width and you can then use auto when specifying margin in order to center a div

283994
width	font-size	fontfamily	font-size
the width of the characters depends on fontfamily and font-size

283994
fontfamily	font-size
i rewrote it for you and added classname so you can use a style to set the fontfamily and font-size

283994
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
that is not necessary since modern browsers do that for you tested with firefox ie opera and google-chrome

284040
int	chars
this will copy an array of chars into an array of int

284040
int	chars
this assigns the values of a null terminated chars array a s d f a s d f 0 to an int array yielding 97 115 100 102 97 115 100 102 0

284045
getter	setter
these scripts allow you to automate the generation of getter and setter methods for any highlighted instance variables

284056
jboss	geronimo
you need something like jboss application server or geronimo for that

284105
int	chars
chars array - int array

284105
int	chars
if you want to convert a chars array a into an int array b you can do it like this

284105
int	chars
the cast to unsigned chars makes the values of the int array positive useful if you want to convert extended 8 bit chars which will be represented in a signed 8bit chars type as a negative number and would otherwise be negative int too

284126
for-loop	loops
for the other for-loop you need to check inside the brackets to have an idea for what this loops is used

284126
vim	emacs
so i think it s the vim vs emacs things coming back in your question with the for vs foreach loop people who like the for will say this foreach is useless might cause performance issues and is just big

284129
ilist	icollection
if you really want to use readonlycollection t the issue is that the constructor of readonlycollection t takes an ilist t while the keycollection of the dictionary is only a icollection t

284134
post	get
it s not a killer -- good programmers will get through it but they ll curse your name and probably post you on thedailywtf

284156
int	chars
if you want to explode a byte array to an int array you can just do it chars by chars

284171
put	get
you might need to put some time into tweaking them to get the windows application look and feel just right but that should be more than compensated for by the lack of a need to write a whole new presentation layer

284184
hide	show
you may want a button to hide show the category lists as this can take a lot of space even when using scrollbars

284265
put	get
your best bet is to put the code that uses side_bar_html in your onreadystatechange function so that it doesn t get used before it s set

284287
gif	png
i am by no means an iis expert that s why i just gave up and went with converting to gif files but from the research i did before giving up i can tell you that not all versions of iis support the png mime type by default

284293
hex	binary
watchdog timer reset pins 8-bit counters overflows delay loops hex binary bit-masking interrupts interrupt service requests io ports etc. it s all very educational - and a great feeling to get so close to the machine - but being able to code something in c will hide some of this complexity so you can focus on results

284313
int	boolean
note dosomething is just there because of the where extension method being ok with a method that takes in a user and int and returns boolean

284321
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have an application with 5 uiviewcontroller s each inside a corresponding uinavigationcontroller all tucked inside a uitabbarcontroller that displays 5 tabs at the bottom of the screen

284321
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i want to display another uiviewcontroller inside a uinavigationcontroller when a dialog button is pressed

284321
hide	show
then i can show it and hide it using the tabbar s selectedindex property

284331
getter	setter
another issue with xmlserializer is that it doesn t like to serialize immutable types everything must have a public getter and setter unless you do it all yourself by implementing ixmlserializable in which case you haven t gained much by using xmlserializer

284360
config	ini
use ini file with config

284385
post	get
5 get post parameters - is it bad form for a class to be looking at _get and _post

284388
ncover	xunit.net
i m setting up ci at present using thoughtworks studios cruise gallio to run xunit.net fact tests and ncover 2 to do code-coverage

284481
post	get
if it bothers you you could use default arguments to use given arguments first then search for get post values if none are provided though that might be a security risk

284489
folder	directory
so i took alien.lua core.dll and struct.dll from the unzipped folder and put them under a directory named alien in a common library repository

284533
public	protected
comment each public method or even better also protected and private ones with explanations what do they do and what parameters are needed

284533
post	get
get vs post

284542
calloc	malloc
well the simplest answer would be to use calloc instead of malloc

284581
pop-up	dialog
but i don t want that message to pop-up when the the application has a modal dialog in the foreground because the user couldn t do anything about it

284588
addition	multiplication
i run a little speed check on them which just uses addition and multiplication

284661
tcombobox	tmemo
it s very interesting to quickly translate a delimited string to a control like a tmemo and similar ones tlistbox tcombobox just to list a few

284661
tstringlist	tlist
i just don t like much tlist as tstringlist satisfied my needs without needing of treating pointers as tlist is a list of pointer values

284677
actionscript	mxml
you can use that sort of technique to create the components in actionscript you will still need to set all the properties that are usually set in mxml but they all have the same names

284711
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
a uinavigationcontroller is a distinct object that is very different from a uitabbarcontroller

284726
postgresql	mysql
it s about postgresql and mysql so the performance analysis is different but the logic for explicitness still holds why force yourself to always worry about something that s relevant a small percentage of the time

284851
junit	testng
in either case segmenting out the tests as both testng and junit do is helpful with integration tests too

284920
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
if i remove clientaccesspolicy.xml and instead add the flash style crossdomain.xml policy file then it works

284920
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i do see through inspecting the network how clientaccesspolicy.xml is requested first unsuccessfully and then silverlight falls back to crossdomain.xml

284922
solaris	aix
the subversion webpage has links to unofficial binaries for many nix systems including hp-ux solaris aix the bsds and linux distros

284929
subclass	abstract-class
what i would suggest is to write your tests on the desired functionality of a non-abstract subclass of the abstract-class in question then write both the abstract-class and the implementing subclass and finally run the test

284929
subclass	abstract-class
your tests should obviously test the defined methods of the abstract-class but always via the subclass

284933
pop-up	dialog
avoid pop-up dialog like the plague

284950
smartsvn	tortoisesvn
we are using various svn clients tortoisesvn smartsvn subclipse etc.

284961
post	get	post	put	put	get
rest really only uses the http verbs get put post delete on a resource

284969
stdout	fflush
immediately before sleeping call fflush stdout

284986
subclass	abstract-class
if you do not want to subclass the abstract-class just to perform a unit test on the methods which are implemented in the abstract-class already you could try to see whether your framework allows you to mock abstract-class

285005
sorting	grouping
as i really only want to find the start and end values of grouping with small gaps the sorting only needs to create buckets and can discard the data

285023
quicksort	heapsort
i was just going to say radix sort however that could be a bit above what you were looking to implement introsort is generally the accepted sorting solution for data it s a variation of quicksort that switches to heapsort when it reaches smaller sets as it s faster on smaller sets than quicksort

285074
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
update i ve tested this in firefox 3 internet explorer 7 opera 9.5 and safari 3.1.2 all on windows xp x64 and this issue occurs in all of them

285086
getattr	setattr
however you can to an extent do this with the setattr and getattr built-in functions

285112
min	max
the buckets will contain a min and max value of their contents but won t store the contents themselves

285204
vim	emacs
but there is one advantage with ides over emacs vim related environments i want to focus on you spend less time installing configuring the features you want

285204
vim	emacs
no idea how many hours i would need to get the features i use up and running with emacs vim

285225
vim	emacs
you ask should i use an ide instead of... but i don t understand what the alternative is - vim and emacs fulfil many functions any ide will give you

285225
vim	emacs
then your question boils down to simply what ide should i use with arguments to be made for the simpler realm of vim and emacs

285239
put	get
remember that if you re still at the tutorial stage any tutorial is going to have a lot of just put this line of code in because they are trying to get concepts across not dig down into the inner workings of everything

285254
solaris	aix
edirectory is cross platform and runs on windows netware linux sles and red hat at least solaris aix and hpux

285324
multiton	singleton
you could use static class singleton multiton to implement the desired functionality

285345
post	get
when scouring the web i find all sorts of post which all seem to be about setting headers on the request some want me to not send the expect header some want me to send the keep-alive header but irregardless of the headers i send i still get this pesky error

285433
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the leading will not match within .htaccess only within httpd.conf src - bottom of page if you wish for processing of further rules to stop then add the l flag

285450
ienumerable	iqueryable
i find that extension methods are most useful when you are working with iqueryable ienumerable collections

285458
hide	show
in rowdatabound which initially show hide the links i add a linkvisibility instance to the collection for each row

285459
int	chars
tab is just ascii chars 9 and that has a base64 representation just like any other int

285502
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this code works in firefox internet explorer not in safari google-chrome

285502
google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome the divnew can only be moved vertically

285521
post	get
i know that the timeout on the server side is 20 min but if my client takes more than 100 seconds to post my data to that service then i get a timeout exception

285601
hide	show
theoretically you should be able to write some code like this and then use the return value to show hide what you want

285627
cvs	svn
most svn users treat tags the way cvs presented them

285627
cvs	rcs
i used to hand-edit rcs and cvs files with vi when i needed to fix a comment etc

285673
post	get
also i m sure if you post more code that shows how query and it are defined and used you ll get a definitive answer here too how s that for remote debugging

285753
boost	stl
for example there are stl standard template library and boost tr1 extensions to stl that are considered industry standards well stl is at least

285754
int	double
so let s say i want to write a class that operates on different kinds of numbers but i don t a priori know what kind of numbers int double etc. i will be operating on

285761
inherited	properties
however since vba does not support inherited objects of the extended class will have only the properties you define for them

285782
pull	push
should he have the right to push in my repository or should i pull from his repository

285792
pull	push
either way you d pull the changes into the private repo on your computer fix any mistakes that result from the merge and then push his changes to your public repo the one on github

285818
ubuntu	linux
with java version 1.5.0_06 on both windows and ubuntu linux

285819
int	chars
instead of appending a chars to a string it will take the integral value of the chars which gets promoted to an int and add that to the value of the pointer

285827
public	protected
per josh the automatically-generated uid is generated based on a class name implemented interfaces and all public and protected members

285828
entity-relationship	diagram
my fallback option is to recreate an entity-relationship diagram by hand

285833
gridview	objectdatasource
use the objectdatasource control bind it to your gridview and set up a handler for the selectcoutnmethod property

285868
lisp	scheme
when you program in lisp or scheme you spend a lot of time thinking about functions and what actions you want to take on your data

285877
versioning	upgrade
i don t know what your product is or who your customers are but from my experience mac users are early adopters relatively speaking i ve never used an os x versioning longer than two weeks before the next upgrade was out and in my circle i am a late adopter

285973
y-combinator	combinators
while he doesn t to my knowledge look at the y-combinator itself he does look at other combinators for instance

286002
agile	sprint
you can pratice agile to your hearts delight as enhancement and fixes could be story boarded and made part of your sprint backlog

286005
.htaccess	httpd.conf
mod_rewrite rules may be placed within the httpd.conf file or within the .htaccess

286005
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if you have access to httpd.conf placing rules here will offer a performance benefit as the rules are processed once as opposed to each time the .htaccess is called

286022
sorting	filtering
i m looking for good patterns for implementing a paged table of results in asp.net mvc with sorting filtering and paging provided via ajax

286029
disk	ram
so in the grand scheme of things -- if you have lots of disk ram and spare i o use whatever datatype you want

286054
nginx	lighttpd
if you just wanted static delivery then something like nginx or lighttpd would be an obvious way to go

286068
decimal	ieee
ieee floating point is binary not decimal

286114
folder	directory
what i first noticed is you are making a directory higher in the tree then attempting to make the php file in the current folder

286231
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd
for freebsd netbsd openbsd macos x kqueue

286239
rss	feed
nabble and gmane both archive mailing lists and provide rss feed

286252
int	chars
primitive arrays int float chars etc are never empty by which i assume you mean null because primitive array elements can never be null

286288
public	protected
my first attempt was using the base class having a non-virtual public interface and then having another protected virtual method checkcreatedtype that would allow anything in the chain to inspect the type before the base class create was called

286300
cos	sin
you can calculate the sin from the cos using sin 2 + cos 2 1

286300
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
that is sin sqrt 1-cos cos

286303
swt	swing
now swt is os specific and you may not have the same flexibility than swing so you need to have good reason for looking for an alternative to swing especially when you consider there are good lafs look and feel for java

286305
width	height
if you don t want to use float then you might need to set the width and height manually

286315
firefox	safari
script that works with firefox safari khtml internet explorer and css3 capable browsers

286321
post	get
now it s my understanding that if a browser my browser is gwt requestbuilder doesn t support delete get rails somehow accomplishes this task with a post and some other url parameter

286323
extjs	mootools
i prefer jquery so that is my first recommendation but i worked with yui mootools prototype and extjs before making my decision

286372
fink	macports
the easiest way to start afresh with macports or fink is to simply remove the folder sw for fink or opt for macports

286372
sudo	passwd
that will install python2.6 into usr local python2.6 the last line requires sudo so will ask you for your passwd

286384
inline	inlining
in general an inline method that does nothing but pass the call onto another function is a great candidate for inlining

286418
ubuntu	linux
the web application hosted on linux ubuntu

286463
post	put
of course the form is sent with post but rails hads a hidden field to simulate a put request

286533
loops	while-loop
i ve been able to do it with a while-loop but i want to try it with a foreach loops

286563
wan	lan
i ve searched a bit and for me it looks like we must use application integration framework aif enterprise portal ep - this due to as i understand that the bc is not made for multi-users like on the web but must be implemented with a session-wrapper like ep - and also it must be run on an lan and is not capable to connect via wan

286570
solaris	bsd
my understanding is that start-stop-daemon is a command that is specific to linux or bsd distros and is not available on solaris

286583
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux ubuntu 8.04 but would be also be interested in solutions for other operating systems

286617
inline	inlining
however inlining opens the door to more optimizations if you have v a + b + c your wrapper class forces the generation of stack variables whereas for inline calls the majority of the data can be kept in the fpu stack

286634
gmail	hotmail
it s the way that big ones gmail g docs hotmail .. do it - lot of js code that manipulates with ui

286635
mouse	keyboard
as g mastros says the _click event is the one to use since it fires when the selection is changed via either keyboard or mouse

286641
width	height
i want to to create a jsp that serves a downsampled image with decent quality not pixelated as per the passed image width height getimage.jsp

286698
ubuntu	debian
to use in debian ubuntu sudo aptitude install html2ps and then pipe the output to lpr to print

286724
filesystems	hfs+
edit i also forgot about macdrive which is another great tool for working with hfs+ filesystems under windows

286724
filesystems	hfs+
since a dmg is basically just a hfs+ filesystems snapshot it is probably possible with macdrive to create dmg s as well

286807
post	get
get maybe post for testing

286846
post	get
it s responsible for the user interface and shows information to the user by building html pages and receiving user input through get and post requests

286887
nginx	lighttpd
both nginx and lighttpd web servers have x-send-file headers you can return from php

286887
nginx	lighttpd
nginx and possibly lighttpd allow you to cap the download speed so you re not sending out streaming data faster than it can be consumed

286909
nginx	lighttpd
if i remember correctly the idea originally comes from lighttpd but - as josh states- is also available for nginx

286956
vbscript	vb6
or you could rewrite the vb6 app as a vbscript program

287014
action-filter	onactionexecuting
what i really wished i could do was have an action-filter that would return a view or partial view during the onactionexecuting event that displays this animated .gif then once the controller completed processsing and returned the viewdata the view or partial view with the actual view data could be displayed

287020
stderr	fflush
you can use fflush or print to stderr which is not buffered

287039
allocator	stl
if you really care about performance so much that you can t use a big old library like regex won t risk a bnf parser don t want to assume that std string substr will avoid a copy with allocator and hence can t use stl string functions and can t even copy the string chars into a buffer and left-pad with 0 characters

287039
int	chars
but fundamentally just 0-initialising those int variables is almost as much work as copying the string into a chars buffer with padding so i wouldn t expect to see any significant performance difference

287053
width	height
how do i programmatically find out the width and height of the video in an mpeg-2 transport program stream file

287054
pecl	pear
is there any way i can embed insert images into this excel file without using any library only php code or library which doesn t require pear pecl extensions

287079
division	multiplication
if you re only using multiplication and division rather than operations like square roots that can result in irrational numbers you will never lose precision

287091
client-side	server-side
it s used a lot for ajax amongst other things because with ajax you typically have a server-side language php etc. passing a set of results to a client-side language javascript

287107
jobs	cron
script runner and rake tasks are perfectly fine to run as cron jobs

287107
jobs	cron
here s one very important thing you must remember when running cron jobs

287107
jobs	cron
also cron jobs probably don t run as you so don t depend on any shortcut you put in .bashrc

287135
dictionary	map
with such variable properties a dictionary approach basically a map of key-value pairs type specific or not is a great way to retain flexibility in the design

287172
queue	fifo
it is effectively a hashset but it also maintains a linkedlist to allow a predictable iteration order - and therefore can also be used as a fifo queue with the nice added benefit that it can t contain duplicate entries

287182
allocator	stl
a disadvantage that i encountered is that the latest installment of the dinkum stl containers make an assumption that pointers are used rather than the using allocator pointer policy

287192
listview	gridview
a common web ui design is to display a sortable grid gridview listview datagrid with paging

287231
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop instead of a foreach loops

287239
sorting	filtering
decouple the filtering sorting from the actual source so that you can mock the datasource

287259
g++	gcc
i tried autoconf but its assuming .h is gcc instead of g++

287273
g++	gcc
from reading the this eclipse cdt faq entry it sounds like eclipse can automatically generate a list of include directories if you start your build from within eclipse and if your build outputs the gcc g++ commands before actually starting gcc g++

287293
superclass	subclassing
should you realize that you need to change the superclass you can fix things without having to sweat the details in each subclassing

287307
put	get
and put the techo info in a hidden area ie click here to get the propeller head version

287315
prepare	execute
if you run the query once the statement is parsed prepare bound and execute

287317
profiling	instrumentation
i would rather spend a little time analyzing the problem up front and putting a few strategic print statements than figure out how to instrumentation your app for profiling then pour over gargantuan reports where every executable line of code is timed

287386
postgresql	mysql
also this was done in postgresql so i m not sure if this exact syntax would work in mysql

287398
width	height
when writing a custom itemrenderer how do you reference the height and width of the grid cell that it will be rendered in

287404
vim	notepad++
the issue is when i try to use that expression in vim and notepad++ it can t seem to find anything

287405
post	get
it will get rid of all of them so you might need to have a pre-preprocessor step and a post pre-processor step to protect things you don t want to be expanded

287435
width	height
it appears that the width and height are set in the mpeg2_header_sequence function in header.c

287498
nunit	mstest
this allows us to use bizunit s library of steps directly in c# nunit mstest code

287503
parent-child	one-to-many
the parent-child relationship is also called a one-to-many relationship where the one is the parent and the many is the child

287538
hash	md5
i would imagine you will have to add a column to the database for the encrypted password then run a batch job over all records which gets the current password encrypts it as others have mentiond a hash like md5 is pretty standard edit but should not be used on its own - see other answers for good discussions stores it in the new column and checks it all happened smoothly

287544
hash	salt
what you should do is store the hash of a pre-chosen and secret salt value + the password

287544
hash	salt
i.e. concatenate the salt and the password hash the result and store this hash

287544
hash	salt
when authenticating do the same - concatenate your salt value and the user-supplied password hash then check for equality

287544
hash	salt
of course if the user send passwords across the network for example if you re working on a web or client-server application then you should not send the password in clear text across so instead of storing hash salt + password you should store and check against hash salt + hash password and have your client pre-hash the user-supplied password and send that one across the network

287649
put	get
the best line in the world to get someone on your side is i m in trouble and i need your help... you ve elevated them and subjugated yourself you ve put them in a position to save you

287654
securitymanager	classloader
class.getmethods bypass es securitymanager checks depending on the immediate caller s classloader see section 6 of the java secure coding guidelines

287738
hash	salt
the basic strategy is to use a key derivation function to hash the password with some salt

287738
hash	salt
the salt and the hash result are stored in the database

287738
hash	salt
when a user inputs a password the salt and their input are hash in the same way and compared to the stored value

287738
hash	salt
first he d use the salt to lookup the correct dictionary then he d use the hash output to look up a usable password

287789
pascal	delphi
what code will produce the absolute fastest execution in delphi pascal

287797
post	get
in ie 6 or ie 7 i can make one request http post to the app but when i try to make a 2nd request i get an operation aborted message

287804
post	get
the creator has a great post that should help get you up and running in no time

287808
int	chars
the table is an array of records each containing 2 chars and 1 int

287821
many-to-many	one-to-many
is the relationship one-to-many or many-to-many

287859
width	margin	margin	background-color
it won t stretch the full width between the label and the right side but you can have the label hide the bottom-border using background-color or something and have the div expand all the way to the right aswell without the margin

287865
spaces	delimiter
by default white spaces is a delimiter so you will get one stringlist item per token

287883
scrypt	pbkdf2
edit 2016 use argon2 scrypt bcrypt or pbkdf2 in that order of preference

287883
hash	md5
when you hash the passwords use do not use plain md5

287883
pbkdf2	salt
use pbkdf2 which basically means using a random salt to prevent rainbow table attacks and iterating re-hashing enough times to slow the hashing down - not so much that your application takes too long but enough that an attacker brute-forcing a large number of different password will notice

287883
hash	salt	hash	hmac
a good way to apply the salt when hashing is to use hmac with your favorite hash algorithm using the password as the hmac key and the salt as the text to hash see this section of the document

287907
post	get
simple http get post with data being represented as json array string variations of this being encrypted compressed string as parameter

287930
post	get
what you want to do is an http post if you are sending a lot of data or a get with a query string if theres a smaller amount of data

288004
post	get
which would result in the http get post of

288044
textview	imageview
i know that i can create an xml layout r.layout.mainmenu_item that has an imageview and textview in it but i am unsure how to set the imageview s icon

288054
hide	show
goal efficiently show hide rows based on the data in the row

288057
gridview	sqldatasource
i m working with a gridview that uses a sqldatasource element that looks like this

288084
folder	dir
exec master.sys.xp_cmdshell dir b c some folder with sql backups in it

288121
folder	directory
however within the directory that i want to recursively search through there are many folder files which have been added locally these i do not want to commit

288127
ant	cruisecontrol
we re using cruisecontrol ant and buckminster

288127
cobertura	eclemma	cobertura	emma
i have been looking at cobertura emma eclemma dbunit though am very interested to hear of any experiences with these or any other tools

288151
perl	tcl
also for a taste of how these widgets look in ruby perl and tcl see

288195
int	chars
if you know that the only whitespace is going to be #32 ascii space or a similarly limited set of chars there may be some clever bit manipulation hacks that can let you process 4 bytes at a time using int scanning

288253
rss	feed
you could probably subscribe to www.freshmeat.net s rss feed and only react when an even numbered version shows up

288263
for-loop	loops
however since we move the multiplication into the for-loop this is done every single loops

288322
google-chrome	firefox
firefox ie google-chrome support the .scrollheight doesnt work with google-chrome so i have come up with a javascript example using jquery to set all iframe heights on a page based on the iframes content

288418
hash	md5
however i always get different md5 results when i hash the file after it is downloaded

288419
stringbuilder	stringwriter
feed stringbuilder to the stringwriter

288440
salt	md5
get md5 js implementation and compare salt

288476
hash	md5
if im not totally wrong here the md5 hash is only working on the actual data not the timestamps and other metadata

288486
pull	push
that lets anyone push pull their changes including branches to the bare repository and then others can fetch pull merge as they see fit

288500
ethernet	wireless
for that configuration i have built-in ethernet en1 configured to use dhcp and our company s dns server for when i m at work there is no wireless available

288501
expander	grid	expander	gridsplitter
i ran into a similar problem using an expander inside a grid with a gridsplitter

288507
versioning	upgrade
i wouldn t advise running this many versioning or instances on a production box but 2 instances until you upgrade your other applications to 2005 should be no problem

288536
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr needn√¢ t be built-in

288537
width	height
the arguments to the resize option are gravity x y width height so this will place the window at the top-left corner of the screen and resize it to 640x480

288562
g++	gcc
gnu gcc g++ provides non portable attributes for types which are very useful

288615
hash	md5
accidental collision of md5 is impossible in all practical scenarios to get a 50 chance of collision you d have to hash 6 billion urls per second every second for 100 years

288615
hash	md5
even though there is a known collision attack against md5 intentional malicious collisions are currently impossible against hash urls

288617
apache	nginx
with java hosting you don t need to do all the stupid tricks with apache or nginx

288625
post	get
you need to know the http protocol basics get post

288643
floating-point	integer
since floating-point values can t be compared for equality an integer may have been used to make the sql simpler

288650
rpyc	pyro
if you re even considering pyro check out rpyc first and re-consider xml-rpc

288665
sorting	grouping
either way it s seems like wrong way to pulling your data you can probably do taht with one query adequate sorting order by directly in the sql server grouping by and sum for getting the sum of your terms

288666
disk	ram
the initrd will get read from the disk once as one large file and then everything will run out of ram

288727
floating-point	integer
which uses all integer arithmetic is usually faster than its floating-point equivalent likely significantly faster in the case of a floating-point type equivalent to t-sql s decimal type

288732
hash	md5
at the moment i calculate an md5 hash for the known file and then scan all files recursively looking for a match

288735
post	put
in fact i can put any old random text in the pre and post events and no error is ever given nor do i see anything being called

288749
hash	md5
it seems pretty pointless to read the entire file compute a md5 hash and then compare the hash

288752
opera	safari
the problem is not seen with ie6 ie7 opera latest stable nov 2008 or safari latest stable nov 2008

288753
min	max
then get a random number with a min max for each section

288771
richfaces	icefaces
icefaces or richfaces jsf

288789
hash	md5
you should either use a hash function which has not been broken yet like sha-1 or as soapbox mentioned use md5 only as a fast way to find candidates for a deeper comparison

288808
ienumerable	ienumerator
is yield return a shortcut for implementing ienumerable and ienumerator

288824
wadl	wsdl
while sam s correct that restful web applications don t need a direct analog to wsdl there is an xml vocabulary that s useful for describing restful web apps wadl or web application description language

288918
ceil	floor
so the worst case depth is floor 2 log2 n call it 15 for a total of 120 and the best is ceil 1 2 log2 n which is 4

288931
pascal	delphi
delphi aka object pascal i ll talk about the native version not .net

288942
division	multiplication
but division and multiplication could be costly.

288946
division	modulo
but the modulo might be as costly as a division

288948
sharpmap	proj
to use sql server 2008 spatial data i would look at the sharpmap proj on codeplex

288955
hex	binary
however what if i want to specify and send a hex or binary number

288999
jquery	simplemodal
i ve used the simplemodal jquery plugin and i ve been quite happy with it

289004
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview that i would like to bind to an objectdatasource

289005
hash	md5
the md5 hash is calculated on the file contents and is not affected by document metadata

289005
hash	md5
how are you creating the md5 hash for the file

289034
division	modulo
but here s a fun fact gcc doesn t use division modulo for this

289038
post	get
it s essentially the same as the joins above but because you re not actually doing a join you don t have to worry about getting duplicates of the records in post so you ll just get one record per post

289047
hide	show
if you wanted to show an image somewhere else on the page you could accomplish that using javascript to hide show the image on the link s mouseover event

289057
interbase	firebird
update to answer your question in the comment most database brands don t support multiple concurrent transactions on a single connection interbase firebird is the only exception i know of

289145
post	get
it should work with post get etc

289145
post	get
it might be that you have an actionfilter that s only allowing post to get through or something else that is thwarting the behavior

289156
folder	directory
you are probably receiving errors on your build- it sounds like the dll s are actually output from other projects in your solution so you should check if they are building properly or if they are being output to a different directory instead of your bin folder

289158
folder	directory
you need to specify copy local on your references this will copy them out of the library folder into your bin directory

289159
textarea	pre
i tried setting white-space pre on the textarea s css but it s still not enough

289163
cassini	iis
the other thing that s a pretty big gotcha is debugging web services is much easier using iis and vdirs rather than separate cassini instances

289258
ogre	irrlicht
now if you want something like this for a free project and you know c++ you may try any of the many open source engines out there such as ogre or irrlicht

289348
ready	each
work on several features at once release each individually when it s ready

289349
post	get
counter intuatively asp uses the response.codepage to determine how the characters in the form post should be interpreted hence utf-8 encoding get erroneously accepted as a set ot 1252 characters corrupting the input

289378
postgresql	mysql
not a relational database like mysql or postgresql

289382
sharepoint	spsite	spweb	spsite
even if it s not a important as in a sharepoint webapp it s still recommenced to dispose all spweb and spsite objets

289438
udp	tcp
tcp 1433 and udp 1434 are open on our firewall

289468
children	parent
i have come up with a few ideas such as traversing the html document tree to its leaves adding up the length of the text and only seeing what other text the parent has if the parent gives us more content than the children do

289497
min	max
rows_this_page get_values rows min index page_number per_page - per_page max index page_number per_page - 1

289521
rss	feed
when i reach the end of the slides i pull data from an aggregated rss feed from all the different systems in order to pull information

289569
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to new versioning

289572
mouse	keyboard	hid	keyboard
what i m searching for is the pen equivalent to the hid mouse driver hid keyboard driver and mass storage driver

289572
mouse	keyboard
the mentioned example drivers makes it possible for windows linux and mac os to recognize mouse keyboard and memory sticks without installing new drivers

289572
mouse	keyboard	hid	keyboard
so far i m able to make usb hid descriptors that qualify as mouse and keyboard from os point of view and automatically uses the standard driver supplied by the os

289580
versioning	upgrade
but just to add xsl s answer using the lts versioning on servers allows you to have some confidence you can deploy servers which are going to be regularly patched but will not need upgrade of the entire os

289590
png	ico
it creates an ico file from 1 or more png s and handles multiple sizes etc like

289615
migrate	upgrade
it was long obsolete by then having been succeeded by both windows 2000 and xp 2003 but because companies did either not want to migrate yet or had custom software that is not compatible microsoft provided support and security upgrade until then

289712
pascal	delphi
as a long time pascal and delphi developer i always line up my begin and ends thus

289727
tinyint	varchar
tinyint varchar fields containing the values 0 1

289727
tinyint	boolean
i tend to prefer the tinyint 0 1 variant since automatic type conversion in php gives me boolean values rather simply

289738
tinyint	boolean
i use tinyint 1 in order to store boolean values in mysql

289738
tinyint	boolean
but if i m not wrong mysql can store boolean bool and it store it as a tinyint 1

289759
tinyint	boolean
otherwise according to the mysql manual you can use bool and boolean which are at the moment aliases of tinyint 1

289759
tinyint	boolean
bool boolean these types are synonyms for tinyint 1

289767
tinyint	boolean
bool and boolean are synonyms of tinyint 1

289780
putty	winscp
you ll find winscp putty filezilla and list free country list of sftp clients

289789
width	height
if i remember correctly an easy way to cure this is to create another iframe in the top page with minimum height width and call it framefix or similar

289792
int	chars
what is the best way to convert an int value to the corresponding chars in utf16 given that the int is in the range of valid values

289793
bazaar	git
that being said if you have some requirements to do this that you cannot get around you can use one of the more modern version control systems like git bazaar and darcs there are others but i ve used these three

289831
disk	ram
i doubt that hardware is the issue as i m running on the latest quad core intel chip with 4gb ram and a wd velociraptor 10 000rpm hard disk

289841
inherited	properties
in oop languages like c# or vb.net if i make the properties or methods in a super class protected i can t access them in my form - they can only be accessed in my class that inherited from that super class

289841
inherited	properties
to access those properties or methods i need to make them public which defeats encapsulation or re-write them into my class which defeats inherited

289915
sorting	filtering
sorting and filtering rows on conditions

290009
cpython	ironpython
i use sql alchemy with cpython i don t know if it ll work with ironpython though

290014
doc	rtf	wordprocessingml	rtf
aspose.words supports a wide array of features including document creation content and formatting manipulation powerful mail merge abilities comprehensive support of doc ooxml rtf wordprocessingml html opendocument and pdf formats

290183
post	get
post redirect get pattern can be used to address this problem

290225
submit	submission
a submit input type has the default functionality of submission the form it s placed in though of course you can still add additional functionality using javascript

290241
jruby	mri
the jruby team are now reporting better performance than the native mri

290255
tinyint	boolean
bit has a this is a boolean semantic and some apps will consider tinyint 1 the same way due to the way mysql used to treat it so apps may format the column as a check box if they check the type and decide upon a format based on that

290262
innodb	myisam
5.0.3 for myisam and extended in 5.0.5 to memory innodb bdb and ndbcluster

290298
gif	png
gif or png

290320
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it doesn t occur with firefox safari or google-chrome

290328
tinyint	boolean
if you use the boolean type this is aliased to tinyint 1

290335
firefox	safari
the following works fine in ie and safari but firefox is positioning the div absolutely on the page not within the cell code based on the solution solution here

290407
padding	overlapping
you can have a header section which has background aligned to the bottom as an image and bottom padding that prevents text content from overlapping that part

290415
hash	md5
the secret key is used to create a signature via md5 hash

290442
width	height
have a div inside the td with width 100 and height 100 then set that to position relative

290460
hash	md5
why do a md5 hash and not something like aes

290473
hash	md5
the hash is strictly a signature so a one-way hash like md5 is good enough for their usage

290516
std	ostream
note the use of constant ... since otherwise boost lambda wouldn t notice that this is supposed to be a lambda expression the compiler would try to output the string using std cout and assign the result an std ostream reference to menu help

290547
fastcgi	scgi
most python web frameworks support the wsgi standard and can be hooked up to servers in a myriad of ways but most live in some sort of long-running process that the web server communicates with via proxying fastcgi scgi etc

290547
django	turbogears	pylons	turbogears
if you are looking for something that comes prepackaged with web db templating integration i d suggest looking at django turbogears or pylons

290547
web.py	cherrypy
if you want to have more control over the individual components look at cherrypy colubrid or web.py

290557
jboss	weblogic
may be trying to deploy jboss or weblogic on the same machine would give you a hint

290565
inherited	properties
as long as you provided the properties that they needed to work everything was fine multiple inherited mi without the diamond problem name conflicts and other mi issues

290601
post	get
new - get - a form to post to create

290615
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
quick test are you going to add subtract multiplying divide phone numbers

290645
hash	md5
so one approach could be to sort them concatenate the bytes and take an md5 hash of all the bytes.

290650
django	turbogears	turbogears	cherrypy
however raw cgi is a huge pain when compared with the greatly simplified world of an all-python framework turbogears cherrypy django whatever.

290656
multiplying	add
if you ve actually got a sequence of guids and the order matters then i d suggest using the same approach i wrote about in another answer - repeatedly add multiplying

290664
std	ostream
this will automatically work for any type which has defined with an std ostream

290664
std	ostream
it will also automatically work with stream manipulator objects - those are really just functions which take an std ostream parameter and just calls the function on the ostream

290686
ncover	nant
for a build runner we use nant to send emails to various people copy the packaged builds where they re supposed to go run nunit and ncover and deploy the software to our web farm

290694
folder	directory
i was asked to find a way to monitor changes modification renaming deletion moving of files in specific folder on the company s shared file server simple windows shared directory

290705
hash	md5
md5 and sha1 have shown a bit of weakness two words can result in the same hash so using sha256-sha512 iterative hash is recommended to hash the password

290705
hash	salt
i would write a small program in the language that the application is written in that goes and generates a random salt that is unique for each user and a hash of the password

290712
shadowing	named
you should use size_t instead of size_t and you should also avoid naming your variables size_t since that introduces confusion by shadowing a type named with a variable named

290739
post	get
in that case the post does not get recorded.

290749
stdout	fflush	stdout	stdio	stdio	fflush
if that s a concern you should arrange to call system.out.flush before calling your jni function and in your c function if it s using stdio rather than the low-level write call you should call fflush stdout before returning

290855
int	chars
also note that the standard says that a bit-field shall have a type that is a qualified or unqualified version of int unsigned int or signed int so having a bit-field in a chars type is non-standard

290894
rss	feed
despite the proliferation of rss and atom feed i d say the average web user still has no idea what they are

290909
sorting	grouping
for example i would prefer to keep items in same order each time with like items grouping together instead of sorting them

290916
serializable	deserialization
you could potentially implement the ixmlserializable interface and use type.fullname you may also need type.assemblyqualifiedname for serializable and the assembly.gettype string for deserialization of your type element

290940
button	checkbox
does anyone know if it s possible to determine using javascript whether the user s browser allows checkbox and radio button to be focused

290968
min	max
other things to consider would be to enforce min max lengths and some rules around passwords.

290988
rss	feed
for example perhaps it might be feasible for changes or summaries of them to be put onto an rss feed and have clients watch the feed instead of the real application

291082
versioning	upgrade
upgrading desktop apps can be a nightmare especially if you develop a new versioning using new tools and suddently have to upgrade all the other stuff dlls binaries whatever on all the desktops

291093
inherited	subclassing
this won t prevent others from subclassing tdefaultfileutils and calling the inherited getfile but that is just not how inherited works anyway

291102
post	get
so the way i have it written down here is all actions that actually do something other than get information will be post

291145
nant	cruisecontrol
would a combination of subversion nunit wiki cruisecontrol nant something else satisfy all of these requirements

291157
nant	cruisecontrol
as for tools to consider - i think searching stack overflow for nant msbuild cruisecontrol etc will give you more content than you can shake a stick at.

291162
submit	submission
before submission the form i d like to grab the values of the checkboxes and stick them into a text field then submit that

291183
opera	firefox
it appears to work perfectly in firefox 3.0.4 but both opera 9.62 and ie fails to execute any other js from the same .js file including what normally works

291189
firefox	safari
works great in firefox but shows up at the top of the page in safari

291189
firefox	safari
on the image breaks it in firefox and does nothing in safari

291246
lisp	scheme
scheme started out as an experiment to add smalltalk-like oop to lisp

291252
pull	push
so some way to be able to push and pull the built objects to a server is critical for this

291267
lisp	scheme
if you re shaky on recursion at all i highly recommend learning scheme or lisp

291270
aptana	radrails
i downloaded aptana w radrails as it seemed to be a good solution and because i love anything eclipse-based

291288
firefox	safari
the following works for me in firefox ie safari

291288
width	height
set the negative margins to half the width height of your image for perfect centering

291304
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the code works on firefox ie7 google-chrome but not safari

291311
x86	64bit
the only difference is that i am now running 64bit as opposed to x86

291330
installation	upgrade
see for example the more fields plugin - it adds to the new edit post form without breaking your ability to upgrade the core installation

291366
stdout	stderr
you give it a bunch of command lines to run stored in a database it captures the exit value and stdout and stderr and if the exit value is non-zero it marks the build as broken

291372
aptana	radrails
i ve used aptana with radrails for a while now and have become quite used to it

291372
postgresql	mysql
for development i use mysql and postgresql on windows xp

291403
int	boolean
you could also package these boolean into bitmasked int

291436
rational-numbers	base
the guy proposing to base all other numbers on a rational-numbers primitive has never heard of transcendental numbers like pi for example which cannot be represented in this manner

291445
lisp	prolog
problem 2 this just feels wrong based on my prior experience with prolog lisp

291468
dia	visio
personally i use dia an open source visio kind of clone it works under windows linux and macosx

291523
filesystems	ntfs
i believe ntfs supports this and i am sure there are flavors of nix filesystems that would support it

291529
int	boolean
calls int boolean

291631
profiling	debugging
with delphi 4 i had been using gpprofile by primoz gabrijelcic as a profiling and memory sleuth by turbo power for memory analysis and leak debugging

291690
javassist	cglib
javassist and cglib are two good bytecode engineering libraries

291697
gridview	rowdatabound
in addition using the rowdatabound event would allow you to have an insert row available when the user pages to a different block of rows in the gridview

291704
opera	firefox
the check needs to work for ie firefox and opera browsers

291747
opera	firefox
i am not sure if opera and firefox use this same key but they likely have similar configuration options but this should at least get you on the right track

291760
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
it works with firefox opera and google-chrome but unfortunately not with ie

291760
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox opera and google-chrome you can test it easily like this

291783
min	max
it would be very hard to do in regex without the min max quantifiers so hopefully your language supports them

291836
int	double
and the type of myarray is not array a b it is array int double

291836
int	double
now both bounds are tuples and its type is array int int double

291848
affinity	processors
is it possible to programmatically either via the win32api python or via a command line option set the processors affinity for a process

291849
folder	directory
what is the simplest way in vb6 to loop through all the files in a specified folder directory and get their names

291858
affinity	processors
given a process handle you can call the setprocessaffinitymask win32 api function to set the processors affinity for another process

291860
javassist	cglib
there are technologies like asm and cglib but i recomend javassist because it is a very good library for that and you can find examples in tapestry5 framework

291891
terminate	timeout
i could use a timeout to terminate the send if it is taking a long time that is the server does not respond quickly but that is not what i want

291897
ready	each
one solution is that in each process i could accumulate the text of the queries i wish to invoke in an array then loop down it once i m ready to write but i m wondering if it s possible the sqlite transaction can be made to do this for me automatically

291922
hide	show
i have a nested function to show hide paragraphs news-ticker-style

291979
explode	implode
the reverse of explode implode

292109
free	malloc
with linux gcc c++ i d like to record something to stderr whenever malloc free new delete are called

292122
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
additionally tested in firefox 2 3 opera 8 9.5 and safari 4 successfully

292129
free	malloc
as far as overriding malloc and free since you re working on linux and with gcc the easiest method is to use malloc_hook and free_hook

292143
free	malloc
you can trace calls to malloc free with ltrace

292161
aptana	radrails
i think aptana radrails is still a little confusing around the edges

292189
google-chrome	safari
the microsoft.com menu doesn t work on google-chrome or safari either but i doubt that microsoft cares

292209
decimal	ieee
though not arbitrary precision lua decnumber a lua 5.1 wrapper for ibm decnumber implements the proposed general decimal arithmetic standard ieee 754r

292225
cvs	svn
all the other points seem as valid under git or svn or cvs or .

292250
lisp	scheme
beyond personal experience the closest thing you ll get to an objective guess is the tiobe index which currently ranks lisp scheme 21st with 0.470 market share

292267
ironruby	ironpython
the dynamic keyword looks like it can bridge the gap between dynamic languages like ironruby or ironpython quite nicely which will probably help its adoption in the microsoft monoculture.

292364
vb6	vba
the versions of vba post office 2000 are almost identical to vb6

292372
width	height
i have a unit with helper functions for determining proper sizes and placement margins which compute these from the default gui font and the standard values in dialog units as given in the ui guidelines and with helper functions to compute the maximum width height of an array of controls place controls things like that

292385
vb6	vba
also as mitch mentioned if you learn the basics of vb6 you can use the same syntax for vba

292459
onchange	onfocus	onchange	onblur	onfocus	onblur
try removing any validation this includes any onfocus onblur onchange event handlers

292510
versioning	upgrade
seconding klathzazts manually changing the versioning numbers. this is often the best solution for dealing with vsc++ when something goes wrong in the upgrade process

292573
folder	directory
it may be easier just to see if you can get permission to write to a single directory perhaps inside your web app folder on the server

292602
getter	setter
i ve implemented idynamicobject in c# 4 return a custom metaobject subclass that does simple property getter setter dispatch to a dictionary

292604
invokelater	invokeandwait
to run code on the event thread an application must obtain a lock on the event object or use invokelater or invokeandwait √¢ extra work for the developer but sophistication comes with a price tag

292649
invokelater	invokeandwait
the direct way of doing this is to use invokelater or invokeandwait

292657
erd	diagram
these domain models can be represented as uml domain models class diagram and sql erd s

292687
multiplying	add
add instruction say and multiplying

292709

292739
innodb	myisam
are you using innodb tables or myisam tables

292813
client-side	server-side
i believe the approach shd be based on a combination of server-side sockets and client-side ajax comet

292829
awt	swing
for awt swing you would use eventqueue.invokelater swingutilities.invokelater is only necessary due to java 1.1 not having the eventqueue method - 1.2 is about to celebrate its tenth birthday

292863
accessor	properties
you are not able to do so in this way since the way it works is that c# evaluates the value of firstname properties by calling its get accessor and passes the value of that to the indexer of the dictionary

292920
google-chrome	firefox
for heavy-weight applications those can be easily understood or at least profiled such as firefox or google-chrome

292951
firefox	safari
download a debugger for your browser firefox firebug ie visual studio express web developer safari drosera and following the execution path until the exception is thrown or you get to the portion of your code where the dom manipulation should happen

292975
domxpath	domdocument
for this kind of task reading the document into a domdocument and using domxpath is probably more suitable

292975
domxpath	domdocument
to answer your question both libraries as well as domdocument + domxpath are standard outfit with php5 so they would be equally fine choices

292991
vb.net	vb6
i would think there is an api to allow this but my favorite vb6 site mvps vb.net does not have a way

292995
inherited	properties
...and partial classes allow me to add permanent code in parallel files simple read-only properties like fullname from firstname and surname members for a person object - or i could use inherited

293006
maven	pom.xml
the modules will each be in a maven project built by a parent pom.xml

293006
jar	war
the process has already started on moving each jar war into it s own project but it s obvious that this will only scratch the surface a few classes in each app jar and a mammoth legacy project with everything else

293036
dao	facade
while repository allows you to abstract the whole data access perhaps being a facade for multiple dao maybe different data sources

293093
getter	setter
the only intents expressed by your code are getter and setter

293159
put	get
requests to do any operation get put in a queue

293256

but there are a number of other .net languages out there - a# boo oxygene f# ironlisp ironscheme ironpython ironruby nemerle phalanger p# powershell and more

293304
mouse	keyboard
a hook dll allows you to intercept all mouse and keyboard events

293304
mouse	keyboard
you can also inject mouse and keyboard events

293343
post	get	post	put	put	get
the issue is that rest uses get post put and delete

293343
post	get
but the django test client only offers get and post

293343
post	get	post	put	put	get
i ve monkeypatched methods for put like post and delete like get

293392
profiling	benchmarking
finally if you make any of those changes which could affect your website s performance run some benchmarking and profiling the gain or loss in performance

293394
margin	font-size
using relative units for font-size line-height and top bottom margin and padding will also keep the typographic scale intact as users increase decrease text size

293653
post	put
if you put square brackets in an input name php will automatically turn them into an array for you in the post array

293672
std	ostream
so my question then is there a way to handle files greater than 4gb in size using std ifstream std ostream ie standard c++

293699
gridview	datalist	gridview	repeater	gridview	detailsview	gridview	formview	datalist	repeater	formview	datalist	formview	detailsview
i am using a custom datalist control but this problem also occurs with gridview detailsview formview and repeater and maybe with other databound controls

293768
bazaar	git
if you know how please explain how to do this in your vcs of choice such as subversion git mercurial bazaar or etc

293878
rss	feed
i would like to provide an rss feed for our customers of their current open issues .

293885
rss	feed
if private feed are part of the rss spec you should look there for the mechanics of rss auth

293892
shoes	fxruby
if you are interested rubylearning offers a course on fxruby and shoes

293904
queue	fifo
asides from that you really need to get to know queue especially fifo and event queue will help you avoid going into the realm of multithreading world

293909
agile	greenhopper
if anyone is trying to do agile i am trying to figure out a way to use jira greenhopper for this

293917
fast-forward	merge
merging to the upstream branch will now be an easy fast-forward merge

293920
set	bag
your bag attribute for example could be such a set

293933
put	get
every link request ex mypage.aspx put a get called synctoken with another token diferent from the one you have stored in the session it goes like mypage.aspx

294046
fseek	fread
in this case the constructor would open the file and the destructor would close the file while the method would do some sort of fseek fread and return the value

294076
folder	directory
it s a rather specific instance where one would have to use this but if you are in the same predicament i was in simply put in your ftp server address username password the name of the folder you want deleted and the path of the folder to start in and this will iterate through the directory deleting all folder that match the name

294096
int	chars
vfilby s answer is probably the best one however many rdbms have better support for indexing chars fields than indexing dense int or floating point fields

294097
redmine	trac
i m also using trac for several projects but i m in the process of switching to redmine

294097
redmine	trac
redmine handles multiple projects and sub-projects right out of the box and overall seems nicer than trac

294097
redmine	trac
both have integration with subversion so it s a matter of determine the features you really need and the backend language you might already have available trac runs on python redmine on ruby on rails

294100
superclass	subclassing
in order to see that the setlabel function can be applied to a wx.statictext instance you have to travel up the namespace hierarchy in the wxpython docs to the wxwindow superclass from which wx.statictext is subclassing

294101
hex	binary
typically you d base64 or hex encode binary content so that it can be transported as text

294103
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
i worked on a project for one place that were forced to use a locking system and opted to use no control at all so i set up a secret svn branch even though i much prefer bazaar or git

294166
ubuntu	linux
i ve used it on both a macbook running os x as well as ubuntu linux on a desktop both with success

294178
easyhook	detours
if you only need to track process creation coming from a specific program or a few programs the easyhook detours method mentioned here will work pretty well but you effectively need to install a hook on createprocess into each program so it s not a great solution if you want to track all process creation in the system

294220
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
currently i have an image placed in the center of the window and i m thinking of using the three mouseevents mousedown mousemove and mouseup to calculate the new position when dragging the image

294246
post	put
a agree with manwood s post - you should build them as reports put a sproc behind the reports if necessary for the following reasons

294250
width	height
to do so i need to calculate the width and height of the element

294268
width	height
as of jquery 1.2.6 you can use one of the core css functions height and width or outerheight and outerwidth as appropriate

294285
pop-up	dialog
the general pattern is the user will press some key combination my program will detect it and potentially pop-up a dialog to get user input and then run a corresponding command typically by running an executable

294291
width	margin
set the margin 0 auto property and required width in px to the body tag

294349
rss	feed
i am trying to create a sidebar for a site that will allow a user to select an item from a drop down menu and show an rss feed

294349
hide	show
i am not sure how to acomplish this but my first thought was to use z-index and show hide layers

294504
ssdp	upnp
update an interesting kind of related discussion of ssdp and upnp is available on stackoverflow

294521
rss	feed
pre-load all the rss feed i m assuming your s in your example page are the html output of your rss feed

294522
mouse	keyboard
the main thing to keep in mind is that oncommand is fired for any action that results in an activation of the button which can include pressing the space bar when the button has the focus using a keyboard shortcut attached to the button or clicking the button with the mouse

294522
onclick	onmousedown	onclick	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup
the only actions that result in the button property being added to the event object are onclick ondblclick onmousedown and onmouseup

294522
onclick	onkeydown
to get the same functionality as oncommand you d need to handle both onclick and onkeydown events yourself while making sure the button is still enabled

294534
width	height
left and top declarations are calculated based on the elements current height width and the window s height and document width

294550
superclass	subclassing
separate subclassing of a common superclass can implement the various exceptions and special cases

294608
mouse	keyboard
apparently when the first listbox is disabled any mouse and keyboard events that would have gone to that listbox bleed through to the second listbox so scrolling support still does work

294616
unsigned	short
long long unsigned countnums short start_x short start_y short array 15 short size bool goright bool goright2

294691
inherited	properties
if i want to do it on multiple places then i would make a user control that inherited a textbox and then add a properties allowedchars or disallowedchars that handle it for me

294748
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to simulate a data-aware version of a tlistbox here and i need something to replace the list box s onclick handler which despite the name actually goes off anytime the selection is changed whether through the mouse or the keyboard

294752
maven	m2e	versioning	upgrade
unfortunately i m currently using rad rational application developer - ibm s commercial versioning of eclipse and it is not fully compatible with m2e and i can t use q4e as i m using maven 2.0.7 with no way to upgrade to 2.1

294766
gentoo	ubuntu
i can do this easily on my own machine gentoo but a binary distribution like ubuntu probably doesn t have a compiler available by default

294852
yacc	bison
parsing will probably be handled with a yacc bison grammar it is now

294861
cvs	svn
it confuses cvs svn users where single file changes are more regular

294869
expander	tabitem
last but not least i was able to get everything working properly with a groupbox and tabitem but not so much luck with an expander and i m not sure why

294894
gmail	hotmail
in my website under development the members can send messages to each other which are sent directly to their email now i m worried that some members can send spam to other members i have a spam filter but it doesn t give 100 protection as you know i m worried that my domain might get blacklisted on yahoo gmail hotmail or aol which will cause any messages sent from my domain to end up in the spam folder this is why i want to add the domain of my website to their whitelists if they exist

294961
versioning	upgrade
which needs to be able to read what versioning of each component is installed on their client machine in order to perform an upgrade only on that one component

294961
prerequisites	uninstaller
i have researched - and apparently prerequisites are not meant to be uninstaller

294961
prerequisites	uninstaller
perermtate i don t think there is a way to uninstaller a prerequisites that was prior installed which makes sense as the prerequisites may be required as a platform for other applications after all prerequisites were meant to be 3rd party components to the application

294965
postgresql	mysql
for both the questions mysql or postgresql is preferred as the database

294978
int	double
if you assign an int to a double there s no loss of precision because double is wider

294978
int	double
this is why you can assign an int to a double but going the other way you have to do an explicit cast - double to int is a narrowing conversion with potential loss of precision

295023
ostringstream	std
use c++ std string and ostringstream - but you ll lose the printf format you ll have to use the operator

295043
vsto	add-in
i m developing a powerpoint c# vsto add-in

295063
hide	show
or should i have one control and multiple panels which i show hide

1 em is the width of the letter m 1 ex the height of the letter x -- obviously also inherited

295094
sorting	filtering
is there any known pattern algorithm on how to perform sorting or filtering a list of records from database in the correct way

295094
sorting	filtering
my current attempt involves usage of a form that provides some filtering and sorting options and then append these criteria and sorting algorithm to my existing sql

295165
pop-up	dialog
if i lock cell in excel it becomes read-only - user can not even try to enter anything to this cell - excel pop-up warning dialog in this case

my facebook application contains javascript that works in firefox and ie but aborts in google-chrome

295248
integer	unsigned
java has no unsigned integer types

295252
wmi	managementeventwatcher
try looking into monitoring wmi events you should be able to create a wql event query that monitors the day of week change managementeventwatcher etc and then setup an event handler that fires when the event arrives

295367
realloc	malloc
modern operating systems will allow for running processes to request more memory - for instance in c you can use alloc malloc realloc or similar to request chunks of memory

295380
getter	setter
properties support asymmetric access you can have either a getter and a setter or just one of the two

295380
getter	setter
similarly properties support individual accessibility for getter setter

295457
cvs	svn	cvs	rcs
i think your confusion is rcs in comparison to cvs subversion rcs blocks a file for all others while editing svn doesn t block anything normally

295524
put	get
a wiki for internal use to get popular it will need the ability to put in screenshots easily without bothering with save screenshot to file - upload file - put complicated markup on page to display image

295534
hash	md5
if you re more paranoid than that concatenate two hash for a longer one such as md5 and sha-256

295557
webclient	webrequest
edit after a long time using webrequest i found out about customizing webclient

295564
stdout	stderr
at this point the process has stdin stdout stderr from its parent plus a file that will be a s stdout and b s stdin

295576
sqldatasource	linqdatasource
the sqldatasource class has a select method so that it can be triggered programmatically in page_load but the linqdatasource does not have this method

295578
hide	show
is there a control like system.windows.controls.groupbox that can hide its contents and show only the name and an expander button

295590
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division	division	multiplication
this should be faster because it reduces the number of division operations done in naive square rooting down to a simple divide by 2 actually a multiplying operation and replace it with a few fixed number of multiplication operations instead

295609
getter	setter
c# has automatic properties which are incredibly convenient and they also help to keep your code cleaner at least when you don t have custom logic in your getter and setter

295625
hide	show
you can render out those rows you want to insert and the + show them and hide them

295707
post	get
as a first port of call i would use a social bookmarking network site such as delicious to get a list of popular tagged post and sites

295710
post	get
if i can get it working i will post a proof of concept

295737
rar	zip
try opening it in any archive extractors you have zip 7z rar gz tar etc. to see if it s just a renamed file format .pk3 is something like that

295780
pywikipedia	mediawiki
as far as i can see in description of mediawiki page table you might be able to find and rename duplicate pages directly in sql but pywikipedia should work too but you ll need to delete redirects that will result from correct page moves otherwise they ll mess up with imported pages from the other wiki

295795
terminate	timeout
i ve seen in the past that the psi project server interface within microsoft project didn t override the timeout and so the default of 100 seconds was applied and would terminate anything talking to it for longer than that time

295871
rar	zip
zip itself and rar aswell are a combination of the two processes

296011
rar	zip
it is also why zip files are extremely prevalent on windows because support is built in regardless of the superior routines in rar or 7z

296019
rss	feed
an rss feed of the last 15 errors from the log

296057
kde	gnome
first you should decide if you are going to be managing the system using gui tools gnome or kde or if you will be accessing mainly from ssh using a command line

296057
ubuntu	debian
from a gui perspective i typically have the terminal cli running anyway from a debian ubuntu perspective

296057
vim	kate	vim	gedit	gedit	nano	kde	gnome	kate	gedit	kate	kde	kate	gnome	kate	nano
text editors gedit gui - gnome kate gui - kde vim cli or nano cli

296057
centos	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos
i would recommend going with a linux distro that has a friendly community ubuntu centos debranded free rhel or rhel you pay them to help you

296060
getattr	setattr
to handle fully qualified names like post.id you could use something like the below functions in place of getattr setattr

296084
post	get
i was afraid i d get no replies for my post happy to be wrong

296116
post	get
restful web services are in general read-only from the view of the client although you could write code which could use post or get to make changes on the server passing an encrypted token for security

296170
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
in terms of .net tools like wsdl.exe will give you a full client-side proxy library to represent a soap service or svcutil.exe for a wcf service

296208
filtering	grouping
for example you can filtering on the content type id of sharepoint grouping which is 0x010b

296216
prng	random
the safest assumption to work on is that your implementation of securerandom is simply a cryptographically-secure prng and therefore that your keys are no more secure than the random seed that you use

296229
hide	show
the js we use manipulates the dom to show hide divs and perform incremental searching for a combobox selecting from a table

296304
clang	llvm
clang a c language family frontend for llvm

296304
yacc	bison
alternately you could write your own using lex and yacc or their kin- flex and bison using a public lex specification and a yacc grammar

296305
fgetc	fread
even though the c standard specifies that fread and fwrite be implemented in terms of fgetc and fputc remember that the standard came into existence long after c was defined by k r and that things specified in the standard might not have been in the original designers ideas

296325
getter	setter
basically what i d like to do is to use entities if they were in my context cat getter setter etc so like normal pojos

296352
margin	height
i assigned the spacer rows a css class of their own and defined a height for that class that acted as a top and bottom margin for that group of table rows

296397
kde	gnome
this library is quite popular and used by abiword gnome and kword kde wvware

296438
windows	winpe
i have an mfc app running in winpe windows preinstallation environment and i m trying to make a method call with a 64-bit value in a ulonglong as a parameter

296484
iprincipal	iidentity
the last line of your question is probably the quickest solution however i don t think you need to create the interface httpcontext.current.user is already an iprincipal and httpcontext.current.user.identity is already an iidentity

296497
keydown	keyup
when hiding on keydown or keypress the other application that becomes active after my window hides itself receives the keyup event for that keystroke

296497
keydown	keyup
for example tweetdeck sends the message currently being edited on enter keyup even if it did not receive keydown keypress

296497
keydown	keyup
if i try to create an history of matching keydown keyup i m over-complicating my code modifiers generate their own key up

296594
children	parent
groupboxes are not supposed to have any children and using them as parent will cause all kinds of errors including painting keyboard navigation and message propagation

296603
mutt	thunderbird
i d be grateful to hear how to do this in other email clients thunderbird outlook evolution mutt etc

296615
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

it still requires xml configuration but have a look at mybatis formerly ibatis

296719
accessor	properties
regardless of whether the point is stored as x y or r theta i would still want accessor for all four properties

296728
ant	cruisecontrol
i ve initially been looking at using cruisecontrol with ant

296744
opera	firefox
it is correctly shown in firefox opera ie6 but it looks ugly in ie7 see this page here

296777
accessor	properties
under the hood the get and set accessor in a properties are simply converted to get_mypropertyname and set_mypropertyname methods

296784
getter	setter
in smalltalk the convention is blarg for getter and blarg for setter

296784
getter	setter
you mention cases where you don t have both getter and setter

296821
idictionary	ilist
like ilist idictionary sometype myvar list idictionary sometype would not loose much if you write var at the left side of the assignment

296843
accessor	properties
for languages that have a native concept of properties which java does not you should use a properties when the accessor get or set does not have side effects is relative performant not long-running returns the same value for each call or does not depend on other properties contextual dependencies

296845
temp	tmp
rails is likely writing it s tempfiles to the global temp directory which everyone can write to but the plugins are probably trying to write to rails_root tmp which your server disallows

296855
ant	cruisecontrol	nant	cruisecontrol
in addition to ant cruisecontrol also supports nant and exec

296912
xfs	ntfs
ntfs xfs jfs ext3 and reiserfs all do just to name a few

296956
vbscript	jscript
vbscript cscript jscript very powerful when combined with wmi

296965

hide	show
i want to show all twenty then hide only the ones that don t relate to what i m working on

297101
nsdata	nserror
to my surprise instead of returning nil and setting the nserror the persistent store coordinator raised an uncaught exception from the underlying nsdata

297123
dictionary	map
in terms of java both the class hashmap and the class dictionary are implementations of the map abstract data type

297123
dictionary	map
abstract data types are not specific to any one programming language and the map adt can also be known as a hash or a dictionary or an associative array others at

297193
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization is very fast too

297202
hide	show
the previous next buttons would essentially hide show the div in each step of the process

297218
width	height
the width does not have to be the same power of 2 as height

297218
width	height
textures newer hw can have them any width and height or is this a lie

297263
width	height
width and height can have arbitrary

297269
postgresql	mysql
i am using postgresql sqllight and mysql but would be interested in how tools for other databases platforms work

297303
ioexception	printwriter
some days ago i realized that printwriter as well as printstream never throw an ioexception when writing flushing or closing

297326
post	get
during the get i want to send back the html but during the post i send back some xml over the wire

297335
put	get
i ve got some code that will generically get all controls in a form and put them in a list

297355
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
i wrote a case-insensitive version of char_traits for use with std basic_string in order to generate a std string that is not case-sensitive when doing comparisons searches etc using the built-in std basic_string member functions

297368
installation	upgrade
but i ve been told some sql server dba s are going to upgrade the os of a ss2000 installation to 64bit to get 64k pages in the fs

hide	show
below that there is a series of check boxes type_of_request for new accounts delete accounts new software etc which show hide those form elements as they are checked unchecked

297581
versioning	upgrade
if i understand correctly you basically want a setup.exe that will detect the current versioning of the pre-requisites on the target system install them if they re missing and upgrade them if they re out of date

297581
uninstall	upgrade
also i haven t been able to find a way to uninstall an installed component if the msi can t do an upgrade something else i ve run into

297651
decoder	encoder
you need to implement your own png encoder decoder that works on an byte array containing the image information

297793
google-chrome	firefox
my pages all validate and they look correct on firefox and mostly correct on google-chrome

297823
post	get
from the server s perspective an ajax request is not very different from normal get post request - just some extra headers added on in the request

297825
put	get
since you are only dealing with int s it wouldn t hurt to put some type checking in your assignments otherwise you ll get sql errors if a string slips in somehow

297850
fgets	fgetc
i have also tried various methods of fgetc and fgets and printing backspace characters to hide the input since this works in other languages

297899
portrait	landscape
if my new document is in portrait the full content appears but if the new document is also landscape the content is cropped

297900
rss	feed
so to that end my best advice is to just load up your rss reader with feed from people who are working in the technologies that you are interested in

297936
versioning	upgrade
this may be named pipes or tcp ip mdac versioning upgrade vs install etc

297952
rss	feed
the motivation i am trying to use feed43 to create an rss feed from the non-rss-enabled highlearn website remote learning website
