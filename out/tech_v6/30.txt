2300601
lambda	first-class-functions
the representation of closures or whether first-class-functions are handled by some other technique such as lambda lifting or defunctionalization is largely orthogonal to the handling of known vs unknown calls

2300605
free	malloc
every malloc call should eventually have a matching free call

i understand that this custom manager instance is overriding the superclass get_query_set method but why is the super call passing in both dahlbookmanager as well as self

2300743
rss	feed
i want to serve an rss feed for each

2300769
punctuation	words
however instead of losing the words boundaries i suggest you ignore punctuation characters in the search expression and construct the regex so as to match one or more tokens at a time

post	get
how best to get an array item value pair as a get post parameter

2300908
width	height
check your css for overriding styles for width and height such as

2300908
width	height
you have an overriding height width set for a parent element somewhere

2300908
width	height
parent element css can override image width and height set in html but not if it is set this way

2300926
comparator	icomparer
in modern c# 3.0 and higher i think you can pass a method name to sort rather than explicitly creating an comparator or icomparer

2300934
free	malloc
it is a function you can set a breakpoint on to debug a malloc free bug in your program

2300942

x86	64bit
even though the x86 registers on a modern intel or amd processor are 64bit wide

2301044
post	get
remember to use get if it will only fetch the data and use post if the request will change something add edit delete login etc

2301045
spaces	delimiter
if you really want to get the first n words and you define words as delimiter by spaces you could still do it in the query as follows

2301056
spaces	delimiter
in particular this will return up to six words where we define a word as a set of characters that are not spaces delimiter by spaces

2301056
punctuation	words
note this will return punctuation attached to the last words which may or may not be desired

2301088
int	double
i have a case where i should get the elements from an array and i do not know if the type is double or int

2301089
mouse	keyboard
for some reason the mouse events especially movement are not passed correctly through the window when wm_paint is in progress and so it appears as though the mouse and the keyboard for that matter lag

2301089
mouse	keyboard
the fps is fine this is some api problem i suspect that for some reason the keyboard mouse messages are not handled as they should while the wm_paint is in progress because the slower the timer is set to the less jerking there is

2301102
verilog	hdl	verilog	vhdl
you likely used an hdl vhdl or verilog to implement your design

2301114
mouse	keyboard
i believe with the main message pump the mouse and keyboard messages are queued up and waiting for you to finish the prior wm_paint message

2301114
mouse	keyboard
maybe look at using directinput for mouse and keyboard input if this is an issue

2301134
oncreate	ondestroy
you are trying to call stop on a member mediaplayer object player in your ondestroy but in your oncreate you create a mediaplayer object player with your line of code

button	checkbox
how to use button checkbox and radio button

2301173
mouse	keyboard
wm_paint messages are never delivered to your window unless someone calls updatewindow or there are no keyboard or mouse messages in your input queue

2301173
mouse	keyboard
once you begin processing wm_paint if a keyboard or mouse message arrives it just sits in your queue until you are done with wm_paint

for public-key systems like rsa and dh dsa both used in openpgp e-mail encryption common key sizes are 1024-bit and larger these days early 2010

2301190
des	aes
whereas with symmetric ciphers like aes rc6 rc4 twofish des and triple-des these algorithms use a random key of a given bit length

2301190
rsa	aes
i hope that explains the general difference between the two types of crypto systems such as rsa and aes

2301218
invokelater	invokeandwait
and you may choose to issue a separate invokeandwait or possibly use invokelater for each block update

2301231
awt	swing
swing does not support multithreading so whenever you need to interact with it you need to do in from the awt event thread

2301266
msg	eml
granted the majority of the eml files i see are adherent to the msg format described in 5322 or 2322 or 822 however good ms stuck to the standards i don t know

please note that in firefox is working fine but in ie or google-chrome it is downloading the swf...if i comment response.redict ... the user remains on this page so the click button is working well only the redirect seems to be the problem

2301530
serializable	deserialization
in your case i would concentrate on the rpc asynchronous way and how will you transport data to the front end serializable deserialization

2301531
post	get
i ve read a few post here on stackoverflow about task scheduling but i m not sure that i get it right

2301544
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
while everything works fine in firefox ie8 opera google-chrome i m having problem with ie7 wrapping words inside block elements

2301553
implements	extends
i wonder if this is because the nexus indexer doesn t index a legacy repository in which case you can maybe implements or extends the indexer or if it s just a limitation

2301602
getter	setter
alternatively you could create a wrapper object called softwaremonkeycontext that has the specific setter getter methods as above and internally uses your genutil.uncheckedcast method

2301653
put	get
they ll then get the appropriate support put in place so that can happen

2301684
udp	tcp
the main difference between tcp and udp is as stated before that udp is connectionless

2301724
allocator	stl
you could try to create a memory mapped file and then create the stl map structure with a customer allocator

2301736
opera	safari
update opera mini and safari mobile definitely support it

2301737
pop-up	dialog
what i d like to do is use the same method that function uses for checking for errors on the fly and then if there s an error that would cause the dialog to pop-up simply pop-up a one-time notification and skip the calls on each file

2301782
x86	64bit
if the main assembly is set to x86 it will run as a 32-bit process on both a 32-bit and 64bit operating system and any attempts at loading assemblies flagged as x64 will fail

2301782
x86	64bit
likewise if the main assembly is set to x64 it will only run on 64bit operating system and any attempt at loading an assembly set to x86 will fail

2301782
x86	64bit
a msil main executable assembly will run as 32-bit on a 32-bit operating system like if it was set to x86 with the above failure point and as 64bit on a 64bit operating system like if it was set to x64 with the above failure point.

2301797
post	get
if you don t want to see the parameters in the query string use the post request instead get request

2301803
onclick	onchange
you should put an onchange event handler on the instead of many onclick event handlers on the s

2301846
cakephp	lithium
while refreshing myself on cakephp i learned that there is a new framework called lithium that is essentially what cakephp 3 was going to be

2301846
cakephp	lithium
i m trying to decide whether to use cakephp for my upcoming php project or to wait a bit for lithium to release a non-development version and try that out

2301851
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested the code in google-chrome and firefox and the result is the same

2301874

crossover	mutation
if the children produced via crossover mutation is an inverse ignore it and generate another child till it is a good child

2301901
width	height
could you try setting an explicit width and height in ems or pixels for the td

2301959
mp3	aiff	mp3	wav	wav	aiff
i don t think there are any libraries that will let you compress mp3s i presume you re talking about generating an mp3 from a wav aiff etc

2301976
min	max
if you think you are going to have a large number of requests why not just setup a pool with a min pool size set to say 25 arbitrary number here do not shoot and max pool size set to say 200

2301994
packets	pcap
then you ll have to parse the http in the captured packets and correlate http requests with its response and take the time difference which you ll get from the timestamps from pcap

2302014
pop-up	dialog
1 the pop-up dialog box doesnt seem to be set to be hidden at first and even though its been assembled it doesnt actually show up until the button is clicked - why is this

2302020
x86	64bit
first off setting platform target to x86 on your .exe project is a very useful when you are debugging your project on a 64bit version of windows

2302052
hide	show
the first step is to show the from that you will need to hide

2302065
google-chrome	firefox
however i discovered that while google-chrome and so presumably webkit allows you to select text within a readonly part of the contenteditable element firefox only allows you to treat the contenteditable as one big block and select it all at once

2302069
puts	gets
this is because the dc which contains the text gets processed with alphablend which also eventually puts it to the window s dc

2302076
uiview	subviews
i have a uitableviewcontroller subclass that has a container uiview which has 1 of 2 subviews the tableview or a uiscroll depending on whether or not the view is flipped

2302129
rss	feed
so i am grabbing rss feed via ajax

2302130
jobs	cron
works only if you have access to the server of course or can set up cron jobs with more liberal permissions than the php user

2302214
accessor	properties	width	height
yes this is standard it s because you re asking for the width and height in the constructor at which point the properties accessor settings are not established

2302240
simulink	labview
i m interested in creating a visual programming language which can aid non-programmers like children to write simple programs much like labview or simulink allows engineers to connect functional blocks together without the knowledge of how they are internally built

2302260
vmware	virtualbox
i found that ubuntu 3d graphics work out of the box in virtualbox 3 where vmware 7 doesn t support out of the box at least

2302260
vmware	virtualbox	vmware	esx	virtualbox	esx
because of compatibility with vmware infrastructure esx i would prefer vmware for headless server operations and virtualbox for anything that requires user interaction photoshop gui etc

2302260
vmware	virtualbox
also there are tons of features in vmware such as ace to lockdown virtual machines that just don t exist in virtualbox

2302262
mongodb	bson
with couchdb this means the use of json and with mongodb this means the use of bson

2302262
imperative	declarative
typcially querying follows an imperative mode of programming rather than the declarative style of sql

2302262
serializable	deserialization
just keep an eye-out for the serializable deserialization scenarios

2302284
config	ini
imagine a strategy whereby you might want parsers for several formats of config file say ini xml and yaml for example

2302434
width	height
the new window can be forced by setting the width and height of the new window but you must be aware that popup blockers can prevent this action

2302443
children	parent
the parent class is usercriteria which has a list of criteria as children

2302462
scrummaster	sprint
the scrummaster s role is to help and support the team not to question the team s way of working during a sprint

2302462
scrummaster	sprint
being dogmatic about your personal idea about how a sprint should look like internally is not something i would want a scrummaster to act like

2302462
scrummaster	sprint
it s their sprint after all and while i think it s perfectly fair for the scrummaster to mention concerns about the way the sprint is going he shouldn t force his idea of the best way to work on the team

2302493
haskell	ocaml
the program works fine and fast in haskell even when using foldl and not foldl but stack overflows in ocaml and f#

2302504
jsf	seam
struts2 and jsf with seam are a nice choices but i can t decide which s better

2302519
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchescancelled	touchesended
it overrides touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended and touchescancelled

2302519
touchesmoved	touchesended
there is another animation in the touchesended method that works just fine so i know that the animation part of things is working just not in touchesmoved

2302520
apache	nginx
at least for apache and nginx there is a module enabling you to use the x-sendfile http header

2302523
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

2302652
rss	feed
i am trying to write a simple google app engine website that reads an external rss feed

2302683
serializable	deserialization
also if you re planning to do some serializable deserialization on your data and would like to do it really fast check out google s protocol buffers python tooling available

2302684
mockito	jmock	jmock	powermockito
another option would be to use powermockito an extension to mockito or jmock which allows to mock stuff normally not mockable like static final private or constructor methods

2302739
portrait	landscape
as you see the code is running in reverse i mean the part the should run when i change the device to portrait the landscape part of the code runs and vice-versa

2302752
jdom	xerces
it seems that the workaround is to include a copy of the xerces jar in your application so that jdom doesn t try to load it from gae itself

2302808
put	get
from there it s easy to get the actual values of an instance s properties but you have to check to see if they are primitive types or objects so i was too lazy to put it in

2302808
inherited	properties
you could also choose to scan the inherited chain to get all the properties defined on an object

2302849
post	get
this all works just fine but i have this same code all over the controller for the get actionresult then the same thing in the post actionresult

2302880
put	get
short of moving up the inheritance chain and put the source code of those parent classes all in my project or writing the widget all from scratch without using the existing framework widgets that already solved the problem i can t find a way to get a vertical scrolling gallery

2302891
getter	setter
let mfoo be an instance variable that s a property that has been synthesized hence it has default setter and getter

2302925
accessor	properties
if you re accessing the properties from another class you should always use the accessor method or dot notation

2303017
uiview	subviews
if the uiview is not a subviews of the uitableview it will not pass it touches up the responder chain to the uitableview

2303017
uiview	subviews
to test this i suggest putting your uiview over make it a subviews of an ordinary view and get the responder chain to work like you wish

2303032
wav	ogg
firefox ogg wav

2303032
mp3	wav
safari mp3 wav

2303032
mp3	ogg
chrome ogg mp3

2303032
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
i basically need to encode in wav and ogg mp3

2303032
mp3	ogg
so i guess i should go for mp3 + ogg leaving opera and ie out

2303046
udp	tcp
for example various network services can be configured in etc services and a program like inetd listens on all of the tcp and udp sockets for incoming connections and datagrams

2303046
stdout	stderr
when a connection dg arrives it forks redirects stdin stdout and stderr to the socket using the dup2 system call and then execs the server process

2303046
udp	tcp
you ask why are tcp servers are typically concurrent while udp servers are typically iterative

2303090
put	get
one potential issue of overriding get_value_for_datastore that i think of is it might not get called before the object was put into datastore

2303093
ppl	tbb
this would bring it closer to more common c++ libraries tbb openmp ms ppl and tpl

2303117
public	protected
similarly the core android team had to make a decision as part of creating the initial sdk of how best to take the existing code and create public stuff we can work with and protected private stuff we cannot with sdk fidelity in mind

2303119
free	malloc
is there a one-liner that will free the memory that is being taken by all pointers you created using malloc s

2303122
cgpoint	cgrect
strictly speaking nspoints cgpoint nsrect cgrect nscolor uicolor and nsimage uiimage structs objects are all implementation ui elements that have nothing to do with the data model

2303122
cgpoint	cgrect
it should store all the nspoints cgpoint nsrect cgrect as strings or numbers

2303142
implements	extends
to the point just create a class which extends httpservlet implements the dopost method define the servlet in web.xml and let the action attribute of the html element point to an url which is covered by the url-pattern of the servlet mapping in the web.xml

2303147
opera	firefox
i have a greasemonkey script that works just fine in firefox and opera

2303147
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this allows me to have the same code for firefox and opera and google-chrome i thought

2303147
google-chrome	firefox
resolution i followed max s. advice and it works in both firefox and google-chrome now

2303149
free	malloc
note that when your program exit s all the memory you allocated with malloc is free

2303151
free	malloc
yes you can do that unless you write your own defintion of malloc and free

2303151
free	malloc
note both your custom methods will be calling malloc and free internally

2303181
subtract	add
when you add or subtract characters on a string it doesn t change the string it produces a new string that is the new result

2303181
subtract	add
when you add or subtract numbers from an integer it doesn t change the integer it produces a new integer that is the new result

2303181
subtract	add
and when you add or subtract a delegate from a delegate it doesn t change either delegate

2303238
svm	naivebayes
although not a specialized text mining framework weka has a number of classifiers usually employed in text mining tasks such as svm knn multinomial naivebayes among others

2303295
min	max
if i group the data by category i can aggregate sum count min max etc. based on any of the other columns

2303309
getter	setter
also when i place breakpoints in the getter and setter of the attached property they are never reached

2303309
getter	setter
the breakpoint in the getter and setter was also never reached yet throwing an exception in them did cause the application to terminate so i am thinking it s a framework eccentricity

2303310
postgresql	mysql
if you re just looking for a free sql database there are many sqlite as valentin suggested postgresql mysql firebird etc

2303331
maven-plugin	pom.xml
i ve created a maven-plugin my-code-generator which is used as described in the pom.xml excerpt below

2303395
mp3	ogg
you could then use ogg mp3 for the others and maybe get away with some simple flash for ie opera

2303420
mouseleave	mouseenter
using the jquery mouse events for mouseenter mouseleave or hover all work swimmingly on all mac or windows browsers except for ie8 windows

2303420
mouseleave	mouseenter
i am using mouseenter and mouseleave to test for hot rectangles absolutely positioned and dimensioned divs that have no content over an image used as hotspots to make visible the navigation buttons when different regions of the main enclosing rectangle image are touched by the cursor

2303420
mouseleave	mouseenter
windows ie jquery never sends notifications mouseenter our mouseleave as the cursor enters or exits one of the target div s

2303424
maven	m2e
i ve managing maven through eclipse with the m2e plugin

2303425
accessor	properties
when i write a properties i use _get_foo and _set_foo for the accessor and _foo for the attribute itself

2303446
accessor	properties
for instance if one uses the design pattern for a singleton often times accessor or properties are used and if the class is not initialized it is done from the accessor since the constructor is private

2303454
google-chrome	firefox
the header image appears correctly onlayed on top of the background color on firefox google-chrome and newer versions of ie

2303469
width	height
i miss defining a viewport with glviewport 0 0 width height

for a project at university i need to extend an existing c application which shall in the end run on a wide variety of commercial and non-commercial unix systems freebsd solaris aix etc.

2303576
dependency-resolution	packaging
by packaging them as another artifact declaring them as a dependency and calling the dependency-resolution api which is a lot more work

2303577
int	chars
if you need to detect it at runtime one method is to use a union of an int and a chars then set the chars to 1 and see what value the int has

2303585
for-loop	loops
mark byers below there is a simpler version of the code above and it has three if statement two before the else one inside a for each loops and another inside the for-loop i want the one at the foreach loops to pair up with the else statement

2303635
public	protected
because the signature includes internal types the method can t be public or protected

2303648
width	height
you can optionally set a width of the lightbox to restrict the width and let the height be automatic

2303668
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
viewdidappear and viewwillappear of vc3 is not fired either

2303672
int	chars
don t assume the current platform uses ebcdic chars and packed decimal int

2303690
width	height
image with image-rendering optimizequality set and scaled with width height

2303698
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the documentation states that viewwillappear and viewdidappear should be called on vc3 so i don t know why they are not

2303740
valgrind	memcheck
valgrind using both memcheck and exp-ptrcheck

2303744
opennlp	lingpipe
opennlp and lingpipe as posted by the other posters are also pretty decent

2303758
vim	gedit	gedit	nano
funnily enough i thought usual linux tools like nano gedit vim and whatnot would have capabilities for ansi color codes in a text file but it s very modest out there with info on ansi color in text files in these editors

2303784
setinterval	settimeout
there are setinterval settimeout methods but they are the same timers

2303788
getter	setter
you could protect the dumb class es further by creating an interface that does not expose the getter setter functions

2303802
put	get
this makes it easy to add new files to your project - you simply put them on disk and they will get compiled automatically

2303811
wav	ogg
i will settle for ogg or wav it s just for a little 2d game so it doesn t have to be super hi-fi quality just something the players can hear

2303822
button	checkbox
check out this jquery checkbox radio button plugin i think it does what you re looking for

2303933
google-chrome	firefox
incidentally ie handles this scenario more gracefully than either google-chrome or firefox

2303938
int	chars
one form i ve used is an array of int as big as the original string storing n chars deleted here values but there are a host of other possibilities

2303955
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari it works as it should

2303962
google-chrome	safari
same thing happens in safari and google-chrome

2303985
prepare	execute
and the statement + bound variables are execute on the mysql server -- without it re-doing the preparation each time the statement is execute which is why prepare statements can be good for performance when the same statement is execute several times

2303992
ferret	sphinx
my question why exactly is using mysql s full text search a bad idea compared to sphinx ferret solr etc.

2304020
haskell	scheme
in any functional language like clean haskell ml or scheme this kind of thing is very easy

2304020
free	malloc
in a language with explicit memory allocation new or even worse malloc and free such a solution would be very tedious

2304074
opennlp	maxent
i built a maximum entropy named entity recognizer for conll data using opennlp maxent for a course once

2304086
switching	screens
now if i press the home button and then switching to the home screens the activity will unbind from the service when i go back to the activity from the task manager then oncreate will not be called and if the code is trying to access a function from the service i will get a nullpointerexception

2304086
onresume	onpause
if i bind and unbind only in onresume and onpause i don t have this problem

2304092
prepare	execute
for prepare statements that are execute with the mysql_stmt_prepare and mysql_stmt_execute c api functions the server writes prepare and execute lines to the general query log so that you can tell when statements are prepare and execute

2304103
hash	md5
you can use md5 file_get_contents to download the file and calculate the md5 hash if your php installation is configured to open remote streams

2304113
unicode	ucs
unicode is always stored in some kind of unicode transformation format utf well or ucs but i never saw that used somewhere

2304152
apache	nginx
nginx doesn t support chunked requests so i m tryping to proxy my put request to apache but it seems nginx blocks and sends 411 error even when proxying

2304152
apache	nginx
any way i can get nginx to send those requests to apache untouched as is

2304156
firefox	safari
silverlight is supported on windows and mac os x in ie firefox and safari

2304185
client-side	server-side
silverlight is a client-side framework comparable perhaps only to adobe s flash while asp.net is a server-side framework

2304195
width	height
the height and width of an image object are fixed at the time the image object is constructed

2304210
onresume	onpause
in most cases you will want to register in onresume and unregister in onpause

2304210
oncreate	ondestroy
if you use oncreate and on ondestroy you will still be registering for updates when you are paused which is being a bad citizen

2304231
implements	sealed	implements	extends
extension methods imply that you are extends the sealed class with new functionality and not overriding the ones already implements

2304237
post	get
however in order to correctly implement prg as i understand it i would have to validate on postback determine there is an error then redirect the user to the same page but via get not post which would then eliminate any kind of scary message you are about to resubmit the contents of a form to the server which can have unintended consequences... etc if the user reloaded the page

2304271
post	get
it takes a string that contains the html document sent by the http server after a post request but fails to parse it properly - i only get like four nodes from the entire document

2304271
post	get
then everything works just fine - i get a proper dom tree but i need to somehow retrieve the post answer from server

2304320
post	get
so now onclick name should be passed as post variable instead of get

2304341
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
with that in mind in most object-oriented programming languages i m thinking objective-c but i know the same is true for java and others the parent class is called the superclass and any class which inherited from the super is called a subclassing

2304341
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
a subclassing inherited things like all instance variables and methods from its superclass thus it contains everything from the parent plus whatever is added in the subclassing

2304345
superclass	subclassing
the set of possible members of a superclass is a superset of the set of possible members of a subclassing of that superclass

2304349
move	drag
i am trying to set up a container that the user can drag items into and then move the items around within the container

2304349
draggable	droppable
i incorporated the answer from when i make a draggable clone and drop it in a droppable i cannot drag it again which works with one problem

2304369
hide	show
when the user leaves the real password field the script will see if it s empty and if so will hide the real field and show the fake one

2304381
superclass	subclassing
the properties and methods defined by a subclassing may extend beyond those provided by its superclass and in fact they often do but instances of the subclassing are still members of the set of instances of the superclass

2304381
superclass	subclassing
so in oop terms people would be a superclass and programmer would be a subclassing

2304381
superclass	subclassing
hence superclass and subclassing

2304402
jstl	taglib
it is to be used to as a template to write html css js in wherein you can dynamically control the flow with help of taglib like jstl and access backend data using el

2304402
implements	extends
just create a class which extends httpservlet implements the doget method accordingly with the espider stuff and finally forward to a jsp page to display the result register the servlet in web.xml and call it by url which covers its url-pattern in web.xml

2304407
integer	unsigned
it defines types like uint32_t an unsigned 32-bit integer

2304411
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing has all the members of its superclass and more

2304411
superclass	subclassing
if a class declaration is considered as a specification then the superclass specification is satisifed by more objects and the subclassing specification is satisfied by fewer objects

2304466
width	height
rather than send a width and height i would like to calculate the dimensions on the fly

2304466
width	height
that should work just great except the webbrowser control refuses to render therefore i can t get the client width and height

2304477
sendkeys	findwindow
i cheated a bit on the findwindow api call because i knew the window s title was and was somehow able to bring it to the foreground and using the inputsimulator to send the keystrokes to it...or use the traditional plain old sendkeys function...the reason i had the thread.sleep is to ensure that the keystrokes are sent in order to be pushed into the keyboard queue of the active foreground window which despite that is hidden

2304479
put	get
why not get an extra dns entry in and put sharepoint on its own host header

2304488
google-chrome	safari
if i point by browser google-chrome or safari on osx to this web site it shows all the svg perfectly

2304494
ubuntu	debian
any guidelines gotchas on how to go about creating installation packages for debian on ubuntu

2304530
rss	feed
btw something that i will probably change is i will skip querying certain folders to speed it up a bit journal deleted items junk e-mail drafts rss feed microsoft at home tasks notes contacts calendar sent items outbox

2304553
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
getelementsbyclassname is supported by google-chrome firefox 3+ as well as recent versions of opera and safari

2304580
comparator	comparable
the java documentation for comparable recommends that comparator be consistent with equals because of the behavior in sorted sets or sorted maps

2304580
comparator	comparable
i will implement the comparable interface and the comparator function to achieve this

2304580
equals	compareto
my question is is it ok in this case if player has a compareto that is not consistant with equals

2304580
comparator	comparable
i m going with implementing the comparator instead of comparable

2304583
min	max
in that control each column can be given a max min width

2304593
comparator	comparable
comparator has the advantage in that you can implement any number of them for different types of sorts rather than the single comparable

2304607
fadein	fadeout
because stop does not work with fadein and fadeout there is a funkyness with the arrows sticking around if you move the mouse pointer fast

2304607
fadein	fadeout
as i said there is still a fix -- get rid of fadein and fadeout and use animate so you can call stop

2304613
equals	compareto
it is not a good practice to implement equals and compareto that are inconsistent

2304628
equals	compareto
the requirement here is that 2 objects that are equals should also return 0 for compareto meaning that they occupy the same rank for sorting purposes

2304649
post	get
we use nsurlconnection to http post to and http get the data from a private web site

2304678
width	height
if the picture is horizontal the new size will be width width height proportional to width

2304678
width	height
and if the picture is vertical the new size will be height width width proportional to height

2304709
width	height
you say you just want to define the width but in the vertical case you set the height to be the width

2304732
integer	unsigned
i can specify an integer literal of type unsigned long as follows

2304747
fadein	fadeout
you can control the fadein and fadeout methods much more reliably

2304749
put	get
as such when i call for my function i get the following result this is only for breakfast since that s all i ve put in

2304756
integer	unsigned
integer constants are either int or long signed or unsigned and in c99 long long

2304767
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
don t use viewdidload use viewwillappear or viewdidappear depending on which looks better for you

2304768
viewdidload	viewdidappear
what if you try hiding it in viewdidappear instead of viewdidload

2304774
children	parent
and then in each of these method you would create a new object and just copy the values yourself and control how you want to handle children or parent objects correctly

2304794
oncreate	onstart	oncreate	ondestroy	onstart	ondestroy
i would generally recommend doing this in either oncreate ondestroy or onstart onstop depending on the semantics that you want

2304794
oncreate	ondestroy
if your activity wants to be interacting with the service the entire time it is running for example maybe it can retrieve some data from a network for you and will return the data when ready and you want to allow this to happen while in the background so if the user returns you will have the data ready then oncreate ondestroy is probably appropriate

2304794
onresume	onpause
i generally wouldn t recommend doing bind unbind in onresume and onpause

2304794
oncreate	onstart	oncreate	ondestroy	onresume	onpause	onstart	ondestroy
also these pairs oncreate ondestroy onstart onstop onpause onresume are intended to be the proper pairs for acquiring and then releasing resources such as binding to service s registering receivers etc to ensure that they are correctly acquired prior to being needed and released and not leaked when no longer needed

2304797
inherited	properties
here s what i am currently using to automatically print class variables in a library for eventual public release - it works by dumping all properties from the instance class all the way back up the inherited tree

2304843
hide	show
if i knew this i would know when to show the div and when to hide it

2304907
rss	feed
easy to see the errors via a readout rss feed etc

2304981
for-loop	loops
the last time through the while loops when only the initialization of the for-loop is executed so that when the while loops exits

2305035
mp3	wav
i encoded the problematic audio file to mp3 format from a wav file using lame on ubuntu

2305073
hide	show
dotfuscator hide your code and .net reflector show an error when you attempt to decompile it

2305078
portrait	landscape
i am trying to code for calling landscape screen from portrait screen

2305116
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has

2305134
invokerequired	begininvoke
following msdn article there are four methods on a control that are thread safe to call invoke begininvoke endinvoke and creategraphics and invokerequired property

2305202
spaces	delimiter
how can i read the file delimiter by spaces instead of newlines

2305202
spaces	delimiter
is there some way i can set the file file.txt .foreach method to use a spaces instead of newlines as a delimiter

2305218
post	get
i am almost at it but there is one last step i need to get it working sending an httprequest with the correct post data to a php page

2305260
pull	push
the latest changeset that is placed in a repository from a commit a pull or a push is called the tip

2305292
ienumerable	iqueryable
i believe you are confusing an iqueryable with an ienumerable

2305292
ienumerable	iqueryable
yes it s true that iqueryable can be treated as an ienumerable but they are not exactly the same thing

2305292
ienumerable	iqueryable
an iqueryable queries each time it s used while an ienumerable has no such implied reuse

2305299
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
i m using bass to extract samples from mp3 wav ogg etc files and add dsp effects like echo flanger etc

2305331
ant	maven
there are only really two choices ant or maven

2305332
ant	maven
and i find it less light because ant scripts grow ugly and unpredictable and become hard to manage while maven scripts stay simple because of the rich functionality provided with the tool

2305337
pop-up	dialog
the user would click on the control a file selection dialog would pop-up the user would select the file and then the upload process would initiate placing the photo somewhere on the page

2305345
ubuntu	linux
for this i recommend g++ on an linux distribution such as ubuntu

2305350
ant	maven
as said elsewhere your real choice is between maven or ant

2305350
ant	maven
to echo other sentiments i find there is more configuration to do with ant so i prefer maven

2305354
min	max
once you zoom out a bit the max value is always a positive integer and the min value is always a negative integer

2305354
min	max
so you need a function that scans the waveform data in chunks and keeps track of the accumulated max and min for that chunk

2305354
min	max
this is slow process so professional audio editors keep a pre-calculated table of min and max values at some fixed zoom ratio

2305354
min	max
its worthwhile to write code that handles all of the channels of the file in an single pass when doing this scanning slowness here will make your whole program feel sluggish it s the disk io that matters here the cpu has no trouble keeping up so straightforward c++ code is fine for building the min max tables but you don t want to go through the file more than once and you want to do it sequentially

2305354
min	max
once you have the min max tables keep them around

2305354
min	max
you want to go back to the disk as little as possible and many of the reasons for wanting to repaint your window will not require you to rescan your min max tables

2305354
min	max
then you draw the waveform by drawing a series of 1 pixel wide vertical lines between the max value and the min value for the time represented by that pixel

2305354
min	max
this should be quite fast if you are drawing from pre built min max tables

2305435
post	get
before passing the get post parameter to a type-specific filter with filter_var i do the following

2305548
width	height
i m trying to get a canvas element to take up the entirety of the document height and window width so that when i resize the window the canvas element stretches with it in effect giving me a full screen canvas

2305597
xfce	gnome
if you prefer gnome or xfce gtk qt can also use your gtk theme

2305597
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
a qt application can be perfectly integrated in windows xp vista 7 macos kde gnome and xfce desktops

2305672
jar	.war
so i want to include 2 jar files in my java web application .war file - to be loaded on glassfish version 2.1

2305678
quicksort	mergesort
resorting within the tree is mostly a matter of choosing an algorithm that gives good performance when operating on a linked list of blocks the leaf nodes minimising the need to use leaf nodes - variants of quicksort or mergesort seem like likely candidates

2305679
mouseleave	mouseenter
the above code is my current solution and its working hover doesn t seem to work because live is required again to remove the bold class thus i am using mouseenter and mouseleave

2305712
integer	unsigned
you should also be aware that assuming unsigned long long is a 64-bit integer type this code won t work correctly for n larger than if x or xx is greater than or equal to then will wrap modulo giving you the wrong value for

2305767
boost	stl
please tell maybe there s something in stl or boost for this

2305769
bazaar	git
generally from what i ve seen this suggests that a dvcs mercurial git bazaar et al might be the most appropriate solution - with the review step being the push to your central repository this resolves the conflict between commit often and review before commit

2305843
jar	manifest.mf
when you re ready to create your executable jar make sure you create a meta-inf manifest.mf file that points to your main class and adds these jars to its classpath

2305850
boost	stl
i don t think there s anything in the stl or boost that does this

2305865
children	parent
can someone shed some light on how it is that file descriptors created by the parent after the fork end up being shared with the children process

2305899
free	malloc
i m trying to free up the memory i ve allocated with malloc but the free command doesn t seem to do its job properly according to eclipse s debugger

2305924
inherited	properties
my model has just one properties but inherited from an abstract base class

2305927
firefox	safari
firefox and safari use the fragment in the location header

2305927
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
thus we seem to have consistent behavior for safari ie firefox google-chrome just tested in that the fragment from the location header gets used no matter what the original uri was

2305931
free	malloc
when you malloc some memory all it does is searching for some free space in memory and keeping track it is now used

2305946
boost	allocator
boost s reference mentions that this allows a factory to change the allocator scheme without the change affecting the user of the factory

2305981
ubuntu	debian
is this debian or ubuntu

2306005
ubuntu	linux
i am building on linux ubuntu 9.10 with gcc 4.4.1

2306009
set	bag
if it s something that s not a part of a persistent object then you can either just read the post values each time and set the viewstate again probably the best practice or if you need to persist that value across a redirect then use the tempdata bag which works much like session

2306019
system.in	system.out
even if you could drill down to the fd inside the stream objects associated with system.in or system.out i don t think that the java class libraries provide an api for turning the fd into a socket object

2306070
postgresql	mysql
personally i d stick to mysql but i never got on with postgresql

2306114
portrait	landscape
but if you want start your application in the portrait mode and then go to the landscape mode you can add a static boolean to know if you must stay in the landspace mode or not

2306130
rss	feed
i m looking for a php solution to easily traverse readonly xml files rss feed from websites

2306144
subtract	add
split the delta in half and add subtract

2306174
google-chrome	firefox
this page renders differently in firefox and google-chrome

2306174
opera	firefox
firefox opera internet explorer

2306174
google-chrome	firefox
firefox or google-chrome

2306190
swt	swing
where i m not so sure is if i should use swt or swing

2306190
swt	swing
so what are the arguments for and against each ui framework swing or swt

2306212
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
for example in my .h i define a class to conform to the uipickerviewdelegate and uipickerviewdatasource protocols

2306223
swt	swing
for your requirements it sounds like the bottom line will be to use swing since it is slightly easier to get started with and not as tightly integrated to the native platform as swt

2306239
awt	swing	swt	swing
i don t know swt too well to brag about it unlike swing and awt but here s the comparison done on swt swing awt

2306249
post	get
i m trying to get to the code that process a post so that i can copy it for my site and make some minor changes to how it s displayed on my site

2306275
awt	swing
heavy components native awt hide swing components not a problem most of the time as as use of heavy components is rather rare

2306275
awt	swing
supported by eclipse gui editor vep vep also supports swing and awt

2306275
awt	swing	swt	swing
has an integrated awt swt bridge to allow use of awt and swing components

2306282
ubuntu	linux
if you want to write graphical applications which work on linux similar to those in a default ubuntu install take a look at gtk

2306294
sudo	passwd
one problem is that sudo can prompt for a passwd

2306294
sudoers	passwd
either remove apache user s passwd but then don t run sshd telnetd ftpd etc... or see if your etc sudoers has a passwordless configuration

2306294
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
man sudoers about line 200 and again about line 270 says tag_spec can include nopasswd to specify that the user does not have to re-authenticate with their passwd to run a sudo command

2306329
bluetooth	usb
what is the best way using bonjour bluetooth or directly usb if it is possible

2306330
junit	jsunit
xunit error - couldn t split junit testsuites for the file tests jsunit logs jstest-1266764410175-0.xml into junit files with one testsuite

2306404
multiplying	add
the multiplying operation uses more clock cycles than the add on many processors

2306435
vim	emacs
vim and emacs are recommended

2306436
jlist	jtable
for this kind of thing you d normally use a jlist or jtable if you need custom rendering

2306457
sorting	filtering
this allows the outer select to filtering on row numbers after sorting and filtering

2306470
rss	feed
i m look at a way of turning an itunes podcast id into the rss feed that the podcast producer serves

2306470
rss	feed
i m aware of the rss generator which can be used to generate a feed of links to podcasts but these links are to html pages

2306481
tcplistener	tcpclient
tcplistener and tcpclient classes

2306499
swt	swing
the miglayout for both swing and swt and jgoodies forms tools are two of the best in my opinion

2306506
int	chars
int parsedata unsigned chars packet int len

2306506
int	chars
printdata chars mesg unsigned chars p int len

2306515
put	get
for a perfectionist person he she would start to learn as much as possible about language x so probably would run put of time and ot get it done

2306528
debian	linux
os debian linux 2.6.26-2-686 filesystem ext3

2306539
rss	feed
it different - reading books following some rss feed from the pros in the area watching attending conferences usergroups etc .

2306596
width	height
you must follow this by doing an if switch to format your page depending on what you want to do css styling s positoin absolute left top clamp the width height or you ll get the result of acid3 when it runs on ie anyone get that joke

2306616
free	malloc
there is a common sense way of doing this in the lines of c for every pair of malloc there is a free if there isn t there s a leak likewise the same for the globalalloc virtualalloc heapalloc localalloc virtualallocex ...there s an associated ...free pair with them for example running a heapalloc on variable foo for example and there is no heapfree for foo that is a leak.

2306618
textarea	textbox
is it posible to replace a character at a specific position within a textarea or textbox

2306745
getter	setter
by mistake maybe because they were typing to fast and just wanted to get the getter and setter out of the way

2306752
width	height
set the width height in inches

2306769
jsf	seam
there is a good choice of jsf seam books

2306788
getter	setter
also an average ide can autogenerate all getter setter in a few keystrokes clicks

2307070
width	height
to set an explicit height or width for an imported image set its height and width properties of the image control

2307070
width	height
setting the height or width property prevents the parent from resizing it

2307070

2307460
int	chars
i am then checking to make sure the chars is a number and storing it in an array of int although that will probably be changed to a short since i only need to be able to store 0-9

2307473
int	chars
first of all if you only need to store values from 0 to 9 you might as well store them in a chars which is just a small int type in c++

2307473
int	chars
since chars is a small int type in c++ you can also do math on it so you could just subtract 0 from each digit after verifying that it is a digit

2307551
free	malloc
if you didn t malloc it you can t free it

2307554
free	malloc

kde	gnome
there are gnome and kde which are built on top of gtk and qt respectively and have a larger amount of desktop integration usability and ram and cpu usage than pretty much any of the other alternatives - in particular people who try to use gnome and kde apps simultaneously will have a significant amount of redundant libraries doing the same things in incompatible ways in ways that often do not integrate between the two desktops loaded into ram

2308013
for-loop	loops
you could use a for-loop instead of a foreach loops

2308013

then there are algorithms based on discrete logarithm in the multiplicative group of numbers modulo a big prime diffie-hellman key exchange dsa signature el gamal encryption .

2308166
rsa	dsa	ecdsa	rsa
if factorization became easy thus scraping rsa and indirectly jeopardizing dsa and diffie-hellman then we would switch to ecdh and ecdsa

my program run on windows and linux on the moment ubuntu 9.10

2308303
division	exponent
so the second time you reach exponent is 0 and you have a division by 0

2308306

2308763
inherited	subclassing
admittedly i come from a java background and in java here i would set up an inherited heirarchy and then on each subclassing of feedentry extend the parse method so that each feedentry knew how to parse itself

2308784
bids	ssis
the second problem which i have seen in sql 2005 has to do with the fact that the runtime for ssis in bids is a 32bit process

2308784
bids	ssis
as mentioned above the root cause is that the runtime for ssis bids devenv.exe is a 32 bit process and many subsystems in that exe create their own private heaps that don t release memory xml oledb etc. see this response to a similar question

2308822

the plan and cost ends up being similar to two max min queries which is usually a great deal faster than even a single windowing query

2309251
rsa	aes
another approach might be to extend propertyplaceholderconfigurer and handle the aes or rsa encryption of the properties

2309251
rsa	aes
so in both approaches above you have to obtain the aes rsa key from another location possibly accessible only for the user under which your application server is started this has to do with os security

i also save data to preferences in onpause and load preferences in onresume

2309367
hide	show
problem is you are hiding and showing bitmap on mouseover so when you move mouseover bitmap mouse goes off panel onpanelmouseleave is called and you hide bitmap which means now mouse if over panel onpanelmouseover is called and in that event you again show bitmap and that means now mouse if over bitmap again and out of panel and hence you are stuck in a hide show circle

2309372
required	placeholder
sometimes i just set the required attributes and set the text etc. sometimes i have placeholder in the template and go something like

2309460

2309817
button	checkbox

rar	zip
zip rar 7z arj

2310388
public	protected
personally i think it would make more sense to just expand the meaning of interface to cover any contract whether internal private protected or external public but i suggested adding a whole new construct first because people seem to be very adamant about the meaning of the word interface and i didn t want semantics to become the focus of people s answers

2310399
hide	show
also you d better hide them from the start and show only elements with image loaded successfully

2310428
stdout	fflush
note that you will still have to wait for the sub-program to fflush its stdout buffer which is commonly buffered differently when not writing to a terminal window so you may not see each line instantaneously as the sub-program prints it this depends on various os details and details of the sub-program

2311191
postgresql	mysql
but we still have other scenario if you are going to distribute this application to other pcs so you have to think about deployment and in this case you can eliminate the mysql postgresql because they depend on servers but msde it s also server is much easier and you can found alot of tutorials how to deploy it with your project

richard stallman argued that this was very important for him that it was made default in emacs lisp even though stallman knew about lexical binding in scheme and common lisp

2311434
lisp	prolog
lisp allows to describe prolog terms with s-expressions and with a special compiler the prolog terms can be compiled to lisp code

redirect on server-side means client-side - server-side - client-side headers only - server-side - client-side

2311456
folder	directory
you can create just the same directory structure inside the other project by creating link folder

2311478

i don t think you need inherited from the linkbutton to just attach an id properties linkbutton has a properties called commandargument which you can utilize to store this id and sent it on postback

2311479
post	get
there is also a good example on devx which you can connect via http post and or get

2311491

in my experience every time i ve wanted to remove a properties from a class in an inherited class my class design was flawed

2311635

one way to solve this problem would be to create a new base class without the shipunit properties and then inherited that base class two times once for your concrete ship type and once for your concrete shipplacementarray type

2311636
qmenubar	qmainwindow
qmainwindow provides you convenience function to add and manage a qmenubar

2311636
qmainwindow	qwidget
with a window that inherits from qwidget instead of qmainwindow you need to achieve this by yourself

2311661
vtune	shark
we do a fair amount of profiling and have used shark osx only vtune glowcode and the old favourite of counters clocks

2311664
accessor	properties
the other way which i find much easier to read and to write is to implement array accessor methods for the array properties in your case the persons properties and exclusively use these accessor to mutate the array outside of init and dealloc

2311676
integer	unsigned
where the column like and dislike are unsigned integer

2311683

2311926
width	height
if you re simply trying to resize an image i d recommend setting width and height of the image with css

2311926

2312728
getter	setter
the accepted method is to use getter and setter

2312740
firefox	safari
only tested in safari so i can t say for sure if it will work in other browsers although i guess it won t be a problem in firefox

2313607
post	get
i ve tried setting a url option and tacking on a random number or timestamp but it winds up being attached to the post that submits the comment to the server rather than the get that returns the response and so has no effect

2313607
post	put
the trouble is that wp-comments-post is spitting back the entire page when a new comment is submitted and the only way i can see to add headers is to put them in the wordpress post template which disables caching on all post at all times--not quite the behavior i m looking for

2313692

goto	break
it d be better to replace goto step 32 with a break statement which exits a loop immediately

2315704
getter	setter
if you have an accepted convention such as the one used by java beans where each field needs a corresponding get and set method then you could loop over all of the first object s getter methods call them and pass the resulting values to the second object s setter methods

2315704
getter	setter
however this won t work for any fields that don t have the right getter and setter

2315705
subtraction	addition
i mean how they work in mathematics operations like addition and subtraction

2315740
google-chrome	firefox
this div will have a computed height of 104.5px in most recent google-chrome firefox and ie

2315740
margin	height
i used firebug to look at the divs and imgs and both imgs have 0 for margin padding and border yet the computed height somehow is 4.5px bigger in the first instance

2315743
versioning	upgrade
these days the preferred method would generally be â progressive enhancementâ include the basic html versioning on the page then have javascript replace upgrade it where it can

2315759
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
however encodedimage only supports png bmp jpg tiff and gif

2315775
inherited	subclassing
it does not alter the inherited contract and when done properly needs be done once only per subclassing that requires it for the runtime life of the application

2315807
nsmutablestring	nsstring
if all you re doing is looking to make sure your nsmutablestring is equivalent to another nsstring why not do something like

2315826
udp	tcp
socket connection is tcp or udp

2315847
udp	mtu
udp uses datagrams chunks of data which are received whole on the other side unless the size is bigger than the mtu but that s a different story

2315853
children	parent
for example you may save a parent with its children thinking it s cascading the save

2315853
children	parent
but in reality hibernate didn t save the children but cached the parent so you re looking at the un-saved children

2315906
onkeyup	onkeydown
so during my form s onkeydown onchar onkeyup i would need to pretend they are going to my windowless child control

2315906
google-chrome	firefox
mozilla firefox and google-chrome also use a widget library of controls

2315906
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know in what development environment firefox google-chrome or blender were created in but their widgets support windowless controls

2315906
width	height
unless i m mistaken it appears to me that although delphi supports a base tcontrol which has width height and can paint itself it cannot receive keyboard focus

2315909
jobs	cron
i d like to better document my jobs so i can easily identify them in gnome-schedule or similar cron wrapper

2315919
post	put
would have put this in comments to his post if i had the privs

implements	extends
an alternative to surfaceview would be to implements your own class that extends view and override ondraw canvas to draw whatever you like this is what me and my friends did

2315933
swt	swing
my solution was to change the shell on the pop-up box shell to an swt shell while keeping the children as swing components

2315948
put	get
that is the error message i get when i put my custom class player in the nsuserdefaults

2316024
gridview	listviewitem

arcgis	proj
i m completely new to arcgis and arcmap but someone suggested this program to me for a proj i m working on

2316153
ostream	istream
easiest to point at iostream which inherits from istream and ostream

2316153
cout	cin	ostream	istream
cin and cout are istream and ostream respectively but fstream derives from iostream

2316171
width	height
the only way you can make this work as far as i could figure out was to specify height and width

2316226
restrict	shared
is there a setting where i can restrict this filter getting shared

2316236
coldfusion	railo
i have several coldfusion sites on a win 2k3 iis6 server and i wanted to ease into railo

2316236

if you get stuck post code and i ll help you adapt it but it shouldn t be difficult at all

2316565
min	max
min and max length of the mobile numbers with or without country code

rss	feed
i need to somehow automatically update parse a couple of rss feed and place them into a mysql database almost as soon as the feed is updated or as close as possible

2316738
post	get
so i do my get post translation in the controller and then send raw data to the model for validation and processing

2316755
rss	feed
assuming you don t control the source of the rss feed doing it periodically via cron makes sense

2316772
rss	feed
if you do control the source of the rss feed have a look at the other observer pattern

2316830
try-catch	exception-handling
you would normally enclose a block of code in a single try-catch block if the code block should be executed as a block or not at all if some exception-handling occurs

2316830
try-catch	exception-handling
if it s not the case then i believe it is much better to isolate the different code blocks throwing different exception-handling into different try-catch blocks sandwitching do more stuff here that does not throw exception-handling

2316863
post	get
if you rely on javascript then no you don t need a since you ll probably bind the element to post a request with xhr but for accessibility purposes you should wrap it with a element to get it to work without javascript

2316910
put	get
to make things even more difficult it should work for put and get methods too

2316935
firefox	safari
i had the same problem and found that whilst i couldn t inspect hover objects in firefox with firebug safari s web inspector would freeze the current state and allow inspection

2316993
put	get
or i have to do it manually put just the internal repositories and which dependencies my build fails for those are external or there is a third way you think will get the results better

2316994
persistent	transient
if you don t want the attributes of the concrete classes to be persistent mark them all transient see persistent fields and or persistent properties

2317014
put	get
at the moment we deploy using visual studio and this creates a setup.exe that makes sure that both .net and the c++ redistributable get put on the target machine

2317014
put	get
if so surely i can just include those dlls in the msi and make sure they get put on the target machine

2317302
gridview	repeater
if the dropdownlist is within a repeater then to make the selectindexchanged event fire you need to disable enableviewstate on the gridview repeater

2317302
gridview	repeater
you also need to databind the gridview repeater on each postback so databind it in the page load method

2317315

2318082
width	height
if the width for rowdefinition height for columndefinition is omitted 1 is implied

2318098
inherited	properties	getter	setter
one more option is if you use the same connection in tons of places just make a control that inherited from sqldatasource and override the connectionstring properties set it only in that getter setter and just use that control everywhere instead

2318129
post	get
here s a link to a blog post to get you started

2318131
post	get
add a check to ensure that you are getting a post instead of a get before you attempt to allow updates

2318131
post	get
make sure that whatever is making the change does it via a post request rather than using url parameters and a get

2318145
post	get
now the servletcontainer most logically a decent and efficient implementation would process the http input stream immediately as it comes in so the parameters would be processed in the order as they appear in the request uri get or request body post

2318145
jboss	glassfish	websphere	ibm
i can at least tell from experience tomcat does it the right way so all major containers appservers which are built on top of tomcat catalina ibm websphere jboss sun glassfish etc will also behave so

2318160
overwrite	preserve
alternatively if you have no local branch changes you need to preserve you could just svn copy a.cpp from trunk and overwrite your local a.cpp

2318214
gmail	hotmail
essentially i need to check if the email contains hotmail yahoo gmail etc in the email field

2318258

how can i program the access restrictions so that on the front end the form control is restricted with a min and max date and in the backend the validator checks the entered date to make sure it falls between those dates

2318258
min	max
i d obviously need to be able to tweak the min and max dates for each user type

2318294
post	get
so basically i am not doing any post get or ajax calls that i can attach the unblock code to it

2318294

google-chrome	firefox
can anyone enlighten me as to why the following code won t work in ie7 but it works just fine in google-chrome firefox

2318787
firefox	safari
and unfortunately with a webview unless you do a bit of work you don t have all the great web debugging stuff that firefox or safari would have that would have made this problem easier to find

2318809
width	height
it may not be related but both viewperson and newview have a width and height of 0

2318823
width	height
just set its height and width so the aspect ratio matches that of your label and you should be good to go

2318861
g++	gcc
i am using g++ gcc version 3.3.3 on suse linux on a 64 bit linux machine and the error that i get is

2318911
min	max
question 1 is nicely answered by bentley davis by setting the min and max values of the x and y axes

2318911
min	max
if you do not set the interval the mschart will automatically do a best-fit interval between your declared min and max thus potentially changing the positioning of the gridlines and the labels

2318924
accessor	properties
i suggest as a troubleshooting step setting a breakpoint in projectionparameters at the line you mention and one on the rateruleids.get properties accessor

2318926
hide	show
the question is how do you hide show the images

2318926
hide	show
if you use the hide show methods to toggle the display property then you can use

2318970
children	parent
so when you select like a certain node you could grab all its parent and children from node_parents

2319001
kerberos	ntlm
the issue is that authentication is downgrading to ntlm from kerberos and i can t figure out why

2319001
kerberos	ntlm
this suggests that kerberos is failing and since the client won t allow ntlm the call results in an exception being thrown

2319001
kerberos	ntlm
but since ntlm is less secure than kerberos why isn t it the other way around

2319001
kerberos	ntlm
if i don t fully trust the server i use kerberos otherwise ntlm is fine

2319008
dictionary	map
can some one suggest how to map a case insensitive dictionary to nhibernate

2319025
width	height
any control placed inside of the grid will directly fill the whole grid and its size the width and height will match the size of the grid

2319044
pop-up	dialog
tortoiseplink has been modified to not read from the standard input but instead pop-up a dialog window if something goes wrong

2319044
pop-up	dialog
you ll have to invoke plink or putty manually then say yes and they will save it in the registry. tortoiseplink will instead pop-up a yes no dialog box

2319047
free	malloc
all i know is that i have to use malloc and later free in c and new delete in c++

2319088
folder	directory
well i found out that all the application does is create a network folder structure a parent directory with some sub directory within it

2319092
free	malloc
to understand malloc free and new delete you might read chapter

2319097
setinterval	settimeout
you can only achieve what you re trying to do with a settimeout or setinterval call increasing each step with a timer instead of a loop

2319109
implements	extends
however java s type system is perfectly capable of distinguishing between interfaces just try to extends one with a class abstract classes just try to instantiate one and classes just try to implements one and so are most ides

2319132
free	malloc
also keep in mind that if you allocate memory in c++ using malloc you have to use free to free it

2319161
portrait	landscape
i want change the view from portrait to landscape and vise versa depends upon device view position

2319173
superclass	subclassing
if i in code try to access the collection car.wheels i get an sql error because the where clause applies to the table of the subclassing wheel instead of its superclass carpart where the isdeleted property is actually defined

2319178
width	height
you want the a s to display in block mode so that your width and height declarations will properly take effect

2319235

it works fine on ie7 8 opera and google-chrome but does not work on firefox 3.5

2319244
children	parent
in my fluent nhibernate mapping for the parent i want to load the list of the children

2319249
free	malloc
the term dynamic allocation is normally used for memory and objects allocated from the heap and whose lifetime are determined by the programmer by new delete malloc free rather than the object s scope

2319268
cassini	iis
impersonation does not work the same as in iis see cassini considered harmful

2319317
folder	directory
creates a directory folder

2319347
disk	ram
i guess the problem is audio synthesis oscillators filters effects etc can be quite cpu intensive as opposed to sample playback which is more ram disk laden

2319381
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
older code in our application contains calls to malloc realloc and free

2319381
free	malloc
the problem is that we now have to include a 3rd party library which has classes that contain methods that have names like malloc and free

2319381
free	malloc
but even then if our code is required to call these malloc or free methods of the 3rd party classes the preprocessor will still alter the calls unless we write all calls like this

2319482
min	max
- the other which does a select min max from flat_file grouping by source into another temp file

2319482
range	max	range	min	min	max
is is possible in a a single stored procedure to retrieve all the rows from the file within a date range and also identify the min max values for each group retrieved

2319498
cassini	iis
the web.config has been updated the site runs well in cassini but my problem now is deploying on iis 6

2319571

2319588
hash	salt
i m creating hash passwords using salt sha1 in php

2319687
udp	mtu
i don t know about .net implementation specifically it might be buffering your data but udp datagram is normally limited by the link mtu which is 1500 on normal ethernet subtract 20 bytes for ip header and 8 bytes of udp header.

2319687
udp	tcp
udp is explicitly allowed to drop and reorder the datagrams and there s no flow control as in tcp

2319701
free	malloc
why don t you just define your own malloc and free functions instead of using macros

2319714
post	get
but you might be able to fake it by doing a post using something like system.net.webclient and then a redirect it depends on how the other site handles the get - it might display the same thing that it did on the post or not

2319745
onfocus	onblur
i used to have the onblur and onfocus events set on this text box to do some text swapping when the user clicked into it or out of it without typing anything

2319754

write a program that just reads the file then one that reads and writes the files then one that just hashes random blocks of ram remove the disk io part and see if any particular step is problematic

2319827
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
constructors are not inherited you must create a new identically prototyped constructor in the subclassing that maps to its matching constructor in the superclass

2319836
free	malloc
for free it is the case the standard free takes a void for malloc it isn t the standard malloc takes a size_t you are passing an int and size_t can t be a typedef for int -- size_t is unsigned

children	parent
the code below is as far as i got it but it is not dealing with multiple children of parent correctly

2319852
free	malloc
for your particular issue about malloc and free the problem is that in your call to malloc

2319853
hide	show
as long as you re keeping them within logical groups you can just move swap show hide the group s container like nsbox or an nsview

2319856
put	get
i have tried to fix this but i cant get the blog to interpret the code and put it out as the real dates and the time

2319862
mouseup	mousedown
is there a way to connect them not to mousedown but to mouseup event

2319864
rss	feed
ok so i m currently having a play around building an iphone web app in which it displays an rss feed

2319864
rss	feed
the rss feed is a full rss feed so the whole story is in the description

2319882
width	height
in a custom wpf control i would like to set the width of the control to be a function of the height

2319914
hide	show
i m looking to hide show properties depending on what selection the user makes in a drop

2319918
hide	show
rather than use the path to show parts of an object i want to use the clipping path to hide cut into an object

2319928
puts	gets
that gets all the information about the forthcoming data block and nicely puts us in the right position within the file the start of the data block

2319929
width	height
first make just to make sure that the outer canvas isnt getting autosized or something weird like that set it to a fixed width height

2319968
pdfsharp	itextsharp
you can use either pdfsharp or itextsharp to create annotations

2319968
pdfsharp	itextsharp
haven t tried pdfsharp annotation but itextsharp does work

2319983
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
i am developing an asp.net 3.5 web application in which i am allowing my users to upload either jpeg gif bmp or png images

2320018
width	height
in my case i needed to cut the height and width of the image by half

2320021
tcplistener	tcpclient
if you are writing a relatively simple application and do not require maximum performance consider using tcpclient tcplistener and udpclient

2320023
free	malloc
if it s available on your system you can use ld_preload to preload a .so library you build that has your versions of malloc and free

2320042
portrait	landscape
if i change the screen from portrait to landscape i can t see the tabs

2320072
portrait	landscape
when that is all said and done in portrait orientation android will use main.xml found in res layout and in landscape main.xml found in res layout-land

2320135
udp	tcp
udp is a connectionless protocol which has zero error-checking it is that is the trade-off with tcp it is faster than tcp

2320135
udp	tcp
think of udp as a fire-and-forget protocol in comparison to tcp where integrity and checksum is the additional overhead of the tcp over udp

2320139
range	percentile	range	median	median	percentile
you may be better served by using a percentile measure such as the median to represent the central tendency and a percentile range such as the iqr to measure certainty

2320140
lan	localhost
as developers we tend to see only the extra 10ms it takes to download the library over localhost or from our development server on a 100 mbit lan

2320140
google-chrome	safari
if they are using a 1-2 year old good computer with safari or google-chrome this would be negligible but if they re on ie ff2 or some versions of ff3 the difference can be severe or at least measurable

2320149
multicastdelegate	delegation
the highest abstraction below is multicastdelegate which seems unhelpful would need a non-generic predicate type under and identifying the presence of the generic parameter is also useless given the other generic delegation s that may be present in the list

2320185
next	except
the user can drop it everywhere except after the last child of any particular node it seems since it reads that position as being between the node and it s next sibling

2320224
inherited	subclassing
you can also create different handler subclassing if necessary--i m just saying don t forget that event handlers are classes you can use inherited and everything if need be

2320233
division	multiplication
these are special registers used to store the result of multiplication and division

2320248
hide	show
why not just set datatype to script with your .ajax call-- and have the php script that the .ajax method calls generate the appropriate javascript to insert remove show hide modify items on your page accordingly

2320265
int	chars
if the string value is most important then use something like the soundex algorithm to split the string into a single chars and a number and encode both into a word or int simple hash

2320309
gtk	gjs
seed and gjs are both gnome projects that bind the gtk and gnome libraries to javascript

2320390
width	height
since text is a control it inherits the method text.setsize width height

2320396
jobs	cron
we re trying to build a dashboard for our cron jobs ---- cf java sqlserver etc

2320404
int	double
the dynamic classes would only need simple fields string int double

2320425
versioning	upgrade
this process will eventually be sent to several other developers who already have eclipse same versioning that i m testing with and i d rather just do an in-place upgrade rather than have everyone go and install a new product

2320426
int	chars
in function int qmain int chars

2320428
width	height
pass width and height into the griddata constructor and set it to the textbox textbox.setlayoutdata along with the properties about how you want the layout manager to manipulate the field

2320450
qdialog	qwidget
you should inherit publically from qwidget or qdialog

2320516
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome for now on just windows from an external application process

2320523
queue	fifo
use the ccr it provides port primitives which are efficient fifo queue and dispatcher dispatcherqueues and arbiter primitives that allow you to control task scheduling

2320537
bcel	cglib	javassist	cglib	javassist	bcel
it is possible to generate classes via cglib asm javassist bcel but you shouldn t do it that way

2320556
google-chrome	firefox
then manually test in firefox and google-chrome for all progression testing

2320593
agile	metrics
you ll have an easier though maybe not easy time introducing agile if show how it aligns with those metrics better than existing practices

2320593
agile	metrics
project the changes in these metrics under an agile process for instance in most cases the sooner we find a bug the easier cheaper it is to fix so benefits from tdd and rapid releases to qa should be easy to quantify

2320597
hide	show
on elements that are nested in that way because inside of one element cannot hide behind itself while the rest of it show

2320599
division	subtract
sort your numbers in decreasing order find the first one less than your desired sum then subtract that from your sum division and remainders could speed this up

2320621
free	malloc
in the second case itâ s easier to forget the free as you donâ t see the malloc

2320626
awt	swing
i believe that all awt swing dimensions are pixels unless otherwise stated

2320657
short	base
in short does any know a way from the base controller to get a list of actionfilters being applied to the current executing action

2320700
entity-relationship	diagram
if you are modeling a database entity-relationship diagram are pretty universal to most people

2320709
width	height
you can set the button s height and width to zero

2320723
multiplying	add
just read in big chunks of data and reshape the data into an array that reflects the receiver channel sample structure and then use the appropriate indexing to multiplying and add things for pythagoras and the sum command to add up the terms in the resulting array

2320725
superclass	subclassing
in your case you create an anonymous subclassing of so type parameter is retained in the superclass declaration

2320728
children	parent
whatever the case i can t figure out how to access children of the parent in this mxml example

2320761
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine with firefox and google-chrome

2320772
squash	merge
git rebase -i forces me to merge and pick and squash

2320779
ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu linux become root and cd to sys bus usb devices usb1

2320790
folder	directory
the best place to put practice directory in the documents folder in the app directory

2320790
folder	directory
gives you the path to the directory folder which you can then hand off to the nsfilemanager

2320800
migrate	staging
assuming you eventually get to the point where you have multiple environments dev test staging prod you may want to migrate data from one to the other

2320803
fast-forward	merge
now merge to master it will be a fast-forward and tidy up the topic branch

2320805
equals	gethashcode
that ll simplify the equals and gethashcode methods nicely

2320835
stdout	stderr
if you want to execute a command and get both stderr and stdout not merged a solution would probably to use proc_open which provides a great level of control over the command that s being executed -- including a way to pipe stdin stdout stderr

2320835
stdout	stderr
and here is an example let s consider we have this shell-script in test.sh which writes to both stderr and stdout

2320841
kerberos	ntlm
this negotiation attempts to use kerberos but if that doesn t work it ll fall back and use the older ntlm protocol

2320845
versioning	upgrade
i once had this issue when my major upgrade didn t contain or remove a file from the previous versioning

2320906
google-chrome	firefox
it looked great in google-chrome drop down under the second menu item in ie7 the drop down was under the third menu item and in firefox it was under the first menu item

2320924
mouseout	mouseleave
this is one of the problems with mouseout vs mouseleave

2320924
mouseout	mouseleave
mouseout fires when you move into a child element whereas mouseleave only fires when you move off the element and all child elements

2320925
vmware	virtualbox
is there some method to take those environments and port them to something usable by either vmware workstation or sun virtualbox

2320958
emacs	aquamacs
most people use emacs aquamacs + slime vimclojure or some java ide with a clojure plugin for stuff like that

2320966
post	get
all the php library does is make curl post and get calls to facebook s rest server

2321043
post	get
in asp.net mvc i need to use 2 separate functions for get and for post so i need to initialize the same data twice and i don t like to repeat something in my code

2321080
action-filter	onactionexecuting
you can create an action-filter and implement onactionexecuting

2321096
mp3	wav
the only problem that i see is that you are using an mp3 format and this uses a wav so you will need to convert the file first

2321161
google-chrome	firefox
p.s i have tested this code works in firefox google-chrome and ie6

2321210
put	get
i know the .each method works as i m able to put alert item.title and get the expected result

2321232
free	malloc
additionally i try to add the code to delete destroy free as soon as i add the code to create init malloc

2321329
qobject	qwidget
here is an explanation of the setproperty method in qobject from which qwidget inherits

2321331
clang	llvm
update feb 17 2012 as of xcode 4.0 with llvm 3.0 clang has supported objective-c++

2321341
post	get
i learned how to get a scrollviewer s scrollbars to display after scaling an element within in a scrollviewer from this post

2321354
uiview	subviews
so as you can see above i have set the uiview and set the uiimageview and assigned a uiimage to that uiimageview and then added it to a subviews of the view

2321357
post	get
the problem is that the page post back to missing the views part of the path which is a non-existent page so i get a page not found 404 error

2321363
cassini	iis
i have an asp.net application in vs2008 that is growing larger and am developing and testing on iis7 not cassini iis dev so when i make changes i publish run and test

2321364
width	height
edit width and height set the viewbox attribute on the main svg element to the rectangle you want render repeat

2321415
jobs	cron
you could use appengine cron jobs to put a job on a task queue to compute the numbers for the report

2321452
isnull	nullif
this was done using nullif and isnull in the view design.

2321472
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tested my site in different browsers now ie firefox safari google-chrome and so far sifr works fine

2321499
nsscanner	nsstring
you can use nsscanner if your hex number is in an nsstring

2321523
rss	feed
if i have a rss feed then how would i parse it in order that i get each of the item titles seperately which can then be inserted into a web page

2321572
folder	directory
a cgi-bin folder was automatically created in the directory for clothing.mysite.com

2321574
daemons	systemd
i m writing a linux daemons and for now it works pretty well but it leaks memory and it s bad - after a few hours it segfaults after using 60 of the systemd s memory

2321633
put	get
one problem with locals or vars is that it will let you put stuff in the namespace that you can t get out of the namespace by normal means

2321645
integer	unsigned
for b it s because integer primary key is the same as integer unsigned primary key

2321688
asterisk	pbx
take a look at asterisk pbx project and asterisk java integration project

2321706
public	protected
that said i think in c++ which again supports private and protected inheritance it s possible to cast the child class up to parent and get access to parent s public members

2321713
boost	stl
previously the code only used stl and boost but i recently had to include so i could look-up csidl_local_appdata

2321763
rss	feed
geoplanit required an appid so i haven t tried this yet and yahoo weather is an rss feed

2321769
daemons	systemd
then run your program until it crash and make sure that the systemd generates a core file use ulimit -c unlimited to allow the creation of a core file be careful if it s a daemons it must be done for the user that actually run the daemons

2321791
integer	unsigned
the size and sign of integer types must be the same. mysql s numeric data types are signed by default so you would have to explicitly specify the unsigned attribute

2321799
webclient	ftpwebrequest
don t waste time to try the webclient class it will give you even less flexibility than ftpwebrequest

2321857
inherited	properties
i find that generics facilitate composition through generic properties without having to write different classes for each composition you want to leverage or having to create a lengthy inherited tree

2321857
children	parent
class parent tchild ilist tchild children

2321880
cout	cin
i can use cout but cannot find examples of how to use cin within a qt console application

2321887
opera	firefox
this is especially odd because in other pages in ie the code works as expected and it works every time in firefox opera and webkit

2321901
maven	m2e
also you may want to look into using the m2e plugin if you are doing maven development with eclipse

2321914
keydown	keyup
shift doesn t trigger keydown and keyup which would have been ideal

2321916
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
so when something happens in your second tab where the uinavigationcontroller lives you will push a uiviewcontroller onto the stack

2321918
firefox	safari
you can create an npapi plug-in which will work in safari firefox and other mac web browsers

2321932
hide	show
i have little piece of javascript to show hide divs based on which link is clicked in a list

2321955
addclass	removeclass
if you re able to use jquery or something similar as it has this ability built in - addclass removeclass

2322007
nfa	dfa
you then step through all of those and follow some fairly simple rules to collect sets of nfa states together to become a state in the dfa

2322007
nfa	dfa
the rules are simple enough that it s pretty easy to program them into a computer but you have to repeat them for every cell in the nfa table and do essentially perfect book-keeping to produce a dfa that works correctly

2322026
ant	maven
as others have posted ant and maven are pretty much the de facto project spec utilities in the java world

2322059
ksort	asort
if you change to then you can use ksort where you tried to use asort

2322087
postgresql	mysql
so far the best way i ve found is to first load the xsd into an rdbms like postgresql or mysql and then have rails connect to do a rake db schema dump

2322091
swt	swing
performance is comparable to swt swing is not slow

2322091
swt	swing
but at the bottom line i wouldn t suggest to use pure swing or swt

2322091
swt	swing
there are several application frameworks for swing swt out

2322091
swt	swing
the biggest players are netbeans swing and eclipse swt

2322137
gmail	hotmail
i can t reproduce this bug with any of my email clients gmail yahoo mail hotmail thunderbird blackberry or iphone

2322167
google-chrome	firefox
i m using jquery 1.4.2 firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 4.0.249.89

2322207
getter	setter
the end result is a property that is publicly readonly while being readwrite within the implementation and for whom both setter and getter are synthesized automatically by the compiler

2322221
freebsd	linux
i am trying to build an application for freebsd which links to a shared object share.so built on linux

2322221
freebsd	linux
i also have freebsd linux compatible libraries under usr compat linux lib

2322262
maven	pom.xml
if a developer that uses eclipse edits the dependencies in the maven project files pom.xml files then idea can import the files and change it s project settings

2322262
ant	maven	imperative	declarative
re ant vs maven - in this respect syncing project settings ant build files won t work because they are imperative script-like rather than declarative

2322265
button	checkbox
when your go button is clicked use javascript to get the values of all the checked checkbox

2322325
mouseover	mouseenter
i have tried using the events mouseover and mouseenter but both of these only animate one time when the mouse is positioned over the button

2322369
jar	war
an additional step needed for jboss 4.2.1.ga is to remove any log4j jar files from the war

2322369
jar	war
if this jar is included in your war the sql.log file is never written to

2322369
maven	pom.xml
example maven pom.xml entry

2322377
console.readline	console.writeline
you can use console.writeline console.readline ..for the purpose.both are in system namespace

2322388
folder	directory
somewhere in each of those directory will be a class template folder

2322388
post	get
if you get it to work post the correct c++ paths back here and i ll update this answer to reference them

2322428
int	chars	int	double
only the types chars short int long long long float double long double _bool void and with _complex will be examined

2322437
profiling	instrumentation
my profiling is showing me that the sqlalchemy instrumentation is taking a lot of time in this use case

2322483
post	put
or even put the breakpoint before the post so you can step through the view

2322492
int	double
in practice though you can expect that long long int is the biggest integral type and long double is the biggest floating point type

2322510
backslash	double-quotes
as you are having double-quotes in a double-quoted string you have to escape the double-quotes inside the string using a backslash

2322513
post	get
you need to sanitize your inputs before dropping post or get data into an sql string

2322515
getter	setter
i can do it without a setter and a getter but i want to know the correct way to approach this

2322515
getter	setter
should i just set the property directly or use a setter and a getter

2322522
width	height
use one of the drawimage methods where you can provide the required width and height of the drawing area

2322536
cout	cin
the first point is to make sure operator overloading is a little less messy than in c++ debatable but it surely makes things a lot simpler and the second point was specifically chosen to rule out c++ s cin and cout way of dealing with io iirc

2322537
getter	setter
a reason to use an setter getter in that kind of situation would be if you want to ensure that some condition or calculation is made on the data each time the property is set

2322537
getter	setter
as a sidenote of course if your want to access your private property from outside the class you ll have to use to public setter getter -- but it doesn t seem to be what you are trying to do here

2322543
ant	maven
maven should be the preferred way but most ide s now days support some kind of ant based project which is what most of the ides use internally

2322545
tabcontrol	tabitem
inside the window is a tabcontrol with three tabitem

2322549
getter	setter
don t forget that you can use the magic __get __set methods without having to create getter and setter for everything

2322549
getter	setter
edit if the member variables are private or protected you will have to use a getter and setter

2322576
peer	p2p
otoh your response to the above comment seems to imply that you might have some p2p elements in which case http will probably not serve unless you incorporate a little bit of network traversal and proxying to expose the peer as public addresses to each other

2322581
opera	firefox
i know how to include ie specific style sheets using conditional comments but what about firefox opera and webkit

2322584
int	chars	int	double
the native types for c are chars int float double and void

2322584
range	minimum
the c standard defines the minimum range for these types and defines a few relative relationships long int must be at least as long as a regular int etc

2322590
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
there are no conditional comments for firefox opera and safari

2322592
google-chrome	firefox
update looks like this works in both firefox and google-chrome

2322595
ant	maven
i d recommend ant long before maven

2322665
getter	setter
setter getter allow derived classes to modify limit enhance state and behavior of an object more easily

2322665
getter	setter
but you can over-do setter getter and then they become a bit annoying

2322677
hbase	hypertable	voldemort	memcachedb
update and twitter s selected cassandra over several others including hbase voldemort mongodb memcachedb redis and hypertable

2322694
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
the advantage of this low-level approach is that with just wait pulse and the lock statement you can achieve the functionality of autoresetevent manualresetevent and semaphore as well as waithandle s static methods waitall and waitany

2322712
post	get
you only need separate methods for get and post if their method signatures differ there s no reason why one action method can t handle get and post methods

2322712
post	get
if you need to know whether it was a get or post you could check using request.httpmethod in your action but i would advise using a separate method decorated with the acceptverbs httpverbs.post attribute as suggested by the other posters

2322724
rss	feed
i m using the nsxmlparser class to parse an rss feed

2322726
pop-up	dialog
if a try to browse any page it pop-up the username and password dialog box and even though i entered a valid user including the domain administrator it doesn t log on into the app

2322732
sorting	filtering
there is an msdn article entitled selecting rows randomly from a large table that talks about this exact problem and shows a solution using no sorting but instead using a where clause on a generated column to filtering the rows

2322749
folder	directory
one directory folder per concept is a good idea

2322776
apache	nginx
check out the nginx upload module i m sure apache has the same thing

2322782
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome opera it works fine

2322839
for-loop	loops
unlike a regular for-loop a foreach loops will only use the collection once to call getenumerator

2322858
required	placeholder
stfail is the exception and only required 1+ arguments. the last required argument is always an optional format string for a description and any other parameters are used to substitute in those placeholder just like you d do with printf or nslog

2322893
waitpid	fork
see the perldocs for fork wait and waitpid and also the examples in this so thread

2322905
for-loop	loops
but there are a lot of things that go wrong here -- you have to do this on an enter_frame loops instead of a for-loop otherwise you just get the 2nd frame totalframes times you have to have the right security settings to be able to use the draw function if your clip has weird registration points the bitmaps will clip.

2322929
google-chrome	safari
over time encountered quite a number of serious cross-browser issues mostly in less widely used browsers safari google-chrome

2322944
rar	gzip	rar	zip
i can uncompress zip gzip and rar files but i also need to uncompress bzip2 files as well as unarchive them .tar

2322944
maven	pom.xml
i am using java along with maven so ideally i d like to include it as a dependency in the pom.xml

2322958
alarmmanager	wakelock
but if you want to keep the device awake -- whether for your first approach or just while you are doing work triggered by an alarmmanager -- you need to hold a wakelock

2322968
inherited	properties
it sounds like you could easily accomplish your task by creating your own custom class that inherited from qwidget and has the additional properties that you described

2322969
post	get
do i understand you right that you get the tag data together with the post data but are unhappy with the display

2322996
for-loop	loops
i d even go as far as saying that the body of loops must not continue or break unless explicitly documented at the top of the for-loop because as i said the whole purpose is to make the code easier to understand by coming up with a distinct style to express simple repetitions

2322996
for-loop	loops
if that s the case then i m merely extending that principle to say that if it s even simpler than your simple for loops you don t even care about the iteration index or whether it s increasing or decreasing etc you just want to repeat doing something n times then use the winking arrow for-loop construct instead

2323028
versioning	upgrade
alternatively just have the customer upgrade to the very latest fiddler versioning

2323032
rss	feed
i m going to go out on a limb and say you mean by rss that the feed is to be parsed and served inline on the server side

2323032
rss	feed
you ll need to implement some sort of caching to keep from hitting your rss feed over and over and over but the speed benefits will be noticeable

2323041
rss	feed
i want to read multiple rss feed using jquery

2323049
width	height
the width and height of a uicomponent s content is determined in the measure method unless the uicomponent has explicit or percent sizes defined

2323051
mouse	keyboard
detailed interaction steps keyboard mouse ...

2323058
folder	directory
my question is how does visual studio add this folder and xml file to the bin debug directory

2323058
folder	directory
when i clean the solution the model folder is still in the bin debug directory but the contacts.xml file has been cleaned

2323064
valgrind	memcheck
run valgrind with the option to try it but beware that it is not as robust as memcheck

2323115
inherited	properties
this is what makes the styling work properties but is also important to allow attached properties properties inherited through the visual tree and many other things wpf relies on

the exception is explicitly thrown by an implementation - this is the recommended way to prevent clonability in a subclassing when the superclass is cloneable

2326851
superclass	subclassing
the latter case cannot occur in your class as you re directly calling the superclass method in the try block even if invoked from a subclassing calling super.clone and the former should not since your class clearly should implement cloneable

powerdesigner lets you create a conceptual datamodel that can be used as source for the creation of several physical datamodel each one associated to a specific dbms

2327607
width	height
there is actually an easy o 2 n brute force solution where n is either the width or the height whichever is smaller

2327774
pascal	delphi
the most ideal solution would be to create a wrapper preferably which consumes the original source unmodified and compile that wrapper to an obj file using c++ which then is linked into delphi where another wrapper exposes the engine via a more standard object pascal syntax

2327794
folder	directory
however i would like to be able to read the content of the pda not only in its mydocument folder so i can t use this plus it have to work with 20+ possible pda of the same model thus making 20+ directory

2327809
client-side	server-side
first of all don t confuse cookie settings which are client-side and garbage collection which is server-side

2327851
hide	show
since they just take up visual space is it possible to somehow hide these columns so they do not show up in a database diagram in ssms or ssmse

2327857
post	get
you can t post a link to the validation output because validating by direct input uses post through form submit not get though url

2327867
free	malloc
under c++ you are encouraged to use new delete over malloc free

2327868
fast-forward	merge
there were no commits on the master itself so the merge was fast-forward

2327868
fast-forward	merge
generally fast-forward merge the topic branches

2327872
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i have tried setting tag 1 in the parent s viewdidload viewwillappear viewdidappear and in the child s viewwilldisappear - any help would be greatly appreciated

int main int argc chars argv

2327940
puts	gets
i currently have a function that gets some data from the database and puts it into a dataset

2327957
xsl-fo	xslt
i m using an xslt stylesheet by antennahouse to convert xhtml to an xsl-fo file

2327960
free	malloc
always use delete if you use new and free if you use malloc

2327960
free	malloc
malloc free only deal with the memory allocation and deallocation

2327982
jboss	glassfish	openmq	hornetq
other stand alone jms brokers open source which can be run standalone or even embedded in your java application are open message queue openmq which is also included in glassfish and the new jboss hornetq message broker which will be the jms implementation in jboss application server

2327986
margin	height
i found this problem in many occasions in which i was animating just the height with slidetoggle but not the margin padding

2328027
folder	directory
deleting a folder in your virtual directory may cause your application to re-start thus loosing all session data

2328033
hide	show
you will notice i pass an object to my user control allowing it to hide or show itself display certain options etc based on permissions

2328090
std	ostream
i have a class in c++ which takes an std ostream as an argument in order to continuously output text trace information

2328160
int	boolean
it can only handle simple types like boolean int long float and string though

2328170
imap	nntp
there are functions provided in php you might have to install the extension though imap pop3 and nntp

2328225
apache	nginx
i have a website set up with nginx acting as a reverse proxy to apache 2.2 which is running php

2328225
apache	nginx
from apache and php s perspective the ip address of all requests is the nginx server

2328242
width	height
with the rectangle s width and height set to auto i expected the rectangle to resize to automatically display the arrow that is drawn

2328242
width	height
however it seems that i need to explicitly set a width height in order to see anything

2328242
width	height
if i leave the width height as auto the rectangle is displayed as a single point as if width height 0

2328244
ienumerable	iqueryable
i guess it is failing cause the ientityset is basically an ienumerable not iqueryable am i right

2328255
ssl	https
i ve got a ckeditor wysiwyg text and html editor control on an https ssl web page

2328263
sorting	filtering
the new logger only consisted of a single python file which provided a bug list with sorting and filtering options and a submit page

2328269
pop-up	dialog
additionally i think i may experiment with putting a timer around the call to edit.removeandsort and if it takes over a certain amount of time pop-up a one-time dialog mentioning that it looks like removeandsort is having problems and asking if the user wants to cancel or at least not call remove and sort

2328278
apache	nginx
here s a blog-post about that nginx proxy to apache - access remote host ip address using mod_praf

2328284
nexus	artifactory
maybe overkill if you re the only one working on the project but i d recommend installing a maven repository manager like artifactory or nexus

2328284
nexus	artifactory
i m not familiar with nexus but artifactory installation is dead simple - just unzip and you re good to go since it comes with an embedded jetty

2328312
ssl	https
you are getting the warning because the scripts are not being loaded via a ssl link https just regular http

2328315
ostringstream	std
create a std ostringstream and print them to it just like you could to cout

2328335
realloc	malloc
if you re allocating the strings with malloc originally you might consider using realloc to resize the character arrays so they can contain the new string

2328353
jar	manifest.mf
i would extract the driver jar file and find the manifest.mf file this will contain some version information

2328362
button	checkbox
it adds the ability to use a free-form list but turns it into either checkbox or radio button

2328374
x86	64bit
i want my solutions platforms to default to any cpu i believe that means that at jit time the assembly will be either x86 or 64bit based on the machine that loaded it

2328386
memset	calloc
containing such gems of nearly-forgotten wisdom like as mentioned above there is a null pointer for each pointer type and the internal values of null pointers for different types may be different. which means that calloc or memset are not a portable initialization for pointers

2328411
mouseover	mouseout
once i mouseover one of the tabs the rotation should stop on the selected tab and when i mouseout it should continue rotating from the selected tab item

2328475
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop that will loops through a set of page in php

2328486
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
i ve seen how collision is detected in the colliding mice example where it uses a qgraphicsscene to draw the qgraphicsitem mice on and scene - collidingitems this to see which mice are colliding

2328486
qgraphicsscene	qwidget
the problem is that the fridge magnets example uses a class that inherits qwidget in place of qgraphicsscene so there s no collidingitems method to check when we have a collision

2328491
hash	md5
for the fastest verbatim searches you should store a md5 hash of the title in a binary 16 column create a unique index over it disabling the key compression and search for the hash

2328522
post	get
once you ve got started post code either on the nvidia cuda forums or here on stackoverflow and the community will likely help out but you ll need more specific questions to get more specific answers

2328547
int	double
string is defined as a standard type just like int double float etc

2328550
firefox	safari
try using a different browser firefox safari konqueror or ignore that your div isn t partially transparent until the fix comes

2328556
free	malloc
new delete are type safe whereas malloc free are not

2328556
free	malloc
this means that pointers returned by malloc and free are void pointers that need to be cast to the correct type

2328556
free	malloc
new delete implicitly support array allocation and deletion using the and syntax using meta-data supplied by the compiler malloc free do not support this syntax

2328556
free	malloc
applying new delete to a class type t will call the constructor and destructor respectively of t malloc free do not call the constructor and destructor of t

2328556
free	malloc
the same holds for memory allocated using malloc which should be free using free

2328569
memcpy	memmove
but anything under about 8 kb is faster to handle with memmove and memcpy

2328579
mouseover	mouseout
so i would imagine that you can simply do that on mouseover and reset back to your defaults on mouseout

2328587
versioning	upgrade
i am running versioning 2.8.4a and will try to upgrade to latest release hoping this will fix things

2328672
post	get
thus when you call get home index the first action will be invoked and when you call post home index the second one will be invoked

2328713
hide	show
strangely as opposed to show method hide can revert hard-coded visible style with no problem

2328713
hide	show
so to hide show elements as intended i either have to use hide show method combo without no visibility style hard-coding or use css method of jquery and set the visibility style as desire

2328716
hide	show
i have some very simple jquery hide show logic called on a change in select list value in a drupal form

2328724
put	get
is it possible via tortoisesvn to know the svn rev number you are about to get prior to a commit so that i can put that rev# into the source code comment section

2328739
put	get
i put everything in comments to finaly get to that conclusion

2328770
rss	feed
as a workaround for familiar feed i would manually fix those datetime nodes - by catching the xmlexception loading the rss into an xmldocument fixing those nodes value creating a new xmlreader and then returning the formatter from this new xmlreader object code not shown

2328770
rss	feed
rss feed cf all ned us hl en q test cf all output rss

2328807
union	distinct
pushed the color condition into the where clause of subselects adding the color to the grouping and added distinct to support identical behavior of union

2328810
onfocus	onblur
i don t activate deactivate detection onblur and onfocus

2328886
children	parent
given the object graph below i need to have 2 different style applied depending on whether the parent object has any children or not

2328890
super	self
if self super initwithnibname nibnameornil bundle nibbundleornil

2328936
bindingsource	dataview
this works when the bindingsource is a dataview

2328948
haskell	ocaml
learning some functional language like haskell or ocaml would help in intellectual enrichment and will teach you new ways in which you can tackle the problems

2328971
rank	percentile
this looks quite similar to f# how to percentile rank an array of doubles

2328975
width	height
height and width are always zero and color of any pixel is always the same

2328989
folder	directory
files should be downloaded into a specific directory if you are concerned with other accessing this file you should do a deny from all in a .htaccess in that folder

2329143
queue	fifo
you can do this iteratively by using a bf search or applied to a matrix the lee algorithm which can be efficiently implemented using a fifo queue which i describe how to do here change floodfill-algorithm to get voronoi territory for two data points

2329143
queue	fifo
basically all checks stay the same just that you use a fifo queue to hold your states instead of an implicit stack

2329186
int	chars
for your error the reason is simple you are trying to assign a pointer chars at sz wich is an int

2329204
exponent	modulo
the main problem i have is that i have been supplied the exponent and modulo as an nsdata object and i need to then convert them to a seckeyref object in order to perform the rsa encryption

2329246
vbulletin	phpbb
those that immediately come to mind are phpbb vanilla and or vbulletin

2329248
for-loop	loops
your click function will use the final value of permalink for every marker event since permalink gets replaced with a new value every time the for-loop loops

2329252
orca	msiexec
msiexec i sample.msi reinstall all reinstallmode amus in command prompt.inspite of setting in command prompt i tried to update msi property through orca

2329275
jquery	anythingslider
the jquery anythingslider doesn t splay images in a rtl right to left hebrew website

2329275
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome but not in firefox and safari

2329350
free	malloc
hence the reason you don t want to mix malloc free with new delete

2329366
width	height
can i explicit set its width and height

2329401
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox 3.5+ and newer versions of google-chrome and safari both links popup the colorbox as is expected

2329452
pull	push
i can control the push pull but i haven t seen a way to actually prevent repos from being visible in the hgwebdir cgi application

2329454
put	get
sometimes this is referred to as a view model class and generally contains nothing more than several string properties that the ui layer can get from and put to directly without worry of validation

2329457
min	max
once you have used something like the code above to get your miny and maxy you can then use those values to reset the min and max y-axis values on the chartarea

2329482
sorting	filtering
the thought behind this is that i want to keep the store around in order to preserve the column sorting and filtering but destroy the grid in order to save on memory

2329482
sorting	filtering
is column sorting and filtering kept intrnally on the gridpanel object or on the store object

2329492
width	height
box has height h i width w i and

2329492
width	height
as it is 3d i get three sequence of height width and depth

2329582
hash	md5
i must admit that i know virtually nothing about encryption but i m assuming that an md5 hash as an example can be longer and would presumably take more processing power to crack

2329584
post	get
the code necessary to get authentified and to read the sharepoint list from java is a bit too long to post here

2329595
x86	mips
the differences features of different cpus platforms like x86 mips arm powerpc

2329609
hash	salt
we prepend each password with a random salt value and hash using md5cryptoserviceprovider

2329664
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
with a salt md5 is much more secure than without but you re better off using one of the sha hash such as sha256managed

2329666
mouseover	mousedown
the problem is when 2 items are positioned so that the label of one is above the icon of another in the z-index so that the label eats any mouseover and mousedown events

2329669
versioning	upgrade
my solution was to upgrade the versioning of tinymce that i was using

2329678
udp	tcp
you can open a tcp pipe you can broadcats udp you can do a fully fledged ws for this purpose alone you can use a file share protocol

2329679
mouse	keyboard
and of course for the keyboard freaks mouse

2329681
postgresql	mysql
since you ve indicated that you re happy working with either one i say go with postgresql for new projects and don t worry about converting existing projects unless and until oracle does something with mysql that gives you cause for concern

2329685
width	height
accounting for the rotations is easy enough for every tower all you have to check is what happens if you use its height as the length of the base and its width as the height and what happens if you use it in the natural way

2329715
datagridcomboboxcolumn	datagridtemplatecolumn
try creating an object to bind to and instead of using datagridtemplatecolumn use datagridtextcolumn and datagridcomboboxcolumn and the editing should be as you expected

2329726
scrypt	pbkdf2
use scrypt bcrypt or pbkdf2

2329726
hash	salt
you should hash the passwords together with salt that are long and cryptographically random

2329735
inherited	properties
since csmapannotation does not inherited from mkannotationview and you have not implemented the selected properties it will not work

2329772
hide	show
you d better not show hide the window but create a new one and close it when needed

2329794
min	max
does the language have min max functions

2329795
post	get
if you include it as part of a post build process or if you have team system set the rule to fail the build they ll soon get the hang of it

2329818
int	boolean
assuming your language doesn t equate boolean and int values as c and c++ do

2329834
stdio	fflush
calling exit instead is a good way to cause pending stdio buffers to be fflush twice

2329839
kerberos	ldap
in addition ldap makes for a good way of abstracting authentication over lots of different means active directory kerberos even normal sql-based authentication

2329845
uninstall	upgrade
at uninstall and upgrade time the reference counts that should have been tracked would determine whether the shared items should be removed

2329867
ftp	telnet
also available zip unzip tar untar xmlvalidate xslt ftp telnet scp sshexec cab .

2329881
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
i m using the nsurlconnection and the nsxmlparser in order to connect and parse the xml content

2329889
scrypt	pbkdf2
we estimate that on modern 2009 hardware if 5 seconds are spent computing a derived key the cost of a hardware brute-force attack against scrypt is roughly 4000 times greater than the cost of a similar attack against bcrypt to find the same password and 20000 times greater than a similar attack against pbkdf2

2329889
hash	salt
also always add a salt to make it impossible to share effort for brute forcing many hash at a time

2329892
width	height
you do this by dismissing all variations where the width is lower than the depth so for each i w i d i and then dismissing the variation where the height is not the highest nor the lowest of the three dimensions because the other two variations can go one on top of the other and this one can t join in

2329899
maven	pom.xml
i m using jsf 2.0.2-fcs with hibernate entity manager 3.3.2.ga and hibernate validator 4.0.2.ga below are the relevant parts from my maven pom.xml running in tomcat 6.0.20 on windows xp pro service pack 3 32-bit

2329944
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
viewwillappear or viewdidappear might work for you

2329980
onfocus	onblur
input type text class textbox onblur search_searchblock_blur onfocus search_searchblock_focus value search name g2_form searchcriteria size 18 id searchcriteria

2329992
minimum	diagonal
i see that the minimum screen diagonal size for android is listed as 2.6

2329993
onfocus	onblur
note that this method doesn t require adding onblur or onfocus event-logic in your html itself

2330079
nsstring	nsdata
you should use nsdata to store binary data not nsstring

2330208
folder	directory
the nhibernate assemblies were not being properly propogated to my application s runtime directory because i was using the standard vs2008 folder structure bin debug etc

2330223
implements	extends
if you re extends from an object or implements an interface you don t really want to be passing objects like that

2330261
filtering	grouping
filtering removing adding or overriding grouping of files help files entire modules etc.

2330261
ant	maven
i m exploring different solutions related to either maven or ant or whatever else

2330292
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic
there are open source and commercial jpa implementations toplink essentials eclipselink hibernate entitymanager openjpa kodo etc and any java ee 5 or java ee 6 application server must provide support for its use jboss uses hibernate entitymanager glassfish v2 uses toplink essentials by default glassfish v3 uses eclipselink by default weblogic uses kodo by default etc 1

2330292
glassfish	weblogic
it is for example possible to use hibernate instead of kodo with weblogic or instead of eclipselink with glassfish

2330329
qthread	qobject
how do i handle qobject that i will use in both the qthread and mainthread

2330357
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my site is working fine in firefox safari google-chrome and opera but for some reason ie7 is not recognizing css padding on any anchor tags

2330373
javassist	cglib
is it still possible to force hibernate 3.3 or 3.5 to use cglib instead of javassist

2330422
qthread	qapplication
when your qthread reads some udp data it can do any initial processing on it then pass the data to the main thread via qapplication postevent or via a queued signal slot connection

2330443
classname	inherited
when using table-per-hierarchy inherited gorm creates a class column that stores the classname of instances

2330484
getter	setter
you can find where the element is being accessed with getter setter

2330504
firefox	safari
you can see the example here best viewed in firefox or safari right now

2330539
mouseover	mouseout
i used bind mouseover and bind mouseout simply because that s what i m used to doing

2330545
opera	firefox
firefox and opera asks what to do.

2330626
background-color	transparency
background-color transparency

2330653
public	protected
it should be protected or private and it should only be tested indirectly by unit testing your public api

2330668
hash	md5
the simplest way to be slow is to iterate the fast hash function thousands of times - that s what the md5 and sha-1 based password scheme used to store passwords on unix-like systems do it s not just one round of md5 or sha-1

2330705
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i m using touchesbegan touchesmoved with multitouch

2330705
touchesbegan	touchesended
i bounds test on the point of touchesbegan to set the button as down and the same for touchesended to reset it

2330736
gif	png
i suppose you can set a generic field type use filefield module and in the allowed filetypes setting enter all image and video filetypes png jpg gif avi flv etc then also set unlimited for the quantity allowed

2330751
for-loop	loops
if by query you meant your for-loop start loops at

2330751
for-loop	loops
as of right now your for-loop structure checks if which evaluates to false so it doesn t run the code inside of loops

2330770
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
demo site seems stable on google-chrome firefox and opera found over at please excuse the ugly

2330773
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome i can scroll the div but i get the selectable outline

2330804
firefox	safari
i tried the website on ie 8 safari and firefox and it looks fine now

2330812
post	get
when a character is typed in to the textbox it sends a ajax post or get request to the php file which queries the database and returns a result set

2330837
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it looks like at least the latest versions of internet explorer firefox google-chrome and safari all support the cut and paste events which are triggered immediately after text is cut or pasted in a given input element

2330837
mouse	keyboard
the events are triggered by keyboard and mouse interactions

2330837
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tested this on a mac in firefox 3.6 google-chrome 5.0 dev and safari 4 and on windows in firefox 3.5 and ie8

2330882
sorting	filtering
also how would any of these work with sorting and filtering operations that are performed just for the ui

2330889
width	height
for example my image is 350px int width and 130px in height

2330930
mpfr	mpir
for arbitray precision if that s what you need take a look at mpir gmp mpfr

2330933
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
i am parsing an xml file of the network using nsxmlparser after i got the data from nsurlconnection

2330935
put	get
i think i d use a combination of jquery and js regexps jq to find the elements to process and get the contents out of each javascript s replace method to do the string manipulation and jq to put the modified contents back in the dom elements

2330946
width	height
then you can write some js to load or replace with the desired image or adjust the height width attributes on the image which would scale it but doesn t always look great

2330998
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux os intel core 2 duo 2.40ghz cpu 2gb memory 15krpm hard drive 37 1080p lcd tv monitor

2331013
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
and this is sufficient until the view is obscured by a modal view at which point the view is resized to the default size somewhere between calls of viewwillappear and viewdidappear as uinavigationcontroller inherits from uiviewcontroller

2331013
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
is there a way to surpress uinavigationcontroller s resizing behavior without subclassing uiviewcontroller myself

2331036
width	height
if you only specify the width in css the height will scale automatically

2331076
mouseleave	mouseenter
i actually acheived this using the mouseenter and mouseleave events and changing the gradient but.

2331077
min	max
however i don t want the rescaling to be jerky as one would get by constantly resetting the min max -- when it does rescale i want the rescaling to be smooth

2331114
bindparam	bindvalue
if you are having problems with passing non-references to bindparam i suggest using bindvalue instead

2331136
put	get
i get a distinct flash-bashing troll vibe off this question but i ll put in my 2 cents

2331139
cakephp	yii
the closest frameworks to want you require are symfony yii cakephp they all have a console command line tool so quickly generte basic crud for them symfony probably has the most complete functionity with it s admin generator but also as a steeper learning curve than the other two

2331150
button	checkbox
you can derive your control from buttonbase just like button hyperlinkbutton checkbox etc

2331166
int	chars
if the initializefrom function takes two chars arguments how come the second argument can pass a chars + int to a chars and have it work out properly

2331182
int	chars
a chars + int results in a chars that is int chars higher in memory

2331193
int	chars
how come the second argument can pass a chars + int

2331205
int	chars
is there a way to turn this int into a chars i can strcmp to an existing string

2331205
int	chars
i ve got everything working minus the int to chars part

2331210
width	height
i m using the height h as the width of the checkbox

2331214
cdr	cons
building data out of thin air - an implementation of lisp s cons car and cdr functions in c#

2331220
int	chars
a chars is just an int with a range of 255 values and chars literals like a are just a number as well

2331227
int	chars
in c a chars is basically an int between 0 and 255 so you can treat the int directly as a chars if you want to sprintf to a buffer or similar

2331239
int	chars
finally obligatory portability remark a chars s value as an int may not represent its ascii value if the underlying encoding is not ascii mdash

2331300
filtering	grouping
you need ranking and grouping algorithms to filtering and understand the data and how it relates

2331339
stdout	stderr
i need to launch a number of long-running processes with subprocess.popen and would like to have the stdout and stderr from each automatically piped to separate log files

2331339
stdout	stderr
each process will run simultaneously for several minutes and i want two log files stdout and stderr per process to be written to as the processes run

2331355
setinterval	settimeout
in fact moving an item at a constant speed is the default way of animating in javascript setinterval settimeout etc. jquery is a shortcut for the people who don t want to do the tedious calculations involved in the more frequent case of wanting a transition to occur in constant time

2331355
setinterval	settimeout
use setinterval or settimeout with a date difference check

2331846
cpu	processors
data types size depends on processors because compiler wants to make cpu easier accessible the next byte

2331846
cpu	processors
for eg if processors is 32bit compiler may not choose int size as 2 bytes which it supposed to choose 4 bytes because accessing another 2 bytes of that int 4bytes will take additional cpu cycle which is waste

if you re still using bde you can use the bde api to physically sort the dbf table

2332726
width	height
why are unscaledwidth and unscaledheight tracing to 0 when the calling component doesn t explicitly set a width and height

2332726

also if you think that there will be big count of uploaded files you can divide your directory structure by folder with names for example consists of first 2 letters of md5 hash

2332998
width	height
just remember that those divs need width and height atributes

2333005
hash	md5
what i always do is set the filename as an md5 hash of the file itself - the side effect of this is it avoids duplicate uploads taking space plus you can verify data integrity fairly easily

2333085
hide	show
you can either hide the current results altogether only show percentages without absolute number of votes or delay the display of the votes

2333090
debian	linux
this has worked well so far and i could just unzip the linux zip file on my debian based server and run . eclipse from the command line and the app would start up

we ll assuming your talking about amd64 em64t x86_64 and x86 for 64bit and 32-bit respectively

2333120
x86	64bit
you can run amd64 code on x86 processors only by emulation qemu or some kinds of virtualisation i believe vmware might support 64bit guest os on 32bit host os on 64

2333139
int	double
i have a with dynamic values from an enum like string int double bool datetime

getter	setter
one of the field is called images with only getter and no setter

2333211
hide	show
essentially when you click on this button it either show or hide the tab control which contains status messages and re-sizes the form to fit the remaining controls shrink or grow

2333217
hide	show
one way to do this is to create the controls all together and show hide the ones required depending on selectedvalue dynamically

2333270
uiview	calayer
it starts with calayer display and from within that method uiview drawrect is called to be precise first uiview drawlayer layer incontext context is called and from within this method uiview drawrect is called

2333270
uiview	calayer
how does the calayer display method obtain the context of uiview

getter	setter
in our legacy java ee application there are loads of value object vo classes which typically contain only getter and setter maybe equals and hashcode

2333314
hide	show
just add a code to resize the form every time the show hide details button is clicked

2333317
post	get
the procedure for writing one is outlined in that post - it s similar to what alex describes but by overriding get instead of get_value_for_datastore you avoid issues with needing to write to the datastore to update it

2333330

one of my jsp s contains a this renders just fine but if i post the values on this page i get

2333358

post	get
it should support mysql and php with get post session and cookies

2333500
put	get
it must get a default price from somewhere else not in this table and it must also get an override price from this table and put the two pieces of information together

2333511
mouseover	mouseout
once i mouseover one of the tabs the rotation should stop on the selected tab and when i mouseout it should continue rotating from the selected tab item

2333511
mouseover	mouseout
at the moment the when mouseover the cycle stops but does not select the correct item once i mouseout then mouseover again the functionality works perfectly

2333566
free	malloc
the c library then manages these pages and maintains lists of what is free and what is allocated giving the user addresses of these blocks when asked to with malloc

2333566
free	malloc
this area may contain garbage or it contain other malloc d memory it may contain the memory used for stack variables or it may even contain the memory used by the c library to manage the lists of free allocated memory

2333566
free	malloc
corruption of the c-library s malloc free management memory causing crashes when malloc or free are called

2333566
free	malloc
malloc free and pointers are very fragile in c and to a slightly lesser degree in c++ and it is very easy to shoot yourself in the foot accidentally

2333576
hex	binary
csv comma separated values is not a format suitable for binary data the general rule of thumb though for saving binary data to a text file is to convert it to a format that does suit text files something like base64 or a textual representation of the raw data in hex

2333605
maven	pom.xml
maven pom.xml fragments

2333642
post	get
as is usual when you post a question you get a minor breakthrough

sort filtering and grouping queries all

2333861
folder	directory
i am able to create the temporary directory e.g-for 100 revision number able to create 100 folder but need help to write piece of code to do a unreserved checkout prior to this create activity set activity each element associated with the each revision and put the file into the particular created folder

2333867
opera	firefox
a browser is not the right tool if you want to debug xslt that transforms xml to xml unless it is a browser like firefox or opera and your target xml format is a format like svg or mathml or xhtml the browser knows to render

2333883
oursql	mysql-python
all python database modules use the same api so either mysql-python or oursql will work

2333883
mako	genshi
genshi jinja2 mako cheetah and too many others

2333895
getter	setter
the convention you are referring to is to adopt an anemic domain model as opposed to rich domain model where entities are simple pojos annotated as beans entity with just the bare minimum in terms of getter and setter

2333904
swt	swing
essentially the two apis you ll need are jdbc and swing or an alternative such as swt

2333925
google-chrome	firefox

2333952
versioning	upgrade
now i have upgrade my ubuntu to versioning 9.10 and g++ to versioning 4.4.1

2333981
free	realloc
when you call realloc as you have you throw away the new address and there s a good chance that the old address has now been free

2333981
free	realloc
the reason realloc returns a new address is because expansion of the buffer may necessitate it being moved if that current block is surrounded in the memory arena in other words it can t just expand into a free block following it

2333981
free	realloc
keep in mind that realloc doesn t have to return a new pointer it may give you the same pointer if for example there was enough free space after the block to satisfy the new size or if you re reducing the size

2333981
memcpy	memset
similarly you don t need to memset a memory chunk to 0 if you re immediately going to memcpy over it

2333981
realloc	malloc
that s because realloc null 7 is identical to malloc 7 - realloc is perfectly capable of starting with a null pointer

2333994
pop-up	dialog
when i try to execute this statement in oracle sql developer 2.1 a dialog box enter substitution variable pop-up asking for a replacement value for tobago

i know the java code works file because i can get a response if i post to it from a html form

2334115
x86	64bit
wpf application run as 64bit processes on 64bit os unless compiled specifically to target only x86 just like any other .net application

2334132
put	get
to get a has one relationship you would put the addressid on the the persontable

2334161
spaces	delimiter
there are many other issues like this you need more ui spaces because some languages need more characters than english to express the same concept you need bigger fonts for east asia you need to use localised date times in the user interface but perhaps english us when communicating with databases you need to use semicolon as a delimiter for csv files string comparisons and sorting are cultural phone numbers addresses.

2334202
mouse	keyboard
i don t know the inner workings of gmail s keyboard event capturing but i recently wrote a simple keyboard shortcut navigator so i don t have to use the mouse to click links for chrome

2334263
mxml	haxe
my advice is learn flex focusing strongly on mxml or learn haxe

2334271
16-bit	64bit
it may be a long way away but consider some years in to the future where 64bit os and cpus are ubiquitous consider how 16-bit faded away when 32-bit took over

however depending on the device used by the phone you may be able to get the system to put it into monitor mode if you have root access

2334381
parent-child	one-to-many	many-to-one	one-to-many
map it as normal one-to-many many-to-one parent-child child-parent relations and that s it

2334392
mouse	keyboard
however now there are some users saying they need to be able to select a part of the item in the label say the first 3 characters or the last 2 using the mouse or keyboard

2334409
hash	md5
as a repository contains more than the artifacts poms the metadata md5 and sha1 hash files... deploying means not only copying the artifacts but making sure all this information is correctly updated

2334429
google-chrome	firefox
or when your user installs google-chrome imports their bookmarks from firefox that pointed to particular spots inside your webapp and suddenly the bookmarks don t work as they did before

2334439
inherited	properties
to get a strongly typed view you can either use the prompts from the vs mvc tools and right click on an action and choose create a strongly-typed view then select the proper business object to act as your model or you can directly alter a page by changing it s page directive s inherited attribute to system.web.mvc.viewpage where somemodel is the model that implements the list properties and is the model that will be bound to the page

2334461
put	get
i put my sqlite database file in the assets folder and i write a dao calss to get data from database but the information from log.e means i can not open the database

2334468
gif	png
if the background is a gradient or image replace the png with a gif in your ie6 stylesheet

2334471
inherited	properties
for each specific report you can create a different properties class as long as it inherited from createreportprop

2334471
ienumerable	idictionary
if you wish to do less changes within the createreport class you can have your createreportprop implement an ienumerable or idictionary interface so that iterating the parameters is more generic

2334472
uiview	subviews
is it possible to make a uiview and any other subviews within it set to an opacity of say 0.5 or whatever

2334516
innodb	myisam
mysql only supports the defining of actual foreign key relationships on innodb tables maybe yours are myisam or something else

2334542
int	chars
rather you supply it with a pointer to int and printf fills that with how many chars have been written so far

2334571
atomic	compare-and-swap
afaik you need either an atomic compare-and-swap instruction or you need to be able to disable interrupts

2334601
toolbar	tabs
it allows you to write text to and read text from a window without the window having any other ui chrome such as toolbar menus tabs etc

2334626
free	malloc
malloc and free rely on rather complex dynamically built structures

2334627
x86	64bit
i am trying to access a dll located in the c program files x86 folder in a 64bit processor pc

2334634
post	get
use a get not a post for search results

2334662
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
data manipulation such as copying splitting merging alignment grouping sorting searching filtering and more

2334709
post	get
now some i know what their purpose is but many i cannot even seem to track down on google or i just get oblique references to such as a post from a forum in 1999 complaining about the process

2334761
maven	pom.xml
assuming that you have a maven pom.xml for building everything in the parent module it would now include modules like

2334903
width	font-size	width	text-align	text-align	font-size
text-align justify works best with small font-size with slightly higher line-height - line-height is for readbility and smaller font size puts more characters in one line abstract characters-per-line width therefore gaps between words justified text looks better

2334930
hide	show
therefore we get the next element and show it by removing the hide class months.eq curr .removeclass hide

2334956
button	checkbox
go to the properties view of a project click the build tab click the advanced button at the bottom right check the check for arithmetic overflow underflow checkbox

2334968
accessor	properties
also if a method in the same class wants to change the value of a properties should it go through the set accessor of the properties or just modify the private variable _registered directly

2334977
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 532.2 khtml like gecko google-chrome 4.0.221.6 safari 532.2

2335007

2335171
wordpress	joomla
how do all these wonderful scripts out there like wordpress joomla e.t.c

2335203
getter	setter
if you have or need java style getter and setter you can also use the beanproperty annotation

if you instead use the beanproperty for a val instead of a var the setter won t be created only the getter

2335204
daemons	systemd
part of this systemd includes a monitoring daemons whose purpose is to take tab-separated value files turn them into xml that dazzle recognizes and pass them to dazzle for label generation

2335270

put	get
i have a problem with with my output when i write to i file i get squares when i put endl to change lines

2335359
ostringstream	std
if you want you can pass it std cerr std cout or an std ostringstream implementation i use it with a std ostringstream implementation

2335369
accessor	properties
to address the issue of the using the field directly or the properties accessor mutator i am in favour of the properties

2335369
accessor	properties
if you should have a default value beeing returned in the accessor or raise properties change events or the like in the mutator you will bypass this functionality by accessing the field directly

2335458
division	multiplication
bit shifting is the same as division or multiplication by 2 n

2335473
client-side	server-side
javascript is a client-side language and really has no way of enumerating files and directories on a web server without the aid of a server-side script anyway

2335501
width	height
then force the calendar-bg to be absolutely positioned and 100 width height and relatively position #calendar-content on top of it

2335536
strdup	malloc
however i m not using strdup nor malloc to allocate space for that string

2335536
strdup	malloc
i ve always used malloc or strdup where appropriate when handling dynamic strings or i would get lots of segmentation faults

2335547
integer	fractions
this precludes a fractions result much like integer division

2335559
put	get
what ends up happening is that all the videos get put into one list

2335618
children	parent
since i m using the aggregate pattern and instances of child class will only ever be referenced in the context of a parent i don t have a childrepository to delete the children directly - only a parentrepository

2335618
children	parent
however when i retrieve the parent object and call parent.children.clear the children from the database are never deleted

2335664
translation	localization
the localization works just fine when storing all text translation in the same file

2335665
fflush	gets
everything that is fflush to the left margin is executed when the file gets executed

2335665
fflush	gets
so the function is defined and its default arguments set once when the program gets executed because the def statement is fflush left

2335724
super	implements
i can t really explain the problem you re seeing but it seems to be related to the fact that jdk 5 will not allow override on implements methods of an interface only on overridden methods present in a super class

2335731
post	get
in case the other post aren t obvious to get the old version of webhelpers you can run

2335752
ant	maven
whenever something compiles in eclipse but not ant or maven you will need to find a way to make both compilers happy

2335753
folder	directory
open the folder you wish to recover click on the time machine icon and browse the directory as if it was 1999 all over again

2335825
draggable	droppable
how to draw a line between draggable and droppable

2335834
pop-up	dialog
click an ajax-inserted li element pop-up a dialog box with a text input when the input is above 100 submit the information for verification against the server

2335868
skip-lists	tree
they include sample code for things like binary search tree graph skip-lists nodelist etc

2335869
spaces	delimiter
the closing delimiter is optional in php but not in xml and removing it helps prevent unwanted white spaces at the end of files which can cause problems

2335873
draggable	droppable
specifically draggable and droppable

2335877
coldfusion	cfchart
i am having an issue with coldfusion s cfchart tag

2335907
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
an argumentexception argumentnullexception argumentoutofrangeexception etc

2335955
post	get
get some data from post and the user who posted them

2336030
typedef	struct
ps in my own view java is likely to follow c# in allowing struct primitives and maybe typedef as parallelism without resorting to them is proving difficult to accomplish with good performance

2336058
hash	md5
neither md5 nor sha are encryption algorithms they re hash algorithms

2336060
int	boolean
it will work for your example since the boolean true and false values are converted into 1 and 0 because the bitwise operators work with 32-bit int

2336068
hash	md5
you can t decrypt md5 or sha1 hash they are one-way hash which means they are non-recoverable

2336130
manipulators	iomanip
in order to use parameterized stream manipulators like setprecision n you will have to include the iomanip library

2336158
pop-up	dialog
the dialog pop-up but the lower half of the dialog is hidden and the user can t possibly click allow or disallow for that matter

2336174
post	get
i think the post redirect get pattern coupled with window.onbeforeunload in javascript like so uses would be really useful for your circumstances

2336213
vtk	itk
as somebody has mentioned you could use itk which could be used with vtk as a visualization toolkit

2336216
min	max
this is not a valid bst the 2 is out of position with regards to the 10 but if you don t send a min and max value down through the tree you will incorrectly verify it as valid

2336249
pop-up	dialog
but the question is can this be done without the uac prompt dialog pop-up every time windows starts

2336252
int	double
it sounds like what you want is to find each int in the s-expression then double it while keeping the rest of it the same

2336280
button	checkbox
i would like the button on my web page to toggle the visibility of my two checkbox

2336345
free	malloc
suppose char p malloc n assigns more than n say n bytes of memory are allocated and free p is used to free the memory allocated to p

2336372
free	malloc
the malloc block header contains information about the the size of the block and when free is called it returns that amount back to the heap

2336489
postgresql	mysql
postgresql scales farther than mysql

2336522
gif	png
i know that png gif are lossless while jpeg is lossy

2336522
gif	png
but what is the main difference between png gif

2336546
gif	png
gif if needs animation or transparency that works on ie6 note png transparency works after ie6

2336552
gif	png
png has a wider color pallete than gif and gif is properitary while png is not

2336560
gif	png
compared to gif png offers better compression larger pallette and more features including transparency

2336561
gif	png
gif has 8 bit 256 color palette where png as upto 24 bit color palette

2336571
put	get
in order to get the width of the div to auto-adjust you ll have to convert it to an inline element using the same style as you put on the p display inline

2336574
gif	png
png files have a larger default pallet however you can shrink their color pallet so that when you do they result in a smaller file size than gif

2336575
gif	png
you should use png instead of gif because it offers better compression and features

2336582
gif	png
i usually go with png as it seems to have a few advantages over gif

2336582
gif	png
the png format is a popular alternative to gif images since it uses better compression techniques and does not have a limit of 256 colors but pngs do not support animations

2336631
spaces	delimiter
however i would probably do something like split the string into tokens using spaces as a delimiter then iterate through until you reach the first token with no numbers in it

2336680
children	parent
i have a parent class with a list of children

2336680
children	parent
i would like to load the parent by something other than the id by name...i am using criteria.setfetchmode children fetchmode.join

2336727
put	get
from the results get all the user_id s that match put them in an array

2336730
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and opera as well so i m assuming it works in safari and google-chrome too

2336733
queue	fifo
you can use a fifo queue that stores your position and thus avoid your recursive calls

2336736
rsa	aes
if you re dealing with sensitive data you could generate a random aes key in javascript then send it to the server along with the password encrypted with rsa

2336738
ssl	https
if your host doesn t support https then a service like cloudflare universal ssl can be used to ensure all browsers connect to your site using https even if your server doesn t support ssl tls

2336738
ssl	https
https certificates can be obtained for free using let s encrypt or start ssl there is no legitimate reason not to support https

2336750
ubuntu	centos
but suppose i want to generate executables for standard ubuntu 8.04 and centos 5.3 boxes

2336752
subtract	add
if you add you must subtract but the absolute value is an implementation detail that should be ignored

2336770
hide	show
there s a lot of customization you can do to the admin by adding custom modeladmin classes hide fields show additional fields allow for editing of related-items on the same page or limit filter the options that appear in a foreign key field

2336770
sorting	filtering
you can also make things easier for users to find by adding sorting filtering to the front page search fields

2336900
setinterval	settimeout
if you are calling this function in a loop as bobince mentioned in his her comment you should change it to a series of settimeout calls or setinterval to give control back to the browser

2336929
folder	directory
publish the web app to a folder on the laptop and create an iis virtual directory pointing to that folder

2336937
width	height
you have to specify a height and width in your img tag or when it loads it has a has a rect of cgrectzero and doesn t show

2336940
min	max
max min distinct references to a grouping column and the

2337026
width	height
you can use document.createelement iframe and then appendchild or replacechild the new element if you use replacechild you define a dummy div that has the width height of your iframe

2337053
for-loop	loops
and now that we have the timestamp of last monday we can write a simple for-loop that loops 7 times adding 1 day each time like this

2337053
for-loop	arrays
modify that for-loop so it stores the dates in an arrays

2337058
ant	maven
likewise build management tools like ant and maven are nice for large projects with nontrivial dependencies but you certainly don t need them to write hello world

2337061
int	double
in beej s guide to networking there is a section of marshalling or packing data for serialization where he describes various functions for packing and unpacking data int float double ..etc

2337132
int	chars
it s perfectly valid according to the standard for you to set the chars data and then read 0s when you attempt to read the int or vice-versa

2337147
ubuntu	linux
operating system is ubuntu linux

2337171
int	double
it makes more sense to say than since t can be non-class types like int or double

2337189
client-side	server-side
the regularexpressionvalidator validates both server-side and client-side using the same regular expression and in the case of it fails on the client-side for length 12 but works for length 10

2337191
ienumerable	iqueryable
however you should note that this works on ienumerable and not on iqueryable the results will be pulled from the data source before the where is applied

2337198
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in firefox and ie but not in google-chrome

2337234
std	ostream
for example cout is a std ostream and inserting data into the stream is a modifying operation so to implement the operator to insert into an ostream the operator is defined like this

2337293
disk	ram
find a library that doesn t read this stuff into ram before writing it to disk

2337334
pop-up	dialog
per the rules i describe on my blog step 8 should succeed w o user intervention no browse for folder dialog no error pop-up

2337341
children	parent
the controls collection only fetches the controls that are the immediate children of a particular parent and it doesn t recursively search through the entire page to find all the buttons

2337382
google-chrome	firefox
i think it only works on google-chrome not working on firefox 3.6

2337391
getter	setter
since all my di mappings are defined in the way of properties getter and setter i created a base class like this

2337394
versioning	upgrade
create a new versioning that will have your changes so that if users want new features they need to upgrade their codebase

2337401
width	height
i wanted to know if there are any dom methods that can help me extract the geometry info xy positions and the height and width of all the hyperlinks in a webpage

2337411
folder	directory
i tried placing the entire amazon folder inside the system libraries directory and then tried including libraries with this- load- library amazon fps client

2337430
punctuation	words
unfortunately google bing altavista yahoo and excite all strip the punctuation and just show anything with the words window in it

2337453
pull	push
i can see how you can use the acl extension to control the push pull to a particular repository by certian users but can you control web access to a repository using the acl extenstion

2337477
width	height
if i set the height and width to auto it doesn t scroll and if i set it to spefic detentions it creates a box when the window is maximized

2337524
ubuntu	centos
for generating executables for standard ubuntu 8.04 and centos 5.3 systems you could install the distributions in virtual machines and do the necessary compilation from within the virtual machine to guarantee the resulting binaries are compatible with the library versions from each distribution

2337524
binutils	glibc
it appears it may be slightly out of date but there is a matrix of build results for various architectures to help determine a suitable combination of gcc glibc binutils and linux kernel headers

2337524
binutils	glibc
not all combinations of gcc binutils glibc and linux headers will build successfully

2337549
width	margin	width	border-box	margin	border-box	box-sizing	margin	box-sizing	border-box
i know i can use box-sizing or -moz-box-sizing set to border-box to get that div s total width including borders and padding but not margin to be that computed 100

2337561
drawingvisual	rendertargetbitmap
currently i m using drawingvisual and a drawingcontext.drawellipse command for each circle then rendering the visual to a rendertargetbitmap but it becomes very slow as the number of circles rises

2337569
folder	directory
so i assumed that mysql default directory was the wamp folder

2337574
treemap	treeset
treeset treemap hashset hashmap etc

2337579
width	margin
it would help to know what s your point but knowing this all - i advice you to use wrapper div having width and padding or just having width and my-div having margin

2337601
swift	objective-c
code snippet in swift 3.x 2.x and objective-c is here

2337609
rss	feed
as part of our application we need to download a rss feed

2337609
rss	feed
our client s have an internal rss feed which works fine with ie firefox but doesn t work with our application

2337686
bash	subshell
the bourne shell would run the while loop in the current shell but bash runs it in a subshell â at least by default

2337712
rss	feed
how can i read the captions of a rss feed from a given website

2337770
min	max
using c# what is the best shortest way to find out min date max date from this list

2337846
min	max
convert them to datetime using parseexact or tryparseexact and then use linq to get the min and max

2337882
rss	feed
because an rss feed is simply an xml file it should be fairly simple to parse it with simplexml

2337900
queue	fifo
note - the queue isn t a fifo

2337940
pop-up	dialog
simplify pop-up dialog using simple panels only

2337940
mouse	keyboard
i m not talking about mouse keyboard junk but high level events

2337940
button	checkbox
the controller doesn t care if the user clicked a button menu or checkbox

2337985
required	placeholder
.lib can be either the same as .a or a magical so-called import library a thin placeholder which causes you to required a .dll at runtime

2337988
hash	whirlpool
does php s hash function supported whirlpool by default

2337991
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
free works on dynamically allocated memory memory allocated with malloc calloc or realloc

2337999
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
free frees the memory space pointed to by ptr which must have been returned by a previous call to malloc calloc or realloc

2337999
free	malloc
you re essentially telling the runtime to free the memory at address 0 which has not been previously allocated by malloc

2338013
hash	whirlpool
yes hash in php should support whirlpool by default

2338065
opera	google-chrome
this is not something that can be seen in internet explorer 8 google-chrome or opera

2338082
config	ini
if you re using ini config add a line like this

2338124
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
the pointers that you can legally pass to free are pointers obtained by previous calls to malloc calloc realloc and null pointers

2338139
google-chrome	firefox
however firefox 2.x+ and google-chrome seems to not have much problems with that if the request url is identical

2338150
min	max
this is similar to jeffrey s answer but instead of parsing each date it first finds the min and max dates comparing its string values and then it parses the values at the end

2338162
versioning	upgrade
one thing to note is not using client versioning 1.6x with a 1.5x svn server as this is playing havok with our merge processes until we upgrade see

2338178
freemarker	velocity
it seems velocity and freemarker look fairly similiar at least for basic usage

2338223
awt	swing
i can at least say what the edt it that s the event dispatch thread the thread where all awt and swing operations are done

2338224
implements	extends
there is thus no need to discuss technical points things like cayenne 2.0 is intrusive you have to implements an interface or to extends a superclass cayenne 3.0 has pojo support but is still in beta after more than 2 years...

2338237
int	chars
perhaps the phrase your teacher was aiming for was along the lines of ...for backwards compatibility with c types recognizing the problem that is misleading when t is a c-style built-in type such as chars or int as others have said

2338249
super	self
super simpleimagebutton self .onmouseup e #dies here

2338272
width	height
save it with appropriative width and height

2338285
jstl	taglib
it s however not builtin but all you need to do is to just drop jstl-1.2.jar in the web-inf lib and declare one of its taglib in top of the jsp page as per the tld documentation jstl core

2338285
jstl	taglib
jstl also has xml and sql taglib but they are intented for quick prototyping only and shouldn t be used in real production

2338285
internationalization	localization
then there is the format fmt taglib which is great for internationalization and localization i18n and l10n

2338285
jstl	taglib
jstl is just a taglib

2338349
rss	feed
if so then you have to know that rss are xml with a standard format and not related to wikinews and you can transform any rss feed to be displayed in -say- html with xslt

2338375
google-chrome	firefox
the above code works beautifully in ie and firefox but for the love of me i cannot get it to work in google-chrome

2338437
subtract	add
now doing the add and subtract method of this class are pretty simple

2338467
int	double
this library is an example of what is possible for float and double arrays similar results should be possible for int arithmetic since sse has int instructions as well

2338499
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome have client side security feature to prevent phishing

2338500
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
multiplication is repeated addition division is the opposite - repeated subtraction

2338500
division	subtract
for example 3 can be subtract from 10 3 times without going 0 so the integer division quotient is 3

2338504
post	get
so even if you can launch your application as brian suggested it s not hard to get that application s components into reflector once it s running i can post a sample from windbg if someone would find it interesting

2338508
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe	xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
i m not sure about svcutil.exe but for xsd.exe and wsdl.exe you have to specify all the files that are used by the .xsd file because they don t recognize elements

2338532
implements	extends
i recommend extends one of the list classes that has already implements a dataprovider property it s a lot to tackle

2338559
width	height
as an addition to the above use the me.move left top width height method

2338569
profiling	debugging
we used sql profiling too to debugging the failure but couldn t see the bulk insert statement for this table

2338602
free	malloc
the same kind of leak exists with memory allocation calling new but never delete or calling malloc but never free for instance or file pointers never closing opened file pointers

2338604
put	get
what i did was create a wrapper which is a partially-implemented abstract base class that uses any standard cache library as the backing cache just needs to implement the contains get put and remove methods

2338604
put	get
intercept all calls to the get put add and remove methods

2338604
put	get
because the getoradd still implements a get followed by an optional put this method is synchronized serialized against the put and remove methods but only to add the incomplete entry not for the entire duration of the lazy load

2338609
selecteditem	selectedindex
it should be enough to set the selecteditem or selectedindex property and then it will be rendered correctly

2338645
children	parent
example i have a parent abstract class with child1 child2 and child3 children that each could occur in my runtime foo class

2338687
nsuinteger	nsmutablearray
to fetch an entry from a nsarray nsmutablearray you can use nsarray objectatindex nsuinteger index

2338687
integer	unsigned
whereas index would be an unsigned integer nsuinteger

2338703
put	get
if you have a tip using another attribute type i just need to get this data to put in the div let me know please

2338705
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
the idea is that i can take whatever filtering grouping sorting has been set on the existing view and then create other views from that base view in effect layering or aggregating my filtering etc

2338775
post	get
take http post and get requests

2338785
uitableview	nsindexpath
i suspect that the method - uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath is not being called

2338785
uitableview	nsindexpath
i suspect the above to be the case because at one point in my development debugging the release version on the iphone revealed that - uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath was not being called though it was being called when debugging the debug version on the same iphone

2338799
firefox	safari
the second one creates the correct screen shot but it only works on firefox and our tests usually pass on firefox and fail in other browsers so it is crucial to capture screen shots for the other browsers mainly ie and safari

2338805
google-chrome	firefox
this works correctly in ie and google-chrome on a pc but in firefox on a mac and pc it resets after four

2338824
ubuntu	debian
details are in the debian ubuntu package

2338849
int	chars
just go through the string building up an int as usual but ignore non-number chars

2338857
unix	bsd
so you will have to learn about writing a basic unix application bsd socket programming for the tcp ip network programming and the http protocol

2338877
mouse	keyboard
the view is responsible for responding to mouse events keyboard events etc

2338877
getter	setter
i don t prescribe to the notion that a dto should just be simple getter setter structs

2338894
g++	gcc
it compiled fine with g++ and also with gcc

2338894
g++	gcc
i m assuming that g++ is c++ compiler and gcc is c compiler

2338915
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
lighttpd apache nginx

2338926
g++	gcc
it compiled fine with g++ and also with gcc

2338977
client-side	server-side
as javascript is a client-side language and php is a server-side language you would need to physically push the variable to the php script by either including the variable on the page load of the php script script.php

2338981
width	height
if you don t need user output create an iframe with width 0 and height 0

2338986
pull	push
often times i ll start work without doing an hg pull and an hg update. when i try to push my changes i get an error

2339006
translation	localization
this question might help iphone localization is it possible to translation nib files.

2339027
int	chars	unsigned	short
i figure that because an int is 2 bytes at the shortest 1 if you count chars so i should be able to store 4 unsigned int with a max value of 15 in a short int and i know i can access each one individually using and

2339040
tinymce	freetextbox
i found it is the better option among all options freetextbox tinymce anything else

2339070
unsigned	short
in c and for the sole purpose of saving space you can reinterpret the unsigned short as a structure with bitfields or use such structure without messing with reinterpretations

2339091
post	get
if you want to get all the approved post with their comments you can just do something like this

2339122
vb.net	vb6
10 things to avoid when moving from vb6 to vb.net

2339122
vb.net	vb6
moving from vb6 to vb.net windows forms

2339177
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
hey everyone i am new to iphone development and i m not understanding the whole uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller idea

2339219
touchescancelled	touchesended
override both touchesended withevent and touchescancelled withevent

2339291
onclick	onfocus
replacing the onclick event with onfocus solved the problem

2339301
scons	autotools
i guess i need to use something called a build system which might be called autotools unless it s actually cmake rake scons or something else

2339307
hash	salt
state information is handled via php sessions while usernames salt hash passwords and user level are stored in a mysql back end

2339371
getter	setter
getter and setter are evil hey i m just quoting

2339417
width	height
try specifying a width and height for your .xboxcontent - either in pixels or percentages

2339434
udp	tcp
most games like the ones you cite use udp for this one of the tcp ip suite of protocols. udp is chosen over tcp for this application since it s lighter weight allowing for better performance and tcp s reliability features aren t necessary

2339469
post	put
which should out put the post preprocessed version of myheader.h to stdout

2339550
post	get
though the form in the page post fine and i receive the data in my salesforce once i make an identical post structure to this form and then post with jquery i get a 405

2339558
googletest	gmock
i ve been looking into googletest and gmock and it does support mocking non-virtual methods

2339566
post	get
instead you should be using a simple form which has a text field but uses a get action which would then post the values of the form to the query string

2340916

my gut feeling is probably firefox google-chrome ie8 in that order - but i m not doing anywhere near enough css work to assert that that s right

getter and setter are not required in python they way they re required in java

2341239
getter	setter
first you have better introspection in python so you don t need getter and setter to help make dynamic bean objects

2341239
getter	setter
however you have the property decorator which will bundle getter and setter into an attribute-like construct

that said once you get the basics of coldfusion down it s easy to transition into an object oriented approach as others have noted there are a plethora of mvc frameworks available fw 1 coldbox fusebox model-glue mach-ii lightfront and the list goes on... and there are also dependency management di ioc frameworks my favorite of which is coldspring modeled after java s spring framework and the ability to do aspect-oriented programming as well

start tcptrace and it ll pop-up a dialog and by default try to redirect traffic from port 8080 to port 80

2342504
accessor	properties
edit modified my misleading title -- i am hoping to find a solution that doesn t involve code generation or copy paste techniques and rather to be able to write the skeleton of the code once in a base class in some form and have it be instantiated into lots of subclasses as the accessor for various properties

2342527
super	extends
since this mixed list is consuming items of type a or b i applied bloch s pecs rule producer extends consumer super to determine that i need here

2342558
put	get
then to get them from javascript strings into images you d have to use data urls which don t work in ie6-ie7 and are limited to how much data you can put in them

overall width height is much smaller

2342801
ciimage	nsimage
i m sorry i don t really know why your code doesn t work but approaching it a different way and i think more efficiently than your cvimagebuffer to ciimage to nsciimagerep to nsimage to nsdata albeit at a slightly lower level -

2342826
stdout	stderr
i have a program that writes information to stdout and stderr and i need to grep through what s coming to stderr while disregarding stdout

2342841
stdout	stderr
first redirect stderr to stdout â the pipe

2342841
stdout	stderr
then redirect stdout to dev null without changing where stderr is going

2342841
stdout	stderr
the operation makes file descriptor 2 aka stderr refer to the same open file description as file descriptor 1 aka stdout is currently referring to see dup2 and open

2342870
disk	ram
and look at the output you will see logical reads and physical reads logical reads are from ram physical reads are from disk

2342918
hide	show
add next back links that use js to hide the current image and show the next one

2342921
post	get
where page was the page part of the url params were any form parameters only get was supported not post which prevented file uploads and thus made burning the flash a pain udata is a token passed in that was set when you registered the function so you could have the same function serve multiple urls or ranges with different data and resp is a file handle that you write the http response headers and all out to

2342922
children	parent
the real life analogy is typically children inherit money from their parent but parent do not inherit money from their children

filtering	grouping
on c# winforms project i have a small table a filtering box an add button and a done button grouping together and they all fit together within 250x250 pixels

2342974

i know it loads and executes tags when a page loads and that you can attach functions to various window events but where things get fuzzy is when for instance i retrieve a remote page via ajax and put its contents into a div

2342976
ddms	adb
if this is on the emulator use ddms file explorer or adb pull to download a copy of the database file and confirm its contents

nhibernate	automapper
just to add this is an issue with the automapper as i am using fluent nhibernate to build the database

2343144
addition	multiplication
the only reason to use the log-likelihood instead of the plain old likelihood is mathematical convenience because it lets you turn multiplication into addition

2343162
ssl	https
pci dss section 4.1 for example requires encryption when transmitting over public open networks which you have covered with ssl and https at both ends

2343190

if i have a parent table and a child table where there can be one parent to many children how can i go about returning the following xml from a stored procedure in a stored procedure

2343197
stdout	stderr
this api lets you specify a lot of startup options among which there is the possibility to redirect stdin stdout stderr but will only start executables

2343197
stdout	stderr
and it can t redirect stdin stdout stderr

2343197
stdout	stderr
iirc for gui applications stdout stdin stderr are just bit buckets they point to nothing useful and all io to them is discarded

2343197
stdout	stderr
the windows std streams are the ones that are redirected when you specify stdin stdout stderr redirection in createprocess

2343197
stdout	stderr
the crt stdin stdout stderr finally are yet another abstraction built by the c runtime library

unix	solaris
as an aside i know core dumps on solaris and i am guessing other unix flavors can be in elf format

2343334
pull	push
developers always push to the testing repository but only pull from the mainline so they only ever pull in tested code

2343334

it is also possible to load the library s weak symbols using dlopen and dlsym and pass the call on if necessary

2343607
inherited	properties
if you just want to use different properties that are declared in different master pages the you can take nick craver and nathan taylor s advice and declare a base class that would have all those fields properties and have all your master pages inherited from that base class and then have your mastertype directive specify that base class via typename attribute

when the linearlayout is show i want to detect if the user clicks anywhere outside of the panel so that i can hide it again

i already used selectedvalue selecteditem selectedindex but they all return the string representation of my object

i want to get the maximum and minimum values of a nsmutablearray so i can create a core-plot plotspace and graph based around those max and min values

2344252
min	max
you can find max and min values when you fill it but it would work just when used in your snippet

2344330
subtract	add
i m trying to find an algorithm to add or subtract days to a date where day starts from 1 and month starts from 1

2344357
min	max
the array operators call valueforkeypath on the contentarray which gives an array built by calling the same valueforkeypath on each member of the array with the key path to the right of the array operator min and max

2344357
min	max
you could easily define a category on nsarray to give you back a struct of min max values

2344365
subtract	add
once the date is expressed as a number of days it s trivial to add or subtract to it

2344391

2344424
hide	show
i want a conditional that asks if the div newsinfo also has the class jopen then show else hide

uploadify	swfupload
in my opinion uploadify easier to implement than swfupload and it is very customizable

2344520
paperclip	attachment-fu
and you need some file attachment plugin on back-end like paperclip or attachment-fu

2344648
for-loop	loops
in your for-loop add a print the_file before the call to re.compile it is no problem that you are re-using a name as loops iterator that referred to file object before so you can see which strings are actually coming from the filelist

2344699
min	max
i tried to set the tick style to tsmanual the min and max position to 1 and 100 respectively and add ticks at 9 19 79 and 89 and no ticks are shown at all except the detault first and last which the control automatically shows

however it is trade off when we want to achieve this and our user really do not want to have file versioning details when we uninstall upgrade the patches

2344760
inherited	properties
the issue is that when databinding against interfaces that inherited from one another you can not see the properties on the base interfaces

2344795
width	margin
where you replace 1em with the width of the left padding margin that your list items would have if the float weren t present

2344817
inherited	properties
note aside some containers for instance implement non-generic icollection but not so they inherited the count properties only from from icollection .

under linux unix bsd os x posix etc. you can use opendir readdir to go through the directory structure

2344830
uncaughtexceptionhandler	runnable
if you are using an executor framework to which you pass a runnable object its threads probably have their own catch block that prevent exceptions from reaching the uncaughtexceptionhandler

2344832
accessor	properties
also with the newer collection classes the count properties is not virtual which means that the jitter can inline the call to the count accessor which makes it practically the same as accessing a field

2344853
put	get
that sprite doesn t get any alpha and is put above the backing 1 therefore apearing not to be transparent

2344865

jboss	glassfish
if you want java ee 6 then the choice appears to be either glassfish 3 or the beta of jboss 6

2345126
inherited	properties
if that added functionality isn t available to you then you could certainly try to enumerate all your program s open handles and set all their inherited properties with sethandleinformation but that seems to be beyond the scope of a function whose job is to create child processes

2345145
put	get
if i put a debuger from starting line one of this code and step through i dont get anything

2345155
firefox	safari

2345483
post	get
get and post are http methods

2345483
post	get
so you need to instruct whatever tool you re using to pass the parameters through the request body instead of the request url along with a http method of post instead of usually the default get

2345483
post	get
there s no difference for post or get unless you re setting the content encoding to multipart form-data instead of usually the default application x-www-form-urlencoded

hide	show
why not simply show or hide the form elements as required rather than redirect to other potentially-multiple subsequent forms

you need some kind of pumping loop to pull data from inputstream and push them into outputstream

2345988

free	memcpy
since you say or something else in the q s title -- if you choose to use ctypes you can represent a with c_void_p one of ctypes fundamental data types and access functions such as free and memcpy from the c runtime library as long as the latter s available as a dll .so dynamic library but that s true pretty widely these days

ie firefox opera render the alternative text inside img for broken images

2348413
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari also do this but the text will be cutoff you unless you set the height weight of the image

2348433
google-chrome	safari
wkhtmltopdf uses an embedded copy of the webkit render engine used in safari google-chrome etc. to save a webpage to pdf including all images no flash video though i guess

2348459
uiview	subviews
you should be able to add it as a subviews to your uiview and resize it as you wish

2349106
awt	swing
addendum 2 see painting in awt and swing paint vs

2349117

q2a calculating does not concatenate two strings because the left hand side is int not a string but instead adds the numeric value to a pointer the memory address of the first chars of the string

2349150
spaces	linefeed
matches a spaces tab carriage return and linefeed

2349154
mouse	keyboard
however there has been one useful addition inputbinding.command and inputbinding.commandparameter are now bindable dependency properties which makes it much easier to handle keyboard and mouse events

git-rebase	amend
this happens when you amend a commit the tip of a branch or during a git-rebase or apply a patch that includes a â œfrom â header that is different from your configured identity

2349474
getter	setter
whether it is a propertyinfo or the methodinfo that reflects the setter or getter is immaterial

2349480
yacc	bison
if you want to stick to c roots try lex yacc or bison

2349484
getter	setter
the key doesn t have to be a database id it can be a guid that is new ed up when the object is instantiated and does not get changed for the entire lifecycle of the object it is a property that has a getter but no setter - as it is a property it will persist across service boundaries so your object will still be identifiable

2349513
accessor	properties
note that you must do the copy yourself when bypassing properties accessor and that you are copy ing the array on behalf of the copy.

2349515
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
you can use any aggregate-functions on dose max min avg sum etc.

2349519
for-loop	loops
how i can read the following files using the for-loop can loops ignore the characters in filenames

2349550
hash	md5
how does this apply to md5 sha1 sha2 hash

2349572
x86	mips
this could include a emulator for a 68000 or mips which are arguably nicer assembly instruction sets than the venerable cisc instruction set of the intel x86 16 32-bit

2349572
yacc	bison
yacc yet another compiler compiler or bison from gnu is a tool designed to make writing a compiler or translator parser easier

2349584

finally you can also implement your tab to be comparable or define a separate comparator for it and make tablist an ordered collection

2349715
postgresql	mysql
it seems to me that postgresql and mysql are a bit abandoned

2349741
put	get
you see if the user is found in db username and password are valid then the user will be put in session scope logged in and the servlet will redirect to some main page this example goes to else it will set an error message and forward the request back to the same jsp page so that the message get displayed by

2349741
equals	compareto
that said i am not sure if it is just playing around and shooting in the dark but the code which you posted doesn t look good such as using compareto instead of equals and digging in the parameternames instead of just using getparameter and the id and password seems to be declared as servlet instance variables mdash

2349747
int	chars
however i cannot get to cast it into anything useful get back the original int chars and for what i understood it could be because i am in a 64-bit system and the size of a pointer to void is different from the size of a pointer to int the program is supposed to be used in both 64 and 32 bit systems

2349757
textview	simplecursoradapter
the layout used by simplecursoradapter contains 2 textview which hold database data one hidden - which contains the database record _id and one displayed

2349774
multiplying	modulo
as we are working modulo 2n we must also deal with the tricky case where both factors are non-zero but multiplying to give 0 mod 2n

2349777
int	chars
the size of pointers on one system is always the same - independently of them pointing to int chars or void

2349792
subtract	add
yes the iterators for std vector are random access iterators so you add subtract integral values to get other valid iterators

2349820
rjava	jri
is it possible to run r in processing through rjava jri

2349820
rjava	jri
in a sense jri is the inverse of rjava

2349829
jhat	yourkit
you can analyze it with jhat comes with the jdk a bit difficult to use or some third party profilers my preference is yourkit - it s commercial but they have time-limited eval licenses

2349847
persistent	transient
memcache data lives in memory and isn t persistent so is for more transient data

if you take a look at this post over here you might get some ideas on how listeners can work if you post the addmouselistener source we can help with your specific question of course

2349975
stdout	fflush
what happens if you fflush stdout after each call to printf

2349980
tcplistener	tcpclient
id suggest looking into the tcplistener and tcpclient class instead of playing around with sockets

2349981
facade	memento
many design patterns dps for short_ can help you re-factor your code to whittle down the large untestable unmaintainable fat class to a nice package of cooperating classes which can be used through facade dps for simplicity consider for example state strategy memento proxy

2350040
int	chars
if you want cin to behave more robustly read into string s instead of int s and manually verify that they contain only numeric chars

2350129
getter	setter
one thing i have been reading about is the use of getter and setter

2350203
lxml	beautifulsoup
you should be using a html parser such as beautifulsoup or lxml instead

2350270
httphandler	httpmodule
if you re developing using the local asp.net webdev server you must remove some of the httphandler and httpmodule and then add them back to the section

2350301
stdout	stderr
another trick you might try is to re-direct stderr to stdout in your command so that your program only has to read the stdout

2350314
vim	emacs
emacs and vim give you lots of functionality with a bit coarser interface

2350320
google-chrome	firefox
in terms of specific utilities i think having a good browser plugin like firebug firefox or the built-in developer console in google-chrome are really handy for seeing whats going in the specific html or javascript

2350336
put	get
what i don t get is how i can put 23 chars into a buffer that is malloc ed as 16 chars...when i change the loop to 24 characters i get an error though at least in linux with gcc ...but why not earlier 17 characters should break it...no

2350342
pull	push
the reason the pull model works better than the push model in this case is as follow

2350351
free	malloc
remember to free the points if you choose the malloc way

2350354
getter	setter
don t just add getter and setter to everything without purpose

2350354
getter	setter
getter setter on everything simply means that you ll have a universally inefficient implementation

2350354
getter	setter
setter getter are gatekeepers

2350354
getter	setter
many ex-java coders i ve worked with put setter getter on attributes unnecessarily every attribute

2350354
getter	setter
the total impact of getter setter is minimal in a high-level design

2350402
wordpress	joomla
imho wordpress is better do work and customize than joomla

2350407
drive	createfile
to open a partition for raw reads you use createfile with the filename . x where x is the drive letter of the partition

2350602
jboss	weblogic
only if your customer really mean web-application instead of console based application you need to ask if server has web-application server for java - usually it s something like apache tomcat jetty jboss weblogic etc

2350616
hide	show
if the final goal is to use them as the source of an img tag then you could do absolutely nothing to hide them as tools such as firebug will show directly all the http requests that the browser performs so it s not even necessary to look at the source of the html page to obtain the image paths

2350636
jobs	cron
cron jobs are easily done from cpanel. p.s

2350653
width	height
remember area of a triangle is width height 0.5 - you ll need to calculate the height of non-right-angled triangles.

2350670
uiview	subviews
use a subclass of uiview as your controller s view that can load and display either of your views as subviews

2350726

i want to make one thread that puts values to a queue when it gets empty and wait for this condition while it is not

2350745
hide	show
note there are fancier ways you can hide the tabs like using a derived tabcontrol as show here on codeproject tabcontrol on a winform without showing the tab header

2350753
width	height
floating works when the combined image widths don t overlap the width of the browser window but when i set the image style height to 100 they don t float left they stack up over each other

2350754
hide	show
i just want to hide show some columns at runtime of the grid in treeview.

2350788

2350963
profiler	yourkit
have you run a profiler like yourkit against this

2350978
google-chrome	safari
have you tried using the built in developer tools for safari and google-chrome to check if you get a response with http status code 200 from your request

2351014
hide	show
you can then hide the container add the points get the getboundszoomlevel show it again and it should work fine

2351020
haskell	scheme
to answer your question fully haskell and scheme are two examples of languages that do not have standard for loops built in

2351029

pull	push
often you ll only have a single other clone to push pull from

2351093
pull	push
then foo-clone will have as its default push pull path

2351093
pull	push
you can then use hg pull alice to get her changes or hg push experiment to push to your own local experimental clone

2351093
pull	push
these are just shortcuts you can always push pull using an explicit url

2351126
ubuntu	linux

stateless	stateful
i am going through the java ee 6 tutorial and i am trying to understand the difference between stateless and stateful session beans

2351220
stateless	stateful
can somebody give me a simple hello world type example of a stateless session bean that behaves differently when you change it to stateful

2351226
hide	show
just add a few calls to hide show your load screen div whatever

2351233
stateless	stateful
stateless and stateful in this context don t mean quite what you might expect

2351233
stateless	stateful
global variables inside a session bean stateless or stateful are something else entirely

2351233
stateless	stateful
stateful session beans will have a pool of beans created since a bean can only be used in one conversation at a time whereas stateless sesion beans will often only have one instance which will make the global variable works but i don t think this is necessarily guaranteed

2351247
lisp	scheme
this just refers to the common lisp and scheme standards because particular implementations have added a lot of these features independently

2351248

2351341
mouse	keyboard
so that you could change the step size without actually moving the mouse or the keyboard focus from one spinner to another

2351359
hash	md5
if performance isn t important simply take a secure hash such as md5 or sha1 and truncate its output to 32 bits

2351372
getter	setter
when you synthesize your word property the setter and getter methods are generated behind the scenes so there are already functions for and you can read about this in the objective-c primer or the programming language documentation

2351372
nsmutablestring	nsstring
this is possible because nsmutablestring is a subclass of nsstring

2351401
webrat	cucumber
i used following step-definition with cucumber and webrat and everything worked fine

2351443
boost	stl
however i prefer to use boost bind and bind a function to the stl algorithms instead -- usually although not in cases where the object has a state that seems a more elegant solution

2351477
public	protected
stuff such as autoloading which i wrote about a couple of paragraph earlier didn t exists in php 4 -- same for public private protected and lots of other oo-related things...

2351547

2351721
turbogears	toscawidgets
in the toscawidgets library used by turbogears you can do the following

2351783
mouseup	mousedown
there may be differences like whether it appears on mousedown or on mouseup or even on the mac on ctrl +click of the single mouse button

2351783
mouse	keyboard
you should therefore not handle mouse and keyboard events directly but handle the wxcontextmenuevent instead

2351783
mouse	keyboard
note that it will be called after both mouse and keyboard events

2351786
dlsym	dlopen
if however i modify the main application to not link against testc and testd but instead load them at runtime using dlopen dlsym then the dynamic_cast fails

thus if you tunnel all your ssh traffic through netcat you reset the tos of the tcp packets to the default ones

2352352
tunnel	packets
so each time you try to ssh to example.com netcat will be called and will tunnel the packets

2352357
client-side	server-side
i would recommending learning the distinction between server-side tags and client-side tags because while similar in syntax they can have very different results for example self-closing script tags in browsers typically don t work when using third-party libraries

2352359
subtract	add
if it s a fairly small range -5.0 to +5.0 then it will be quicker to repeatedly add subtract 1.0 until you get within range rather than calling expensive functions such as floor

2352387
setinterval	settimeout
to process the links one by one instead of a bunch of simulaneous requests you could capture the nodes in an array makearray and pop one at a time at a specific rate settimeout setinterval

firefox	safari
i am developing an annual report site which needs to be compatible with major browsers such as ie firefox and safari at least

2352538
serializable	deserialization
as a more direct response to your question i d recommend not trying to do text parsing on your own but instead have classes that mean something to your domain that you can then use the json serializable deserialization logic that comes w the framework

2352553
width	height
you can fix this by setting the height and width on #container ul

2352615
put	get
4 stick with ugly schemas and put xs any within an optional extensions element - it nests it for no good reason other than the official .net framework doesn t get confused but it works

2352620
integer	unsigned
the last number there is too large to be represented as a signed 32-bit integer and so you need to tell the compiler that it s an unsigned integer by suffixing it with u as

2352680
getter	setter
your example interface has no behavior whatsoever beyond getter setter

2352689
children	parent
i have a function which gets the ids of all children of a parent from my db

are there short and easy to learn tutorials to use collabnet svn

2352691
collabnet	svn
for collabnet svn this is not necessary

2352691

is it better to use collabnet svn with an apache installation

2352691
collabnet	svn
are the capabilities of visual svn standard edition and collabnet svn equal

2352721
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
i ve heard of some other options lighttpd nginx etc. and was wondering what benefit using these would provide over using apache

2352738
collabnet	svn
i highly recommend collabnet svn use the apache option in the install and tortoisesvn as a nice gui client

2352740
post	get
it seems that the simple way to move the values is to use get whereas formmail uses post

2352777
cos	sin
note of warning you can change the rounding mode used here by directly tweaking registers on the cpu but don t do that you ll break a lot of stuff including msvc s implementation of sin and cos

2352780
nginx	lighttpd
lighttpd and nginx are really fast but i would only use them for static content

2352780
nginx	lighttpd
as a fellow php developer i really recomend zend server for dinamic content and either lighttpd or nginx for static content

2352784
collabnet	svn
however svn protocol is much faster so i suggest using collabnet svn for performance reasons

2352824
centos	linux
i look at the code and did two things to work on my centos 5 linux dev box with tomcat5

2352863

in an openmp parallel for-loop i can declare a statically allocated arrays as private

2352935
squash	branch	squash	merge
currently what i do is to do all cherry-picking on branch x and then do a squash merge into new branch y

2352972
int	double
you might want to change the types depending on whether you really need floats i.e a long int might do for some of these or a double if you need more precision

2352972
mpfr	mpir
if you need arbitrary precision look up mpfr mpir

2352993

nginx	lighttpd
ideal for this is using an lightweight proxying server in front of your appserver like a nginx or lighttpd

2353161
free	malloc
a segfault within free or malloc usually means that you ve corrupted the heap somehow either by freeing something more than once or freeing something that was never allocated

2353161
free	malloc
the memory for those members ignoring any memory they might dynamically allocate internally was not allocated by a separate call to malloc new and so when you free them you mess up the heap

2353162
gtk	cairo
gtk uses cairo graphics library to draw widgets and theoretically it would be enough to set transformation matrix inside cairo.

2353175
folder	directory
what i m looking for is a way to automate this graphic creation within access so a jpeg of a certain size is created and dumped in a folder containing text that s been sized to fit from a couple of fields within the db standard text and a graphic which may be a football or a rugby ball but will be optimised and stored in a directory

2353190
memcached	apc
and we are using apc + memcached as caching systems

2353190
memcached	apc
there are two three main differences between apc and memcached when it comes to caching data

2353190
memcached	apc
apc access is a bit faster something like 5 times faster than memcached if i remember correctly as it s only local -- no network involved

2353218

if you have a dynamic array property so i hope you are updating the jsf tree you can use ajax4jsf - default in richfaces or icefaces

2353590

i agree with mike that this is the standard way to do this but to mitigate the confusion of having to cast your provider each time you could create a base controller that all of your controllers inherited from and have a protected properties with a getter that casts it once

2353602
int	boolean
create function fifty_two_cards_deck deck int returns boolean

2353615

couchbase	couchdb	membase	couchbase	membase	couchdb
update 3 membase has slept with couchdb and produced a hybrid product offering called couchbase

2356756
opera	firefox
there are some approaches that work only on firefox opera and other mozilla based browsers but not on ie

2356770
width	height
the unit shape is a square of height and width of 1

2356840
multiplying	add
normalize vector v into a unit vector and then just multiplying it with the distance d you want and finally add the resulting vector to point a

2356859
internationalization	translation
last but not least if you want to target international audiences take into account of internationalization of the error messages - hence that s why to keep it neutral because then it will be easier to translation avoid synonyms slang words etc which would make the translation meaningless - for example fiat ford the motor car company was selling their brand fiat ford pinto but noticed no sales was happening in south america it turned out pinto was a slang there for small penis and hence no sales.

2356872
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
internet explorer and opera don t support let on any browser version firefox since version 2.0 and safari since 3.2

2356883
hide	show
3.- first table should no be click able only its images for show and hide div under

2356883
hide	show
4.- rest of tables should be click able the whole table to show and hide div under with slidetoggle

2356883
slideup	slidedown
5.- rest of tables also have two images for show with slidedown and slideup

2356899
submit	submission
since the calling app is essentially submission to a queue so that the process i ve written can process it i can have the web service just submit the item to the database or an msmq or another queue and then return success

2356901
width	height
so i d like the yellow blocks to be of equal height without giving table row cell div a fixed width relative is fine

2356965
put	get
i suspect if i can get a hold of the implementation of icache at runtime all i would need to do is call the put method to stick my data into the cache

2357052
post	get
how can i get lucene to return only unique threads as results while also searching the content of the post

2357100
free	malloc
if not use id variable and use malloc and free

2357110
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine on safari firefox and google-chrome

2357131
min	max
the set the min max number of values

2357153
hide	show
first table should no be click able only its images for show and hide div under

2357153
hide	show
rest of tables should be click able the whole table to show and hide div under with slidetoggle

2357153
slideup	slidedown
rest of tables also have two images for show with slidedown and slideup

2357197
inherited	subclassing
you might consider one table posts but two subclassing sitepost and memberpost that inherited from it

2357197
post	put
this allows you to put most of the functionality into the post model

2357197
inherited	subclassing
you can then have two subclassing controllers for sitepostcontroller and memberpostcontroller - that inherited from postcontroller.

2357213
migrate	staging
on a more advanced level it s recommended that you use visual studio to create solutions that are then migrate from your local sharepoint for dev to a staging farm for testing and then production

2357276
eurekalog	madexcept
for example madexcept eurekalog or jedi jcl s jcl is the only free offering from the above

2357289
int	chars
the chars are already numbers binary - in c a chars is an int type

2357309
dictionary	map
you would map the dictionary as a property using your iusertype

2357316
mongodb	dbref
cross-collection relationships can be achieved with mongodb using dbref

2357316
mongodb	dbref
most of the mongodb language drivers has a way of dealing with dbrefs in a neater way than on the console normally using some kind of dbref class

2357347
google-chrome	firefox
if you open with firefox or google-chrome the table header shows correctly no black if you use ie7 or ie8 it shows some black space

2357347
width	height
solution fix a height width for the image

2357379
getter	setter
you can only access a private member of another class if you either explicitly pass it to the constructor if you provide getter setter functions

2357407
width	height
but all images must be same format otherwise height width may vary

2357407
width	height
and if you set fixed size in css width height then the images will be scewed

2357431
width	height
rather than using css just resize the image using jquery s width and height methods on the image element

2357439
tostring	gethashcode
a fully generic implementation generally wonn t have the information needed to compare two objects - unless you want to sort them on gethashcode or tostring which is quite an odd thing to do

2357455
ssl	https
with the last set of rules traffic to except secure.php the url rewrites to https turns blue ssl for a second and disappears no ssl but the url is still https

2357489
google-chrome	safari
to start with you might also want to use -webkit-border-top-left-radius 5px and -webkit-border-bottom-left-radius 5px to get that same effect with google-chrome and safari

2357547
pop-up	dialog
but it pop-up the sas odbc configuration dialog sets the datasource name and waits for the user to enter the information and dismiss the dialog

2357592
accessor	properties
properties are not handled automatically. the closest that comes to being true is that synthesized accessor handle their memory management responsibilities properly

2357598
post	put
i have put up a post on my blog about them there are plenty of resources elsewhere too

2357675
accessor	properties
when you declare a properties and synthesize it all you get is the accessor there is no special automatic behaviour in dealloc

2357676
mouseleave	mouseenter
i know how to use the mouseenter and mouseleave to detect if the mouse has entered the sl box or left it

2357689
decoder	encoder
note the 1 million annual fee for a decoder encoder that runs on a non-windows os

2357720
int	chars
i ve always been taught that if an int is larger than a chars you must solve the byte ordering problem

2357795
subtract	add
i need to be able to add subtract and display the data in feet and inches and using conversion methods just gets messy

2357801
free	malloc
preferring new delete vs malloc and free which is obvious but his reasonining was very well stated

2357807
onresume	onpause
if b becomes the foreground activity hiding a onpause will be called for a and when a becomes the foreground activity again because you pressed the back button onresume will be called not onstart unless a was deleted because of a low memory situation

2357811
free	malloc
using new delete instead of malloc free and oop was all new back in 1991

2357858
gif	ico
off the top of my head image vnd.microsoft.icon will work only if the image actually is a real ico file while image x-icon is less fussy and will also work for bitmaps and gif images

2357930
pygtk	pygobject
i want to do this in a pygtk app so i tried using pygobject s gio.filemonitor but no dice

2357998
cos	sin
if you define x sin y + i cos y cos y i will be the real part of x i

2358002
cos	sin
knowing that cos i+1 y cos i y+y cos i y cos y -sin i y sin y can help if you precompute cos y and sin y and keep track of both cos i y and sin i y along the way

2358008
mysqlconnection	mysqldatareader
ended up accessing raw sql via mysqlconnection mysqlcommand mysqldatareader

2358010
firefox	safari
99 of the time this process seems to function properly in firefox and safari but in ie8 the process fails

2358056
ostringstream	std
in some places i use std ostringstream a lot since it is very convenient for my purposes

2358056
free	malloc
however i just discovered that the performance hit is extreme since adding data to the stream results in a lot of calls to malloc and free

2358059
folder	directory
should this directory be placed in webapps folder in tomcat container

2358092
post	get
no further communication or feedback is presented to the server which is where your asp.net webforms code runs without the browser contacting the server via a get or post form submission link ajax

2358093
jlabel	jprogressbar
splashscreen s constructor adds a jlabel and jprogressbar to itself packs and sets visible

2358095
email	dkim
now i have a requirement to sign outbound email using dominkeys dkim but i m not sure how to do it

2358159
getter	setter
i believe this error stems from the fact that i am trying to call getter setter from the name object when the person object is not yet instantiated

2358204
rss	feed
i have noticed that in google web reader that lets us read rss feed on the web the page does not seem to load all the feed

2358288
chunked	transfer-encoding
set the transfer-encoding header to chunked then output the size of each chunk before sending it

2358297
width	height
2 you need to tell the media sample that the sample is now height x width instead of width x height

2358304
swt	swing
as for speeding up the edit-compile-debug cycle i normally prototype my work in small swt swing applications before integrating them into the full product but this might not work in a lot of cases

2358344
nsurl	nsstring
i want to check if an nsstring is a valid url so i can parse it to an nsurl variable.

2358345
post	get
so if i post data to it with the output 2 the page should echo 10 and i would like to have a variable to get the file contents of when it says 10

2358355
for-loop	loops
type fore ctrl-space to insert the for-loop since eclipse usually chooses the closest iterable when constructing loops

2358375
width	height
is the fontsize dimension the height the width or diagonal size of a character

2358375
width	height
also is there an easy way to get the height and width of a font size

2358375
width	height
so it looks like the fontsize is the height and the width can only be determined without knowing the actual character on monospaced fonts since proportional fonts have varying widths

2358433
google-chrome	firefox
and google-chrome didn t have a problem with this but everything else firefox and ie8 did

2358478
many-to-many	one-to-many
your business rules might only state one-to-many but in reality people companies can be a many-to-many relationship

2358542
google-chrome	firefox
the element is there because if i adjust the sizes it adjusts accordingly but it won t display images in firefox or google-chrome

2358574
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i have tested it with internet explorer 8.0 firefox 3.6 google-chrome 4.0 opera 10.10 both within html and xhtml

2358584
width	height
borders actually affect the height width of elements on a page

2358586
width	height
you could leave small and extra-small out and use the width and height attributes of the html img tag

2358592
width	height
you must adjust the padding margins or width height of the selected tab to compensate

2358611
width	height
let h and w be width and height of your buffer

2358658
versioning	upgrade
mercurial is a modern open source distributed versioning control system and a compelling upgrade from older systems like subversion

2358699
mvp	presenter
personally the way i have solved issues like this is allowing my mvp pattern to have hybrid view presenter that can access many views think ilistview ieditview however this would be more problematic to do if they re truly user controls since they half exist outside of the page to start with

2358712
typemock	nmock
i use nmock and didn t think it was up for the task - so i downloaded typemock as i ve done reading and heard that this was the best and that it could mock out even concrete classes non interface method calls.

2358717
implements	extends
also it has changed slightly since pre-java 5 as the javadoc says that extends and implements

2358723
typedef	struct
typedef struct

2358737
octal	binary
do you want the values to displayed as binary textual numbers such as 11111111 for octal 377

2358745
oncreate	ondestroy
coming from a ms windows background i kind of expected to find overridable oncreate and ondestroy methods or something similar but i haven t found anything of the sort in linearlayout or any of its inherited members

2358745
onresume	onpause
i make these calls from the activity s onresume and onpause methods respectively

2358749
google-chrome	safari
on safari and google-chrome i won t be able to see flush updates updating live on my page until after a certain number of flushes or sometimes it hangs altogether on safari

2358749
google-chrome	safari
1 why does safari and google-chrome lag out at the beginning with the flush updates and then all of a sudden works normally later after i spam flushes

2358750
gtk	gdk
i just checked the gtk source code and you can call realize on a gtk window to make the gtk window create its corresponding gdk window

2358794
integer	unsigned
casting an integer type from signed to unsigned does not modify the bit pattern it merely changes the interpretation of the bit pattern

2358834
fontconfig	freetype	fontconfig	cairo	freetype	cairo
i m not sure why you re getting this error on just loading a library but we ve seen this issue on leopard due to apple s freetype fontconfig cairo libraries calling corefoundation calls

2358851
ready	each
for example let s say on page ready i do a for each on every row in a table and for a certain cell in each row i want to change the row color based on this cell exceeding a certain value

2358866
for-loop	arrays
while i was trying something special in for-loop i recognized that java doesn t seem to like putting an anonymous arrays right as the source for a for-each-loop

2358867
inherited	properties
do i need the inherited and implementation statements for courseprefix and icourse respectively if i m already supposedly exposing the properties of each within the listings wrapper class

2358901
onfocus	onblur
you could listen for the onfocus onblur events and keep track of page state that way

2358949
profiler	perf
after all is well and done i check pages in ie and use the built-in profiler in ie8 if there is some ie specific perf issue

2359055
subtraction	multiplication
if you precompute the constant 2 cos y then each value cos n+y can be computed from the previous 2 values with one single multiplication and one subtraction

2359088
maven	pom.xml
there is a versions plugin for maven which allows you to update your pom.xml to the latest greatest snapshots in visible repositories

2359127
jobs	cron
my issue is - all those email that get sent from localhost to mydom.com by php s function or possible by some cron jobs reporting some issues do not go to google s email servers but instead get picked up by localhost and it s mail server

2359154
google-chrome	firefox
also since it s an internal site i can add the site to the local intranet zone in ie not sure if that changes stuff for firefox and google-chrome

2359165
stdout	stderr
if you don t want to use raw_input or input you could log your output stdout stderr to a file or files

2359165
stdout	stderr
here s an example of redirecting stdout and stderr

2359201
accessor	properties	equals	gethashcode
you are probably thinking about this fxcop warning that you get when throwing notimplementedexception from special methods such as a properties getter event accessor equals gethashcode dispose etcetera

2359228
profiling	debugging
final update after some more intensive debugging and proformance profiling i ve come to the conclusion that between the fairly sizeable amounts of data and the incredibly bad performance of the asp.net treeview object i m gutting that in favor of a telerik grid control

2359243
folder	directory
i ve programed a plugin for an installer package i am planning to use.i ve used apple s package manager 2.4 tiger before where i could right click packages pkg navigate through the contents folder create a plugins directory and paste my plugin plus the installersections.plist file

2359260
cucumber	concordion
today i d include bdd frameworks jbehave cucumber concordion fitnesse... that all help create executable documents that describe what the system does in clear customer-level acceptance tests

2359303
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
if you can t wait for that release or don t want to target that version of the framework the closest thing you will get is sortedlist or sorteddictionary neither of which allow for duplicate entries and both of which offer sorted behaviour you may find useful

2359326
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works absolutely fine in firefox safari google-chrome and ie8 but fails to appear in ie7

2359358
rss	feed
i am using a plugin that uses jquery to pull an rss feed and displays it after the content loads

2359358
rss	feed
i need a simple jquery command that says do not run the jscrollpane commands until after the rss feed is fully loaded. any ideas

2359384
rss	feed
you might also be able to use their wayback machine to pull up news articles from major site using their rss feed

2359450
rss	feed
you need a callback function on the rss feed plugin and apply the scoll bars plugin in it

2359450
rss	feed
if the rss feed plugin does not allow you to specify a callback function you ll need to edit the code to add one

2359469
width	margin
you need to give the ul margin 0 and padding 0 and the li a width 49 for example to leave some room for a margin-right

2359500
children	parent
therefore if a parent forks two children if they both have a file descriptor they didn t close it is now shared even if the parent subsequently closes it

2359548
sharepoint	spsite	spweb	spsite
you still need to carefully dispose of spsite and spweb instances in sharepoint 2010

2359555
cpu	processors
bcd exists in modern x86 cpu s since it was in the original 8086 processors and all x86 cpu s are 8086 compatible

2359572
put	get
you need to put the code to do this in your exception filter by the time you get to the exception handler much of the context information for the exception has been lost

2359605
wordpress	joomla
the proof of the pudding of this is that joomla wordpress phpbbs and many other of the well known open source php applications run straight out of the box on windows

2359637
updatepanel	scriptmanager
so i guess i really need to abandon scriptmanager and updatepanel altogether here

2359651
versioning	upgrade
be careful though -- ubuntu s update manager will happily upgrade this versioning of libodbc-ruby to the broken 0.9997-2

2359655
range	max	range	min	min	max
reason being gmaps reports the min max long as whatever is at the edge of the map but if you zoom out enough you can get a longitudinal range that excludes visible locations

2359655
min	max
the min max long are around -36.5625 to 170.15625

2359655
min	max
my code for finding the min max long is

2359655
min	max
off the top of my head i can only thing of a hack to check the zoom level and hardcode the min max lats to -180 180 if necessary which is definitely unacceptable

2359678
fflush	gets
but in general yes you should close better dispose via using so it gets shut down upon exception the stream when done otherwise you might not fflush some data to the underlying unmanaged destination

2359703
maven	pom.xml
just in case upgrading the snapshot version typically means that you are releasing some code and the maven release plugin provides support for that see the updating pom.xml versions

2359720
min	max
when reaching max value reset to min value return false

2359728
range	max
now an important property of unsigned integral types in c and c++ is that their values are always in the range 0 max where max for unsigned int is uint_max it s defined in limits.h

2359768
width	height
luckily the uitextfield can notify you whenever its text changes and luckily nsstring has methods under the uikit additions that let you get the height of the string given a certain width and luckily you can resize a uitextfield yourself

2359796
pop-up	dialog
i have my server generate and outputs csv file which the browser then pop-up a open save dialog

2359830
firefox	safari
here s my solution to the problem using mootools which works in firefox 3.6 safari 4.0.4 and internet explorer 7

2359842
google-chrome	safari
i am also at a loss as to how to solve this problem because i can t figure out how to use any of ie s debuggers if they even have one and seeing how i already tested this and made it work in two browsers technically three since safari runs off webkit just like google-chrome i just don t have the drive or capacity to imagine what could be going wrong

2359872
maven	pom.xml
i have a maven dependency in my pom.xml as such

2359882
goto	break
the end points of a break continue return goto return and throw are not reachable because all of those statements branch to another location and do not come back so that the code token immediately following them is not reachable

2359885
pbkdf2	hash
you ve hash it by applying something like pbkdf2 or bcrypt to it for storage right

2359892
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox safari ie

2359903
rss	feed
should i use rss feed to get information to homepage

2359931
hash	salt
-client login details are stored as hash securely with their salt on a database stored locally on the server

2359951
firefox	safari
when i try to upload the pdf myself using firefox on os x or safari or ie 6 7 8 it works just fine

2359985
hash	salt
don t forget to hash and salt the passwords

2360021
google-chrome	firefox
i want it to do the same thing with firefox google-chrome

2360042
google-chrome	safari
it works in ie7 ie8 fx 3 safari and google-chrome so no need to handle cross-browser issues

2360095
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog box that pop-up browse to the repository you created

2360132
cvs	svn
subversion or svn is a version control system others are cvs git mercurial

2360139
superclass	subclassing
what s the correct syntax to define my subclassing in a way that lets me keep the typing generic letting me pass they types along to the superclass and interface

2360154
put	get
they don t actually get the real model metadata the displaynameattribute to put together a more flexible localizable message

2360161
min	max
however the processor does have built-in max and min operators

2360185
objectdatasource	formview
you can use an objectdatasource to connect a method to a control but if this control is a formview you have all these problems to deal with and it simply doesn t work

2360209
slideup	slidedown
i have an interface that makes heavy use of the jquery slideup and slidedown effect to expand items in a tri-state kind of way

2360214
google-chrome	firefox
you need to change visual studio s default browser to firefox google-chrome

2360216
mouse	keyboard
instead of sendinput i would try sending keyboard or mouse messages directly to the child window

2360236
subtract	add
incidently you want to add 1 to strlen name not subtract 1

2360236
memcpy	strcpy
or if you want name stored in your record without a terminating null then you need to use memcpy to copy the string into your record not strcpy

2360256
mouseover	mouseout
also if you re setting these on mouseover and mouseout it is arguably clearer to simply use the hover event instead

2360267
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine on firefox safari google-chrome but not on ie

2360274
atoi	strcmp	fgets	atoi	fgets	strcmp
if that is indeed the case try not to use scanf use fgets to retrieve choice and use atoi to conver to int or strcmp to compare against 1 n etc.

2360316
integer	unsigned
if you do not require a specific value you can simply cast the object s address to unsigned long or other suitable integer type intptr_t would be optimal but it is a c99 feature that is not available in standard c++

2360320
ubuntu	debian
anyway for the past year i ve been using fink and apt-get on leopard because i m more familiar with debian ubuntu

2360320
versioning	upgrade
upgrading via apt-get didn t get me to a high enough versioning so we instead use force to make the upgrade go through

2360320
versioning	upgrade
for me sudo port -d -f install expat pushed the upgrade through over-wrote the apt versioning and allowed me to progress

2360345
post	get
refresh isn t a postback there s no post happening it s another get it s the browser asking for the page all over again

2360374
emacs	textmate
there are some old posts out there about how to set up a pure python xcode project like this one but in the end you might be better off using an editor you re already familiar with like emacs or if you don t mind spending a little bit of money textmate all along with a free vcs like mercurial or git

2360404
button	checkbox
you probably want to call that when your value is changing in addition to when you click the checkbox ie whenever you click on your calculator button or on textboxt1.textchanged or whatever and only if your checkbox is checked

2360416
width	height
scale the image to x pixels in height maintain aspect for width

2360472
int	chars
if appends were safe you should get a file with 100 lines all of which roughly 10 000 chars long and beginning with an int

2360489
sequence	permutation
you can generate in pure xslt sequence of random numbers and also random permutation of the numbers in 1

2360495
fileinputstream	objectinputstream
objectinputstream just takes the inputstream in its constructor so clearly the task is implementing an inputstream concrete subclass that reads two files in sequence rather than just one as fileinputstream does

2360591
tinyint	boolean
make sure the users table has a tinyint 1 boolean column called show

2360619
opera	firefox
i changed your language check to use http_accept_language and to also not be case sensitive opera uses en-us where firefox and ie use en-us in my tests

2360631
memcpy	strcpy
the best way to copy char array into another char array is to use either memcpy strcpy or similar methods that accept pointers to src dest and size to be copied

2360640
setinterval	settimeout
side note try not to use eval this is what passing a string to settimeout or setinterval does pass a function or anonymous function instead like i have above

2360641
rss	feed
i m using pyrss2gen to generate a rss feed and i m trying to support pubsubhubbub but i need to add link elements that break rss

2360672
put	get
if you really wanted to get slick you put the database polling code in a backgroundworker thread so your gui never blanks out while you wait for a sql server connection

2360683
rubygems	bundler
i m using gem bundler v.0.9.6 and rails 2.3.5 rubygems 1.3.6 and ruby 1.8.7 on snow leopard

2360683
webrat	cucumber
however i started using cucumber and webrat in the selenium mode to test some ajaxy features of the site and whenever i was running the feature webrat was telling me that the rails server was started but i always got a xhr_error where selenium couldn t find the url

2360683
webrat	cucumber
i just want to be able to run cucumber and webrat + selenium successfully while using gem bundler but this is driving me nuts

2360689
hide	show
i d like to add some checkboxes not on each row just in a control panel besides the table to show hide groups of rows using javascript

2360693
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

2361324
hide	show
here s an answer that involves a bit of mucking around using a panel and a strategy to hide and show the mdi application s main form s mdiclient object

2361324
hide	show
i m more comfortable with a strategy that hide and show the mdiclient object rather than one that removes it as a side effect of setting a property and which would then require you to re-add it to the controls collection of the main mdi form to use it again

2361329
maven	pom.xml

2361403
fseek	ftell
otherwise use fseek ftell function

translation	localization
i have also considered the printf function but that does not work for localization as the relative position of the placeholder can change depending on the translation

2361453
maven	pom.xml
when maven tries to build a project it will look in your local repository by default .m2 repository but you can configure it by changing the value in your .m2 settings.xml to find any dependency plugin or report defined in your pom.xml

if you look closely the errors you get with compiling with gcc include everything you get with g++ plus extra errors

2361547

it contains the modulo and the exponent of the key

2361792
hash	md5
i would calculate a md5 hash of each file and compare the hash instead

2361792
hash	md5
in my testing if the files are usually equivalent then comparing md5 hash is about three times faster than comparing each byte of the file

2361792
hash	md5
example of calculating the md5 hash of two files now tested

postgresql	mysql
i was migrating mysql database to postgresql and stumbled across the following block in ddl note this is what i got from mysqldump

2362182
jvisualvm	jprofiler
i would suggest using something like jprofiler jvisualvm jconsole or something similar

2362199
jlist	jtable
you could consider using a single column jtable instead of a jlist

2362199
sorting	filtering
if you follow this approach you ll get filtering and sorting for free providing you re using jdk 6

2362209
sorting	filtering	jlist	jtable
imho glazedlists should do filtering as well as sorting for jtable jlist and jcombobox

i recommend to read a post about various methods to get random row from table

2362447
profiling	debugging
is there a way i can do this centrally just for debugging profiling reasons

2362452
put	get
i cannot seem to put anything in the url like a querystring off the link to get to the page so i tried a meta tag as they can add this in the settings of the page tab in dnn

2362520
iequalitycomparer	iqueryable
i think its an iqueryable object and iequalitycomparer s wont work for this object

2362531
post	get
get means posted argument are showed in the url and post means they are sent but not shown in the url

2362531
post	get
but what is that related to post get

2362531
post	get
i understand what get and post method is

2362531
post	get
what i wanna know is why do we get post why don t we call it type1 type2 or another more make-sense name like on-url off-url

2362538
post	get
methods get and post in html forms - what s the difference

2362538
post	get
the definitive guide to get vs post

2362538
post	get
get and post

2362541
packets	multicast
i want to capture the udp packets by joining to the multicast group

2362548
post	get
but essentially get is used to retrieve a resource and post is used to create a new one or make a change to a resource

2362552
post	get
so get should be used to read a resource whereas post should be used to create update or delete a resource

2362562
post	get
get and post are called http verbs

2362588
daemons	launchd
for a java application you may copy your compile classes through ftp and use a daemons that scan files in a directory and launchd them in debug may be parsing the manifest of the jar

2362600
udp	tcp
first i ll just paraphrase stevens from unix network programming section 22.4 when to use udp instead of tcp

2362600
udp	tcp
udp should not be used for bulk data transfer file transfers since you would have to build in all the functionality arleady in tcp to make it work right

2362611
bash	zsh
if you have the luxury to use different shells other than bash try zsh or ksh

2362618
width	margin
in ie7 i d like to add some margin to a element that has 100 width of it s parent

2362658
children	parent
note that you can t -- in a single standard sql query -- find all members of the family or all parent back to the top of the family or all children and grand-children

2362658
children	parent
the cascading delete doesn t work out well because the relationships in a family are directed in two ways parent to children child to parent but sql only has one kind of direction fk reference

2362672
maven	pom.xml
this combination is called the effective pom.xml and can be printed using the effective-pom goal of the maven help plugin useful for debugging

2362672
maven	pom.xml
so basically maven is unable to find the url.project project pom.xml x.x because it is not available in central

2362694
children	parent
i considered using a tree structure where each item had a parent except root and a number of children eg like

2362725
pop-up	dialog
a dialog pop-up

2362753
ant	maven
if this question is about maven 2 then the property is excludes and takes a comma-separated list of ant patterns

i am trying to use io.popen in order to put with .puts method and to get with .gets method messages from a process to its sub-process

2362861
webclient	httpwebrequest
i have made a test project that makes http post requests in silverlight using the httpwebrequest and webclient classes

2362869
chown	chmod
php had chown and chmod conflicts with the server the code couldn t access uploaded files or vice versa and couldn t handle urls properly

2362871
postgresql	mysql
what is the postgresql equivalent of the below mysql code

2362943
error-handling	exception-handling
i generally like using exception-handling in that kind of situation it allows me to have all error-handling code at one place

2362976
put	get
now each time i need to put all the params in the request scope read them again store them in hidden fields and get them back

2363021
getter	setter
wcf objects are designed to be data transport objects and any logic that resides behind setter and getter is dangerous at best

2363108
switching	screens
how do you test winform application layouts on a resolution lower then your screens s optimal resolution without constantly switching resolutions

2363128

this works fine in google-chrome safari but doesn t in firefox ie8 and i don t understand why

2363195
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	webkit	gecko
i would say gecko firefox and friends or webkit safari google-chrome and friends

2363202
folder	directory
use activator.createinstance or similar reflection method and put the new dlls in a sub folder of the bin directory

2363223
post	get
chrome 4 sends a get request for the post form

2363223
opera	firefox
none of the browsers i ve tested windows xp feature the behaviour your describe firefox 3.6 ie 6 ie7 ie8 opera 10.

2363226
extjs	mootools
i recommend looking at an ajax library though life is much easier in jquery extjs mootools whatever you prefer

2363255
invokelater	invokeandwait
invokelater adds the task to the current queue of tasks on the edt and invokeandwait runs the task and blocks until completion

2363268
versioning	upgrade
but the problem with undefined behaviour is that because the standard doesn t guarantee it if you later change os or compiler or upgrade to a later versioning of the same compiler you can t rely on the behaviour remaining the same

2363322
firefox	safari
this works fine in firefox pc mac safari mac but in ie8 on pc it returns unexpected error on line 3 or any other line that uses the flashmovie object

2363329
mouse	keyboard
as you are inside the while true loop maybe even user events mouse and keyboard cant get dispatched in the message queue correctly

2363354
bmp	png
how can i load a bmp or png from disk and create a brush from it

2363359
put	get
then you should have a thread collection who will get items from that list and get the file if he timeouts he should put the task back to the collection

2363384
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
in addition be sure to preallocate any output arrays before loops and index into them instead of growing the arrays inside the for-loop

2363415
post	get
i want to code a function to get a list of entry objects whose date field is between a beginperiod and endperiod i post below a code snippet which works with a hack

2363419
width	height
but how do i detect with js that the column is filled ads are fixed 200x200px both height and width wise

2363421
ftp	smb
you could just set up a smb share or an ftp server in the remote virtual machine and then use an ant task to jar all of your class files and copy them over to the second virtual machine

2363421
ftp	smb
copies the compiled code ftp scp smb or something of the sort

2363497
filesystems	ntfs
the filesystems is ntfs

2363539
outputstream	inputstream
you could also use public static long copy inputstream from outputstream to from bytestreams

2363546
width	height
imho and according to my tests seems that css shadow on an element is increasing both total width and height of the page if the surrounding element has width or height set to 100 as you said and i haven t found a css workaround for this problem yet

2363553
postgresql	mysql
i have done some googling and have found references to using linq with mysql and postgresql my other two db options but they are refer to dlinq which i understand to be the predecessor of linq to db

2363602
loops	while-loop
can i return out of a loops like the above or should i use a while-loop like so

2363666
post	get
there is also a copy of this question on the anddev.org forums so i ll keep this post updated with any responses i get over there

2363712
many-to-many	many-to-one
it does not usually make sense to enable cascade on a many-to-one or many-to-many association

2363712
children	parent
but if you think that you will often be working with the parent and children together in the same transaction and you want to save yourself some typing consider using cascade persist merge save-update

2363765
profiling	benchmarking
i think to get a better benchmarking on these you should check the time in sql profiling not in google chrome because in the browser it may be a lot of things affect the speed on the page load

2363774
button	checkbox
but what if i want to apply a style to all of my button checkbox and radiobuttons all inheriting from buttonbase

2363781
portrait	landscape
i typically create a screen for landscape and one for portrait

2363823
integer	unsigned
so as not to waste space on byte-level precision by actually storing the limit as an integer that would require a full bigint for things like 100gb you might want to instead do something like limit_amount int unsigned and limit_unit enum b kb mb gb

2363851
getter	setter
to do this you can t really use automatic getter setter and you need to set isdirty in each setter

2363923
free	malloc
generally malloc new free delete on multi threaded systems are thread safe so this should be no problem - and allocating in one thread deallocating in another is a quite common thing to do

2363926
getter	setter
when you synthesize them you overwrite the getter setter and interface builder cannot bind to them anymore

2363946
google-chrome	firefox
add that script to your page then if you re using firefox w firebug or other debugger or google-chrome you can inspect element to see what s been written to the page

2363992

i got expected output two lines of text on all browsers i tested including internet explorer even 6 firefox safari and google-chrome

2363997
cairngorm	flex
but i am still lost with changing views using cairngorm or entirely in flex

2363997
cairngorm	flex
how to do that in flex and in cairngorm

2364006
ant	maven
2011-12-01 we have now migrated from ant to maven

2364006
ecj	javac
we are looking into using ecj instead of javac for several reasons but for most purposes javac works nicely

2364010
post	get
i know there are many post regarding and it works fine if the action method which i am calling is just a get method but it fails if the action method has a post attribute because in the code we do a redirect to the url and not a post

2364124
memcpy	strcpy
you can assign structs in c using but you can t assign arrays - you have to use strcpy memcpy for things like this

2364141
google-chrome	firefox
i have a form very basic and when i hit enter key nothing happens in firefox but in google-chrome it submits

2364165
post	put
he later put together this blog post that details the process of tracking memory allocations this is important to track because the lag that i was seeing was directly due to garbage collection

2364195
getter	setter
you need to initialise the the items so an auto getter setter won t help you here

2364199
ant	maven
here are many ways to execute your change log including via command line ant maven grails and a servlet listener

2364212
spweb	spsite
you only need to dispose of an spweb object and spsite object if you are responsible for instantiating the object

2364215
tapestry	stripes
velocity tapestry cocoon stripes all require jsp knowledge .

2364270
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works great in firefox and even the crappy ie6 but not webkit safari google-chrome

2364293
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction work and the bracket notation is just a fancy syntax for addition

2364309
udp	tcp
if you are talking about udp so the best message size is ethernet block which is 1496 bytes long if yiu are using tcp leave it up to network layer to handle how much to send

2364312
int	chars
i could use actual strings and strcmp but i want this to be really fast for mobile devices so i was thinking to use chars constants int id btn1

2364312
int	chars
but it looks as if chars constants can only hold 4 chars and the only thing making a long int chars constant gives you is the ability for your 4 chars to be twice as wide not have twice the amount of chars

2364320
innodb	myisam
that means you ll have to use innodb not myisam tables

2364340
hide	show
in this simple app it would be possible to just hide the other screens that aren t show but in the more complicated app there s just too much state information to manage screen information properly and easily

2364340
hide	show
edit i ve tried the hide show thing on some dialogs and it just doesn t seem to matter

2364349
udp	mtu	udp	tcp
with udp arguably the best thing to do is use path mtu discovery which tcp does for you automatically but as a general rule you are fine just using something in 500 byte range

2364351
button	checkbox
so i created a new fla i dropped a combobox an inputtext a checkbox and a button

2364373
inherited	properties
1 first ask yourself if you need another view properties beside the inherited one at all

2364373
inherited	properties
if you need just one view for the controller just used the inherited properties

2364395
fseek	fread
there are about 40 fread in method 1 with maybe 15 fseek vs 1 fread in method 2

2364488
sharepoint	spsite	spweb	spsite
there are several changes between wss 3.0 and sharepoint 2010 foundations essentially wss 4.0 one of which is that you are no longer required to dispose of a spweb object only the spsite object when referenced from the spsite in a using block

2364488
sharepoint	spsite	spweb	spsite
in fact if you get a spsite and spweb in wss 3.0 from the spcontext object you will run into issues with sharepoint if you dispose of the object since the sharepoint runtime instantiated it

2364496
maven	pom.xml
maven can manage your batch scripts by replacing placeholders such as project.version inside the bat script with the current version number from the pom.xml

2364560

when i need to get all results for a day i create a datetime with no time component 0 00 and then add a day and subtract a second to get a datetime with a time component of 23 59 59

2364588
oci	sqlplus
we have used different driver jdbc odbc oci and sqlplus

udp is also more work than tcp if you need reliability which is built in to tcp

2364617
spaces	delimiter
if there is a spaces or other standard delimiter

2364653
jobs	cron
but in general what is the most suitable and perhaps efficient language to use in writing cron jobs

2364653
jobs	cron
does this simply come down to a question of what is the most efficient language period or can the specificity of cron jobs determine one programming language over the other

2364653
jobs	cron
also does mysql database operations affect the programming language of choice for cron jobs

2364656

any other considerations have nothing to do with cron jobs

2364691
client-side	server-side
i will de compress server-side c# and client-side javascript before after every response request

2364735
jobs	cron
most cron jobs i ve come across have been in bash or the scripting language of the system s shell. however if performance is critical i write a c++ application to do what i want although there really aren t many times when a bash script hasn t been sufficient.

int	chars
alternatively you could simply write a helper function to convert a const chars 9 in to a 64-bit int

2364751
post	get
take a look at the documentation for the querydict which is used to hold the get post attributes

width	height
that would essentially give me the width and height of the string inside the richtextbox control

2364972
sqldatasource	formview
i m thinking of using the databound event for the formview to set the label text to the value of a field in the formview or of using the sqldatasource selected event to set the labels to values retrieved by the query

2364972
sqldatasource	formview
the formview only displays one of the two values though the other value is retrieved by the sqldatasource

2364999
listview	gridview
you can even use a listview along with a gridview if you want a multi-column list

2365059
google-chrome	safari
unfortunately the textarea in the html editor control is never displayed in google-chrome and safari both latest version

2365060
interbase	firebird
snapshot isolation per se is not new for me as i develop administer firebird interbase as well - where there no explicit locking and all works in row versioning.

2365065
button	checkbox
simple components like button checkbox and radiobutton are a good place to start

2365106
post	get
pascal sorry for that i didn t mean to just say switch to external server no talking it s just that i ve seen a lot of people on so and on gwt s google group that have problems configuring jetty that comes with gwt - in some cases it s because the configuration is somewhat different than standard because the gwt team included an older modified i can t get any solid info on this version of jetty for example see this post and comments there some quotes

2365142
inherited	properties
if you do find yourself with too complex a hierarchy because the presence of certain properties overlap you may want to look at multiple inherited or multiple interface implementation like the decorator pattern if that is supported conveniently in php

2365187
serializable	deserialization
when using only the serializable attribute the deserialization can be controlled only by attributes and is less flexible

2365229
qgraphicsview	qwidget
qgraphicsview is a type-of qwidget

2365327
integer	unsigned
content-length response header is not a valid unsigned integer

2365380

int	double
replace these with and so on wherever possible here i am specifically referring to collections of value types such as int double long etc.

2365523
ant	maven
if you want smart dependency management then you need to look at something like maven ant with ivy or possibly some module system with explicit dependencies osgi

2365549
entities	entitymanager
my current solution is to use an entitymanager class that maintains a dictionary of all entities as well as an array of actives

2365568
vmware	esx
use vmware server esx - what we have done most recently is to actually build vm images for the server and client machine with a mountable second drive data drive

2365570
getter	setter
i could put events into all of my getter and setter to be notified of changes to my objects but i would rather avoid that

2365630
int	chars
for others say you want to push int chars or pointers of objects you can use

2365639

how can i ignore a commit locally without altering it on the remote repo after a push pull

2365684
width	height
robbie is right for the width height for loops

2365713
sorting	filtering
i think it might be reasonable to say that if two lists on a form have different filtering sorting requirements then they should be bound from different source properties even if those properties are straight clones of a single underlying source

2365747
int	chars
which is of enum int chars float...

2365757
client-side	server-side
it appears you are looking for a way to manipulate the html that is being produced on the server-side which is a very legitimate desire it s just that the approach on the server side using .net or other technologies is radically different than how you would approach it on the client-side

2365758
width	height
sometimes it might use height and width tags other times it might use css

2365778
width	height
you can t set height and width on inline elements

2365785
uninstall	upgrade
by creating a folder in there with the same name as your service app it s readily apparent where the contents come from you can grant access to it without compromising the program files folder and when you uninstall or upgrade your app you won t leave orphan folders in program files that couldn t be removed because the installer didn t know it had to delete some log files

2365787
width	height
do you simply mean you want them to appear side-by-side or do you actually want the width and height to be ignored as tom pointed out

2365842
treemap	treeset
also if you re sorting these items then placing them into a hashmap or a hashset - these structures will not preserve your order - use treeset or treemap instead

2365869
lisp	scheme
it often catches lisp scheme programmers

2365947
google-chrome	firefox
your exact code works for me in ie firefox and google-chrome

i found a c++ specific solution system pause and a really ugly c solution while looping fflush stdout but nothing nice and pretty

2366152
post	get
i m running chrome on mac snow leopard and whenever i submit the form the page simply reloads with an empty form i can see from the runserver output that it s not sending a post - instead it s sending a get request

2366183
division	modulo
i might be misunderstanding it but modulo gives you the rest of a division so 600851475143 3 is 200283825047 rest 2 and this is what it gives you back

2366452
implements	extends
javax.portlet.portlet is implements by genericportlet and all portlet examples seem to extends genericportlet so i assume that s ok

2366524
post	put
it would more than likely be a producer-consumer model which would have the post put in a queue and then the queue is read and the database updated

2366601
udp	tcp
i had first tried this in tcp and it worked but in udp after i send the message and listen for the reply in recvfrom i get nothing

2366653
int	chars
just like int and chars it cannot be null

2366660
uiview	subviews
create a uiview with two subviews

2366660
inherited	properties
note the reason for the sibling views where one is dimmed and thwarts ui events is i m pretty certain that if you lower the alpha of a superview the child views inherited that properties

2366670
udp	tcp
tcp and udp are not interchangeable

2366670
udp	tcp
in short your server is probably only listening on tcp port and not on udp

2366670
udp	tcp
if you know that server is listening on both tcp and udp check the firewalls on both machines and along the route

2366693
daemon	cron
so i m trying to set up a cron job as a sort of watchdog for a daemon that i ve created

the service s wsdl does not contain any ws-security info but i have an example soap message from the service s authors and know that i must include wsse security headers including x 509 tokens

2366722
implements	extends
i like to know which is more preferable to create a thread by extends thread class or by implements runnable interface.and why

2366781
implements	extends
also since you can implements many interfaces but extends only one class you can only provide your own superclass if you implements runnable

2366786
ienumerable	ilist
there is a known bug when a wcf service tries to return an ilist or ienumerable

2366791
pull	push
thus they are able to push to pull from other repositories

2366791
pull	push
it doesn t mean it will keep track of where it has been cloned although your own repository can keep a list of remote repositories from which to pull from push to

2366812
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
i m looking for textbook example of database to illustrate salient features of the aggregate-functions max min sum avg and count when null values are involved

2366881
pull	push
i have successfully set up an hgwebdir instance over cgi with apache and i can hg push and hg pull to all the repositories listed on the page but i cannot create a new repository without ssh and such as it gives me ann operation not supported via http error

2366920
yslow	pagespeed
you might also want to look at firebug and yslow or pagespeed

2366921
implements	extends
i will be generating classes that extends existing classes in the application assembly implements additional interfaces adding methods and overriding virtual and abstract members

2366928
yslow	pagespeed

after looking at the code in your question i realized that you need getter and setter for those attributes

2367153
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchescancelled	touchesended
i then forwarded touchesbegan touchesmoved touchescancelled and touchesended from the uitableview to all of the uiscrollviews in the array

2367211
firefox	safari
firefox 3.6 for windows works as does ie 8 and safari on both platforms

when the user selects a foobar in the list and clicks the edit button i want the foobar to be shown in a pop-up dialog window so it can be edited

2367411
url.action	html.beginform
how can i force html.beginform or more specifically url.action search products to ignore the query page in the url

2367434
min	max
but if you have a large application probably its service oriented or in layers then have basic validation i.e mandatory nullable min max length etc in database and more strict i.e patters or business rules in model

2367462
action-filter	onactionexecuting
now i would like to set up some unit tests for the action-filter but how can i set up the action method upon which the onactionexecuting method should run in the unit test

2367471
union	distinct
union means union distinct and this is relatively slow as it will check for duplicates even though there will not be any

2367496
rss	feed
rss xml validation is not neccessary since we get the feed from a well reputed company

2367514
sorting	filtering
if i m filtering and sorting by a there is no need for the first query to populate b using the line

2367571
put	get
is there any online translation api that i could use to get the corresponding chinese word back and put it in another string2 å å é â œ

2367576
keydown	keyup
you need to send both keydown and keyup events for each key

2367595
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
that works with firefox safari and google-chrome because those are the only browsers i really work with

2367626
post	get
do you bill by request or only certain requests ie get or post

2367695
for-loop	loops
technically speaking any loops will do it a for-loop for example which is another way to write a

2367702
children	parent
and the resource entity would still have children parent navigation properties and somehow access the quantity column as a property of the resource entity

2367716
phong	shading
phong shading

2367719
client-side	server-side
such acts should be counted at the server level the client-side may include some audit monitoring log of sorts but the server-side should be the authoritative source of info

2367727
websphere	ibm
the advantage of using spring over standard jdk 5 java.util.concurrent.executor is that if you re on application servers that need to use managed threads ibm websphere or oracle weblogic you can use the workmanagertaskexecutor to hook into the commonj work managers

2367734
nunit	mstest
i realise that there are many older questions addressing the general question of nunit v mstest for versions of visual studio up to 2008 such as this one

2367738
hex	binary
no you don t need to know any math except maybe binary oct hex dec representations for system programming and stuff like that

2367752
cck	ubercart
look into an integration of ubercart and cck so you can set up your own field for this

2367753
multiplying	add
i m trying to create a class that will allow me to add multiplying divide objects of the same class together or add multiplying numeric arguments to each member of the class

2367759
nunit	mstest
my recommendation is following if nunit satisfies you - use it forget about mstest

2367807
stdout	stderr
running this script but redirecting stdout thus showing what gets printed on stderr you get

2367837
cairngorm	flex
is there a jquery micro-architecture similar to cairngorm for flex

2367869
folder	directory	installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i remember old versioning of office used to save documents underneath the installation directory the number complaints we used to receive when after an upgrade users would delete the old office folder and lose their documents was enormous

2367874
ironruby	ironpython
have you thought about ironpython or ironruby

2367905
spaces	delimiter
seems like your date + 3 characters are always the first 5 fields with spaces as delimiter

2368007
subtraction	addition
for example you can program if you only known addition and subtraction

2368031
post	get
webservices are for the most part just like any other get post system restful or not

2368091
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works in firefox ie6 - 8 safari google-chrome and opera

2368100
np-hard	np-complete
my point being that the problem as stated is so vague as to admit np-complete or np-hard problems

2368103
cairngorm	mate
we recently switched to mate after using cairngorm because we found it was a much easier framework to use and understand

2368103
hide	show
you could easily use that to show or hide whatever you needed to

2368124
width	height
in order to remain a square you would have to change the height as well but you only asked to change the width

2368124
width	height
you could make a new method on rectangle that knows how to clone the rectangle with a new width or a new height and then your square could safely devolve to a rectangle during the cloning process but now you are no longer mutating the original value

2368126
hash	salt
second suppose i had an algorithm that took the microtime a 128 character salt and a random number between 1 billion and 10 billion and hash them together

2368126
hash	salt
surely even if they knew how the hash was generated trying to brute-force all the combinations with a long salt would make it unrealistic to do

2368126
hash	salt
so the salt and random number don t need to be stored just the resulting hash

2368165
folder	directory
if you re using a standard capistrano deployment put the file in the shared folder and update your deployment task to create a symlink to it in the current release s directory

2368171
hash	salt
because the salt adds a lil spice which differentiates the password hash from all the others

2368171
hash	salt
with dictionary-based and brute-forcing attacks the value for plain-text-passwd is spammed by the user which in turn gets hash with the salt

2368225
subclass	accessor
the nswindowcontroller subclass has an nsarraycontroller that is bound to the post entity and a read-only managedobjectcontext accessor that points to

2368264
width	height
you ll need either the two corner points or one corner point with a width height rotation set of data

2368298
post	get
i wanted to post how i managed to get this to work

2368299
cpu	processors
when multi cpu and later multi core systems began to be built more sophisticated systems were needed to insure that lock and xchg would synchronize all of the memory subsystems including l1 cache on all of the processors

2368299
atomic	lockless
about this time new research into locking and lockless algorithms showed that atomic compareandset was a more flexible primitive to have so more modern cpus have that as an instruction

2368318
post	get
scott gu has an excellent blog post that can get you started linq to sql part 6 - retrieving data using stored procedures

2368323
robocopy	xcopy
for an c# console app like this is it better to use xcopy or robocopy

2368333
opengl-es	glreadpixels
see this answer to this question for how to use glreadpixels to extract the image from opengl-es within a caeagllayer into a uiimage that you can store in the photos library using uiimagewritetosavedphotosalbum

2368440
punctuation	words
to leave case intact and treat punctuation symbols as words replace normalize_line and normalize_word

2368466
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview with its datasourceid set to an objectdatasource

2368466
gridview	objectdatasource
i hope this ends up as a normal feature of the gridview or objectdatasource control rather than having to hack it

2368501
hex	binary
now if you cannot convert from hex to binary to decimal quickly either in your head on paper or using a calculator you are going to struggle

2368571
free	malloc
when we call new delete and malloc free we are actually using the crt heap

2368600
maven	pom.xml
add following to pom.xml if you re using maven

2368613
udp	tcp
keep in mind that this also depends on whether you use tcp or udp sockets

2368659
pweave	latex
i have written a python implementation of sweave called pweave that implements basic functionality and some options of sweave for python code embedded in rest or latex document

2368659
post	get
you can get it here and see the original blog post here

2368693
udp	tcp
it is simple and works for both our tcp and udp implementations

2368703
post	get
since the browser was redirected using get a refresh of the page will not resend the post data

2368751
udp	tcp
for example i usually explain how tcp packets differ from udp packets by explaining how we talk on the phone

2368794
put	get
generally you can also put a regular texture through and get decent results as well

2368818
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it can running in firefox but not in google-chrome and safari

2368834
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari don t like the body element to be the target of scrolling requests like that

2368842
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
remember bodmas brackets of division multiplication addition and subtraction

2368848
3dsmax	blender
there s probably many ways to generate a normal map but like others said you can do it from a height map and 3d packages like xsi 3dsmax blender any of them can output one for you as an image

2368869
spaces	delimiter
also i am going to assume that words are delimiter by spaces

2368968
postgresql	mysql
but it is specific to postgresql and mysql

2369009
width	height
the height and width declaration on the body are there to help ie6

2369033
post	get
a flex app running in a view of my .net mvc app can load data fine from another route but submitting data via either post or get never invokes the controller action

2369033
post	get
interestingly the only way i can get the action method to fire is by passing intentionally malformed post variables in the http request

2369052
folder	directory
i ll then copy the file to that folder run my command against it provide a link to the file and i ll have some service that runs every now and then that deletes directory that are more than a day old

2369064
post	get
how do i get these links to call a dynamic function that can return a list of all post in that category

2369075
qtabwidget	qwidget
i have a main window which has a qtabwidget with a qwidget holder for each tab

2369108
linefeed	delimiter	spaces	delimiter	spaces	linefeed
when it finds a linefeed the delimiter in the input file it fills the number of spaces remaining in the buffer for that record record size is set to 30 with null characters

2369223
division	modulo
you need to use both modulo and division

2369233
put	get
the convention of putting the constant on the left side of isn t really useful in java since java requires that the expression in an if evaluate to a boolean value so unless the constant is a boolean you d get a compilation error either way you put the arguments

2369259
ienumerable	icollection
a good example is ienumerable and icollection

2369259
ienumerable	icollection
every icollection is guaranteed to be ienumerable so icollection derives from ienumerable

2369259
ienumerable	icollection
if it was legal or made sense to be a collection but not be enumerable then implementers of icollection wouldn t have to implement ienumerable also

2369272
pull	push
you never make a push to a qa or stable repo they pull or they integrate bundles or patches and there s one person responsible for each

2369280
post	get
i want to get the details contents user info of a post that was made on a fan page s stream

2369280
post	get
i have the post_id variable but don t see any method api call where i can pass in a post_id to get the post contents

2369293
hash	md5
use a md5 hash

2369320
post	get
but when i inspect the post data i get something like

2369327
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
instead of an onitemclicklistener add an onclicklistener to each of your views returned from your adapter

2369342
post	get
if you need extra information you will probably need to call fql.multiquery using the results from the previous queries as filters once you get the post it will have the user and so on and so on

2369347
int	chars
all three has the following members chars filename chars size int size

2369357
int	chars
use strcmp for chars strings and comparison operators for int

2369382
vsto	add-in
i would like to know first what is the difference between vsto excel 2007 workbook and vsto excel 2007 add-in

toolbar	docking
in the past this was not with the feature pack docking framework if you wanted to dock on startup to a specific side you had to set the side where you wanted the toolbar to be docked as the only one allowed on the right create the toolbar dock it there was a setdocked or something like that and then modify the allowed dock sides to the directions you wanted to allow

2370803
toolbar	docking
i m not sure if that behavior persists in the current version but i think it does as that was something build on low level docking toolbar functionality which the feature pack stuff just builds on

bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
or to improve performance a bit more wrap with bufferedinputstream instead and do the same with bufferedoutputstream for the response

2370912
hide	show
the code below is used to show hide a div

2370912
hide	show
the trigger to show hide the div will have the same id as the div and have classes as selectors showtrigger hidetrigger respectively

2370912
hide	show
now when i click on the show hide trigger the code enters the click event above but it does not show me the div back

2370986
int	boolean
by the way is it better to return an int or a boolean in this case

2371057
implements	extends
if the parent class has a variable and a child class extends the parent then the child doesn t need to implements the variable

2371057
subclass	abstract-class	implements	extends
if you extends an abstract-class and fail to implements an abstract method the compiler will tell you to either implements it or mark the subclass as abstract

2371059
super	extends
when you extends abstracttable the class won t compile until you add a constructor which calls super somename

2371073
g++	gcc
edit#3 if i just compile and link the c code with g++ instead of gcc does it make any sense

2371074
superclass	subclassing
if every subclassing is supposed to have it just define it in the superclass

2371084
rvm	bundler
if your gems are installed in a subdirectory of your home dir rvm local gems and bundler do this then at one point this will check for the existence of config.ru in your home dir

2371097
free	malloc
if you change your tid array to an array of int64 s and pass tid i then you won t need malloc free and the race condition is also solved - though this only works if you re guaranteed to have only one caller to your library at once

2371105
firefox	safari
this was tested and it happens in the same way on firefox ie7 and safari

2371176
g++	gcc
code compiled with g++ gcc 3.4.4 cygming special gdc 0.12 using dmd 0.125 but it has been verified to behave the same with other compilers as well

2371195
box-sizing	border-box
either setting box-sizing border-box

union	distinct
edit i removed my recommendation to use distinct because union filters out duplicates

2371312
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the style it s correctly applied in all browsers ie6 7 8 firefox 3+ opera 9.5+ google-chrome 3 4 but in safari 4.0 it is not

2371312
google-chrome	safari
i can make work in safari but then it breaks in google-chrome

2371338
cells	tablecell
i haven t tried it but it might be possible to simply interrogate the accessoryview property of the cells and find the checkmark and replace it with another image it s almost certainly an image. i think that cells style is just a default style tablecell with an image cells that holds the checkmark

2371399
folder	dir
i could do git svn clone svnrepo dir sb-dir if i needed only sb-dir but i need all folder and files within the dir except the design folder

2371405
post	get
sorry for the double post i will update this question if i can t get things to work

2371440
switching	screens
for the moment when you start a game i switching the layout of main to the game screens layout which just contains one big surface view

2371480
daemons	systemd
if you are doing longer-term delays more than say 30 seconds or the jobs are somewhat important to perform abeit later then it also has a binary logging systemd so that any daemons crash would still have a record of the job

2371550
setinterval	settimeout
there is an alternative to settimeout called setinterval which will call the function you pass as argument at regular intervals

2371550
setinterval	clearinterval
calling setinterval will return a value which can be passed to clearinterval to stop the function from being called

2371597
hide	show
using jquery with radiobuttons to hide show table rows

2371607
setinterval	settimeout
using settimeout instead of setinterval is to me often more flexible because it lets the timed code adapt and possibly cancel itself

2371620
rss	feed
maybe it s possible to simply aggregate the items on one server by using a webservice or an rss feed

2371656
jstl	taglib
you can control the page flow with taglib like jstl

2371665
firefox	safari
edit i got firefox and safari switched around due to the mac reference

2371702
int	double
because a double has a much bigger maximum value than an int supports

2371702
int	double
asking for the ceiling on a double that has a value greater than int32.maxvalue or even int64.maxvalue would not be possible if it returned an int

2371708
hide	show
if your layout is a widget this will return a on which you can call show or hide

2371708
hide	show	qgridlayout	qwidget
if your qgridlayout is not a qwidget you can nest it within a qwidget and you can show hide that widget instead

2371709
int	double
the range of the largest int type is still much smaller than that of double

2371733
maven	pom.xml
so when maven downloads a jar dependency it doesn t only download a jar but also the pom.xml file

2371761
width	height
one thing that is continuously getting in my way are the width and height properties of displayobject container s

2371761
width	height
i m finally starting to get my head around them and learned that the width and height of a sprite are determined solely by their contents for example

2371768
folder	directory
am i assuming correct in that you have a hidden folder under your virtual directory

2371768
folder	directory
you need to fake the folder as a virtual directory which gives you access to the configuration button and remove wild card mappings

2371768
folder	directory
then remove the folder as a virtual directory

2371794
width	height
then you could use this to make all videos stretch to width height

2371800
subtract	add
i have a simple test for this add 1 to a counter when call is started subtract 1 on success

2371834
folder	directory
either create the directory programatically or offline or create the folder on the base path

2371868
octal	binary
you can also use #b for binary #o for octal numbers or #36r for base 36

2371878
getter	setter
the property directive is equivalent to declaring both a setter and a getter

2371883
punctuation	words
2 medium add the words to a hashtable then split the input into words you may have to use regular expression replacing to remove punctuation and try to find each words of input in the hashtable

2371886
hash	md5
i have then turned the user s password into a hash value using md5

2371930
agile	greenhopper
jira versions are primarily a planning tool especially if you use greenhopper aka agile where you can have a version hierarchy

2371941
button	checkbox
the trouble is that if the user hits the back button the checkbox are still selected page cached but the css is not re-applied

2371951
children	parent
since when you save parent object it also validates child objects and it contains errors for children

2371999
post	get
i get a 500 response and all future post s return a 500 error until i recycle my iis app pool and then it starts to work again

2372014
clang	llvm
llvm 2.6 + clang

2372022
imperative	declarative
both are declarative or set based rather than imperative meaning you ask for what you want - you don t loop through and process individual items one by one

2372023
int	boolean
c did not have native boolean types so this was an int

2372035
jar	manifest.mf	rar	zip
scan the entire classpath for jsf jar files and use some zip rar tool to determine the included manifest.mf file for the actual jsf version

2372042
folder	directory
and selecting that directory in order to run all tests in it or changing the run all tests in the selected project package or source folder in the test tab of the run configuration

2372098
ant	maven
i m migrating a maven project to ant + ivy it s an arbitrary decision and it has to be done

2372098
ant	maven
the thing is that comparing both war files the ant and the maven one the former has a lot more 3rd party jars than the first one.

2372161
pull	push
this will allow you to clone commit to push and pull projects and their associated libraries as a group

2372193
hide	show
qlayout parentwidget gives you the widget which owns the layout which you can then show and hide

2372334
fadein	fadeout
this way the fadeout does not start until the fadein is done

2372441
getter	setter
an additional benefit is that all your getter setter methods can use the generic parameters and expose a more sensible front to other objects which rely on the fact that you set up specialised fields in the aforementioned object

2372456
subtract	add
the only obvious difference is that instead of subtract they basically add pre-negate the bytes and add

2372519
put	get
by separating the tabbar from the navigator in this case the view stack you can put it in a different parent and get the result you re looking for

2372592
public	protected
java allows 4 levels of access private protected public and default

2372624
bash	zsh
right now i m using because bash and zsh set the environment variable to the last-run program

2372633
post	get
you probably also want to look into restful urls and the prg post redirect get pattern to maintain the integrity of the back button and enable correct bookmarking of pages etc

2372644
int	double
where a b c d e f are double and t is int

2372662
sorting	filtering
check out richfaces datatable datatable with table filtering and table sorting

2372662
sorting	filtering
but yes i forgot one small note if you need to go to the database and handle your filtering sorting on db level you will need to provide your own implementation of datamodel by extending the org.ajax4jsf.model.serializabledatamodel

2372712
vsto	add-in
assuming that you are referring to an add-in created using vsto

2372712
vsto	add-in
iirc a vsto add-in developed for office 2003 will possibly work on office 2007 without change but never the other way around

2372739
macports	homebrew
on ubuntu osx homebrew package rename macports package p5-file-rename or other systems with perl rename prename

2372752
valgrind	callgrind
have a look at callgrind part of the valgrind toolset

2372758
libxml2	libxslt
following the first steps in the guide which involved building and installing the libxml2 and libxslt packages seemed to be successful.

2372763
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie7 comp mode google-chrome and firefox

2372780
free	malloc
in my program i m not using malloc or free

2372780
free	malloc
should i be using malloc and free anyway

2372780
free	malloc
what practices should i pursue about malloc ing and free ing memory with linked lists

2372801
free	malloc
you should be using delete with a new and free with a malloc

2372815
children	parent
so i only get the parent back but none of the children and possibly their children etc - this can in theory be indefinite

2372820
free	malloc
there s rarely a reason to use malloc and free in a c++ program

2372822
button	checkbox
note that for some input elements checkbox radio button the handling is a little weird

2372842
fgets	fgetc
use either fgets if you know that your lines will fit into buffer or use fgetc for more control over reading

2372853
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
you should use new and delete in preference to malloc calloc realloc and free

2372858
post	get
you can get the post parameters with

2372873
free	malloc
new and delete can more or less to be considered the c++ versions of malloc and free

2372873
free	malloc
the malloc free pair are not c++ aware and just allocate and release a block of memory with no attached constructor destructor semantics

2372883
hash	md5
i then observed a difference in the md5 hash of the failing iso with the one that worked..

2372883
hash	md5
md5 hash 0c5c6b7e4e80b66cd299b1dba6a819db

2372903
qstackedwidget	qgridlayout
then for each widget in the qstackedwidget you should associate a separate qgridlayout

2372904
google-chrome	safari
it s yellow in google-chrome and blue in safari and gets in the way of any custom focus styles i try to implement

2372923
sorting	filtering
you will always have memory problems when the java code hauls copies the entire dataset of a datastore a rdbms in java s memory and then do the sorting and filtering right in java s memory using java code

2372923
sorting	filtering
the sql language offers you under each the order by clause to do the sorting the where clause to do the filtering and the db vendor specific limit offset clauses subselects functions to return only a subset of records based on firstrow and rowcount or lastrow

2372923
sorting	filtering
it will always require the entire dataset being available in the java memory because the filtering and sorting needs to happen with pure java code or javascripts

2372935
setinterval	settimeout
don t pass a string as the first parameter of setinterval or settimeout

2372943
jar	war
check out the jaxb versions that you have in your war and make sure that they are not conflicting with a jaxb jar that jboss may have in its lib directory

2373037
free	malloc
should i be using malloc and free anyway

2373037
free	malloc
trying to use both means that you will inevitably screw up and delete a malloc ed item or free a newed item giving a subtle bug

2373050
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s supported in ie firefox 3.5 google-chrome safari and opera 10.50

2373078
free	malloc
in my program i m not using malloc or free

2373078
free	malloc
there is no need to use malloc free in c++ code there are a few situations where you are using c libs that require malloced memory but they are explicitly documented and few

2373078
free	malloc
should i be using malloc and free anyway

2373078
free	malloc
what practices should i pursue about malloc ing and free ing memory with linked lists

2373179
nunit	mstest
as many here have pointed out nunit has frequent updates while mstest is only updated as often as the ide

2373190
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
you can use nsurlrequest or nsmutableurlrequest to construct the request

2373216
postgresql	mysql
i wonder if most open-source databases mysql postgresql etc. have either a hard or a practical limit on how many tables they can manage without being impeded

2373243
put	preflight
put that into a file named preflight or preinstall and then make it executable by typing in the terminal chmod a+x preflight or preinstall

2373309
mouse	keyboard
another remark be consistent though there might be different ways get access to the same functionality all of them should work in the same way i d be very pissed of if copying with the keyboard shortcut did a different thing than copying with the right mouse button xd

2373363
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
if your customexception extends runtimeexception it is an unchecked-exception then you will be fine

2373387
post	get
there isn t any need to use commentnumber to get the most recent comment as the post are already ordered by timestamp

2373400
jruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	ironruby	rubinius	mri	rubinius
also of course this extension is specific to macruby and not part of the ruby specification and not portable to mri yarv jruby xruby ironruby maglev rubinius tinyrb rubygolightly blueruby smallruby or any other ruby implementation

2373456
children	parent
mycontainercomponent is the parent control i m adding the children controls to and mycustomchildcontrol is the control i want to show the transitions for

2373487
background-image	background-color
as noted by easwee the opacity is inherited by contained elements which is why you can t override it and is why i prefer to use the background-color background-image approach

2373567
fgets	realloc
what you can do however is read the data using fgets and check whether the last character is a n or you ve reached the end of file and if not realloc your buffer and read more

2373579
folder	dir
folder the view name working dir c projects dir

2373580
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the gallery displays in ie8 and firefox but not in google-chrome opera or safari

2373580
google-chrome	firefox
i noticed that in google-chrome there are 2 divs that don t get assigned the same classes as they do in firefox and the ul that contains the images is empty

2373606
put	get
the thing is i want to get all the project-related data from user1 and put it in a tree-view but on the server all the files are in the same folder with randomly generated names

2373635
gridview	radgrid
i am using a radgrid rather than the standard gridview but it seems to work there as well

2373659
sorting	filtering
another approach is to filtering the lists by sorting and doing a foldr operation combining adjacent elements if they match

2373699
folder	directory
i am trying to make a web server in c# i need to get the requested url and then list the files and folder requested.this is good to get the first directory

2373710
implements	extends
i realize i can make another comparableandclonable which extends the two but i don t have control over some of the code so i can t go make my future-s object implements comparableandclonable

2373749
realloc	malloc
this application exe allocates memory dynamically from heap using malloc and realloc

2373749
realloc	malloc
i want to calculate the maximum size allocated size allocated on heap using malloc realloc by this application program when i run particular test case

2373749
free	malloc
a there can be a scenario that some memory of 1kb is malloc ed then free and then a memory of 2kb is malloc ed

2373749
free	malloc
so i have to really see whereall malloc free is happening in this code and add code for this which i want to avoid

2373749
realloc	malloc
1 so are there any tools freeware licensed to find size of maximum or total memory allocated dynamically using malloc realloc

2373772
realloc	malloc
it you do have access to the source code that you wish to analyze replace all malloc realloc calls with calls you your own function that would perform the analysis

2373772
realloc	malloc
in this implementation you can perform the analysis and then fall back to standard malloc realloc

2373777
activemq	rabbitmq
if you want a multilanguage standard -- meaning you are not tied to using a specific broker intermediary like activemq sonicmq or webspheremq -- i strongly suggest you look at the amqp standard and related brokers rabbitmq qpid openamq

2373804
for-loop	arrays
then create a for-loop much like you ve done to add as many enemies as you want to the arrays and give them some positional info and also to add them to the stage

2373813
notepad++	textpad
you could try using a text editor such as textpad or notepad++ to try and edit the .rpt file

getter	setter
let s say i have a simple class vector2 as given below note that i am aware that x and y should be private with getter and setter these have just been omitted for brevity

2373872
google-chrome	safari
the following problem happens on both safari and google-chrome so probably a webkit issue

2373872
google-chrome	safari
on safari and google-chrome when c is rendered the form on page c has the type submit button name submit but value shows up as a

2373923
postgresql	mysql
this means taht if at any point you want to change from mysql to postgresql you simple change

2373923
daemon	cron
with both languages you could have them run intermittently via a cron job or you could have them run as a daemon which is as easy as running the script s while piping your output to a black hole such as dev null

2373925
free	malloc
if there is a reason to use a separate storage and result you will probably get better milage using and delete instead of malloc 4 and free

2373939
subtract	add
what would be the correct and efficient sql syntax to add all payment dues and subtract it from all payment made for a specific user

2374012
std	ostream
the std ostream class requires a std streambuf object for its output

2374012
stringstream	fstream
this is used by the fstream and stringstream classes which use the features of ostream by providing a custom implementation of the streambuf class

2374032
put	get
the perfect solution would be able to run stand-alone no big dependencies and require just to put in the api key login data to get started

2374051
inline	inlining
the inline keyword hardly plays a role in whether or not the compiler does any inlining

2374062
imagemagick	libjpeg
the real solution is use an image library imagemagick been the easiest or libjpeg make the file check the size and then resize as necessary

2374063
inline	inlining
if your compiler does any inlining at all it will be able to inline get and set methods defined and used within a given class

2374125
qsharedpointer	qpointer
qt also includes qpointer a guarded pointer and the qsharedpointer qweakpointer pair that implement a reference-couting smart pointer and weak-reference pair

2374164
hide	show
it displays things normally on the screen of course but when you go to print preview in ie7 the only thing that show is longer description. so in other words it hide that first column and it also hide the second column

2374195
subtract	add
the advantage is that you can select the field simply by changing the number enclosed in curly braces without having to add or subtract literal copies of the pattern manually

2374224
post	get
the problem i got is that the values that comes in the post are all by the name answer so i get a list of all the elements from all forms by the name answer and i can t identify which ones belong to each form

2374284

i m trying to create a fast image generator that does lots of 2d transformations and shape rendering so i m trying to use a bufferedimage and then acquire the graphics2d object to perform all my drawing

2374374
fflush	gets
compression buffers the data until it gets enough worth compressing or is told to fflush

2374432
getter	setter
adding logic to the getter or setter won t break existing code

2374470
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to overwrite certain pieces in kernel memory linux 2.6.31 ubuntu 9.10 in a virtual machine using virtualbox via a kernel module

2374470
ubuntu	debian
the problem seems related to ubuntu because the same code does not fail using debian

2374481
youtube	vimeo
video embeded from youtube vimeo etc

2374483
getter	setter
from inside your custom class you d specify getter and setter if you wanted to access them from outside the class

2374548
cassini	iis
if you re using a remote server not cassini or iis on localhost then change the to in the snippet above

2374640
median	percentile
all i could find is the median 50th percentile but not something more specific

2374667
hash	salt
it won t take long for somebody to figure out your hash if you re hashing plain numbers you absolutely need to salt it

2374667
hash	salt
the advantages of a salt hash is quick generation and low chance of collisions in small cases absolutely no need to verify for these so faster inserts

2374688
folder	directory
the res folder needs to be a source directory in eclipse

2374706
for-loop	arrays
how can i take the first row of a cell arrays that contains doubles and insert it into a vector without using a for-loop

2374771
post	get
or optionally use an ivalueconverter to convert get your view from a viewmodel like this post shows

2374772
ubuntu	linux
using ubuntu linux server

2374777
aim	instant
microsoft office communicator is a instant messaging client similar to live messenger aim or yahoo

2374781
width	height
the site i work on must be almost completely liquid - i have many customers sharing the same site templates and i really have no idea what size width height they will want their headers menus or content to be

2374786
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as to be expected firefox google-chrome safari all render the menu correctly and use the supersubs plugin to make sure each level of the menu is at least as wide as the widest element

2374831
hash	md5
you don t have to worry about collisions no integer that your databases uses will result in the same md5 hash as any other

2374838
versioning	upgrade
in the next versioning the prerequisites have been bumped from framework 3.0 to framework 3.5 and we need an easy way to detect the framework versioning of each client machine and advise them on whether they need to upgrade or not

2374869
getter	setter
you should encapsulate the both classes in a containing class and provide a relevant interface such as setter getter for private variables

2374870
pop-up	dialog
i use this code login so the oracle odbc driver connect dialog box would not pop-up to ask password

2374959
min	max
i want to clarify that the min max values need to be plugged into the forumla

2374981
hash	md5
a hashing algorithm such as md5 is not a good solution for this as hash by definition to not assure uniqueness they create hash that have a finite number of values

2374993
int	double
now if you realize that foo should actually be a double rather than int you change it

2374993
accessor	properties
with this design you are free to introduce an address properties internally which would contain street address zip code and country code and rewrite your accessor to use the fields of this private member instead without your clients noticing anything

2375002
centos	linux
linux bash on centos linux 5

2375005
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2375008
range	max	range	min	min	max
you need to first find the range of those values to get the min and max

2375013
min	max
i think you re going to have to run through your data at least once to get the min max or know them ahead of time

2375019
getter	setter
also in java for example you have no way to restrict access to a member variable without changing its visibility so you often find yourself prematurely creating getter and setter and making the variable itself private or protected

2375019
getter	setter
in python for example that problem doesn t exist because you can make getter and setter behave like variables for direct access they re called properties there

2375027
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
the component actually takes care of all crud operations as long as it s wired up to a properly configured data source objectdatasource sqldatasource etc

2375042

g++	gcc
i am using gcc g++ to compile c c++ applications - living on opensuse btw

2375082
width	height
i have a wpf window that contains a contentpresenter that has height and width set to 0 by default

2375082
width	height
when a user clicks a button i run an animation to transform the contentpresenter s height and width properties to 896 1024 actually it does 3 rotations whilst its growing too and this is all good.

2375082
width	height
my problem is that if the user clicks cancel and i run the animation that shrinks the height width back down to 0 0 then the usercontrol shrinks as required but the red border does not completely disappear - it leaves a single red pixel in the middle of my window

2375108
post	get
get is an http get call and post is an http post

2375108
post	get
in fact even lower than that when you request a webpage you have to either http 1.0 get or http 1.0 post or the other request methods

2375108
post	get
actually if you look at the latest jquery documentation get and post are listed under shorthand methods and equivalent methods are given

2375120
post	get
one uses post and one uses get

2375120
post	get
as far as what they re meant for - the only real technical difference please correct this post if i m wrong is that get has a much shorter limit to the query string

2375120
post	get
you should be able to make the exact same get call an unlimited number of times and get the same result every time with no consequence to the server provided of course that no one else has changed the server s state. but remember that there are no technical barriers preventing you from misusing either get or post

2375125
debian	linux
i m looking for a way to list all fonts installed on a linux debian system and then generate images of some strings using these fonts

2375142

2375291
umbraco	dotnetnuke
so far i have looked at umbraco which looks good but the help is poor and the getting started video section is empty and dotnetnuke which again looks good but i get the impression its aimed at non developers plus to has much more than i need and want

2375291
umbraco	dotnetnuke
what i m after is a simple cms system that really just controls text and images i dont need all the fancy stuff thats in umbraco and dotnetnuke all the design and css i can do myself

2375395
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
if you statically link with the crt you can overrule the implementation of malloc realloc free in fact all functions that appear in malloc.c realloc c free.c and or dbgheap.c in the crt

2375395
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
if you dynamically link with the crt you can redefine malloc realloc and free like this

2375395
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
the implementations of mymalloc myrealloc and myfree can then simply use malloc realloc and free be sure not to use the #define in the source file that implements mymalloc ... or you could use the native windows functions

2375406
post	put
rememberme s post describes how this could work - you can still use arrows in column headers - one option would be to put an arrow icon in the header but change the state of that icon if it was sorted highlight the up or down button if the dataset is currently sorted by this column.

2375471
listview	gridview
try pure databinding with observabledictionary which internally creates your gridview datatemplates and will keep your listview in proper column order

2375495
rar	zip

the program files x86 directory is for applications that are set to run as 32-bit while the program files directory is for applications set to run as 64bit so yes they should be considered different

2375585
regasm	tlbexp
in particular i need to use tlbexp s names flag to specify the proper case of my property names regasm butchers them

2375647
post	get
because lytebox requirements include the rev and rel attributes to be set in an tag i couldn t use it to send get post data i ended up going with jquery using thickbox s tb_show function and a ajax call to send the selected choice to my script and show the results

2375729
put	get
besides the js code you get is heavily optimized and with gwt 2.0 the js file contains js css and even images for example when possible strings are put into variables for performance reasons - but these variables are usually grouped together and put in one place in the compiled js file so even if you could somehow get to the code that creates your form it could contain references to some undefined variables

2375738
emacs	textmate
i am switching to emacs from textmate

2375738
emacs	textmate
one feature of textmate that i would really like to have in emacs is the find in project search box that uses fuzzy matching

equals	gethashcode
i thought it was enough to simply override equals and gethashcode in the entity class for this to work the way i want it to

2376003
int	chars
rather you should get the chars at and convert it to an int

2376016

awt	swing
should the tile class extend some other swing or awt component such as bufferedimage or will that not have an effect

2376466
moq	typemock
typemock has one significant benefit over moq as i see it

2376466
moq	typemock
moq and other mocking frameworks like it rhinomocks comes to mind do make you think about your code as you re writing it especially in terms of testability but i would argue that s a good thing further our team ran in to several headaches trying to deploy typemock to our continuous integration server

2377121
google-chrome	safari
so safari looks like os x on both systems whereas google-chrome looks like the platform it s running on

2377140
put	get
note it would be tempting to put a very high value for memory_limit to just get rid of the problem.

2377146
post	get
to do this you can use jquery either jquery ajax jquery get or jquery post

2377157
implements	extends
i ve implements a treecellrenderer that returns a jcheckbox simple code that the renderer extends a jcheckbox and sets its selection status based on a flag in the item and it works well

in swing has more features than the awt components

2377486
awt	swing
swing and awt both provide user interface components however swing is built on top of awt

2377486
awt	swing
also swing is meant to be portable while awt in theory will match more of the system s look and feel

in this case asuming your machine uses four-byte int and eight-byte double the float is converted to a double inside printf the first four bytes of a will be just zeroes and this gets printed

2377772
int	double
if the expression that denotes the called function has a type that does not include a prototype the int promotions are performed on each argument and arguments that have type float are promoted to double

preorder	inorder
the algorithm for preorder inorder is not optimal and can actually be bettered

2377819
preorder	inorder
especially look at the last two results for longer strings for which the preorder inorder approach is much faster than brute force

2377819
preorder	inorder
in any case for shorter strings you can use brute force and switch to the preorder inorder approach for longer ones to get the best of both worlds

2377819
preorder	inorder
find all trees which have a as the preorder and b as the inorder

2377819
preorder	inorder
finding a tree given preorder inorder is a standard problem and has many fast solutions

2378247
single-quotes	double-quotes
you need to use single-quotes instead of double-quotes

2378257
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if i understood you correctly all you should have to do is create an nsarray with one or more uinavigationcontroller instances and assign it to the uitabbarcontroller s viewcontrollers property

2378298
erlang	scheme
i am proficient in java javascript and have dabbled in python perl erlang scheme

2378331
int	chars
the type of 1 is int in c not chars so you are reading bytes in each fread

2378331
int	chars
this is one of the places where c and c++ are different in c chars literals are of type int in c++ they are of type chars

2378343
floor	sqrt
n floor log m sqrt 5 log phi

2378346
children	parent
i want to build a tree to link up those children and parent

2378346
children	parent
1 parent may have several children and there is an object which will be the ancestor of all objects

2378371
getter	setter
could you make the string not public and add a getter and a setter so that you can easily have a breakpoint on the change of this field

2378399
x86	64bit
i suppose i am focussing on x86 but i am generally interested in the move from 32 to 64bit

2378409
integer	unsigned
add an identifier to your rows an id column in the database preferably an unsigned integer which is also in the table you can use it as a querystring in the url you use for editing an entry and as a hidden input in the form

2378441
getter	setter
this will enable you to change the behavior of the getter and setter for the property in the inheriting class

2378447
hide	show
a button to toggle the ime show hide

2378450
post	get
so i advice you to dig you some resources about c c++ cgi programming and probably some libraries to facilitate access to post get variable and the decoding

2378557
forth	compiled-language
x86 does not have enough registers to make compiled-language as efficient as they could be so x86 code spends a lot of instructions and memory bandwidth shifting data back and forth between registers and memory

2378579
macbook	isight
i ve done the hard work turning my isight camera on my macbook into an infrared camera converted it set the threshold etc

2378670
int	double
the type attribute can be one of string int double date or currency

2378677
dictionary	map
my own recommendation would be to expose your api only through the builtin map or dictionary interface provided by the language until such time as it becomes necessary to provide users with a higher level of control

2378680
min	max
max - min

2378680
min	max
your font-size increment would be the step - which is basically max - min spread

2378696
x86	64bit
you re probably trying to mix different architectures 32 bit and 64bit code or x86 and arm

2378733
range	minimum
i am using numericupdown controls one for setting the minimum range and other for the maximum range

2378733
range	minimum
user removes the entire value present in the minimum range numeric updown by pressing delete key or backspace key and moves to the maximumrange now in the minimum range numericupdown a default value to be displayed

2378799

2378831
haskell	ocaml
this list of bindings for d-bus includes php python perl java .net c++ haskell ocaml squeak and plenty more besides

2378838
jobs	cron
in general perl is considered to be best for text parsing but since all you need to do is print the changes to console you should simply do a tail -f rather than cron jobs etc

2378854
getter	setter
perhaps you can add a getter and setter for your tweening into your test class

2378867
children	parent
and since a parent like somecollection can contain many many myitems i feel like i need to have some sort of paging involved in getting the children from a parent

2378868
cruisecontrol	teamcity
in which case teamcity cruisecontrol cruisecontrol.net or hudson are all good alternatives

2378868
cruisecontrol	teamcity
i haven t had much experience with teamcity but i know that cruisecontrol and hudon both talk to tfs by wrapping the command line which is now available cross-platform from microsoft as a free download

2378884
width	height
if you add px after your height and width measurements to indicate the size in pixels the page should display better

2378887
regasm	regsvr32
this replaces the need to registry the com components using regasm or regsvr32 for native com servers in the system registry with xml configuration manifest files

2378929
children	parent
parent contains a collection of children the children may be linked from several parent

2378942

a wcf service would only ever return data - not objects with behavior dataview contains a lot of behavior - sorting filtering etc.

2379048
submit	submission
advantage you can have multiple submit buttons submission different values

2379101
versioning	upgrade
as for a library you should definitely include a versioning number so that applications can link against different versioning and can continue using an older versioning even if a newer one exists until the application has been upgrade to handle the new versioning

2379105
versioning	upgrade
it should still be possible to create versioning 1 obejcts with the versioning 2 api so users of the library can upgrade gradually

2379158
width	height
is it possible with only css to make a block element occupy the whole page busy box when the element is on a non-root level where width and height set to 100 stretch it only as big as the parent element

2379244
memcached	apc
flexibility to either store in files apc or memcached

2379251
client-side	server-side
please read this article with details about client-side vs server-side coding

2379254
post	get
when the button is clicked you need to send post get the variables to the server where the php can be executed

2379259
post	get
if you want to get anything back to php you need to make a new http request and include the data in it either in the query string get data or message body post data

2379326
min	max
i have found how to change the max and min image but not the bar itself

2379367
post	get
while researching this further i came across an interesting blog post that explains how to use a set to get faster sql performance from in clauses by creating list of ids into a common table expression cte and then joining on that

2379398
width	height
that s right the table height and width is dynamically calculated but you don t have to call writeselectedrows function

2379398
width	height
you have to set either height or width

2379415
innodb	myisam
default maximum key length is 1000 bytes for myisam and 3072 bytes for innodb with additional requirement that each column in the key should not exceed 767 bytes

2379415
innodb	myisam
if your table is innodb or myisam with a single-byte encoding then you can create the constraint alright

2379417
memcached	apc
it provides backends for use with a number of caching systems among them apc and memcached

2379506
min	max
you can use the same image for both the min and max parts

2379558
cpu	affinity
i was thinking about using windows 2008r2 and hyper-v but hyper-v does not allow setting cpu affinity for a virtual machine is there any way i can make sure that a virtual machine running a cpu intensive task will use only one core of the cpu the vm is configured to use a single cpu and have the rest of the cores available for other task

2379558
vmware	esx
vmware esx server is an interesting choice since it provides the settings i need including hot memory add however it seems like a closed system

2379558
cpu	affinity
besides these two solutions can you recommend other hypervisors which provide facilities such as setting cpu affinity cpu limits and reservations hot memory add and which allow for custom applications running on the host server also provide apis to program such applications - maybe citrix xensource kvm i am not familiar with these solutions

2379587
udp	tcp
udp is a stateless protocol unlike tcp which is connection oriented

2379611
nsdatecomponents	nsdateformatter
i also tried to use nsdatecomponents instead of nsdateformatter so i changed the code for saving date with

2379614
int	chars
when you create a class it is like creating your own type just like int chars etc

2379649
vmware	esx
i don t think vmware would support modifications to the server but you can get a command line on the esx server as essentially you re right it s linux underneath redhat mod i believe

division	modulo
i have tested some things and for me mysql the division modulo in group by won t work

2379758
int	chars
if you don t have any problem that the file is plain text my suggestion would be to write to file using string c_str which returns a const chars as well as using itoa or itoa_s to get the int as a chars

2379768
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this in firefox google-chrome and opera on both platforms â results are practically the same

2379798
seam	ajax4jsf
it can be a bug in the view handler of mojarra that it should handle empty strings as well but it can also be a bug in the view handler of either ajax4jsf facelets or seam that it should never pass an empty string through up

2379803

2380005
unsigned	short
that for unsigned short is hu

2380041
fileoutputstream	filewriter
without seeing your code this is guess work but most likely you are creating a new filewriter or fileoutputstream object each time you append but neglect to call close on these objects which eventually causes you to run out of file descriptors an os level resource that is independant from memory and thus not adequately handled by garbage collection requiring manual release

2380135

2383135
action-filter	onactionexecuting
couple of options off the top of my head use a common base controller that all your controllers inherit from which adds the info in the onactionexecuting method override or you could possibly use an action-filter if it is not required globally.

can anyone verify that i need to upgrade subversion on the client machine to match versioning on server 1.6.9

2384658
width	height
this is not related in the direction of the loop in any way but rather to the fact that the in the original construct the loop control conditions implied dereferencing the img object to index to its width or height property for each and single iteration in the loops whereby the second construct evaluates these properties only once

2384661
width	height
it s not the loop reversal that speeds things up -- it s the fact that you re accessing the width and height properties far fewer times

2385919
serializable	deserialization
.net remoting does have its limitations such as events and external clients outside a different network cannot access the server internally on a different network because of the usage of sockets to communicate with each other on the network in that the serializable deserialization of marshalbyref objects are tied to the network itself and hence cannot be accessed externally with a firewall in place.

2385919
serializable	deserialization
modify the mono s sources for the remoting framework to remove the limitation and implement events...but afaik there is a snag with the serializable deserialization of marshalbyref objects in that they are not 100 compatible with remoting s serializable deserialization

note on version 5.5 it works on myisam but not innodb

2386022
getter	setter
the self keyword indicates that you are using the property getter setter instead of accessing the value directly

2386022
getter	setter
in case you let the getter setter be auto-generated using synchronize you have to use self in the first example because the object is retained there instead of simply pointer-assigned

2386039
min	max
in that case you will see a index full scan min max step in the explain plan meaning that the data will be retrieved directly from the index

2386810
unicode	ucs
it also is the ucs value of ã in the unicode system

2386810
unicode	ucs
if you use string literal ã and get a string of two characters the string is in fact encoded in utf-8 and you may wish to parse the utf-8 coding to acquire unicode ucs values

2386813
width	height
each cell s width can be assign.but the height cannot

2386815
post	put	post	get	put	get
i try to change the post and get s in the mvc application to mvcapp controller.aspx action instead controller.aspx action but it doesn t work at all if in the explorer i put it throws the 404 to

2386844
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup events

2386844
keydown	keyup
the only thing i can think of is a very tiny performance decrease as it needs to check for event handles on the form for each keydown keyup keypressed

2386845
nunit	mstest
in my current config every 60 seconds i am checking out the trunk using subversion running msbuild then either nunit or mstest

2386864
next	except
the next times the program should do the same except

2386882
int	double
of course sometimes even double isn t accurate enough hence we sometimes have long double 1 the above example gives 9.000000000000000066 on mac but all floating point types suffer from round-off errors so if precision is very important money processing you should use int or a fraction class

2386908
umask	chdir
detach chdir setsid umask

2386908
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux ubuntu 9.10

2386910
config	ini
with them you buy yourself the ability to support ini yaml xml apache-style config and more

2386952
lxml	elementtree
you now have a difficult-to-debug module that looks like it has lxml s elementtree in it but really has elementtree instead

2386953
postgresql	mysql
i don t really know hoe mysql optimizes queries but from postgresql i do know that you should explain a query on a database approximately the same in size and data as the real database

2386977
128bit	64bit
one 128bit load gets four indices from b two 128bit loads each get a pair of adjacent doubles from c and gathering a required independent 64bit loads

2386988
getter	setter
i have added getter setter functions and it is working

2387000
integer	unsigned
why the first comparison fails when unchecked conversion of integer -1 to unsigned integer is 0xffffffff

2387020
pascal	delphi	modula-2	oberon
also anybody who has experience in oberon pascal or delphi will be able to handle modula-2

2387023
filtering	grouping
this should filtering any line with version in it and return as content the only grouping captured vx.y.zz..

2387115
pop-up	dialog
in this example i simply put the chosen list item into a textblock then upon closing the pop-up i just put the dialog result in a textblock on the main window to show if the user pushed ok or cancel

2387147
hide	show
when i hover over a link it show a black panel i want to be able to hide that panel only when mouse is out of that black panel area

2387157

should i even need to put the require command in the model file or is there some other way that the gem should get loaded

2387190
firefox	safari
i get this on safari 4 and firefox 3.6 on mac as well as ie 8 on windows 7

2387210
inherited	properties	width	height
so i created a class extended the sprite class and now in the constructor i am trying to set the sprite s width and height properties which are inherited from the displayobject

2387210
width	height
when i view the livedocs i see that displayobject has width and height listed as public properties

2387210
width	height
i have been able to instantiate a sprite directly and set the width and height after it s been instantiated so i don t get it

2387231
gitolite	gitorious	gitolite	gitosis	gitorious	gitosis
more suited for collabrative development than gitosis or gitolite but open-source is gitorious

2387236
nsdata	nserror
the solution was to use avaudioplayer and the method id initwithdata nsdata data error nserror outerror

2387246
post	get
urllib2 only supports http get and post there might be workarounds but if your app depends on other http verbs you will probably prefer a different module

2387414
hex	binary
the hex manipulator only controls how a value is read - it is always stored using the same internal binary representation

2387421
ddms	adb
so i need to use adb or ddms to pull the database first

2387422
google-chrome	firefox
it only loads the first drop down in google-chrome and doesnt load any in firefox

2387457
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction are pretty much just addition and subtraction

2387470
mouse	keyboard
but it will also have a separate item that is under cursor movable with mouse keyboard

2387473
google-chrome	firefox
why should notepad++ have a set of tabs and google-chrome and firefox and internet explorer yes i have been known to run all 4 along with dev studios docking view various paint programs

2387475
force.com	salesforce
note that the error doesn t happen when you run the tests from eclipse force.com ide but it does happen when you deploy to salesforce and then run the tests from within salesforce

2387490
pull	push
c can push the branch to github where a can pull it again

2387498
subtraction	addition
for example addition and subtraction is now o n

2387514
waitpid	fork
just use standard system calls fork waitpid kill .

2387525
public	protected
herb sutter recommends making them either public and virtual most common case or protected and non-virtual depending on what you want to do with them

2387551
jruby	mri
jruby immediately copied the api wayne meissner wrote two c extensions for mri and yarv tinyrb supports it ironruby macruby and maglev will pretty soon

2387551
jruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	ironruby	rubinius	mri	rubinius
so if you use ffi you won t have to write a single line of c and your library will automatically work on mri yarv jruby and rubinius and in the future also on ironruby macruby and maglev

2387575
ubuntu	debian
the os there is debian i use ubuntu

2387587
rss	feed
mercurial itself provides rss feed no need to count on the ci system for those -- they re better and producing test pass fail feed and build release feed

2387640
versioning	upgrade
an upgrade of mysql to versioning 5.1.20 so i don t think this is likely to happen for me

2387647
int	double
if we try to exchange their exception specification such that a f throws int and double while b f throws only int the error does not appear

2387659
put	get
if i put a space at the beginning i get all 7 courses but no highlighting

2387674
lsp	principles
having a wider specification in the derived class breaks lsp liskov substitution principles

2387674
int	double
to expand on point 2 a s callers expect that only int comes out but if you use a b which because it s publicly derived from a also means it s usable as an a suddenly double can come out too and that would break a s contract that only int gets thrown

2387765
backwards-compatibility	legacy
node.js implements all i o libraries itself all event-based without backwards-compatibility or legacy requirements

2387845
client-side	server-side
the ui is an untrusted layer it is always possible for somebody to bypass your client-side validation and in some cases your server-side ui validation

2387978
maven	m2e
within eclipse assuming you have m2e installed right-click on the module in question and choose run as - maven package

2388011
int	double
sadly .net generics doesn t support a numerical type contraint so you will have to implement a different version of the following function for decimal int double etc

2388032
equals	tostring
i use the above approach sometimes too but it s easier to just override equals on the objects for which you want to compare semantic equality audit and provide an appropriate tostring override that makes it clear what changed

2388047
flac	ogg	flac	wma
from the id3v1 v2 ogg flac wma

2388057
executable	upx
if you are really serious about doing this you could check what executable packers like upx do

2388062
haskell	ocaml
note that - like in ocaml or haskell - whitespace can also be used quite comprehensively

2388072
mouseleave	mouseenter
i would say to use the mouseenter and mouseleave events to prevent the extra parameters but for some reason jsbin doesn t think it is a function

2388103
tolower	toupper
i personally haven t evaluated each for performance but tolower and toupper aren t supported in linq to sql so it seems like compare is a good candidate

2388139
jobs	cron
the default environment for cron jobs is very sparse and may be very different from the environment you develop your python scripts in

2388147
firefox	safari
firefox 3.6 and apparently the latest safari maybe webkit nightly support this through html5

2388161
for-loop	loops
if you want it to compile without those warnings though you could turn the inner loops into a standard for-loop which only uses loopcount as a bound

2388237
children	parent
i need to be able to link tasks to other tasks a task can have multiple children and multiple parent

2388242
post	get
perhaps you could post the stack trace so we can get some more information

2388253
ant	maven
in the past i had a specific use case where maven completely broke down on me but ant gave me the flexibility i needed so i ended up attached to ant but i m thinking maybe i was just taking the wrong approach

2388272
folder	directory
your problem may be related to the fact that iis reloads the web service application if the directory or files contained in the main folder changes

2388273
mvp	presenter
shouldn t the web forms mvp framework automatically build a new view.model object in the presenter

2388285
ant	maven
maven seems to be difficult to comprehend for many people socialized on ant as it apparently requires a very different way of thinking

2388294
pop-up	dialog
once the download is done you can pop-up a dialog box telling user that you are ready for update

2388308
yourkit	jprofiler
i ve used jprofiler and yourkit on linux

2388320
ant	maven
if you have an existing ant file what is the best way to convert the project to maven

2388336
put	get
in other words the payment gateway should probably work like paypal in the respect that you put in the credit card information once and you get back a token key which you can safely store in the site s database since this token can only be used to transfer money from the associated card to the account for which the token key was originally created

2388422
allocator	stl
you can change how memory is allocated for stl containers with the combination of allocator template type and the allocator object passed to the constructor

2388434
width	height
i also avoided the height property in favour of contentheight as i found a strange issue with the image tag whereby i had to set its height to a value i only wanted to set the width really in order for the resize effect to actually do anything

2388489
superclass	subclassing
so should i have a superclass that contains all the tests and an abstract setup method then have a subclassing for each data store

2388558
int	chars
with big int support 431 necessary chars

2388558
realloc	malloc
note do not remove without at least prototyping malloc realloc as doing so will not be safe on 64-bit platforms 64-bit void will be converted to 32-bit int

2388565
equals	gethashcode
i am currently implementing a spec framework in f# and i want to hide the equals gethashcode etc

2388569
int	boolean
notice that c# does not allow boolean logic operators to be used on int

2388569
int	boolean
if you want to convert int to boolean you ll have to write code to do that as i have here

2388574
bbpress	buddypress
therefore bbpress and buddypress doesn t quite hit the mark

2388574
codeigniter	kohana
codeigniter does not have an auth library however kohana does

2388599
google-chrome	safari
this works as expected in safari but does not work in google-chrome on a mac or a pc

2388599
google-chrome	safari
why would google-chrome have a different experience over safari for this

2388683
ant	maven
in other words do not use the ide to build your ear but rather use a tool like maven or ant which are ide agnostic

2388683
ant	maven
given your actual toolset which is far from ideal there is not much community support for the tools you are using my recommendation would be to use ant or maven if you have some knowledge of it for the build and hudson for the continuous integration because it s extremely easy to install and to use and it has a dimensions plugin

2388687
octal	binary
for more about hexadecimal octal and binary numbers in general see scalar value constructors under perldoc perldata

2388690
actionscript	mxml
javascript actionscript html5 mxml

2388711
dreamweaver	aptana
there is also aptana and adobe s dreamweaver

2388711
codeigniter	cakephp
as for php frameworks zend has its own but there are also codeigniter and cakephp

2388724
hide	show
you want to look at the state of a checkbox checked or not and hide or show a second div based on the status of that value

2388778
post	get
the php configurations register_globals and register_long_arrays will use a little bit more memory because all get post cookie are duplicated

2388792
subnet	packets	wan	subnet
if you are crossing different subnet then yes you should consider the firewall as maybe in the future a user would want to access the system remotely a la working from home via vpn virtual private network - that would have the security aspect cut out as packets are encrypted over the wan ...keep touching base with the it personnel who look after and maintain the firewall in order to minimize headaches later on which could be costly

2388820
hash	salt
the accepted way to keep passwords is to only store a one-way hash of password typically using the bcrypt hashing algorithm plus a salt nonce and when someone logs in use the same hashing technique on the attempted password to see if it matches your stored value

2388827
dictionary	map
when i first started to program in c# last year i immediately looked for the equivalent to stl s map and learned about dictionary

2388827
dictionary	map
why doesn t dictionary automatically add the key value pair if the key doesn t exist like stl s map

2388875
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
my implementation uses a uitableview with custom header for the add photo and edit name equivalents and a custom footer using the uisegmentedcontrol hack for a big button for the delete equivalent

2388937
equals	gethashcode
in f# you can disallow equals gethashcode and remove them from intellisense by annotating the type with the noequality and nocomparison attributes as shown below

2388973
uilabel	uibutton
for the header you ll need a uiimageview and a uilabel for the footer you ll need a few uibutton

2388974
rcurl	libcurl
i m clearly not understanding how rcurl works with libcurl options

2389024
ant	maven
first refactor the existing ant build to align it on maven conventions

2389024
maven	pom.xml
create poms for each module create a pom.xml declare external libraries as maven dependencies maybe add them to a corporate repository using an enterprise repository is a good practice in an enterprise context anyway add dependencies between modules

2389025
put	get
what do i need to do to get the bound method to execute put its results into my values dictionary

2389049
post	get
can someone post me the code to get this done

2389055
inherited	properties	children	parent
all uiview children have a frame bounds and center properties they inherited from their common uiview parent

2389096
put	get
or otherwise put you want to get the values of column1

2389101
accessor	properties
the problem of course is with the design choice by hp or whoever to mix accessor with other kinds of values -- accessor are not a good pythonic choice and should be replaced with properties where this call gets automated for you where needed

2389105
paramiko	subprocess
i would recommend scrapping the subprocess approach and using the paramiko package for sftp access

2389106
config	ini
edit adding the config used for the pylons application which comes out of the ini file

2389107
textarea	textbox
just textbox textarea

2389112
post	get
why everybody here is saying post is more secure than get when used over https

2389147
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception	runtimeexception	illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
see the java sdk s use of nullpointerexception illegalargumentexception etc. which are runtimeexception because they represent a violation of contract

2389151
equals	gethashcode
you must override the equals object and gethashcode methods on each class

2389181
ant	maven
you could run the ant script from maven with the maven-antrun-plugin

2389181
ant	maven
that way you can start to move your dependencies into maven and reference them in the ant script like so

2389181
ant	maven
then just start slowly moving pieces of your ant into pure maven stuff

2389223
nsdateformatter	nsnumberformatter
instead of rolling your own string formatting code you should be using an nsnumberformatter for numbers or an nsdateformatter for dates times

2389238
gtk	cairo
if you report is mostly text i d render to the cairo context with pango yet part of the gtk stack

2389251
avr	microcontroller
the special function registers in a microcontroller such avr m128 has fixed addresses the avr gcc defines the sfr in the io.h header file but i want to handle it myself

2389261
disk	ram
files are on disk malloc is for ram

2389310
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	ienumerator	ilist	ienumerator
ilist implements ienumerable but it does not implement ienumerator

2389341
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox google-chrome it goes weel and submit the form after file selection but i can t do this on ie

2389390
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
the normal way is to throw an illegalargumentexception or nullpointerexception or any other that suits your needs

2389405
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
note i suggest using an argumentexception over an invalidoperationexception in this context

2389406
rss	feed
im looking for a search api that will allow me to search for rss feed

2389406
rss	feed
it will either be a regular search feed that then returns the content type - allowing me to filter by rss items only or a special rss-only index

2389420
ati	nvidia
this would be the best way to start especially if you have an ati card and run it on a friend s nvidia card or vice versa

2389518
width	height
scroll down to the position group of properties and specify the width and height there

2389540
children	parent
i know about parent selector and parent selector but these select the parent and not the children with the parent

2389551
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the script functions perfectly in the several browsers tested firefox safari mobile safari fennec ie google-chrome midori etc.

2389648
folder	directory
just select build from the context menu right-click your project node and the jar file will be created inside a dist directory in project folder

2389653
google-chrome	firefox
however i saw no difference between firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 3.0.195.38

2389662
maven	pom.xml
i used the following maven pom.xml to resolve the dependencies

2389700
put	get
the more data you put to the skeleton the more outdated or meaningless or mistaken data you may get there

2389702
single-quotes	double-quotes
what looks non-standard to me based on the definition is the lack of double-quotes around the keys and single-quotes instead of double-quotes wrapping the string values

2389750
width	height
width and height emphatically given

2389812
gtk	gio
here s a trivial drive monitor i wrote in c that uses gtk and gio

2389817
updatepanel	scriptmanager
no you can use it without an updatepanel but you still need a scriptmanager

2389818
min	max
the caption the window borders the min max close boxes

2389819
mouseup	mousedown
however i don t know how to compare the elements triggered on mousedown mouseup after they ve been wrapped in jquery

2389820
struts	stripes
in your case you don t need web gui - you have an applet so web framework like stripes struts etc

2389853
swt	swing
i have only swing experience but swt will not be a problem for me

2389876
many-to-one	one-to-many
when one-to-many many-to-one bi-directional inverse true on owner.cats

2389888
strlen	substr
i heard that in php there are some alternatives for the functions substr and strlen which handles safer bits

2389912
observer-pattern	chain-of-responsibility
you can use a publish subscribe mechanism aka observer-pattern or the chain-of-responsibility patten to decouple model or parts thereof from the different parts of the view

2389912
puts	gets
or as jbrains puts it stop subclassing or the kitten gets it

2389915
multibyte	substr	strlen	substr
because substr and strlen are not safe for multibyte encodings

2389929
bazaar	git
this is a good read that applies to git hg bazaar etc

2389930
free	malloc
actually if your native c includes regular calls to malloc and free any kind of gargage collected language like vb.net is going to literally run circles around it

2389930
cpu	processors
then you can run a solver per processors 2 per ht cpu or network computers

2389964
width	height
the following code create a new anonymous object that contains the label name width and height

2389990
versioning	upgrade
i am working on getting x-forward-for to work on tomcat 5.5.25 i know a patch has gone out for tomcat 6.0.24 but we can t upgrade our tomcat versioning right now

2390031
public	protected
no public means a kind of protected while the keyword protected is prohibited weird huh

2390032
versioning	upgrade
when they open those files generated by php modify them with excel and save those changes excel ask to upgrade the file format because it was saved to versioning 5.0 95

2390055
division	multiplication
50 points on the slider then correspond to division or multiplication by four so you can set

2390070
vmware	virtualbox
uml is light because it s a native application not heavy virtualisation vmware virtualbox qemu neither para-virtualisation xen

2390077
required	placeholder
you might not like that solution though because it still required that you place placeholder views in the appropriate locations and connect them up even though their content is copied automatically

2390080
free	malloc
as was mentioned i would not trust the memory usage reported by the task manager as there are other factors beyond your control that impact it how malloc free are implemented etc

2390080
free	malloc
one way you can test for memory leaks is by writing your own wrapper functions around the existing malloc and free functions similar to

2390094
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i develop using snow leopard and the font appears fine in safari firefox and google-chrome

2390163
awt	swing
i know some fairly low-level libraries awt swing jogl sdl

2390174
int	chars
this line parses the input buffer for chars input that can be converted to an int

2390229
codeigniter	kohana
some frameworks codeigniter and a fork kohana have lightweight designs they do not load a lot of code by default

2390242
igraph	networkx
igraph has built-in support for this algorithm as does networkx i believe and is really fast

2390247
maven	m2e
in fact i think that somehow this is eclipse in its own right as i don t have m2e or using maven for this

2390410
sharepoint	spsite
if you create an instance of an spsite object by passing an url into its constructor the sharepoint api will create a valid object out of that

2390442
multiplying	add
to multiplying add partial products from the shifted multiplicand to an accumulator iff the corresponding bit in the multiplier is set

2390453
getter	setter
one possibility is to hide the variable as a property and use a singleton in the setter getter functions but i don t know if there is a simple way

2390469
getter	setter
create a class that has the fields you require along with the relevant getter and setter

2390471
google-chrome	safari
the only thing i ve had problem with is that google-chrome safari won t accept tags in the data

2390482
persistent	transient
the distinction is between transient and persistent objects and persistent objects are synchronized with the database when the session is flushed an possibly at other times

2390524
put	get
our answer to that was to put the value in a double precision variable and do a dint on it to get rid of any fractional parts

2390524
int	double
the results are an int placed in a double precision variable

2390524
int	double
the function is a double precision int function and this will allow for very large int up to 17 digits

2390527
svg	vml
other vector graphics alternatives are the currently hated sigh flash ie s vml directly coded to and svg if a browser supports it

2390532
opera	firefox
and the text-align-right is being ignored both in firefox and opera

2390543
public	protected
i tried public private protected and internal

2390546
getter	setter
you should add class-level getter setter to encapsulate access to the static global variable

2390548
division	multiplication
it turns out that i still have some old 68000 assembler code for long multiplication and long division

2390587
stdout	stderr
but at the same time also giving back the stdout and stderr

2390592
versioning	upgrade
java se 6 contains jax-ws 2.1 se 6 upgrade 3 and older versioning contain jax-ws 2.0

2390593
switching	screens
i m wondering if there is an easier way to switching between screens

2390601
nunit	mstest
a similar feature exists for mstest implemented by the same person who did it for nunit but does not ship with mstest

2390631
google-chrome	safari
for some reason if i go directly to the blog address google-chrome and safari fail to display all of my background images.

2390660
pull	push
if you want to be able to push to pull from each other while offsite you re going to need some kind of vpn so your laptops can talk to each other

2390673
post	get
well when i go there in firefox i get an error saying no post match my query which make me wonder if your server isn t set up right

2390691
width	height
chrome doesn t resize the window to the specified height and width and also the location bar is still visible

2390691
width	height
firefox resizes the window to the appropriate height width but also shows the location bar

2390691
width	height
is there something wrong with the code that i m using in order to make a new popup window with a fixed width height that has the location bar menu bar scroll bar status bars disabled

2390698
sequence	permutation
i didn t explore all the permutation here you can probably just use the guid-based name in the .add call but to be explicit this is the sequence that worked for me

2390720
int	chars
there is code in this website to get a list of all permutations of an array see method perm2 it is coded for chars arrays but can be modified to do int arrays as well and to other languages as well then you can use mjv s idea

2390753
getter	setter
if i had coded this in php or java i would probably have opted to create getter setter methods to protect the data and give me the flexibility to handle this in the domain model itself

post	get
delete isn t supported without javascript and therefore you would have to use get or post which both do have a totally different meaning from delete in rest anyway

2391864

you can often keep the association as a one-way relationship by letting the children raise events instead of explicitly referencing their parent

2393129
wxpython	pyqt
to my tastes it seems that wxpython s tutorial the new one in wiki form is what i m pointing to and recommending is really good and pyqt s not bad at all

2393142
width	height
it seems you might have to modify the height and width

2393155

that s fairly rare btw lots of control property getter and setter generate a windows message to ask the native window control for the property value

2393330
children	parent
since each child is a person it can have a parent or its own children

i think its search option has one choice where it says get products tagged with gives you a box to put in your idea of what a tag could be which shows you a dropdown of tags it finds matching - same as stackoverflow

2393564
int	chars	int	double
valid types are primitives int double byte chars etc. and of course objects such as string or calendar or whatever class you might be using

2393590
rss	feed

however if i import as an existing maven project or use mvn eclipse eclipse and then import i get the artifacts not found in my pom.xml file resulting in no maven dependencies being loaded at all

2393685
children	parent
what s odd is that i have 2 projects both children to a parent pom packaged project

2393685
maven	pom.xml
one child loads all my maven dependencies while the other cannot find any and says my pom.xml file is missing artifacts

2393685
maven	pom.xml
as soon as i remove the dependency of projecta from projectb s pom.xml file all the maven dependencies are found by eclipse

2393768

i had problems with using m2e it did not appear to be installed at all but i develop a project using iam - maven plugin for eclipse supported by eclipse foundation or hosted or something like that

2393810
maven	m2e
it sounds like your m2e install is using the embedded maven which has its own repository located under user home and settings

2393824
switching	screens
i understand how to switching views from say the home screens

2393839
nsmutablestring	nsstring
thus at runtime you ll note that you never actually have an instance of nsstring or nsmutablestring but only instances of subclasses which actually aren t really subclasses.

2393839
nsmutablestring	nsstring
and those subclasses -- the implementation class used at runtime -- overrides almost all of the methods of nsstring and nsmutablestring to provide highly optimized implementations of the specific operations

2393843
fadein	fadeout
i m trying to use the following code to make an image fadeout and only when it s faded out change its source and then make it fadein again

rewrite the for-loop to check for already-uncompressed files to be a single if-statement

2393888
put	get
i m trying to update a random-access binary file using the std iostream interface with separate get put positions managed via seekg seekp

2393888
put	get
everything works fine with stringstream but when i create a file descriptor-based stream using boost.iostream specifically boost iostreams stream boost iostreams file_descriptor the get put positions are no longer independent

2393888
stringstream	fstream
i gather from web searches that stringstream seems to be independent but that fstream may not be

2393941
lxml	beautifulsoup
lxml and beautifulsoup attempt to mimic this level of stupidity so they are the correct tools to use

2393971
rubygems	bundler

2393989
nunit	mstest
jim implented a version of assert.throws for mstest at the same time as he did the original implementation for nunit nunit has included in subsequent releases mstest has not its still possible to use though

2393989
nunit	mstest
nunit can run tests in 32 and 64 bit mstest only runs them in 32 bit iirc

2393989
nunit	mstest
correct there is a lot of misconception that mstest is the same as nunit but mstest is a generalized framework

2393991
int	boolean
evalueates to boolean but evaluates to int as assignments always evaluate to the assigned values

2394011
int	chars
the strchr function in the c standard library looks for a chars in a string but its signature takes an int for the search chars

int	chars
in these two implementations i found the implementation casts this int to a chars

2394012
mouse	keyboard
value due to mouse or keyboard

2394015
disk	ram
no hit to the disk everything is in ram

2394023

int	chars
in some situations in the c library such as the getc function an int value is returned for the chars read from input

2394031
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your rubygems versioning this is fixed as of rubygems 1.3.6

2394035
ddms	adb
in general use adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse to look at the java stack trace associated with the force close dialog to see what the problem is

2394046
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
the changed property from freezable class is not included - use inotifypropertychanged and or inotifycollectionchanged instead

mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
i m working on a web app where i support dragging on the page by simply watching for mousedown mousemove mouseup events

2394121
int	chars
when the parameters are undeclared whenever you pass a chars value as an argument this value is implicitly converted to int and actually physically passed as an int

2394121
int	chars
in order to preserve and reproduce the traditional functionality of strchr as described above we have no other choice but to declare the parameter of strchr as an int and explicitly convert it to chars inside the function

2394121
int	double
all these functions will be declared with parameters of type int or double instead

2394121
int	chars
an argument formerly declared as chars is now written as int

2394132
bazaar	git
git and mercurial are distributed rcss like bazaar that have tools for hooks including different approaches to branch-specific hooks and global hooks

boost	stl
you can use lexecal_cast from boost then c itoa and of course stringstream from stl

2394174
postgresql	mysql
as database backend you can use mysql if the structure is simple but for more complex databases i d use postgresql as the mysql performance seems to drop fast with increasing complexity subjective opinion

bmp	png
i m having a lot of difficulty creating and writing bmp or png images in java

2394192
bmp	png
java says png bmp and others are supported on my system according to the filetypessupported method

2394192
bmp	png
here is my code for if i were to write a png with a lot snipped out and the bmp writing

2394197
getter	setter
for example calling setproperty or getproperty on the object would be slower than using an integer -- especially if that property is bound to a getter or setter method

2394200
integer	unsigned
the reason that the type is called uintptr_t is because the type is an unsigned integer value that is the same width as a pointer

2394249
opera	google-chrome
using the code below both google-chrome and opera latest versions supporting border-radius on mac show a small blue area outside the rounded corners which seems to a part of the defined background-image

2394260
width	height
if i increment the width and i recalculate the height according to the incremented width ratio sometimes i get xxx.5 decimals for the width

2394260
width	height
ex. width 4 height 2

2394281
implements	extends
this can happen when class a depends on object of class interface d which will be returned by b from factory method which will be object of class interface c which extends implements d

2394298
google-chrome	firefox
ok this works in firefox ie8 and google-chrome

2394302
width	height
the next biggest image has width w + w g and height h + h g

2394303
integer	fractions
now if you want the next largest integer fractions with the same ration then multiple the numerator and denominator by d+1

2394331
implements	modifiers
what you have to implements is that event processing object which will according to an even and modifiers call the right behaviour event+modifier handler

2394370
width	height
i want the scrollbars of the scrollviewer to show up when i zoom in enough such that the canvas is no longer visible in the scrollviewer area but it seems that they only show up depending on the width height of the canvas itself regardless of whether it is zoomed in or not

2394391

okay so i have a website where the user can put a search query into a form that uses get to send the data

2394431
hash	salt
algorithm salt hash

2394431
hash	salt
the algorithm is sha1 the salt which was generated randomly is 63a11 and the crypted hash is 85a93f217a72212b23fb0d5b95f3856db9575c1a

2394431
hash	salt
you simple concatenate the salt and the raw password and hash it with the algorithm in this case sha1

2394448
for-loop	loops
so what is wrong with the for-loop that causes either an infinite loops or seg fault

2394472
lxml	beautifulsoup
for a table that s simply logically broken though it may look ok when rendered the browser and therefore selenium may be just as helpless as lxml or beautifulsoup

2394473
button	checkbox
like checkbox radio button div

2394478
folder	directory
you could also put folder monitoring software on the severs that keep certain directory in sync

2394481
int	chars
which assumes that the primary key column is an 11 chars int rather than a 36 chars string so running migrations produces a correct database but test database is generated incorrectly and if i were to run rake db schema load it would fail as well.

2394483
google-chrome	firefox
ubuntu 9.10 firefox 3.6 google-chrome 5.0.307.11

2394581
std	ostream
shape put std ostream const

2394589
width	height
however the ones you mention name width and height are all common to tcontrol and it should not be necessary to cast to access these

2394612
put	get
off the top of my head and without trying it you should be able to put the resources in with the source files which will get netbeans to put them into the jar file

2394626
width	height
note if fixedsize true is indeed set in your code then it also means that you have set width and height values for some or all of your nodes

width	height
as long as you change the fixedsize value to false you do not have to change the height and width values because with fixedsize set to false these values just set the initial minimum height and width values passed to the layout algorithm.

2394640
fseek	fread
that said if you read a block at a time you do save on call overheads to the fseek and fread functions

2394649
getter	setter
you must implement the property getter and setter by hand.

2394672
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome but not on firefox nor ie

2394772
phpdoc	codesniffer
no idea if it s any help but if codesniffer can point out the functions methods then a decent php ide i offer phped can easily inspect and scaffold the phpdoc comments for each function

2394788
put	get
the first is that if you put those integers back together you ll get

2394834
min	max
how do i set the background color for the entire slider not just from the min or max to the selected value

2394889
range	minimum
you can leave either datetime value null or perhaps set it to maximum or minimum value to represent half-infinite range like after 1900

2394890
google-chrome	firefox
eta 3 current tests indicate a speed savings using offsetwidth rather than getcalculatedstyle currentstyle of 2ms 1.8 in google-chrome and 24ms 4.3 in firefox which isn t the 10 i wanted for a solid bounty win

2394894
onclick	onkeyup
the on... attributes that is - onclick onkeyup etc

2394902
spss	hmisc
as usual i got some spss file that i ve imported into r with spss.get function from hmisc package

2394933
try-catch	exception-handling
you catch exception-handling with a try-catch block

2394948
width	height
the height and width of the image

2394949
inline	inlining
there isn t much you can do about that except not request inlining of functions that cannot be inline

2394956
for-loop	arrays
i have code in java that should make multiple objects within a for-loop then add each object into an arrays

2394956
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
however the code just copies the same which is the last in the for-loop object into each index i in the arrays once loops ends

2394970
fseek	fgetc
just relax and use fseek and fgetc which are designed and implemented exactly to solve your problem

2394970
hfs+	ntfs
of course if you re stuck with ntfs or hfs+ it s just going to be slow

2394970
fgetc	fread
if you use fgetc instead of fread to read single bytes you can save about 20 on small benchmarks

2394986
children	parent
my goal is to have a tree view where the parent is just a text block and all the children are check boxes but only one child can be checked at a time

2394991
min	max
max value is 60 min is 0

2394995
hide	show
this might be an artifact of the hide show animation since you use a duration

2394995
slideup	slidedown
if you try a different animation like slideup slidedown it works fine

2394996
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
and this html5 vedio can be show on firefox and google-chrome but not safari

2395012
min	max
when you use the random min max function in most languages what is the distribution like

2395113
vsto	add-in
i m aiming to develop a vsto add-in that will allow a user to select one or more custom slide shows and then export the slide shows to their desktop and i m looking for some code to help get me on my way

2395139
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	solaris	solaris	netbsd
when you talk about kernels for unix-y operating systems like linux solaris mac os x netbsd freebsd etc

2395159
unix	bsd
src unix you can confirm this by reading lions commentary on unix or the bsd 4.4-lite which is similar to bsd net 2 which is available in tarball or via cvs from freebsd

2395181
outputstream	inputstream
copy is a method on the outputstream interface that causes it to drain the provided inputstream of all input

2395186
postgresql	mysql
2008 postgresql since version 8.2 mysql and h2

2395207
post	get
i m writing a little project which interacts with a set of servers using http 1.1 get and post

2395216
free	malloc
i can t just iterate over every key value and use free on them cause maybe some of them weren t malloc d by any programmer in the first place and i don t need to free them

2395216
strdup	malloc
in point one my suggestion was to use strdup or malloc to fix that specific problem while introducing another but that also don t look very modular to me

2395224
chunked	transfer-encoding
try sending them in chunks along with transfer-encoding chunked

2395231
post	get
a much older one was posted on comp.sources.misc in four consecutive post years ago -- i m pretty sure it d take a fair amount of work to get it to compile with a current c++ compiler

2395257
octal	decimal
each succeeding i reads and converts one integer using the normal c-style convention that if the number starts with 0x it ll be converted as hexadecimal otherwise if there s a leading 0 it ll be converted as octal and otherwise it ll be converted as decimal

2395262
jstl	taglib
jsp allows you to interact with backend via el expressions while producing html output and to use taglib like jstl to control the flow

2395263
integer	unsigned
that is the value returned by your hashing function - apparently an unsigned integer

2395263
free	malloc
i can t just iterate over every key value and use free on them cause maybe some of them weren t malloc d by any programmer in the first place and i don t need to free them

2395263
strdup	malloc
in point one my suggestion was to use strdup or malloc to fix that specific problem while introducing another but that also don t look very modular to me

2395269
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the underlying problem is that you are using a new objectoutputstream to write to an existing objectinputstream that you have already used a prior objectoutputstream to write to

2395283
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
prefer encapsulation over inherited having each of your current subclassing contain a complex properties with all the common fields

2395344
jstl	taglib
then to determine it you ll have to play a bit round with jstl functions taglib

2395355
libjpeg	libpng
i m trying to compile a project that uses both libjpeg and libpng

2395355
zlib	libpng
i know that libpng needs zlib so i compiled all the three independently and put them libjpeg.a libpng.a and libz.a on a folder called linrel32

2395357
folder	directory
just put it in the working directory or system32 folder

2395371
zlib	libpng
so it pulls the code from libpng and since it makes calls to zlib now there are references to the zlib functions

2395372
lisp	scheme
i stumbled upon this question while searching for circular lists lisp scheme

2395403
postgresql	mysql
i currently have a news website setup in php mysql that s a bit old and i m in the process of migrating it to a new django site that uses postgresql 8.4 and psycopg2

2395405
srand	math.h
srand is in stdlib.h not math.h

2395405
prng	random
if speed and security is not a concern you can store the current prng state in persistent memory and restart from that point when a random number is required

2395408
width	height
getpaneldimensions width 1024 height 768 bpp 16

2395425
folder	directory
if that s not an option you can use a virtual directory on each machine that points to one folder on one of the machines but then you lose redundancy

2395428
lisp	scheme
i note that scheme and lisp i guess support circular lists and i have used circular lists in c c++ to simplify the insertion and deletion of elements but what are they good for

2395432
lisp	scheme
for example a double linked list data structure is circular in the scheme lisp point of view if you try to print the cons-structure out you get backreferences cycles

2395432
lisp	scheme
so it s not really about having data structures that look like rings any data structure where you have some kind of backpointers is circular from the scheme lisp perspective

2395432
lisp	scheme
that s the killer feature of double linked lists which are circular in the scheme lisp context

2395435
folder	directory
when deploying the app you need to copy the qt libraries it links against to the application folder on windows or you need to copy them to the app directory and launch it via a wrapper script which adds that directory to ld_library_path on linux.

2395445
associativity	operator-precedence
operator-precedence and associativity does not tell you what happens before and what happens after

2395445
associativity	operator-precedence
operator-precedence associativity has nothing to do with it

2395445
associativity	operator-precedence
operator-precedence associativity simply tells you which operands belong to which operators

2395445
associativity	operator-precedence
operator-precedence associativity is this case simply tells you that the latter interpretation is correct and the former is incorrect ++ applies to b and not to the result of

2395445
associativity	operator-precedence
operator-precedence associativity once again has noting to do with what happens first and what happens next

2395465
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to create a write only file in c on linux ubuntu

2395472
octal	decimal
this is seldom a coherent set of permissions in your example it appears that decimal 12 octal 014 was on the stack

2395479
put	get
i usually put things like this that will get called multiple times in a separate function bindhoverevent in the below example

2395516
rss	feed
it seems like what you need is to refresh the data source for the uitableview when the parser reaches the end of the rss feed

2395521
int	chars
under c++ it is unique built-in type like chars or int so you can legally overload void foo short x and void foo wchar_t x

2395584
unsigned	short
i have an unsigned short that represents a bit pattern i would like an array of bool 16 that has true or false set for the corresponding bit in the unsigned short

2395584
unsigned	short
where binary 2 is an unsigned short that has the bit pattern i wish to unpack

2395622
client-side	server-side
widget library integration to toscawidgets is a bonus providing automated server-side and with certain add-ons client-side validation and type coercion

2395622
django	turbogears
webcore and turbogears utilize standard wsgi middleware layers and provide helpful accessors for shared features while django takes the â œbatteries includedâ approach

2395662
width	height
the image retains it s aspect ratio and resizes it s width according to the height resizing

2395680
unsigned	short
you have an unsigned short and an array of bools

2395724
typedef	struct
typedef struct

2395740
nsstring	nserror
i am using the nsurlrequest class in my iphone app and the method that calls it returns an nsstring which is great for when the connection goes through ok but the issue is i need to convert the nserror into an nsstring so i can either return it back or run some if statements on it

2395741
udp	tcp
basically if you need guaranteed in-order delivery of your data than you are going to re-implement tcp on top of udp

2395741
udp	tcp
if the only reason you use udp is latency then you can probably use tcp and disable the nagle algorithm

2395741
udp	tcp
i would recommend steven s unix network programming which has a section on advanced udp and when it s appropriate to use udp instead of tcp

2395786
free	memcpy
those codes does not include bound checking and free allocated data don t forget to delete the returned buffer from serialize function and also you can use memcpy instead of using loop to copy byte per byte into or from std vector

2395918
udp	tcp
generally socks requires configuration on each client and isn t transparent to applications system-wide socket socksification isn t installed enabled by default on windows while nat even without upnp mostly works transparently and without any additional client configuration for outgoing tcp sockets and outgoing udp

2395925
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
openfiledialog savefiledialog

2395956
int	double
suppose you find that a lot of uses of foo take numeric types int double etc and you keep having to write code that unwraps these numbers adds or multiplies them and then wraps them back up

2395959
postgresql	mysql
i don t know enough about the internal row-versioning mechanisms of mysql or indeed if there is one but other databases oracle postgresql and more recently sql server have invested a lot of effort into allowing writers to not block readers in so far as readers have access to the version of the rows that existed immediately before the update write process started

2395970
groupbox	panel
panel or groupbox

2395975
folder	directory
you can add in your current java project a linked folder pointing to that new directory

2395975
folder	directory
since you can have several source folder simply declare that new directory as a source folder and you are done

2395995
width	height
it seems that the root view of a nib file does not allow you to specify flexible width and flexible height for the autoresizing mask in interface builder at least not as of 3.2

2395996
switching	screens
...if i change the position of one of my objects...then after switching to the other changing activeobject i got the other view on the screens after all switches .

2395998
ilist	iqueryable
in other words i would like nhibernate to return iqueryable instead of a simple ilist when i access a collection

2396038
pyopengl	pyglet
pyglet s gl api is nowhere near as nice as pyopengl s - pyglet s is at the raw ctypes layer which means you ll need to learn ctypes as well

2396042
width	height
but i can t set width height etc + i need to integrate it into my system i use php mysql jquery

2396043
width	height
you can do this pretty easily by cloning the image then removing the height and width attributes to get the real values

2396043
width	height
you also have to then insert the changed image into the page or else it wont have a calculated height width

2396047
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
they display correctly in firefox ie and opera but doesn t work in google-chrome and safari

2396056
memcached	apc
since caching is a common concept there is a number of implementations to pick from like apc memcached and abstraction layers like zend_cache pear s cache or cachelite

2396067
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql are the obvious options for an ngo i presume cost is a consideration but both sql server and oracle come in free if restricted express editions

2396120
width	height
it keeps state for an inputs text value but the principle could easily be used for your width and height

2396120
width	height
i would create a custom object that stores the original object s id width and height

2396120
width	height
when required to restore the value simply loop the array of custom objects to match id and bingo an object with the original width and height

2396128
folder	directory
however if that isn t what you want just follow the same directory structure above under the application folder

2396132
g++	gcc
edit this works with g++ --std c++0x gcc --version is 4.4.3

2396148

or multiplying and add

2396303
wordpress	joomla
is good knowledge of php needed to make an installable template for cms like wordpress joomla drupal

2396304
octal	decimal
that tells java and many other languages that you want the number interpreted as an octal base 8 constant not decimal

2396309
wordpress	joomla
like wordpress joomla drupal

2396311
wordpress	joomla
from my experience - i have a lot with wordpress and some with joomla - i would recommend at least some php knowledge and understanding of the underlying code base

2396311
wordpress	joomla
if you want to increase your market value getting into the wordpress codex and either joomla or drupal is certainly a good idea

2396312
wordpress	joomla
note i don t know about wordpress nor joomla but have worked with drupal for quite some time

2396344
versioning	upgrade
then you should upgrade to the latest versioning of redmine and follow the rest of the wiki.

2396697
submit	submission
the user experience i m trying to achieve is that when a user submit the form i ll check to see if they have granted a specific permission and if not prompt them for the permission before submission the form

2396697
onclick	onsubmit
as i mentioned this js function works perfectly as an onclick action but fails as an onsubmit action so i m pretty sure that this has something to do with how javascript treats onsubmit actions

2396704
put	get
if you construct a bidirectional_seekable boost iostreams device it will support two separate get put positions which can be modified with the help of the iostreams seek function

2396725
int	boolean
strpos returns an int or boolean false

2396744
qtableview	qabstracttablemodel
i m just getting started with qt programming and i m trying to make a simple tabular data layout using a qtableview control with a model class of my own creation inheriting from qabstracttablemodel

2396760
stdout	stderr
linux typically reserves handles 0 1 and 2 for stdin stdout and stderr respectively

2396767
x86	64bit
on solaris x86 the x87 fpu is likely to be using its default precision of 64bit extended precision hence the difference

2396772
post	get
when talking about some of them being more dangerous than others i would indeed separate _get and _request as it includes _get out from _post as it is slightly harder to generate manipulate a post request than a get request

2396772
post	get
anybody who understands the difference between get and post or how unsanitized inputs might be exploitable won t hesitate for a second to fire up tamper data

2396784
cos	sin
to address kirk s concerns all of the solutions based on the recurrence for cos and sin boil down to computing

2396789
freebsd	linux
i want to differentiate between freebsd and linux

2396800
submit	submission
when you attach the same function to the submit handler the function returns before facebook stuff gets actually executed and it does without returning false causing the form to proceed with submission earlier than you want it to

2396800
submit	submission
what you need to do is return false at the end of your onsubmit function to prevent submission and give time to facebook stuff to finish and then manually submit form at places you want it to be submitted by calling

2396860
for-loop	loops
you did it inside the for-loop but its local scope lasts just for the body of loops

2396872
for-loop	loops
in c++ the scope of a variable declared in a for-loop is loops

2397201
pop-up	dialog
the following code placed in my template pop-up the alerts but no permission dialog

2397214
put	get
what s really going to kill your memory management is if you get fragmentation where you might all of a sudden have a bunch of memory but still nowhere to put your objects not enough contiguous space

2397232
piston	tastypie
- similar to piston but i ve had better luck with tastypie

2397286
google-chrome	safari
if it doesn t seem to work in google-chrome or safari then it s most likely just a symptom of an error you have elsewhere

2397304
postgresql	mysql
with torque i can define a database with mysql well i use postgresql but mysql is supported too and torque can then query the database and then generate java classes for each table in the database

2397314
google-chrome	firefox
but when i try to see this image through firefox google-chrome my image is not displaying only a tiny icon is displaying there.image is jpeg type

2397573
width	height
do it with actionscript in the flash by using the stage width and stage height variables

2397618
boost	allocator
look up pool allocator eg boost or small object allocator eg loki

2397622
boost	allocator
regarding the allocator of your class objects take a look at the boost pool library which may be more efficient for many allocator of small objects than regular new delete via the system allocator

2397646
profiling	debugging
see my suggestion as to how you can add a -foreground switch to a service to make it easier to run it as a regular program which makes it easier to profiling and debugging

2397748
int	boolean
then iterate over the array containing the actual data and keep an int of which word you re currently at and a boolean if you already matched whitespace

uiview	uitouch
i have setup a uiscrollview which handles a large uiview inside the uiview is a uiimageview i ve managed to get the uitouch to drag the uiimageview outside of the uiscrollview but inside it s not registering the event

2397818
move	drag
i suppose what i was trying to accomplish was dragging the uiimageview around the large uiview whilst the uiscrollview move along the image if the user drag it beyond the pos of when the uiview when the uiimageview began it s dragging if that makes sense

2397842
rss	feed
for example if there is an rss feed and for some reason it is down or cannot be grabbed i want to display a simple message saying feed cannot be grabbed

2397843
notepad++	textpad

inherited	properties
1 if textbox element has its width properties set to inherited then textbox doesnâ t overflow

2397990
cassini	iis
the location for what you are looking for is in the solution file of your solution open the sln send to notepad you will see what i mean you can hard code the port if you are using the built in webserver cassini or you can port it all to your local iis which is what i do

2398000
for-loop	loops
i want to set up a for-loop for the first 1 3 of the main loops that will increase a value from .00001 or similar to 1

2398001
put	get
the only work around is to put the cache code inside the load of each object and to loop all properties from the caching object to get the value and to set it back to the real object

2398002
hash	md5
if you can have a third db field like the one above do a varchar 32 that is unique that is an md5 hash of the first two

2398030
int	chars
for example you have a very large value in an int that doesn t fit in chars

2398030
int	chars
anything could happen but the most sensible thing would be to take the first byte of that int and put it in chars

2398042
hide	show
i create a menu and i show and hide submenu on jquery via hover event like following code

2398042
hide	show
is any way submenu show or hide after some milisecond mouse stay over them

each properties may also have a specified value of inherited which means that for a given element the properties takes the same computed value as the properties for the element s parent

2398079
width	height
if height and width both have computed values of auto and the element also has an intrinsic width then that intrinsic width is the used value of width

2398079
width	height
if height and width both have computed values of auto and the element has no intrinsic width but does have an intrinsic height and intrinsic ratio

2398079
width	height
or if width has a computed value of auto height has some other computed value and the element does have an intrinsic ratio

2398079
width	height
if height and width both have computed values of auto and the element has an intrinsic ratio but no intrinsic height or width and the containing block s width does not itself depend on the replaced element s width then the used value of width is calculated from the constraint equation used for block-level non-replaced elements in normal flow

2398082
jar	manifest.mf
i run jar cmf manifest.mf hello.jar .class to get hello.jar file

2398096
cpu	processors
when you call a opengl function it will either calculate on the cpu or on the gpu graphics card s processors

2398122
super	implements
because of that i m now having problems implements methods such as new open and save - i find myself writing a lot of code the manuals say should be implements by the super class

2398176
ironruby	ironpython
languages such as ironpython and ironruby used an additional layer on top the clr to allow all the wonderful dynamics features

2398183
realloc	malloc
on program start it begins as null and i then malloc realloc as i need to add remove these structures and i was just gonna use my pointer to point at the first structure and move through it like an array

2398183
realloc	malloc
when i malloc realloc i always make the size of the array area in memory one larger than it needs to be

2398188
hide	show
start debugging and windows move show hide in order to be in the same position as the last debugging session

2398216
filesystems	fat
using fat for example but most other filesystems have at least some degree of similarity you could go in and directly manipulate the fat

2398216
filesystems	fat
most modern filesystems are also considerably more complex than fat which would add further difficulty to the implementation

2398221
getter	setter
unfortunately there is no way to shorten what you have automatically implemented properties must have empty getter and setter blocks to be syntactically correct

2398233
accessor	properties
the code that was causing a stackoverflowexception doesn t provide a backing field for the properties the get accessor is returning the properties itself which is what causes the stack overflow

2398246
accessor	properties
returning feedbackcomment in the get accessor of the feedbackcomment properties is creating a self-referential loop that keeps getting the properties so no surprise about the stack overflow there

2398257
inherited	subclassing
so each subclassing will be run a individual with it-setup method and also all inherited test-methods

2398260
getter	setter
the getter references itself as andrew points out but the setter is also wrong

2398273
getter	setter
a property cannot hold any data it is just a pair of a getter method and a setter method there are also properties which only have getter or setter

2398273
getter	setter
the getter method is basically a method which takes no arguments and returns a value of the property s type the setter on the other hand is a method with no return value and an argument of the property s type called value

2398273
implements	extends
please be also aware that the c# compiler will create a backing field automatically so basically both ways are the same but you gain more flexibility with the first because with automatically implements properties you cannot add more complex behaviour than just simple setting and retrieving of values at least in the class where you declare it making it virtual opens possibilites to extends property logic in subclasses..

2398286
cairngorm	mate	cairngorm	flex
you build a useful app for flex and air use cairngorm adobe s supported flex application framework but people seem to enjoy using others like mate and swiz connect to a backend with xml json and amf and build useful cms-like interfaces all using design patterns

2398304
division	multiplication
also the code that is setting x1 y1 etc are you casting to floats before doing division multiplication etc

2398365
implements	extends
you could either implements an interface or extends something like a plane class

2398420
width	height
i m able to resize the height with the part but the width just doesn t update according to the new content

2398427
int	double
assume the number being represented is larger than the system can handle as an actual number an int or a double etc

2398427
hex	binary
i m open to a solution for any base n which satisfies the above criteria binary hex ...

2398430
html5lib	beautifulsoup
use beautifulsoup as a tree builder for html5lib

2398447
ubuntu	linux
i ve downloaded latest linux source package from the ubuntu repository and found the mentioned source files with minor directory and file name changes

2398453
put	get
anyway if you insist on such an approach i guess the closest you get is to put the init code into the constructor and the destruct code into an override of finalize

2398474
int	boolean
it should only output json native types e.g strings int boolean and lists

2398518
width	margin
resulting margin width is the maximum

2398541
margin	height
the parent element doesn t have any non-floating elements so it s height is zero and the floating elements overlap the margin

2398576
int	double
so it was actually faster to cast to double call pow with double then test for overflow and cast back than to implement it using int arithmetic

2398619
comparator	comparable
hashtable and hashmap don t use either comparator or comparable

2398627
post	get
you could get your fragment via post append the html to a div with display none

2398660
children	parent
a child record can have a parent record selected from a node reference field this is optional -- i can have parent-less children as well

2398660
children	parent
i created a page view to display the parent then an attachment view to display all the children then attached that under the page view

2398699
cpython	ironpython
user is running ironpython jython or anything other than cpython

2398791
int	double
can someone explain why the casting from double float to int works correctly in the first case and does not work when done in printf

2398821
int	chars
so in your case the d is getting promoted to an int then printf is popping off an int and casting to a chars

2398852
int	double
if you pass it a double value and specify an int format specifier like d printf will take that double value and blindly reinterpret it an an int

2398877
mouseover	mouseout
te undefined prior to the mouseover and null after the mouseout

2398907
int	chars
1 23.45 or 1 minute 23 seconds 45 hundredths is 8345. lapcount is a simple unsigned tiny int or unsigned chars

2398918
calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
in most realities malloc and memset or calloc which effectively does the same will suit your needs

2398949
getter	setter
isn t a property just a getter and a setter

2398963
children	parent
you need to get the children of the closest parent like this

2398976
lwjgl	jogl
for graphics lwjgl and jogl are both java opengl wrappers

2398980
nstextview	nsscrollview
nstextfield or nstextview without nsscrollview

2398989
button	checkbox
i would favor field controls like text boxes checkbox and dropdown menus rather than command button so that the commanded value is clearly shown

2398991
int	chars
the reason your follow-up code works is because the chars constant is promoted to an int before it is pushed onto the stack

2398991
int	chars
in fact chars constants are of type int not type chars

2399074
ati	nvidia
this is just what nvidia ati drivers do for you but you re out of luck unless your kernel supports windows linux drivers

2399107
width	height
of course if i really want to be lazy i can just google for the average height width ratio since height is known

2399107
width	height
says a width to height ratio of 3 5 0.6 is recommended for most applications

2399136
clang	llvm
since llvm clang is especially well designed

2399154
clang	llvm
llvm clang is especially well designed

2399168
hex	binary
i have a binary file to which i m trying to write however i dont have the file format specification nor have found it using google i ve been looking at the file using a hex editor but so far has only give me a headache is there a better way to decipher the format of the file so that i can append data to it

2399181
min	max
i have put together a small powershell script as below to check page file pae switch 3gb switch sql server max ram min ram

2399208
hash	md5
do a recursive search through all the files sorting them by size any byte sizes with two or more files do an md5 hash or a sha1 hash computation to see if they are in fact identical

2399211
autofac	castle-windsor
there are many other di libraries including autofac ninject structuremap and castle-windsor

2399237
sctp	tcp
if you re feeling particularly bold you can look into using sctp sockets instead of tcp sockets

2399244
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i have an interesting problem when using partial page update in asp.net with scriptmanager and a updatepanel

2399268
width	height
you ve set the frame to the same width and height as the content

2399307
super	self
i would expect super self but this doesn t work

2399409
inherited	properties
i d like to have the nested containers inherited that properties but when i set it in the outermost one i m not sure if it s working

2399416
rss	feed
i am creating an rss feed application

2399416
rss	feed
as a sample i have downloaded apples rss feed but the problem with it is that the words in the table cells are not wrapped

2399549
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
create qgraphicsview object to your widget and added a qgraphicsscene to view

2399564
bids	ssis
is there any way to develop ssis packages in sql 2005 without using bids

2399567
inherited	properties
the dependency properties specifies that it will inherited down the visual tree when it is declared

2399593
g++	gcc
following are the versions of gcc g++ i am using

2399593
g++	gcc
since gcc and g++ are configured built with --disable-aix64 there are no 64-bit std libraries available ex libstdc++

2399593
g++	gcc
how can i build 64-bit libstdc++ which should work with gcc g++ 4.1.1

2399593
g++	gcc
do i need to rebuild gcc and g++ without the --disable-aix64 flag

2399602
put	get
i would agree that it s probably an issue with trying to get the id of the element since the element s id changes at runtime when you put it inside a user control

2399607
mp3	wav
basically now i will not write real time applications i would like to start from the processing of a wav file or even better an mp3 file so basically on vectors of samples

2399611
telerik	componentart
telerik devexpress and componentart make controls which do this

2399638
g++	gcc
be aware that gcc or g++ uses a different name-mangling scheme from other compilers quite deliberately - because it does various things such as exception handling class layouts and the like differently from other compilers

2399642
cpu	processors
in either situation make sure that your main thread yields processors time to the running threads else your wait loop will consume most all the cpu and starve your worker threads

2399664
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
subclasses such as uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller provide additional behavior for managing complex hierarchies of view controllers and views.

2399667
cpython	pypy
very fast execution swig cpython psyco pypy unladen-swallow etc

2399705
pop-up	dialog
after uninstalling xampp and reinstalling it xampp-win32-1.7.0-installer.exe and applying the xampp-patch2-win32-1.7.0-installer i still have the problem of the php cli closing and throwing the pop-up dialog

2399797
google-chrome	firefox
i want to write a browser google-chrome firefox extension that needs to select an element on a web page

2399826
opensolaris	bsd
for an open source os such as linux bsd or opensolaris you could delve into the os source code to figure this out

2399876
width	height
as for the transparent overlay just give it an absolute position and a full width and height

2399918
int	chars
i got hold of these 2 functions to convert a 4 byte float into an unsinged 32 bit int to transfer over network which works fine for a simple c++ udp program but for qt i need to receive the data as unsigned chars

2399980
mouse	keyboard
you can alleviate this problem a by removing the mouse keyboard and the screen and only access the buildserver through rdp or something similar

2399984
int	chars
the values are the result of chars int enumvalue

2399994
width	height
suppose i have an html page with three blocks of fixed width their height can vary if that s important like shown on picture

2400012
retaincount	dealloc
an object is removed from memory - with dealloc when retaincount is 0

2400025
valgrind	callgrind
but valgrind callgrind is quite slow .

2400025
valgrind	callgrind
i just want to know is it possible to do the same thing using valgrind callgrind

2400115
width	height
i create another div element which positioned at the same place of the nested target with same width and height but with higher z-index value

2400142
versioning	upgrade
now i found the way and i want to upgrade production website to the same structure as my dev versioning now

2400215
google-chrome	firefox
you have one cookie per different browser firefox ie google-chrome

2400224
mouse	keyboard
using a mouse while you press any button key of the keyboard the corresponding character will be typed in the application running below

2400266
width	height
i m thinking of using jquery but would i be right in thinking the only way to do it is manually calculating the percentage of width height where the shape layer should be placed then using absolute positioning is the only way to do this

2400283
rss	feed
i made news applicaion in android using rss feed and now i want to share some news ie i want to upload links from my app to facebook twitter etc.is it possible

2400292
setinterval	settimeout
there are quite a few timer plugins but they are all just abstractions of settimeout and setinterval anyway and i m not sure they re really much simpler to use

2400307
int	chars
to create those key strokes from chars i would recommand you create them using before to transform them into int values using

2400307
int	chars
this way you would have int values associatesd your unicode chars whichever they are

2400363
jta	persistence-unit
and i put persistence.xml with persistence-unit type jta in src main resources

2400395
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
that this ended up in a single class with a 400+ long method including a single for-loop at least 5 places where code is repeated-but-not-completely unused logic wrong comments while true loops and increasing the for counter in loops body to look-ahead into an arrays list

2400432
ubuntu	linux
how do i put a program in the system tray i don t think it s called like that in linux in python tkinter for ubuntu 9.04

2400440
entities	entitymanager
you can either refresh on one entity and it will be reloaded form the database or you can clear the entitymanager itself in which case all entities are removed from the cache

2400487
listview	gridview
at the moment i m displaying the data in a listview with a gridview and this works perfectly except that gridview doesn t allow one to copy data

2400494
gif	png
this will go through all the img tags and replace the path with it s own path but with the gif extension instead of png

2400519
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
personally i would quite like a future version of c# to allow you to write a very brief class declaration which generates the same code immutable properties constructor equals gethashcode tostring with a name.

2400548
put	get
it s pretty obvious that i must get forms.validationerror when i put invalid value in this field isn t it

2400570
multiplying	add
the add reg reg instruction is 2 bytes per instruction so thats 6 bytes of instructions and 0 bytes for constants to multiplying by 3 that s smaller code than imul plus a 4 byte constant

2400570
multiplying	add
plus the way the add instructions are used it works out to a pretty literal translation of 2 3 so this may not be a size optimization it may be the default compiler output whenever you multiplying by 2 or by 3

2400570
multiplying	add
add is usually a faster instruction than multiplying

2400606
int	double
problem is that compareto throws an exception when trying to compare between different types int and double

2400640
post	get
you should be able to simply ask the user via a post get method in a form the file path using and then embed that variable in an image tag as

2400677
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if you re using uitabbarcontroller inside your application then all of uiviewcontroller inside uitabbarcontroller should support autorotation

2400707
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i test my applications in firefox safari and google-chrome and all display fine

2400748
int	double
should the int be promoted to be a double then compared

2400748
int	double
should the double be truncated to an int

2400753
maven	pom.xml
i think the better way is to describe all your dependencies in a single place the maven pom.xml or leiningen s project.clj and then start a swank session with those dependencies

2400821
integer	fractions
when you divide two integers c# uses integer division where the fractions part is discarded

2400821
int	double
to get floating point division cast one of the arguments to either double float or decimal depending on the level of precision you need which will cause the other argument to be implicitly converted to the same type and the division carried out using floating point rules instead of int rules

2400871
width	height
and the parentmc on stage is not scaled it is at 100 width height

2400884
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
while this works perfectly in ie and firefox it doesn t work in opera and google-chrome

2400897
pop-up	dialog
i have a javascript modal pop-up dialog and got a button in this modal dialog which used to select things this is not an asp button control

2400904
width	height
for instance if you draw a circle of diameter 100px on shape whose size was initially set to 50x50 the width and height properties will read 100 and not 50

2400916
inherited	properties
when inspecting a specific element of a html page the debugger shows all style properties applied to the element why they re applied class id tag inherited and from which css file the properties are coming

2400931
getter	setter
i have a class customer which is below with getter and setter

2400949
webclient	httpwebrequest
the reason i wrote it is because i noticed the same performance problem with webclient and i thought that the httpwebrequest would allow to tweak the performance issue

2400957
opera	firefox
in opera for example you can fake an internet explorer or firefox instance

2400965
ubuntu	linux
i wonder if there s something similar for linux ubuntu

2400969
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
you can use the nscalendar and the nsdatecomponents like that

2401001
jstl	taglib
declare the tags in top of jsp as per this jstl documentation click any of the taglib to see the declaration examples

2401001
jstl	taglib
you should never do that this is a wrong suggestion which is caused by the change in taglib uri s during the jstl 1.0 - jstl 1.1 step

2401014
versioning	upgrade
newer versioning can read old working copies but only to immediately upgrade them

2401028
debian	linux
i am using debian 3.1 linux machine

2401036
google-chrome	firefox
many browser like firefox google-chrome already supporting this

2401037
width	height
flashobject accepts several arguments the 3rd and 4th of which represent the width and height attributes of the element

2401037
width	height
course this won t really work if the width of the swf is a percentage as the height of the whitespace wont be constant

2401037
width	margin
if you set the width to a constant such as 1040px you can set the negative top margin accordingly

2401076
google-chrome	firefox
it works ok in firefox and google-chrome

2401086
stateless	stateful
the web is essentially stateless and mvc helps you to go down to the metal that is mvc does not try to make something stateful that isn t which is mostly the path of ye olde asp each request is a request of it s own and it shouldn t know anything about any other request that has been performed in the past

2401097
pascal	delphi
that said i myself walked a way from borland pascal and delphi quite some time ago over php and asp.net using c#

2401100
appfuse	spring
further there s the appfuse which gives you the possibility to compose a kickoff java ee application together yourself based on a certain mvc framework jsf spring mvc struts2 etc and plug in several modules sooner or later like hibernate and so on

2401150
prepare	execute
you can also prepare and execute separately

2401239
httphandler	httpmodule	isapi	httpmodule
any .aspx page will be passed to the .net isapi filter by iis and go through the entire chain of httpmodule then will be handled by the page httphandler

2401244
disk	ram
you may need to have to adjust disk space and ram if it s running low but with the proper indexes you should be safe to go

2401254
pull	push
as you can see the pull looks reasonable but the default push does not

2401267
nsnull	nsstring
i think the problem is i mean the second warning is that you re comparing nsstring object which could be set to null to an nsnull object

2401292
width	height
the images that get uploaded have a big variety of sizes while my holder has a width of 239 and height of 179

2401293
getter	setter
this uses _x _y and _z to internally store the incoming values and exposes them via the use of property with getter setter

2401295
put	get
you can in theory put your classes and jar files there so that you don t need to do anything to get java javac to find them

2401328
debian	linux
debian linux with iceweasel basically firefox

2401341
ssl	https
we need a ssl https connection to the webservice but we didn t find any documentation or hint how to activate it programmatically via the embedded api

2401343
put	get
both of the answers previously given missed a fundamental point you can t put nil into an array so you ll never get nil out of an array

2401358
width	height
or if you want to maintain the same image then you could find out new height and width maintaining the aspect ratio and apply it accordingly to the height and width properties of the img tag

2401358
width	height
you can use these to resize the image or find the height and width

2401393
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
i m already aware of some browser-specific dom documentation out there gecko dom reference for firefox msdn for internet explorer and of course the ecma and w3c specs but i wonder if someone has compiled a good api reference that covers all common browsers firefox internet explorer opera safari chrome...

2401415
super	extends
could i instead make a super class of superhelper which is a singleton class and then let every helper extends it

2401471
width	height
i created a canvas component just for drawing the fill-level with bounds 0 0 and width height of the box

2401520
haskell	scheme	haskell	ocaml	lisp	scheme	ocaml	scheme
if you want to try that approach use a language better suited to do functional programming as lisp scheme haskell ocaml etc

2401559
put	get
the best you can do is to get the user to put the phone into speakerphone mode then open your application and then play the sound at loud volume

2401568
width	height
the point to be noted here is the width of the document can changed and as html is reflowable as width increases height decreases and vice-versa

2401592
uitableview	nsindexpath
- nsindexpath tableview uitableview tableview willremoveobject id object atindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

2401622
rss	feed
and place rss feed related code in a separate function named performrss

2401625
put	get
but more importantly - try to get rid of fill in the missing coordinates or better don t put addresses with missing coordinates in the list

2401662
inherited	properties
you can create a non-generic interface that has the caneditentity properties on it make secureddomainviewmodel inherited off that then call the properties through the interface.

2401671
many-to-many	many-to-one
this is all quite a manual process but satisfies requirements such as migrating data from one model to another expanding a boolean flag to a set of options or converting a many-to-one association to a many-to-many

2401679
junit	testng
alternatively you could switch to using testng which is very similar to junit but has a default html report as well as several other cool features

2401726
width	height
inline elements do not have a height or width so the whole background is being displayed instead of being cropped by the image size

2401762
directx	gdi
display there are lots of apis for the screen directx gdi gdi+

2401771
keydown	keyup
ajax calls will be made on a keydown to start the robot and keyup to stop it

2401771
keydown	keyup
my problem is that when a key is held down the keyup keydown and keypress events seem to cycle continually

2401771
keydown	keyup
does anybody know of a way to only have keydown fire when the key is first pressed and keyup to fire when it has been released

2401771
keydown	keyup
the problem is that keydown keypress and keyup events fire over and over again as i am holding the key down

2401800
g++	gcc
at the beginning i was developing the entire project compiling my fortran files with gfortran which comes with gcc and linking them with my app by the g++ -o.

2401800
int	chars
void g95_runtime_start int argc chars argv

2401824
keydown	keyup
you ll want to use the keydown and keyup events.

2401824
keydown	keyup
on keyup re-assign the keydown event handler

2401902
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
the cfile model supports any kind of filesystems ntfs but also fat and cdfs for cd-roms

2401914
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox when i alert matchparts it is an array containing the text and then the url

2401928
int	chars
for example if only int are allowed then you ignore any keying of the decimal point along with all letters and most special chars

2402005
inherited	properties
i create a new customcontrol which inherited control i couldnâ t use neither selector or treeview because i wouldnâ t have been able to manage the selecteditem properties from the derived class

2402012
opera	firefox
but doing as futta suggested by providing an ogg theora vorbis alternative is a good idea as it will then work in opera and firefox too

2402014
puts	gets
explanation gets a line from file1 and puts its value to variable t

2402117
firefox	safari
for firefox and safari this does the trick

2402119
subtract	add
so those are the externs im using to move the scroll position what im doing is i get the current position and add or subtract an exact amount of pixels and the scroll bar on my form moves perfectly how i want it but the content in the control stays stationary

2402124
getter	setter
this object setter and getter are needed in different parts of the application

your best bet is to use a plugin like jqtransform uses jquery

2402517
int	chars
if yes you could just remap the ranges of the int values of the chars

2402566
hide	show
ok i believe than radio buttons is the best choice because just one choice is needed but to use it i need to use visual basic script to handle the code hide and show text

2402569
xslt	schematron
the alternative solution is to use schematron but you won t get so handy and user-friendly tool for that as you get in-case of xsd and xslt

2402627
idictionary	ilist
you could also make custom version of the ilist and idictionary which using chunking to avoid stuff ending up in the loh in the first place

2402639
folder	directory
i want to create separate folder for my layouts like this in my resource directory

2402671
ffmpeg	libavformat
4.1 are there examples illustrating how to use the ffmpeg libraries particularly libavcodec and libavformat

2402671
ffmpeg	libavformat
i suggest looking at libavformat output-example.c or perhaps the source of the ffmpeg command line utility itself

2402673
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie8 firefox safari and google-chrome but probably not in older versions of ie

2402700
width	height
you d need to add your own positions sizes the top left width and height properties as appropriate

2402722
keydown	keyup
i do not find any keyup events thrown from keydown

2402722
keydown	keyup
and waits for a keyup before listening for another keydown

2402726
mdpi	hdpi
i haven t found anything else on the web that references this structure but the following blog post shows an example where the author uses ldpi and i m sure mdpi and hdpi instead of small normal and large as the android reference docs online would suggest

2402746
rss	feed
if the page is your own you could try increasing the number of entires included in the rss feed

2402746
rss	feed
otherwise there is no way to retrieve entries from a page via rss if those entries are no longer available in the feed

2402751
perforce	svn
i concur that svn seems like a pita when you come from a perforce background

2402773
width	height
this means that they flow inline like text but also have a width and height like block elements

2402776
width	height
they are block elements in that they have a width and a height

2402777
memcached	apc
besides all optimization that is not in the language reverse proxy memcached apc ect i want to avoid to build the application using events only to find out that they become a major bottleneck due to bad performing implementation

2402782
double-pointer	pointers
you d need a double-pointer argument or a pointers return value and you have neither

2402821
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
having the handler return false works for me in safari and firefox and google-chrome

2402823
rss	feed
i m looking to integrate a bunch of rss atom sources into a feed for our intranet

2402849

you can use the classes in the system.servicemodel.syndication namespace to read write and merge rss feed

2402860
richfaces	trinidad
i have worked only with trinidad and richfaces

2402860
richfaces	trinidad
i have used trinidad tree in one recent application i developed and it was easy to use and fill trinidad components - richfaces components login required

2402860
richfaces	trinidad
regarding skinning i feel trinidad default skinning to be more basic than richfaces one but i think both have ways to make them as beautiful as your css skills allow you

2402860
richfaces	trinidad
i think richfaces has a more mature ajax integration and their ajax components and events are more easy to use for me than trinidad ones

2402888
disk	ram
looking for a ram disk api or equivalent set of software to implement to store file s temporarily for read write operations outside the physical hard disk environment

2402888

uiview	calayer
i ve got a uiview and thus a calayer which i m trying to warp or bend slightly in 3d space

2402936
disk	ram
a ram disk is an operating system level construct because it has to implement a file system and device driver to emulate a disk

2402936
disk	ram
otherwise reading the files into a data structure in your application will have the same performance characteristics as using a ram disk

2402936
disk	ram
typically a ram disk is used when the application is unaware of the fact that it is running off of ram cached files

2402948
entity-relationship	diagram	entity-relationship	entities
determining the functional dependencies in your schema should be simple once you produce an entity-relationship diagram and decide what data is part of the entities posts attachments media and what data is part of the relationships

to elaborate a little more on answer #3 i d do the following note still does not support paste oprations through keyboard or mouse

2402985
width	height
glteximage2d gl_texture_2d 0 gl_rgba width height 0 gl_rgba gl_unsigned_byte pixeldata

2403006

unix	solaris
i ve seen the about cross compilers reply at how do i cross-compile c code on windows for a binary to also be run on unix solaris hpux linux

2403077
m2e	pom.xml
not with the level of detail you provided like your pom.xml especially your spring dependency your eclipse version the m2e version...

2403118
folder	directory
could you put a folder in the application s directory then create a shortcut to it for every user when they first use the feature in their home directory

2403193
expression-blend	silverlight
expression-blend - as a beginer blend 2.0 is enough for you to get started with wpf silverlight xaml

2403202
firefox	safari
the script is working in ie for a change it works there but i cannot get it working in firefox or safari

2403202
firefox	safari
so the ajax call is working but gives me always and error only in firefox and safari not in ie

2403271
perl	tcl
berkeley db is written in c with api bindings for c++ c# php java perl python ruby tcl smalltalk and many other programming languages

2403307
super	extends
i just wanted to add that there is a reason for this there is a strong aversion to adding keywords because such additions break existing code so when new features are added existing keywords are used if they make a reasonable fit such as super and extends for generics and default for annotations or they are just skipped as in the colon used in the enhanced for-loop

2403323
actionscript	mxml
adobe - coding with mxml and actionscript

2403367
hide	show
the show hide part can be done with little help of jquery

2403557
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
hey guys the following snippet of jquery code seems to work fine in google-chrome and opera but nothing happens when i try hiding showing the related div in internet explorer or firefox

2403649
int	double
keep in mind that the above code will cast an int to a float double for the arithmetic and it can be changed back to an int for the final return

2403659
serializable	deserialization
that said i ve never really bothered with the whole entity serializable deserialization reattach thing as it seems fraught with peril

2403665
google-chrome	firefox
i thought it might be my new firebug version 1.5.2 or firefox in general but they re not working in ie or google-chrome either

2403680
multiplying	division
you can do this by performing integer division by 10 rounding up and then multiplying the result by 10

2403701
submit	submission
you could make this call from the click handler of the submit button in the other form or you could make one submission dependent on the other by submission from the actioncomplete handler of the other form

2403722
keydown	keyup
when are keybinding preferable to handling keyup keydown .ect events

2403766
x86	64bit
it will return either x86 when a program is running in 32 bit mode either because it is running under a 32 bit os or because it is running on a 64bit os but as a 32 bit program under wow64 or either ia64 or amd64 if running as native 64bit program on a 64bit os

2403773
post	get
note that get post and getscript allow you to bind function to success only

2403784
put	get
if you don t do this someone is going to figure out a way to get by whatever stop-gap you put in place and they will come back to you saying hey i thought i told you to lock this down

2403789
pdfbox	itext
i do have itext and pdfbox at my disposal

2403790
keydown	keyup
if on the other hand you wanted to set off the repeat function every time someone keydown only the r key but then do another function when the r key is released keyup you would need to use event handlers

2403834
hide	fadeout
even when i try to fadeout or hide the content on click nothing happens

2403840
google-chrome	safari
to get a background image on a table row that works in ie8 also safari and google-chrome you have to apply a background image to the table cells of the row rather than the table row

2403886
multiplying	transpose
however the documentation states that to get the location of the camera one must multiplying the transpose and inverted rotation matrix by the translation vector

2403889
getter	setter
it uses a class decorator which i think is slightly simpler to understand than a metaclass and martineau s idea of simplifying the getter and setter with default values

2403889
getter	setter
they take one argument the attribute name as a string and return the setter or getter function respectively for that attribute

2403889
getter	setter
the main difference is that autoproperties expects the user to define getter and setter factories instead of manually defined getter and setter

2403922
opera	firefox
when i open this page in firefox and opera everything works fine but ie does not allow me to attach anything to the url

2403946
int	chars
for comparison if chars variables occupy 4-byte stack slots in the calling convention they might say that the compiler is actually passing an int

2403947
mouseover	mouseout
if you do mouseover twice you get two mouseout event handlers that will both be called.

2403962
put	get
i have this working but it seems a bit kludgy get the value from the posted form put it into viewstate put the value of the viewstate var into a hidden field get the value of the hidden field in js split it into an array iterate thru the array comparing ids

2403965
width	height
i want to know the width and height of the html elements like divs body and tables

2403965
width	height
i want the calculated width height and not the one that i apply to the elements

2404040
int	chars
remember that nvarchar requires 2 bytes per chars so if an int is 4 chars then to use the same space you could only use 2 chars in the nvarchar column

2404079
post	get
if i try the code from the original post i get the following exception which makes sense

2404101
min	max
setting both the min and max to 512 is good if your program allocates a bunch of stuff but is not situational always uses about the same amount of ram

2404127
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and other new browsers there doesn t seem to be any issues when one of the services go down

2404160
post	get
instead of rehashing - here is an mvp post that should get you pointed in the right direction

2404199
firefox	safari
i have not tested on all browsers but it seems to work for me in safari firefox and msie8

2404242
tripledes	aes
as for block ciphers you should use aes instead of tripledes

2404285
getter	setter
alternatively i was thinking about modifying the models such that all getter setter will uppercase any string coming and going

2404317
children	parent
is there any way that i can apply the stylesheets only to a parent widget not to it s children

2404319
post	get
i would not use get as the method you should use post if you are going to save data

2404322
post	get
on the other hand i ve been quite successful at using the ef 1 on its own terms and have managed to not allow claims people make in blog post to get in the way of making it work for me

2404356
hide	show
the latest version of apple s uicatalog example application includes zero code in the textfieldcontroller for handling keyboard show hide events and yet the table view still slides up and down beautifully with the keyboard

2404364
16-bit	64bit
in non-sse 066h switches between 32-bit or 64bit and 16-bit operation

2404376
ienumerable	ilist
this approach will work with anything that s ienumerable t not just ilist t collections which is very useful if your collection never ends or is otherwise calculated on-the-fly

2404423
postgresql	mysql
sphinx for mysql or postgresql or xml pipes

2404446
width	height
when it has both height and width defined in the browser ff ignores the height set and renders a very small div

2404465
multiplying	transpose
the multiplying the transpose and inverted rotation matrix by thing is the backward transformation

2404525
min	max
you could use max min too

2404550
mouseover	mouseout
try using hover instead of mouseover and mouseout

2404559
pull	push
then you can push or commit to your own branches and pull update or merge from everyone else s branches

2404564
firefox	safari
ie uses ntlm by default if your using firefox safari etc

2404569
try-catch	exception-handling
edit i have added a try-catch statement to catch the exception-handling

2404581
mouseover	mouseout
add the mouseover handler to #div_1 and the mouseout handler to #div_2

2404581
mouseover	mouseout
this way #div_2 is shown when you mouseover #div_1 and it is hidden when you mouseout of #div_2 instead of as soon as you mouseout of #div_1

2404634
folder	directory
i don t know that you can do that as a url mapping however files and folder in the same directory that your web.xml file is in will be accessible in the way you describe although you can t control the mapping under your webapp

2404635
strncmp	strncpy
you need to pass the size along with the array just like it is done in many library functions for instance strncpy strncmp etc

2404675
decimal	ieee
how would i go about manually changing a decimal base 10 number into ieee 754 single-precision floating-point format

2404717
trojan	virus
if your goal is to create a virus or a trojan horse that hides its payload in a ram drive i question your motives

2404757
implements	extends
do i need to implements this snippet elsewhere or have it extends a different class

2404763
gcj	javac
i see here that ant supports gcj compilation through the javac tag

2404818
getter	setter
synthesize will generate the getter and setter for you

2404851
fgets	strlen
caveats do not use strlen aname - 1 because a line returned by fgets may start with the nul character - thus the index into the buffer becomes -1

2405064
for-loop	arrays	put	get
i need to get a range of pages using ajax and put them into an arrays where their given place in the arrays is equal to the i of a for-loop it s a caching-like function for blog pages and the range of the for-loop is entirely variable

2405126
disk	ram
try different block sizes to find the sweet spot performance-wise depending on your disk filesystem and available ram

2405134
hide	show
all the columns are included in the report designer and i use parameters to hide show columns based on the user s choice

2405166
int	boolean
if you need to be able to answer the question of whether an x y z triplet is in your data set you either store an impossible w value -1 perhaps if they re otherwise positive int or int_max if they re otherwise finite or at each point you store a struct of a w int and a boolean is_present flag and set the flag to true false for whether that index is present in your data set

2405234
strtok	getline
actually if it s within the constraints of your assignment i d recommend abandoning and strtok in favor of string istringstream and getline

2405261
width	height
i have a winforms gui in c# that allows a user to draw a rectangle on a display of a tiff and save the position height width etc

2405261
width	height
basically what i want to do is take the saved position height and width of the rectangle and clip that area into a sep

2405288
multiplying	transpose
transpose and multiplying the rotation matrix does not change the rotation matrix --- a rotation matrix is orthogonal which means it s transpose is equal to its inverse and therefore r t -1 r

2405307
post	get
using this you will get array of category object for each post the loop is currently processing

2405336
google-chrome	safari
for some reason when a user attempts to print any article of this type from a webkit-based browser i ve confirmed this in both safari and google-chrome the pages are all blank

2405341
folder	directory
then ensure that you create a bin folder in each of the virtual directory and copy the library into there as well

2405353
post	get
however now with the new csrf middleware component api requests from the desktop client that are post ed get a 403

2405357
tcplistener	tcpclient
i want to use the tcpclient and tcplistener to send an mp3 file over a network

2405358
hide	show
in the first step the second div is hidden css and when the customer goes to step 2 the first div is hidden with jquery hide and the second div show with jquery show

2405362
16-bit	64bit
you couldn t write a file on say a 64bit host and read the file back in on a 16-bit microwave oven controller

2405503
cruisecontrol	teamcity
how about using a build server cruisecontrol bamboo teamcity etc

2405541
hide	show
use to hide and to show

2405611
rsa	aes
windows vista and later supports sha-2 in the microsoft enhanced rsa and aes cryptographic provider for cryptoapi and the .net framework has supported sha-2 since .net 1.1

2405621
versioning	upgrade
update i upgrade memcached to versioning 1.4.2 packaged on lucid repos with the exact same result

2405633
opera	google-chrome
the problem i am encountering is that for my login form i have to login twice for the session to register properly but only in google-chrome my version is 4.0.249.89 and opera my version is 10.10

2405662
user-controls	elementhost
specialusercontrol is the user-controls with wpf textbox within an elementhost object

2405714
google-chrome	safari
as that doesn t solve problems of testing in ie google-chrome safari

2405781
free	malloc
this is how it is with malloc free this is how it is with

2405781
free	malloc
in fact in a typical implementation raw memory allocations for calls are eventually processed by some implementation-specific malloc free -like pair which means that doesn t really have to care about how much memory to deallocate it simply calls that internal free or whatever it is named which takes care of that

2405827
aggregate-functions	sum
my cube has a measure called amount with a aggregate-functions sum and transactionnumber with a agregate function count and a time dimesion transactiontype dimension and others

2405835
mouseup	mousedown
as others have mentioned the right mouse button can be detected through the usual mouse events mousedown mouseup click

2405838
opera	safari
opera and safari

2405896
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
apache has mod_proxy nginx has http proxy lighttpd has its own mod_proxy.

2405915
post	get
note that the latter three views are still accessed via get even though they are processed via overloaded post

2405915
post	get
get article add - displays a form for adding a new article fetched via get processed via post

2405915
post	put	post	get	put	get
get article 123 edit - displays article 123 in edit mode fetched via get processed via put overloaded as post

2405915
post	get
get article 123 delete - displays delete confirmation for article 123 fetched via get processed via delete overloaded as post

2405915
put	get
a better implementation of the above might be to put the add edit delete keywords into a get parameter - since they do not change the resource we re working with it might be better to keep the base uri same for all of them

2405939
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
i don t know how good the rubyzip implementation is but with java.util.zip implementation the outputstream can be set to bytearrayoutputstream fileoutputstream filteroutputstream objectoutputstream outputstream pipedoutputstream ..

2406130
width	height
then the scroller has a scrollerlayout which sizes the scroller if it has an explicit width height it uses that otherwise it uses it s content sizes

2406151
unix	bsd
mac os x was based on bsd unix so is it possible

2406157
int	double
you can t overload + for int types and similarly you can t overload for double types

2406180
cpu	processors
for complicated reasons having to do with the internal electronics of the cpu for most modern processors it is faster to perform a direct branch where the destination address is encoded in the instruction than an indirect branch where the address is computed at runtime

2406222
width	height
coordinate java.awt.rectangle x 0 y 0 width 0 height 0

2406222
width	height
coordinate java.awt.rectangle x 5 y 5 width 23 height 16

2406255
html5lib	beautifulsoup
the main alternative i think would be html5lib -- i haven t tries it on app engine but i believe it does run there quite slowly -- if that s a problem i think you need to stick with beautifulsoup this service runs on app engine and is based on html5lib

2406258
hide	show
either pass autodestroy false this can be set at the tabpanel level as well and hide existing components after removing them then simply show them on subsequent clicks or you ll have to reinstantiate them before adding each time

2406288
awt	swing
why don t you learn swing instead of awt then you can use a jtextfield

2406324
getter	setter
modify the getter setter not via configuration though

2406342
post	get
so if you can initially select each post parse it get the first paragraph and insert it into another table then have your plugin do that when each new post is saved you re home

2406353
folder	directory
however i have migrated the mock-up folder to the root directory and in implementing these rules for the site some files are not being served in the pdfs folder

2406374
int	chars
when you try and assign that int to a chars there is a possible loss of precision 32 bit signed to 16 bit unsigned

2406380
int	chars
both userinput.charat 0 and 0 are of type chars but they are implicitly converted to int for the operation subtraction and hence when the int result is assigned to a chars java will given an error

2406466
urllib	httplib
beautifulsoup and mechanize should both work out of the box on app engine - it provides a wrapper around httplib and urllib that uses urlfetch as a backend

2406488
public	protected
the jvm only knows package-protected protected public and private visibility

2406491
children	parent
i have a class called man parent class and two children namely toddler and old man they are its children because they override a behaviour in man called as walk

2406512
subtraction	multiplication
once you understand what the code does my suggestion would be to implement vector subtraction and multiplication

2406523
vmware	virtualbox
another good option that you might want to investigate is running linux inside of virtualbox or vmware on your windows machine

2406526
int	double
for example you can typically use the binary + operator to add numeric values floats int double etc.

2406541
post	put
right now i am rewriting all the action to use form tags post and add in a hidden value called _method which would be delete for deleting action and put for updating action

2406576
width	height
on the image you could set max-width max-height giving support for ie 7 and everything else and then pick whichever you really need the most between width and height using an ie6 conditional to set that

2406592
getter	setter
the second case is better when you want to provide a setter deleter docstring as well as the getter or if you want to add a property that has a different name to the method it derives its value from

2406595
hide	show
if you are sure that at some point the run-time user is going to want to create a datagridview why not create it in advance visually style it create columns etc. and then hide it when the form loads then show it on demand

2406628
switching	screens
is there a way to switching views in a viewflipper just like on home screens where we have small dots at the bottom of the screens and on clicking on them we can switching views

2406675
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
although you tagged as firefox google-chrome safari and opera 10.5 also have support for audio

2406676
int	chars
for example if you use the increment decrement operators ++ and -- on an object the compiler will not understand what needs to be incremented decremented in the object because it is not a primitive type int chars float...

2406696
condor	checkpoint
checkpoint is the only condor feature not available on windows

2406708
explode	implode
i would show yet another version that may shorter and involves using implode and explode but i m sure that s enough for now

2406721
umask	sudo
if you forget to use this and your default umask is more restrictive or less restrictive then you will need to re-run the non- sudo

2406743
versioning	upgrade
we had lots of tug-of-wars with customers that didn t want to upgrade for whatever reason or wanted to do their own qa on the new versioning

2406847
wordpress	expressionengine
is there any cms such as expressionengine or wordpress that allows a user to click a button and convert all the text to another language it would have to be human generated otherwise it has too many mistakes probably

2406929
html5lib	beautifulsoup
for normalizing html using a pure python library i have had better experiences with html5lib than beautifulsoup

2406955
inherited	properties
inherited is about how properties trickle down from an element to its children

2406955

in python you can concatenate boolean values and it would return an int

2407018
pascal	delphi
there are free serialization libraries for delphi also for free pascal

2407018
omnixml	nativexml
xml omnixml and nativexml

2407018
serializable	deserialization
update i would not use the constructor-based approach while maybe looking trivial in the beginning deserialization can become a complex process which would add more and more non-class-specific code to the classes which need serializable

2407021
width	height
that value is then used to change the sizer width and height thus updating the scrollviewer s scrollbars

2407080

i know qwidget settaborder qwidget qwidget but since i am setting the data through qstandarditemmodel how can i acheive the desired tab order in qtableview

2407308
google-chrome	firefox
it appears that the element indices are different in ie and in google-chrome firefox as .eq 2 returns different values depending on browser

versioning	upgrade
our upgrade process now involves building synchronized replicas of the two versioning taking extracts from the live query logs and playing these against both versioning and comparing the results

2407357
qmenubar	qmainwindow
if you want to remove the menu bar from the qmainwindow you can use the qt_no_menubar preprocessor to remove all uses of a qmenubar

2407357
qmainwindow	qwidget
if you are not using facilities provided by qmainwindow maybe you can use a simple qwidget as main window in your application

2407365
google-chrome	firefox
ï ½ odd character when request file via ajax method and also ext.ajax.request.only problem on firefox browser.internet explorer 8 and google-chrome no effect.the file i request come from windows iis server

2407371
allocator	stl
i am not sure about the granularity of the stl allocator in the current configuration you are working on

2407415
children	parent
but if you really need to roll your own i d suggest having an object with parent name directories children and files

2407475
stdout	stderr
you can obviously do the reverse with as 1 refers to stdout and 2 to stderr

2407475
stdout	stderr
for piping stderr to stdout

2407475
stdout	stderr
for piping stderr and stdout to stdout

2407490
multiplying	add
the common idea to get hash is to multiplying each bitpattern of a float with a prime and add them together

2407510
width	height
starting at width 0 height 0 for when it is in contact with the background when it moves over the edge expand it by a reasonable amount eg 5px per loop until it has a hittest

2407529
apache	nginx
i would configure your webserver nginx or apache to look for a maintenance.html page and serve that up with a 503 status if it exists

2407545
pop-up	dialog
an error dialog will pop-up showing you every directory that was searched - you should be able to confirm that the directory with pocomsg.h in it isn t there

2407583
width	height
turn of docking for the tablelayout and set its width height larger than the form

2407602
post	put
i once wondered about this too so i figured it out and put it in a blog post

2407648
udp	tcp
you might mean providing an end-point for a tcp circuit or udp stream

2407648
udp	tcp
the entire point of the assignment it seems is to show you understand the raw layout of ip packets and possibly tcp udp

2407679
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
its working fine in ie firefox and safari but the event does not trigger in google-chrome

2407729
nexus	artifactory
i would suggest that you setup your own repository such as archiva nexus or artifactory

2407788
int	chars
if you explicitly cast your chars to an int it ll use the ascii code else it s not doing the cast by itself to int so you get the strange results you are getting

2407806
subtract	add
so really you just need to get the local timezone offset and feed it into the basic equation timezone.getdefault + 6 and you ll know what to add or subtract to your local db

2407818
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
afaik it is supported by ie5.5+ firefox google-chrome safari and opera but you can test any of them properly at quirksmode.org s test page

2407983
getter	setter
using explicit getter and setter for properties on the object like the example you gave for set_name instead of directly accessing them gives you among others the following advantages

2408012
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol	uinavigationbar	uisegmentedcontrol
in my app i have a uitableview uisegmentedcontrol and uinavigationbar

2408012
uinavigationbar	uisegmentedcontrol

2408027
gif	png
i only need to handle png so jpg gif etc

2408031
hash	md5
you are probably computing md5 or sha1 hash which change drastically on minor change of the input

2408056
children	parent
and to add some more complexity how can the positioning of the children be relative to the width of the parent itemscontrol

2408080
put	get
i feel you get back what you put into comments 5 minutes commenting a class well will in 3 months time when the class needs to be changed by someone else other than the original author indeed sometimes by the original author will take much less time to get to grips with

2408165
post	put
see this codinghorror post for a nicely put explanation

2408188
google-chrome	firefox
this solution worked just ok in firefox and google-chrome but than i found out

2408201
gif	ico
ico and gif files support only single bit for transparency - every pixel is either fully opaque or fully transparent

2408208
content-disposition	content-type
the way to force the browser not to handle the file internally is to change the headers content-disposition prefereably or content-type so the browser will not try to handle the file internally

2408212
udp	tcp
i have tried socket.receivebuffsize it has no effect at all for udp and it clearly said that it is for tcp window

2408241
getter	setter
as a counterpoint to christophed s answer if your instance variable is strictly for private use i wouldn t bother with writing a getter setter and just declare the instance variable private

2408241
getter	setter
in addition using a getter setter also shields other parts of the same class from knowing about its own implementation which i ve found very useful on occasion

2408265
jboss	weblogic
then changing to a different database would simply mean changing the separate datasource configuration in jboss jetty weblogic etc

2408281
post	get
i get the country from the post i query db with that get cities and craft cities back into a dropdown

2408306
put	get
in other words how do i get the sliders to freeze and stay put when the minimum value slider and the maximum value slider come next to each other

2408353
put	get
when i try to put the return values of a method that returns a profileentity into the wrapper i get the above error

2408531
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
made this nice little loop for hiding and showing div s works as a charm in firefox and opera but ie safari and google-chrome say s no...

2408537
vsto	add-in
centralizing vsto add-in exception management with postsharp

2408565
post	get
with php the get variable is a global variable along with others the big ones being post and cookie that the php script can retrieve by getting the value passed from the server to script in this case in

2408574
implements	extends
create a class that extends defaulttablecellrenderer and implements the gettablecellrenderercomponent method something like

2408580
getter	setter
getter and setter are optional but you need them if you want to be able to set their properties using the properties window

2408589
base-class	subclassing
add another protected virtual method to the base-class which called initarrayimpl and order the creator of the subclassing to fill the array in it

2408670
stdout	stderr
read data from stdout and stderr until end-of-file is reached

2408679
stdout	stderr
communicate reads data from stdout and stderr until end-of-file is reached

2408707
width	height
the image itself does not have any width or height set but its size is correctly controlled through the columndefinition set

2408707
width	height
from this i would assume that the image controller actually has a width and height set but when i try to bind another element to its width and height it doesn t work

2408740
distance	polygons
bill chadwick s google maps api demos scroll to distance point to polyline or polygons

2408747
ienumerable	ilist
since findallsites seems to return an ilist which is descended from ienumerable you should be able to use system.linq s extension methods select

2408772
pull	push
also do i need to clone push pull to the original library project or is this done automatically when committing in the main project

2408803
hide	show
it show a div with a loading message when the img is loaded it hide the loadig message and call a function with the visual transition transizione

2408805
getter	setter
you should have setter getter methods

2408805
getter	setter
no need to declare members or setter getter functions

2408806
onresume	onpause
furthermore using the onresume onpause etc is somewhat necessary

2408807
rss	feed
zend_feed_reader to read the rss feed

2408826
webrat	cucumber
i had originally configured factory_girl to be looked for config.gem but not loaded in the cucumber environment and fully required in features support env.rb same as cucumber does for webrat etc

2408843
dynamicmethod	reflection.emit
replacing with typed delegates dynamicmethod etc - or taking it hardcore reflection.emit

2408857
single-quotes	double-quotes
it assumes this between signs test 0 is a parameter of your tag try substituting single-quotes with double-quotes and make it html xhtml compliant

2408857
single-quotes	double-quotes
so single-quotes and double-quotes will be correctly set

2408887
int	chars
the reason for failure is that is replaced with the contents of stdio.h and when you replace int with chars within the content you break some declarations

2408887
stdio	gets
from usr include bits types.h which gets included indirectly through stdio

2408887
int	chars
clearly when you replace int with chars it becomes

2408895
int	chars
there are defined variables of type short int long int and so on which obviously fails when you change them through define to short chars and long chars

2408896
int	chars
since errors are from types.h it must modifying some stuff like short int to short chars etc

2408944
min	max
you just want to see if the passwords match and are between a min and max length

2408973
folder	directory
this way you can create your folder in shared directory and symlink it upon deployment like

2409077
regasm	regsvr32
i understand that regsvr32 and or regasm needs to be used to register my dll not sure which i have found conflicting advice

2409146
allocator	stl
why not use stl but provide your own allocator and deallocator for example stl vector is defined as you can create and set your own allocator that request memory space from your memory pool

2409169
stdout	stderr
the command time sends it s output to stderr instead of stdout

2409175
post	get
javascript can only send values to serverside php via post or get

2409196
kde	gnome
my impression is that people tend to stick to one widget toolkit gtk for gnome and qt for kde but on the other hand i would be surprised to see that someone isn t using a good application he she needs just because of the toolkit

2409241
free	malloc
the most obvious scenario would be integration with a legacy system the requires you to pass or accept ownership of some memory as you shouldn t mix new free or malloc delete

2409247
hide	show
i need to hide or disable then enable or show site menu i mean visible content

2409273
realloc	malloc
even then malloc is rarely the right thing to do but sometimes you may want to take advantage of realloc be able to resize the underlying storage more efficiently

2409285
hide	show
if i understood correctly you want to hide show menu base on user authenticated or not

2409303
stdout	stderr
there are other ways by which an application can start a new process by the _system library function but i strongly suggest to use createprocess directly in your code since you can control the child process behaviour completely you can select the priority pass stdin stdout stderr handles decide the startup window s characteristics...

2409311
implements	extends
doing a little more research i did find a few things on how to get the dependency injection to work where you are implements extends an instance provider a service behavior and a service host class.

2409317
as.date	posixct
the only way i could get it to work was by converting my posixct timestamps using as.date

2409323
public	protected
create public or protected instance of accessor class that will wrap m_arr and m_field_initialized

2409323
int	double
accessor should have setval int i double val method which will set and additionaly flag to true

2409336
getter	setter
just create a private variable with getter and setter that you continually update

2409340
maven	pom.xml
xmlbeans maven plugin conf in pom.xml

2409350
qiodevice	qudpsocket
if you want stream orientated behaviour you could use the fact that qudpsocket is a qiodevice with a data-stream but it sounds as if you want per-datagram behaviour

2409363
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller don t deal with uiviews they deal with uiviewcontroller

2409410
min	max
in addition to the min max size constraint i want the control always being painted with

2409431
folder	directory
i m thinking of something that looks similar to windows explorer with a directory structure on the left in a panel and then when you click on a particular folder you would be able to view some text or html that describes the folder in the right hand panel

2409444
pop-up	dialog
my problem is that by clicking on add button from dialogdemo.jspx not any pop-up window or dialog box is opened

2409462
swt	swing
based on these requirements i ve narrowed down the selection of toolkits to qt and wxwidgets since none of the other toolkits that i know about including java s swing and swt flex air etc. satisfy the native-looking requirement

2409549
pull	push
according to the help pull push commit etc should act on the subrepo as well

2409572
int	boolean
like raveren said you can t send int or boolean to php

2409593
extjs	qooxdoo
i compared qooxdoo with yui and extjs and i think qooxdoo is the way to go for programmers - yui isn t that polished as qooxdoo from a programmer s point of view and extjs has a not so friendly licensing model

2409595
submit	submission
one solution may be to use the jquery ajax forms plugin which will submit the form to the server and give you back the result of the submission which would avoid breaking the page lifecycle

2409598
hide	show
this is a form validation that will hide the submit button if the input field s are not valid and show it if all the input fields are valid

2409604
rss	feed
i want to provide an rss feed for this

2409604
rss	feed
so what is the way to create an rss feed which other can use to subscribe

2409625
folder	directory
i think you won t get around manually exporting all folder in project b that came from project a thus removing the faulty .svn directory and re-add them

2409637
rss	feed
when feed aggregator fetches this url the servlet i believe this is how they are called in java world fetches a list of recent products from the db or wherever build rss feed and then sends it back to the requester which turns out to be a feed aggregator

2409700
inherited	subclassing
here s an instance from the nhibernate documentation or if you use inherited you will only need to map your derived classes as subclassing and specify the datatable name for each of them from within your base type class mapping

2409719
put	get
therefore i d like to simply ensure that all access to the backend which will be a few rest queries to get and put data will be via a valid iphone application and not some script running on a machine

2409725
fflush	gets
the most common reason for this fail is that the headers have already been fflush and body output has started before php gets to the header script

2409732
width	height
i have 2 vbox containers inside a viewstack and the viewstack is inside hbox i ve set both the height and width of the vboxes to 100 and the same for the viewstack

2409732
width	height
my problem is that the viewstack does not display the whole content of the container childs only a part of it and displays a vertical scroll although the width is stretched to fill the whole width of the container hbox why doesn t the viewstack stretches to show the 100 height of its child and does it for the width only

2409771
rss	feed
the control it meant to read in a twitter rss feed for a specific account and write out the last 2 tweets

2409771
rss	feed
i often see this error message on the prod site so i m wondering if it s making too many requests to the rss feed

2409801
vmware	virtualbox
if you run vmware or workstation or maybe virtualbox i m not sure if it supports mac os x but may and then mac os x server client can t legally be virtualized

2409815
implements	extends
to exectue java code whenever this request arrives at your server just create a class which extends httpservlet which listens on an url-pattern of run and has the dopost roughly implements as follows

2409832
ssl	https
but when we configure ssl https it is not working and throwing the below error

2409847
mouse	keyboard
if you have to get input into fullscreen mode you can try to make a virtual keyboard an example and user will use the mouse to press the keyboard key

2409867
google-chrome	firefox
i have need to move the mouse cursor position in the browser i can use any method as long as its in google-chrome or firefox one or the other

2409881
apache	nginx
you can use for example apache with mod_mono or nginx on linux

2409908
jquery	jqmodal
you re probably looking for jquery ui dialog or jqmodal

2409970
java.util.date	simpledateformat
i ve got a question about simpledateformat class and the java.util.date s compareto method

2409975
button	checkbox
my users found it very confusing to have to insert a special mark in the body even though fck editor provides a button and to use the checkbox to say whether the teaser should be included in the article

2409992
hash	md5
find md5 hash of url while fetching them

2409992
hash	md5
i fetch one table as an array run a loop through it and insert the values from other table where md5 hash is the same

2410045
put	get
if you can get away with less space 512 i think for nvarchar than you could put uniqueness constraints in sql and index on the column which would make the search so much faster - definitely my recommendation if you think you could cut the message length

2410068
memcpy	strcpy
i tried with memcpy strcpy etc etc

2410077
many-to-many	one-to-many
i m thinking about one-to-one one-to-many or many-to-many relationships

2410077
many-to-many	one-to-many
example let s say i have a blog post which has a many-to-many with tags and a one-to-many with comments

2410081
getter	setter
i understand the properties are just getter and setter so i m not sure how it would work

2410087
strdup	malloc	strcpy	strdup	strcpy	malloc
if you have it you can use strdup to combine the malloc + strcpy into one call

2410087
strdup	malloc
obviously this lacks error handling malloc and strdup can both fail

2410105
instances	transient
my solution was to create a new property injection strategy that kept track of previously activated instances that were not transient in scope and skip the default property injection strategy for activation requests for such instances

2410116
min	max
updated to max instead of min

2410134
klocwork	coverity
i think itâ s better software engineering to do the false-positive marking outside the code as in coverity and klocwork and do your enforcement based on that

2410162
width	height
and your desired width and height

2410188
equals	icomparable	equals	compareto	icomparable	compareto
you might implement icomparable without implementing iequatable for a class where a partial ordering makes sense and where very definitely you wish the consumer to draw the inference that just because compareto returns zero this does not imply that the objects are equals for anything other than sorting purposes

2410194
ant	maven
you can extend buckminster by writing new readers to obtain source from other locations or new actors that provide build steps - these actors can reuse maven or ant thus providing extra functionality

2410227
int	chars
the issue is that when you read into an int variable using c++ streams the input method expects chars that can make up a number such as + - 0 .

2410227
int	chars
if you want to see the ascii value you will need to output the chars variable as an int generally requiring a cast before output

2410239
opensuse	linux
i m using qt 4.6.3 on opensuse linux 11.2

2410291
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
use viewwillappear or viewdidappear

2410308
superclass	subclassing
if i now create an instance of subclassing and call a will a call b from superclass or from subclassing

2410309
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sortedlist sorteddictionary or sortedset if you re using .net 4.0 probably do everything you need here with only a fairly small amount of work

2410341
udp	tcp
which tcp and or udp ports needs to be open between hosts a and b for cassandra to operate properly

2410425
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
for every object you want to save in the recordstore pare it down to its component strings and primitives then serialise it to a byte array using a bytearrayoutputstream wrapped in a dataoutputstream

2410441
post	put
you could post the details view action and put the extra parameters in the form rather than the url so the user can still bookmark the url

2410593
rss	feed
our email vendor supports rss feed for dynamic content which we use successfully for daily headline type emails

2410593
rss	feed
since we use movable type for his blog is there a way to generate a rss feed that only contains items posted on the current day

2410594
post	get
but before you start doing this note it is a really really bad idea to simply take every post and get variable and spit it into the global namespace

2410613
shadowing	named
also please don t use such named as sum for your variables you re shadowing built-in

2410657
png	ico
you upload a large 512x512 png it gives you an ico that works the way it should with multiple embedded images in different sizes

2410795
udp	tcp
i have tried socket.receivebuffsize it has no effect at all for udp and it clearly said that it is for tcp window

2410800
width	height
in which method are you reading the width height value

2410823
csv	tsv
instead of trying to build your own csv tsv file parser or using string.split i d recommend you have a look at fast csv reader or filehelpers library

2410849
getter	setter
do you have classes with many getter and setter

2411009
inherited	properties
you should get this object in the openreadcompletedeventargs in the userstate properties inherited from asynccompletedeventargs

2411022
implements	extends
but in the definition of the class there no extends statement only implements

2411031
pull	push
copying .git is not an option since i want refs to push pull with and i don t want to set them up manually

2411049
put	get
where the routehandler splits the path into its correct parts to get the correct report and this works great if i put in a route www.mysite.com report folder1 folder2 report then i ll get what i m looking for however my problem is if i have a link like www.mysite.com report folder1 report the path is only folder1 report and the routing really doesn t like this in fact it doesn t even hit my route handler just goes straight to resource can t be found server error page

2411065
ubuntu	linux
also fwiw chrome 5.0.322.2 dev under linux ubuntu 9.1 does not have this issue

2411072
uielement	adorner
is there any way to make wpf adorner ignore mouse entirely so that the uielement behind the adorner still gets mouse events as if the adorner does not exist

2411106
post	get
using javascript you can send get and post requests but you will not be able to read the response like you can with xhr

2411116
invokerequired	begininvoke
i ve read articles for winforms that suggest using invokerequired to automatically call begininvoke if necessary

2411131
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade jquery to versioning 1.4.2 and i am now getting an error on this line

2411132
int	chars
in my case i am just checking the int representation of the chars and if it is 65 returning true else false

2411164
gridview	formview
components like the gridview formview datagrid follow the 80 20 rule

2411177
folder	directory
that created a directory for my sub-branch in the original branch s folder structure

2411187
uielement	adorner
if you use the tunneling version of the mouse events rather than the bubbling events previewmousedown instead of mousedown you will receive the mouse events from the uielement first and be able to stop them from reaching the adorner by setting e.handled to true

2411235
hide	show
then when each filter is changed show hide the divs based on class selectors

2411314
slideup	slidedown
i have seen slideup and slidedown in jquery

2411315
for-loop	loops
i would like to convert my for-loop to stl std for_each loops

2411323
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
i want to use mysqlconnection command and sqldatareader or sqlconnection command and sqldatareader based on a condition

2411335
getter	setter
as i look at it you have a getter and setter for each attribute of the class package

2411335
getter	setter
are these getter and setter really needed

2411335
getter	setter
having getter setter for all those attributes doesn t go well with encapsulation

2411384
solaris	sunos
the 1.5 and 1.6 versions are what the java compiler says using java -version and sometimes the minor release is used as a version string like sunos 5.8 was called solaris 8 as a product name

2411397
width	height
this prints a height of 44 and a width of 320

nunit	mstest
you can use the mstest framework to run your test testclass attribute and testmethod attribute for each test but use the nunit assert api

2411687
mvp	presenter
i have been searching on the net and i made a couple of examples of both of them but i m even more confused because in some sample web pages mvp uses more than 2 interfaces to communicate the presenter with the view layer some ones even have completely blank interfaces only declarated but in other ones it only takes two interfaces to transport data from presenter to view

mdpi	hdpi
it also says that if the mdpi directory doesn t exist and a mdpi device is running the app it will scale down the hdpi ones so everything looks good

2411865
put	get
it would be much simpler to code if get and put were reduced to their bare bones no timeouts no no-waits etc and all subqueues used a single overall mutex very small overhead wrt many mutexes and much easier to code in a deadlock-free way

2411887
children	parent
there could be multiple children with the same parent for example - intersect should only return that id once

i ve tried pretty much every other method of getting data from the client tcpsocket but all of them hang and never break out of the loop getc gets read etc

2412839
uiview	subviews
in the meantime you could construct a custom uiview with uilabels and colored lines to act as the legend for the graph then add it as a sibling to the graph not a subviews or it will not be rendered properly and order it to show above the graph

2412843
switching	screens

2413463
subtract	add
add subtract the hours from time_t.tm_hour

2413521
public	protected
basically in the latter version getname must be public although i think you can use friend and so must be the inheritance whereas in the former the inheritance can be private and or the interface functions can be protected if desired

2413535
inherited	properties
however i see one reason to use them anyway if you have an object of type mysubtype which inherited from mytype you might want to render only properties defined in mytype in that case you just have to specify mytype as the type parameter overriding the type inference

2413540

in this case by far the easiest approach is to write a serializable deserialization method for your entity

2413848
multiplying	multiplication
and don t use divide where multiplying will do multiplication is typically faster though not always

whirlpool	md5
i suggest using sha2 224 256 384 512 md5 ripemd160 or whirlpool if you can

2414110
children	parent
however perhaps since the documentation says they are stored close to one another if the many image entities were grouped as children to a single mosaic layer parent than this has the advantage that the writing in transaction and reading will happen much faster

2414154
width	height
the paintpicture method accepts width height and a few other parameters to help get the image to fit and the printer object gives you all sorts of info about the printer

2414506
width	height
or in the css style with width height

2414510
accessor	properties
in c# you can have more restrictive accessor on the accessor of a properties like this

you can pass 3 options uri method get post

2414554
hide	show
modify effects for your needs if show hide isn t what you need

2414555

onchange	onblur
i want to be able to enter data and use javascript onchange onblur etc to render a live print preview

2414578

some way what i want to do is this once i click on calender the selected value should show in textbox and calender should hide

2414615
min	max
so if you have no agregation function sum max min avg count etc. selected you will not be able to group by

2414617
width	height
specifying width and height in the image tag is a good practice..this way when the page loads there is space allocated for the image and the layout does not suffer any jerks even if the image takes a long time to load

2414623
width	height
if you d like to use inline styles though it s probably best to set the width and height using the style attribute for the sake of readability

2414624
width	height
the historical reason to define height width in tags is so that browsers can size the actual elements in the page even before the css and or image resources are loaded

2414624
width	height
if you do not supply height and width explicitly the element will be rendered at 0x0 until the browser can size it based on the file

2414624
width	height
sizing the via height width creates a physical placeholder in the page flow at the correct size enabling your content to load asynchronously without disrupting the user experience

2414624
width	height
alternately if you are doing mobile-responsive design which is a best practice these days it s quite common to specify a width or max-width only and define the height as auto

2414624
width	height
that way when you define media queries css for different screen widths you can simply adjust the image width and let the browser deal with keeping the image height aspect ratio correct

2414645
hide	show
module third party to perform a small operation in my main application when i call that module..it processes for a particular time say 5 sec.while its proccessing it show the process in the commmand window with some information..now my main application waits until the called module finishes its process.now my question is..how to do i hide this command window without disturbing its process..i tried to use the createprocess but it seems to not work.

2414669
allocator	stl
stl implementation differ on every platform so exposing stl in library will have risk for example if you expose std map on your library since you can not export std map from your library your library will be forced to use std map implementation from your library users the one that load your lib this will cause some incompatibility such as different version of stl implementation different stl allocator class and some platform specific issues

2414672

2414708
gif	bmp	gif	png	gif	ico	bmp	png	png	ico
if you have a byte array that represents a file that wpf can decode bmp jpg gif png tif ico you can do the following

2414737
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
so my launchconditions will never fire on uninstall and will correctly detect which versioning if any is being upgrade from

2414746
affinity	processors
you can get better accuracy by running you timer pooling routine inside a separate thread and set that thread affinity to one core processors and set the thread priority the highest you can get

2414791
opensuse	linux
on a relatively modern linux opensuse 11.1 the default is 32 768 processes

2414791
children	parent
if the parent processes does not reap it s children you ll need to kill the parent process so that init can reap the zombies

2414807

i love vi and i m looking for a plugin of some sort that would allow me to input text in my browser preferably firefox or google-chrome using vi commands

2414824
yacc	bison
here are some reasons i could think of for using lex yacc or flex bison

2414824
yacc	bison
the developer is already familiar with lex yacc or flex bison

2414841
affinity	processors
in the rare cases where you absolutely need to be sure that it never happens then locking your threads down by setting the processors affinity mask is the only option

2414880
post	get
for post params you would need to do something else obviously but to get them to jqgrid it s the same idea

2414935
interpolation	splines
but as the saying goes there are lies damn lies and bicubic splines interpolation

2414940
width	height
i m going to go against the grain here and state that the principle of separating content from layout which would justify the answers that suggest using css does not always apply to image height and width

2414940
width	height
each image has an innate original height and width that can be derived from the image data

2414940
width	height
in the framework of content vs layout i would say that this derived height and width information is content not layout and should therefore be rendered as html as element attributes

2414940
width	height
at the least the aspect ratio could prove useful image has a width of 15 and a height of 200

2414940
width	height
the spec says that the width and height attributes can also be used to override the height and width conveyed in the actual image file

2414940
width	height
to override height and width i believe css inline embedded or external is the best approach

2414940
width	height
i think ideally the original height and width would always be specified as html element attributes while styling information should optionally be conveyed in css

2415002
width	height
by default cgrect instance variables are set to cgrectzero but remember that this is just a normal cgrect struct at location 0 0 with 0 width and 0 height

2415009
put	get
instead google allows you to put custom attributes inside your html which can then be retrieved from the xml you get back from google custom search results api

2415020

that means a linear search will almost always be substantially more efficient overall than a trie or suffix tree

2415113
children	parent
at the top of your module class just use an imports and all parent and children will use this namespace

2415121
actualheight	rowdefinition
unlike frameworkelement which does define actualheight as a dependency property rowdefinition doesn t derive from frameworkelement and just defines actualheight as a normal property with no change event

2415134
width	height
3 the height has been zoomed an identical amount to the width

2415134
width	height
img id test src alt map test usemap #maptest width 800 height 800

2415148
lxml	beautifulsoup
either accept the need to loop not through every tag in general but through all with a given tag name or upgrade to a richer interface such as beautifulsoup or lxml

2415194
pull	push
if you and bob are working on a project and you re not always going to be able to push pull from each other s personal machines or you work in a company that wants a place for the latest clean trunk then a shared server with a no-trees repository is your answer

2415200
inline	inlining
with normal inlining all kinds of effects on register usage local variables etc are there that the compiler cannot do with inline assembly

2415220
int	chars
scanner.nextint catches the first int occurrence and nothing else so it doesn t handle the new line chars which scanner.readline will see as its input

2415228
int	double
if the number of digits is 16 normal precision of double convert that int into floating point directly and return

2415238
bazaar	git
this type of flexibility is what draws me to bazaar despite the fact that git is wildly more popular and faster

2415280
google-chrome	firefox
i tried to use css to give a style to the page but there were lots of problems to keep the page aligned between different browsers and i tested only internet explorer firefox and google-chrome

2415287
codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	yii	cakephp	yii
you should be able to solve this using cakephp symfony codeigniter yii zend or any other framework so it is better to do some real testing

2415287
codeigniter	yii
you might also consider footprint and execution time and find a framework that performes well and is not too cpu heavy read yii or codeigniter for instance

2415310
rss	feed
a i want to be able to support password protection of my rss feed through the following authentication methods

2415310
kerberos	ntlm
integrated windows ntlm kerberos

2415310
rss	feed
reading over the rss 2.0 specification i saw nothing related to security so i assume that security implemented for the rss feed is handled on one end by the web server handling the http request for the rss feed and on the other end by the client requesting access to the rss feed

2415310
rss	feed
i m curious to know how or if sites like userland or asp.net weblogs offer password protected rss feed and on the other side of the fence how are rss aggregators like newsgator newzcrawler sharpreader etc

2415310
rss	feed
handling password protected rss feed

2415362
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work in firefox 3 and in google-chrome with both get and getjson

2415387
jobs	cron
it is quite common that cron backup jobs etc run and hit your server and the team has forotten why those were set up in the first place

2415396
bazaar	git
minscm an abstract front-end for mercurial git bazaar from takeshi nishida

2415415
mouseover	mouseout
edit the main problem now is that the second bigger menu social_menu that is shown on top of the smaller mouseover triggering element share_words only closes when you mouseout the smaller trigger element even though this element is hidden

2415420
google-chrome	safari
the color animations doesn t wokr on webkit safari google-chrome

2415420
google-chrome	safari
and you will be find a is not run and b is ok in safari and google-chrome

2415442
uiview	uiwindow
i had a uiwindow in which i placed an opengles uiview

2415451
filesystems	fat
fat filesystems and network filesystems will have their own ordering or no ordering - the files might just be in the directory in whatever order they happened to be created - i think fat systems are like that

2415473
stdout	stderr
a simple redirects stdout to stderr will clear things up and give that instant aha

2415497
appkit	nsimage
uikit iphone defines uiimage and appkit mac os x defines nsimage you use the one for the platform you are targeting

2415504
pascal	delphi
some languages have direct support for that in delphi pascal for example you can do that like that

2415526
post	get
it serves content on top of http protocol webdav uses http and adds special methods to standard post and get and word is webdav client

2415544
hide	show
i probably don t want method level security because i want to use spring taglibs to selectively show hide menu items however there should be way to prohibit unauthorized user to access a page directly through url

2415551
unsigned	short
additionally i m not fully seeing the use of the unsigned short if you are planning on writing a binary file consider that the unsigned char type is generally of size byte making it very convenient for that purpose

2415567
opera	firefox
firefox and opera will download an equivalent data set in 40 seconds

2415567
opera	firefox
firefox and opera are probably using between 4 and 8 connections to download all of the files

2415628
post	get
in get or post requests though utf-8 encoding is obviously expected which the standard urllib.urlencode function does not process correctly throws exceptions

2415641
width	font-size
though if you know the font size in pixels you can get a rough estimate of how many characters is visible by dividing the pixel width with the pixel font-size

2415641
width	height
beware that this may vary depending on the font s character height with ratio and that some browsers will return the width either including or excluding the scrollbar if present

2415692
doc	rtf
take a look at this article on code project it shows how to convert a doc to rtf using c# you should be able to adapt this to convert to text

2415742
integer	unsigned
they both say they are of type struct system.byte and represent an 8-digit unsigned integer

2415778
cldc	midp
this device has midp 2.0 and cldc 1.1 support also jsr75 which i need in order to save files

2415778
cldc	midp
one of them the defaultcldcjtwiphone2 from the java me sdk 3.0 also claims midp 2.0 and cldc 1.1 support

2415778
cldc	midp
when i look at the midp 2.0 jsr118 api i can clearly see all of these methods being present with the since tag being either midp 2.0 or cldc 1.1

2415824
google-chrome	safari
safari ie and google-chrome doesn t support the onclick event in the tag

2415850
bada	maemo
info about any mobile platforms symbian maemo win-mobile android bada etc is appreciated

2415852
innodb	myisam
iam using mysql database with myisam innodb

2415949
public	protected
should be public protected virtual

2416043
button	checkbox
except that when you mouse over the individual checkbox and button and various components they all fidget slightly

2416172
move	drag
when i drag to the right the item move underneath the other items

2416175
rss	feed
how would you create an rss feed in asp.net 3.5 using c#

2416175
rss	feed
what framework pieces would help in making the publishing of an rss or atom feed easier for the .net developer

2416184
src	attr
you have to make it a jquerby object to access attr src

2416214
width	height
another point which comes to my mind is that you create windows with dimension 0 - no width or height

2416233
pull	push
i have some ideas for reworking the internals of xml calabash to use more of the push pull streaming features of saxon but there are a lot of other things on my todo list too -

2416284
hide	show
i can t disable it completely because the user sometimes needs to access the start menu or may like to manually show or hide the sip

2416365
audiotrack	audiorecord
it uses audiorecord and audiotrack to record pcm audio from the mic and play pcm audio out the earpiece

2416365
audiotrack	audiorecord
so as you can see in the creation of the audiotrack and audiorecord the encoding is supplied via the audioformat but this only allows 16 bit or 8 bit pcm

2416365
audiotrack	audiorecord
i have my own g711 codec implementation now and i want to be able to encode the audio from the mic and decode it going into the earpiece so i have encode short lin int offset byte enc int frames and decode byte enc short lin int frames methods but i m unsure as to how to use them to encode and the decode the audio from the audiorecord and audiotrack

2416378
pop-up	dialog
getting the session key from the cookie after the facebook connect dialog pop-up and the user logs in

2416430
for-loop	loops
the for-loop was chaged to a while loops and the code brought inside the while

2416434
submit	submission
this was to avoid multiple submit for same requests - hence we used the common html submission approach of token generation where with every response carries with itself a new token and the client has to sent it back to the server for executing the next request

2416434
mouse	keyboard
in this case we disabled the session expiration on the server and wrote custom code to handle events - keyboard and mouse on the flex client

2416497
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
this code was adapted from here i didn t need the various doctypes identification as i m only dealing with images however the image type could be any number of things - jpg bmp gif png etc

2416504
post	get
in both get and post responses the content-type is application json

2416586
mouse	keyboard
the quizzes can be attempted using only the mouse so i need the keyboard to be completed disabled for the period of the quiz

2416594
width	height
use overflow hidden in combination with the desired width height

2416599
width	height
declare a width and height and then use the overflow property

2416680
pull	push
most of the time some push pull clone dance manage to solve it

2416715
ubuntu	linux
my language at the moment is java on gnu linux ubuntu so i know about the robot class

2416779
post	put	post	get	put	get
also you could try to use http put or something other than get or post because normal browsers don t do that

2416790
onmousedown	onfocus
i ve spent quite a while trying to resolve this issue and found a simple work-around for ie8 - just use onmousedown rather than onfocus

2416816
put	get
here s a function that i wrote to get the clip id s in a string input and put them into an array which you can the insert into your embedded object

2416870
rsa	dsa
then it was switching to different authentication mechanism at first it was trying dsa instead of rsa and then it was prompting for a password

2416875
int	chars
basically i do not want the user to enter 0 zero as the first chars in a textbox which represents data with type of int

2416881
tunnel	vpn
if you have no clue about security the simplest solution might be to set up a secure tunnel using a vpn or ssh and send your messages using that

2416893
getter	setter
finally unless your setter method has to do something special you should consider using synthesize to have your setter getter automatically generated

2416937
lxml	html5lib
the best modules for this task are lxml or html5lib

2416974
post	get
and get all blogcomments for each post that has a state of published

2417033
google-chrome	firefox
once the firefox plugin is installed google-chrome also plays the files correctly but i doubt that the average user would ever think to do this

2417051
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectmodel
sounds like you are creating two different core data stacks nsmanagedobjectcontext nsmanagedobjectmodel and nspersistentstorecoordinator

2417089
serializable	deserialization
you need a binary serializable to preserve objects identity during the serializable deserialization step

2417114
mp3	speex
i m also looking to encode the audio to mp3 before upload and have seen some references to speex

2417181
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
depending on implementation resize events can be sent continuously as the resizing is in progress the typical behavior in internet explorer and webkit-based browsers such as safari and google-chrome or only once at the end of the resize operation the typical behavior in firefox

2417210
opensuse	centos	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	opensuse
may be stick with the most popular ubuntu fedora opensuse slackware centos rhe

2417210
vmware	virtualbox
you can use virtualbox or vmware and freely available virtual machines to test other distros instead of having 5+ separate partitions

2417218
filtering	grouping
however just remember where filtering the entire pool of rows first grouping by combines those remaining rows and having filtering those grouping

2417218
filtering	grouping
having filtering grouping

2417357
int	double
and to answer your question - yes you can crate data types but they can t be primitive types like int double etc

2417399
postgresql	mysql
so it doesn t matter if i use the pdo driver once for mysql and once for postgresql it will still return the table structure

2417425
int	double
but point object s x and y values are int i need position in float or double

2417456
int	double
from int you should be able to cast to double or float without any problems

2417480
firefox	safari
for safari and firefox it works fine when the user clicks a link or refreshes the page

2417544
firefox	safari
when i run the app in debug mode my safari or firefox becomes irresponsive i can t even switch to them

2417559
sudo	passwd
you also need to allow apache to sudo without a passwd as you have no way of entering the passwd through php

2417563
hash	md5
i m creating my own rss reader and to see which rss items were already downloaded i m converting the links of each item to md5 hash

2417563
hash	md5	rss	feed
when an rss feed is loaded it adds all the items to a listview object and then checks the md5 hash against a text file and removes the ones that already exist

2417563
hash	md5
now this works right now because i have only 5 feeds and each feed only loads about 10 items but in terms of longterm use the textfile would become cluttered with very old md5 hash

2417563
hash	md5
i m wondering if an sqlite database would be better to do such a thing such as storing the feed link the md5 hash and the date

2417601
hash	md5
you could use a database for this or even a flat cache file in xml or something. you could then serialise de-serialise an array of your md5 hash dates etc remove any from the array you don t need any more then serialise the array back to your cache file again

2417609
rss	feed
why not use the updated field in the rss this way what you need to save is the latest fetch date a compare it to the feed updated date

2417628
post	get
you ll get a signal when the request completes which you should use to post an xwindows message and wake up your event processing loop

2417651
put	get
of course to get this to work you ll have to put in all the code for tabhosts to work

2417778
folder	directory
your routing probably works fine for the root directory of your site and content folder

2417833
superclass	subclassing
in addition all my classes subclassing a general superclass which implements among others the method help that calls doc class obj which allows me to bring up the help from every instance of the class

2417845
folder	directory
if you do not see your folder in that final list it is because there is no virtual directory pointing to the my documents folder that contains your web site and home page.

2417859
typedef	typename
typedef typename tb btype typeb

2417859
typedef	typename
typedef typename ta atype typea

2417905
folder	directory
i ve figured out that typing git clone git gist.github.com 285330.git gist-285330 will copy the latest files from the gist into the local directory gist-285330 as well as creating the .git folder with all the previous version information

2417947
post	get
the internal logic determines which collection to look at based on whether the request is a get or a post

2417947
post	get
post requests to get the desired

2417973
typedef	struct
i think that since you are typedef ing tb btype the compiler would need to know the type struct myb which it doesn t you only forward declared it

2417973
typedef	struct
you can check this in fact if you comment out the reference to ta atype in struct b you still get the same error while if you comment out the typedef typeb in struct a the compiler doesn t complain

2418009
post	get
the post page uses an api to get the result back from google

2418058
google-chrome	firefox
so far i ve tried this in both firefox and google-chrome with no success

2418086
width	height
i want the size of this new window to change depending on the height and width of the video that is being played

2418093
put	get
we give an empty set to it so that as a result we get a set with elements fillset has put in it

2418097
children	parent
setting anything to 100 makes it fit the parent container not the children

2418097
children	parent
i m pretty sure that the problem exists above your viewstack though in the parent children relationship not necessarily in the code order

2418101
post	get
but basically yeah have a page on your site that when it gets a post get variable it makes an http request to google containing at least your search term and your api key it then receives a load of xml in return which it then formats and returns on the page

2418114
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
i m having trouble getting jquery to load in ie7 works fine in all other browsers firefox safari opera ie8 just not in ie7

2418120
g++	gcc
short answer the error happens because you compile c++ code with the gcc driver instead of g++

2418126
min	max
similarly apply to things like min max avg etc

2418149
implements	sealed
let s say taskargument is abstract and task implements a method onentertask taskargument args and is sealed for some special behavior of the existing system which is out of scope

2418240
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
note i m only enquiring about firefox safari google-chrome in this sample

2418281
submit	submission
form submission requires post-back once you submit the first form your page is redirected to the action of that form and you will lose the information in the rest of the forms you have

2418338
kohana	yii
i am going to use kohana or yii still doing feasible test at the moment

2418342
firefox	safari
safari firefox etc internet explorer will render css differently from other browsers so you should be aware and test for this during development

2418353
width	height
how can i get the width and height of the body with javascript so that i can resize the window size dynamically based on the amount of contents of the page

2418379
gridview	rowdatabound
this table i later assign as datasource to a gridview and on rowdatabound i assign the value of each cell

2418451
migrate	downgrade
but with the microsoft data access technologies data set linq2sql entity framework i don t know a way to automate things like migrate or downgrade a database schema with data migration

2418512
invokerequired	begininvoke
for thread-safe updates back to the ui use the invokerequired and invoke begininvoke members on the winforms controls

2418557
post	get
if i m trying to post a message or check my bank balance or get movie ratings i don t want to be fiddling around with colors and fonts

2418583
matplotlib	scipy
i have installed numpy1.3 scipy 0.7.1 matplotlib 0.99.1.1 and python 2.5

2418619
integer	unsigned
10u 10u is explicitly an unsigned integer

2418624
sikuli	eggplant
however you may be able to try automation tools like citratest or eggplant or sikuli which are image-based rather than object-based

2418635
int	chars
int -123 chars c strings str etc

2418638
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the viewwillappear and viewdidappear methods give subclasses a chance to perform any additional actions related to the appearance of the view

2418687
min	max
min max and somewhere between min and max

2418687
min	max
and where appropriate two extremes below min and above max

2418687
min	max
there are obvious exceptions some code may not have a min or max for example but i ve found that unit testing for these events is a good start and captures a majority of common issues with the code

2418693
hide	show
this event handler then hide panel1 and show panel2

2418693
hide	show
in usercontrol1 there is button user clicks this which raises event in aspx page this is supposed to hide panel1 and show panel2

2418703
spaces	delimiter
the downside to the second is that all other whitespace characters spaces tabs etc between the string delimiter are part of the string which makes it awkward to keep your code looking neat

2418735
teamcity	luntbuild
if they don t pass the joel test they re clueless enough to not be able to micromanage you so you should have the flexibility to automate your build using teamcity or luntbuild if the re isn t any money in the contract for tools

2418746
int	double
in addition to the previous comments about suffixes and gcc c99 mode if you can t get long long to work and you only need int up to 2 52 you can get away with using double

2418746
int	double
int up to 2 52 should be exactly representable as double assuming an ieee double precision format 0 +1 bias exponent

2418750
touchesmoved	touchesended
but text should take the touchesmoved and sprite should take touchesended

2418795
soappy	suds	soaplib	suds	soaplib	soappy
after trying a few different librairies suds soaplib i finally dug into the soappy code

2418819
caliburn	prism
currently i read up a lot about silverlight prism and caliburn which seem to get me this functionality - at a price

2418832
post	get
the application has numerous controllers containing get and post request methods which are marked with requestmapping annotations like this

2418928
maven	pom.xml
maven has a nice utility to create eclipse project files and there s a plugin to manage the pom.xml file in eclipse

2418989
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
strictly speaking unchecked-exception will always extend runtimeexception whereas checked exceptions do not

2419016
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the unchecked-exception classes are the class runtimeexception and its subclasses and the class error and its subclasses

2419058
cpu	processors
these daysâ memory band-width and usage of the processors cache is as match of a problem is cpu time

2419066
maven	pom.xml
maven doesn t have any knowledge of things that are not declared in the pom.xml so yes you have to declare smartgwt in the pom.xml

2419066
maven	pom.xml
actually the common way to work with maven and ides is to add things in the pom.xml and to generate or derive things at the ide level from the pom.xml

2419088
apache	nginx
files and is readily available on most servers or reverse proxies apache s mod_deflate nginx s nginxhttpgzipmodule etc. and all modern browsers you can instruct both apache and nginx to skip compression for specific browsers based on user-agent .

2419105
cassini	iis
some pages require ssl is there a way to mimick ssl locally through cassini or iis 7

2419115
spoofing	traffic
spoofing of traffic is a serious problem for other google services such as adwords

2419152
width	height
you ve seen the official answer above but i would urge you to think more about why you would use width and height attributes in some instances and css in others

2419152
width	height
therefore you should normally use the width height attributes on images

2419155
ssl	https
whether that works for you or not depends on why you need ssl with stunnel your client webbrowser will think it s https but asp.net cassini won t

2419163
ubuntu	linux
just wondering if there is any benchmark software that i can download that will run on both windows preferable windows 7 and linux ubuntu 9.10

2419217
floating-point	integer
back then when we worried more about integer vs floating-point performance the dhrystone test was popular

2419232
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
catching an illegalargumentexception to rethrow another runtimeexception with a clearer message might look like a good idea but it is not

2419237
implements	extends
given that statusnet implements an api very similar to twitter i could probably modify extends twitterizer to do just that

2419243
calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
the latter actually is one of the reasons the calloc function exists on some platforms it can be implemented significantly more efficiently than a mere malloc followed by a memset to zero

2419274
g++	gcc
in that case it sounds like your gdb is out of date compared to your gcc g++ version

2419309
post	put
so far i understand this small code to post only one particular category one a page when put infront of the loop

2419339
hide	show
i have tried programmatically hiding one and showing the other with hide and show but the problem is that the hidden widget occupies space in my qgraphicslinearlayout even when it s hidden leaving an empty gap

2419339
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicswidget	qgraphicsscene	qwidget	qstackedwidget	qgraphicsscene	qstackedwidget	qgraphicswidget	qstackedwidget	qwidget
however i am working with a qgraphicsscene and so my widgets don t inherit from qwidget but rather qgraphicswidget so i can t add them to a qstackedwidget

2419393
getter	setter
it then has getter methods to expose these values but no setter methods. the stockmarketdata class is basically a holder for stock market data values

2419422
accessor	properties
the controlitems properties has internal set and public get accessor and is of type

2419422
accessor	properties
the thing is that i am getting build errors that say this is not possible because my controlitems properties does not have an accessable set accessor

2419445
move	drag
for instance having the widget move only in one axis or have the widget move double the distance between the cursor and the drag starting point

2419465
caliburn	prism
with silverlight and the frameworks that are available prism caliburn etc you can produce incredibly flexible and scalable uis so that gets a big thumbs up from me

2419475
rtl	vhdl
first the vhdl is analyzed in order to detect rtl templates consisting in rtl elements flip-flops arithmetic expressions multiplexers control logic

2419485
debian	centos	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian
you can also provide distribution specific installers like a rpm on redhat or centos or deb for debian ubuntu although once you have the makefile spitted by autotools making these is a breeze

2419549
width	height
but only to fit the image to the width and height of the browserâ s viewport since you cannot size a background image yet

2419549
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	webkit	gecko
css 3 specifies a background-size property but its support is still proprietary using the vendor specific prefix like -khtml- konqueror -moz- gecko based browsers like firefox -o- opera and -webkit- webkit based browsers like safari

2419588
post	get
sorry if there is way too much info in this post â thereâ s a load of story before i get to the actual problem

2419592
draggable	droppable
i want to call a function only when the draggable div is dropped perfectly onto a droppable div

2419663
getter	setter
under source menu generate getter and setter

2419675
touchesbegan	touchesended
i have it doing a nslog on touchesbegan and touchesended and it s doing both correctly

2419675
touchesbegan	touchesended
i m worried touchesbegan and touchesended cannot cause a scroll

2419712
hide	show
then you your user click the edit button you hide your textbox and show your combobox with its visible property set to true

subtract	add
in fact with the above gltranslate changed to add a single integer to a global variable and when leaving subtract it again and the below defined gltranslatee i did a test

2419738
firefox	safari
edit this is what my code looks like this works fine in ie8 firefox and safari but in ie7 uploadify doesn t show the image that replaces the file upload input dom element

2419769
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
try in different kinds of browsers to exclude the one and other ie6 7 8 firefox safari google-chrome etc

2419771
min	max
diving into the bowels of the container code via reflector it was setting the min max size values for my control that was being reparented

2419771
min	max
i had assumed inaccurately that the default min max settings were left as the default from the designer

2419794
hash	md5
you could use a md5 hash on both files and compare them that way

2419835
subtract	add
if you want to be really clever you can start looking at what level of braces you re in and make sure it s a top level one go to the start of the file add 1 every time you see and subtract one every time you see etc

2419873
width	height
are you giving the image a size height width

2419875
disk	ram
if you are running code on a standard machine with hard disk drive hdd and your program resides on the hdd then the time to copy the data from data section of your binary image to ram is essentially the same amount of time as using some type of run-time initialization

2419880
public	protected
one of the rulesets i believe from stylecop enforces putting public functions first then protected static then protected then private static and finally private

2419880
public	protected
what is stylecop s reasoning for wanting the public protected private ordering

2419909
folder	directory
there you have the field additional python import directory where you can add the django folder actually the folder that contains the django folder

2419913
listview	gridview
the error is because the gridview is being applied to more than one listview

2419915
prepare	execute
information 0x40043006 at import data to table01 dts.pipeline prepare for execute phase is beginning

2419935
public	protected
by visibility public methods internal methods protected methods ...

2420043
memcpy	memmove
i am making a simple byte buffer that stores its data in a char array acquired with new and i was just wondering if the memcpy and memmove functions would give me anything weird if used on memory acquired with new or is there anything you would recommend doing instead

2420072
memcpy	memmove
using memcpy memmove should work fine on that kind of data

2420079
firefox	safari
it worked in safari but not in firefox this cuts out too many customers for the website i m designing for

2420079
firefox	safari
it does work in safari - just not in firefox or camino

2420080
pygobject	gio
you will need to use gio via pygobject in order to retrieve the file

2420097
memcpy	malloc
as soon as you have a valid variable in your hand allocated by new malloc or on the stack it is just a pointer to memory hence memcpy and other functions from this family will work as expected

2420111
client-side	server-side
first of all you have to decide if you need both client-side and server-side functionality for your control

2420111
client-side	server-side
they will allow you to create a custom server-side control and extend that control to include some client-side functionality

2420111
onmouseover	onclick
first of all avoid binding events from inside scripts use onclick onmouseover etc

2420154
super	implements
i think it s super lame to implements two command handlers and it certainly won t scale well if you have to add more email sources

2420168
cifs	smb
terms to google for are python smb cifs

2420190
put	get
i appreciate the technical side of reformatting but i am pointing out that there is risk involved in anything non-trivial and unless you put the right person on it it might get mucked up

2420218
hash	md5
take a hash md5 should be good enough of the build before and after the reformatting - if it s the same for every file that clearly means it can t have altered behaviour

2420225
spaces	linefeed
since compiling would ignore the spaces tabs linefeed etc. then the compiled version should be identical to the original and that would prove to those semi-technical managers that all is well

2420248
getter	setter
it seems that part of the problem is that an rdbms resolves what object you are referring to based on a simple case insensitive string-based name in a language like java typing is more complicated than this you cannot refer to a property if the getter setter field are not a member of the class loaded at runtime so you essentially need to have 2 versions of your code in the same script hmm custom classloaders sound like a pain have the new version of your class stored belong to another package sounds messy or use the version x+1 x+2 strategy i mentioned requires a lot more planning

2420252
memcpy	memmove
i would still use vector with std copy but that doesn t mean new memcpy memmove is bad

2420272
button	checkbox
how can i change a checkbox for a radio button using jquery

2420303
post	get
while i m not sure this is a proper question for stackoverflow i ll post a couple links to get you started towards solving the problem

2420319
width	height
i also tried replacing the rendertransform with just scaling the image by itself using the height and width properties but it made no difference

2420337
implements	extends
if you absolutely need to use a hashmap then i would create a class that extends hashmap and implements comparable

2420366
mouseup	mousedown
as an aside if you were simulating a double click you would need to set the click state to 2 for both the mousedown and mouseup events of the second click.

2420377
getdate	dateadd
the number of weeks generated can be changed by altering only one digit the 3 in select dateadd week -3 getdate as starting_date

2420402
hide	show
and use the show hide methods.

2420477
post	get
once i get around to reinstalling i will post the result back here

2420488
width	height
you should use the width and height of the view not the canvas both available via getwidth and getheight

2420494
rss	feed
i created an iphone app that gets rss feed from my youtube channel my blog and my twitter

2420550
post	put
it seems like the jquery is aborted midway as any alerts i put in the post or ajax callback functions are being ignored

2420551
int	chars
that is int chars varchar decimal etc

2420601
mouse	keyboard
create the xna objects related to keyboard mouse gamepads in the main

2420632
put	get
actioncontroller methodnotallowed only get put and delete requests are allowed

2420642
nsmutablestring	nsstring
is anyone aware of a category on nsstring or nsmutablestring that allows for templating

2420653
portrait	landscape
for handsets with qwerty and touch screens the qwerty keyboard is exposed when it is slid out and the screen changes to landscape mode from portrait

2420653
width	height
so you can detect the sizechanged width height call detect that handset went into landscape mode and then handle it

2420653
portrait	landscape
handle portrait landscape changes

2420694
operands	decrement
even more important since it results in undefined behavior not just unspecified behavior is that you generally can t use an operands to the increment decrement operators more than once in an expression

2420716
vim	emacs
alternatively if you use the vim or emacs xemacs editors they have cscope support built-in

2420716
vim	emacs
i m not familiar with how the emacs integration works but in vim it works pretty much like a regular tag-stack in that you can jump to symbol and then pop back to a previous symbol

2420739
post	get
this will force it to do a post back and will get your second panel to show up

2420779
post	get
as mentioned previously out of the box there is only support for get and post

2420779
put	get
at first glance it appears that you can use the proxy config in livecycle data services or blaze to get support for put and delete

2420796
mouseup	mousedown
one thing you should also do is set the click count properly on both the mousedown and mouseup events like so

2420820
put	get
either you can live with slightly off colors affected by the nearly transparent invisible layer or upon getting a click you must remove the layer get the correct pixel color and put again a nearly transparent layer

2420835
cvs	svn
the most senior developer here reformatted all the code base when he migrated it from cvs to svn and he had to perform some tests to make sure it would work all the way from start to end and now we have hooks to ensure that checked-in code is properly formatted

2420864
children	parent
in this case i don t add the child to the parent s children collection i just set the parent on the child object

2420864
children	parent
is there any way to get nhibernate to persist this correctly so that when i grab the parent out of the database it will have the child inside its children collection

2420868
subtraction	multiplication
there are various methods - i would suggest newton-raphson which is simple and fast and uses only multiplication and subtraction

2420868
subtract	add	division	multiplication	division	subtract
if multiplication is not allowed then there also seem to be plenty of integer division algorithms which just use shifts bitwise operations and add subtract first hit on google www.bearcave.com software divide.htm

2420896
inherited	properties
the system.web.mvc.viewpage class is the class that your default asp.net mvc views inherited from so you have access to the html properties in your views

2420902
cck	pathauto
i have done some reading on drupal custom content types and cck views and pathauto

2420902
put	get
however i have not been able to get a clear picture of how to put it all together to accomplish what i am attempting

2420967
google-chrome	firefox
i have this html5 code with a mp4 for google-chrome working an ogg for firefox failing and the same ogg via a java applet for internet explorer working

2420992
filtering	grouping
all i had to do was to specify an appender per application grouping and inside each appender i would have a filtering chain

2421015
post	get
i suggest that you post your code here to get some more helpful responses

2421045
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the easiest way is to force the user to install the internet explorer version of flash note installing in firefox google-chrome or safari will not work as they do not use the ocx version of flash

2421056
opera	firefox
my site displays just like in need in ie and opera but in firefox i can t get via css to have font sizes smaller than firefox default minimum-font-size

2421066
hide	show
the jqtouch demo helpfully show how to show an install this message for users not using full screen mode and hide it for those who are

2421066
put	get
and yet i can t find any other trace of it when i put this alert to test things after the document has loaded i get nothing when launching in fullscreen mode

2421067
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie firefox safari desktop versions win mac google-chrome opera

2421144
children	parent
you don t have to add the child to the parent s children collection to get nh to persist it because it s marked as the inverse side of the relationship

2421144
children	parent
if you set the parent on the child flush the session and re-load the parent in a new session then the children collection should contain the child assuming 2nd level cache doesn t come into play

2421165
realloc	malloc
and it returns a std string so you would have to use malloc realloc to handle that

2421218
firefox	safari
in the browsers i ve tried firefox 3.5.8 and safari 4.0.4 no object has a checkvalidity method so i can t run the validations even though i can define them

2421246
min	max
the validation of numbers even takes into account the min and max attributes so opera will not let you submit the form if you enter a number that is too large

2421286
firefox	safari
for some reason i cant access the function in safari or firefox

2421296
post	get
what i am trying to is when another service call post to a get with say 5 parameters

2421316
folder	directory
several top level directory are gone and their content folder and files just spread out in the list

2421318
width	height
the buttons view should have a fixed height but stretch width wise

2421318
width	height
buttonview resizes width but not height and is locked top left

2421375
n-gram	words
second the reason i got into the n-gram approach is that i don t want to limit the words count n to a specific length

2421375
minimum	max
the only problem with this example is that you have to specify the minimum word pattern length and i want it to be dynamic from 2 to max found

2421402
filesystems	fat
and fat is a simple enough filesystems that you can crawl through it with nothing but a hex editor and some patience

2421413
profiling	instrumentation
profiling your app with instrumentation and use the core animation instrumentation

2421420
try-catch	exception-handling
i d encourage you to expand upon this by implementing a try-catch and handling exception-handling

2421422
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine for me in ie firefox and google-chrome

2421441
aggregate-functions	sum
this is because when we group by two columns it is saying group them so that all of those with the same subject and semester are in the same group and then calculate all the aggregate-functions count sum average etc. for each of those groups

2421453
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	heapsort
you do not implement your own sorting algorithm if quicksort mergesort and heapsort is available

2421457
post	get
maxpostsize defines how big a post can get before tomcat will automatically parse it whatever that means

2421473
firefox	safari
this works in firefox i can t vouch for safari

2421504
width	height
sandy www.myspace.com sandy -- should be the url webpage in specified height and width

2421504
width	height
mandy www.myspace.com mandy -- should be the url webpage in specified height and width

2421558
folder	directory
if you don t specify the folder explicitly the system will look in the current working directory for the process

2421562
width	height
either the width height got messed up as you encountered or transparency didn t work well or the floats got mad or there were browser inconstenties or they shipped with gifs or the documentation support was poor

2421590
public	protected
... if a class is declared to be a base class for another class using the private access specifier the public and protected members of the base class are accessible as private members of the derived class

pop-up	dialog
if user presses the button a js dialog box will pop-up asking user to confirm the deletion

2421618
int	boolean
type one of string int hexcolor boolean

2421690
maven	pom.xml	jar	war
i ve been using the same approach as jens on a number of projects both with maven 2.2.1 and now with maven 3.0-alpha-6 pom.xml modules define the module structure of your project tree jar war modules are the leaves of the tree

2421693
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
in this case argumentnullexception is thrown because an argument is null and argumentexception is thrown because the contents of the enumeration are not directly a parameter of the function so what you can say is that the argument is invalid but it is not because it i null or is out of range

2421777
maven	m2e
m2e does not run any maven goals

2421784
children	parent
say there s an animal type as parent and cat dog and bird as children

2421838

but later it discovers that it is actually a void prn double int

2421851
mouseup	mousedown
the display is safe to move to mouseup instead of mousedown

2421909
opera	google-chrome
here s a link to a sandbox where you can see opera and google-chrome in action

2421941
onresume	onpause
the best solution i can think of is to flip a boolean on off whenever onresume or onpause is called in all my activities but this seems like a lot of footwork

2421954
width	height
width and height meet minimum thresholds

2421980
post	get
i wrote something similar a while ago to get images from scraped blog post

2422021
int	chars
the int chars for r is 10

2422022
move	drag
in the iphone or android if you have a jquery slider it doesn t quite work touchscreen will move the screen instead of drag the slider.

2422059
qstackedwidget	qgraphicswidget
with a little work you could even make it generic enough to be used as a qgraphicswidget version of qstackedwidget

2422086
int	chars
also you want c to be of type int not chars

2422088
scrollable	panels
appending multiple grids to a single scrollable panels is the right way to do it unless you want to break them off into individual tabs

2422159
opera	firefox
ie8 firefox opera

google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari

2422160

i went through the debugger and searchicon is showing the width and height to be -1

2422168
pull	push
i currently have a pull mechanism where every one minute or so clients query one row in db to understand if cache is still good if changed they sync everything but i want to change this mechanism to push based

2422180
debian	centos	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian
for instance it will know to use apt-get install libncurses5-dev if using debian ubuntu yum install libncurses-devel if using rhel fedora centos

2422180
bash	zsh
work on any shell bash dash zsh pdksh busybox ash etc

2422199
onresume	onpause
so register a callback supplied by the activity with the service in onresume and unregister it in onpause

2422199
onresume	onpause
you could accomplish the same thing with a broadcast intent register unregister the receiver in the activity in onresume onpause if you wanted

2422291
rar	zip
archive 7z rar zip etc

2422291
wav	flac	wav	ogg	flac	ogg
sound most such as m4a flac ogg but not wav

2422304
fflush	gets
however if if the order was modified before the second query is executed the order will get fflush assuming auto-flush mode and read-write transaction right before the second query gets executed and this will trigger a staleobjectstateexception

2422309
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox you can use css

2422339
nunit	mstest
roy osherove just wrote a recent blog post summarizing the differences between nunit and mstest

2422339
nunit	mstest
he concludes that nunit wins for unit testing but mstest has much better abilities for integration based testing and team testing with team system

2422353
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
if your list implements the inotifycollectionchanged interface see observablecollection msdn or the objects implement inotifypropertychanged see inotifypropertychanged msdn and you are binding the points to the view then it should sort itself out as long as the binding is correct of course

2422388
width	height
the goal is to have a canvas with a grid child and takes up 100 width and height

2422398
width	height
it s much more similar to the way windows forms worked in that all elements must have a top left width and height specified

2422401
nunit	mstest
see msbuild nant nunit mstest and frustration

2422410
nunit	mstest
i have used both nunit and mstest

2422410
nunit	mstest
for example nunit offers more assert methods than mstest

2422419
mouse	keyboard
is it possible to disable full keyboard and mouse when i run my c program in window os

2422429
prefuse	flare
richard inglis has already mentioned prefuse flare which provides some nice flash based layouts

2422455
hide	show
but there is either a flag to say hide the window or or a flag you don t set to not show it or use an alternative function which does the same thing but launches the process a different way

2422511
crypt	salt
call the crypt function with the input and salt

2422537
freebsd	linux
linux s epoll freebsd s kqueue which you may need to look into if you find you are having latency problems

2422625
clang	llvm
would be interested in hearing from others who are using clang without llvm

2422628
google-chrome	safari
however above code works just fine in ie 8 google-chrome and safari

2422628
opera	firefox
on localhost all of the above browsers work as expected including firefox and opera -- they all receive got ajax request

2422686
pop-up	dialog
it sounds like you want a non-intrusive pop-up dialog but for it just to overlay the main page and not show up in a separate browser window

2422691
for-loop	loops
similarly if you start with a for-each loops and later realized that you need to switch to the indexed for-loop make sure that you re preserving the semantics because it s not guaranteed

2422801
for-loop	arrays
if i copy the code for-loop that prints out the values to the sub-menu nothing is printed presumably because it can t access the original arrays and has made a new blank one

2422878
super	implements
especially if i want to implements my entities not only as a corresponding employee entity class but rather multiple classes such as manager assistant manager engineer etc each inheriting from employee super entity class some entity having attributes that don t actually apply to all for example manager gets perks others don t the corresponding table column would accept null of course

2423010
put	get
whenever you treat a as just a list you won t get compiler checks to make sure you don t put a bla into your list

2423026
innodb	myisam
so no need to change the myisam to innodb if you don t need you can just change the collation

2423028
for-loop	arrays
yes in the first example the for-loop is acting as a topicalizer setting which is the default argument to many perl functions over the elements in the arrays

2423030
width	height
ie what i rotate a bitmap of width 100 height 200 my end result will be a bigger image but the rotated portion will still have an area of 100 200

2423120
switching	screens
how do i switching between the two screens on the qt

here s a sample of one item from the the actual rss feed i m using the description is longer and has status size and a couple of other fields but they re all formatted the same.

2423241
uiview	subviews
on click of button ui which is on uiview uiworkareaview_g_obj it has to create one more button button on uiview uiworkareaview_g_obj.and after placing the button each of there subviews i m placing those subviews upon a common mainview_g_obj of type uiview

2423286
udp	tcp
udp and tcp

2423335
button	checkbox
after button click add new row i do it and replace previous row html elements input type text textarea select input type text input type checkbox must be safe with its own values

2423366
ferret	sphinx
i ve looked into sphinx xapian ferret and acts_as_searchable but none of them offers advanced arabic search functionality to the best of my knowledge

2423426
put	get
you get this note that i put all classes as static nested classes into main

2423428
button	checkbox
with lots of button checkbox

2423488
pop-up	dialog
make one jframe class call it mainframe for example and from here open jpanels that way you have a centralized place to commuincate data between different frames pop-up options dialog ...etc

2423489
public	protected
all public and protected methods and properties from the parent class but not of a specific instance will be available in b and you can access them via the keyword of the b instance

if your host does not respond to arp requests it can never correctly receive tcp or udp packets

2423586
selecteditem	selectedindex
there is always selecteditem to get it not selectedindex .

2423600
gif	png
some things are better with jpg some with png or gif

2423601
uiview	subviews	fadein	hide
another idea using wants fullscreen layout is to hide the status bar with uiapplication sharedapplication setstatusbarhidden yes animated no and add an uiview as a subviews to the controller s view and animate that fadein fade-out at regular intervals

2423616
nsstring	nsdata
but it is the mystring nsstring data type not the data nsdata data type that equals the right value

2423624
hide	show
so i d generally prefer to have a table with all the rows you re ever going to show perhaps with class attributes to classify them and a jquery plugin to show hide selections of rows based on the context

2423639
nsstring	nsdata
how do i convert a nsstring value to nsdata

2423676
google-chrome	firefox
the thing is this works great in firefox and google-chrome

2423676
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome it works great

2423690
printf	feof	printf	fgets	fgets	feof
is more useful when you work with text files and user input output because it allows you to use api functions like printf sscanf fgets feof etc

2423699
doc	rtf
for anyone interested here is an article that ll help you get started it will convert rtf doc docx files to pdf

2423765
ienumerable	iqueryable

2423797
emacs	jedit
try jedit epsilon emacs vi...

2423847
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you can add the access rules to the apache config file httpd.conf or similar in a directory or location tag instead of adding it in the .htaccess

2423869
children	parent
i seem to remember a nice tool where i could drag its pointer over the gui of my running application and get lots of info about what was pointed at - handle size text parent children etc

2423918
createfile	deviceiocontrol
unfortunately there is a slight asymmetry in the mapping unmapping services since the mapping service is done via deviceiocontrol so it taked the handle obtained at createfile time but the mapped area is not directly connected to the device handle anymore

2424015
maven-assembly-plugin	maven-jar-plugin
3 - into the every client project that use the library ex my-pda-app add some specialized maven plugins to trim - out when generating the final artifact package the un-needed classes ex maven-assembly-plugin maven-jar-plugin proguard-maven-plugin

2424031
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you actually have several view controllers running at the same time each with its own view on screen at once -- your root view controller will be an instance or subclass of uitabbarcontroller which then has several nested uinavigationcontroller each which will display nested view controllers like an instance or a subclass of uitableviewcontroller

2424060
selecteditem	selectedindex
upon selectedindexchanged event you can get selecteditem selectedindex selectedvalue

2424118
hudson	bamboo
as a side issue i m also wondering how to achieve this in a ci hudson bamboo to generate and deploy these generated artifacts for all the environments to their proper servers ex using scp hudson plugin

2424131

2425925

2425977
min	max

we have a very comfortable setup using jpa through spring hibernate where we attach a persistenceunitpostprocessor to our entitymanager factory and this post processor takes a list of project names scans the classpath for jars that contain that name and adds those jar files for scanning for entities to the persistence unit this is much more convenient than specifying in persistence.xml since it can take partial names and we added facilities for detecting the different classpath configurations when we are running in a war a unit test an ear etc

it seems that implementation of fileinputstream from sun used to throw ioexception instead which is now also documented in javadoc

2427981
kohana	yii
i took that very seriously and had a close look at alternatives mainly yii and kohana

2427981
kohana	yii
for future projects in which i want to make use of the actual mvc features and totally submit to a framework s conventions on application building naming style and procedures though i may not necessarily be going for zend but for a more minimalistic framework like yii or kohana

2428007
ant	maven
you may want to take a look at teamprise build extensions which allows building ant or maven tasks from tfs

2428065
post	get
the best practice if generating one tiny form per delete link in on server is impractical is to use a get link to load up a confirmation page from the server which has a post form that performs the delete

2428065
post	get
if the server gets a get to controller delete x then serve up a confirmation page with a post form

2428066

folder	directory
this is my first stackoverflow question i m learning vb and having a few problems with getting a list of all folder directory on the system

2428188
ienumerable	iqueryable
asenumerable transforms the previously uses iqueryable into an ienumerable thus stopping the generation of the sql in case of linq to sql or any other transfromation by the provider implementing the specific iqueryable linq to sql provider

2428203
nsexpression	nspredicate
solving simple linear equations with nspredicate and nsexpression is a breeze but to go from there to solving arbitrary collections of constraints aka linear programming is still a big step

2428208
move	drag
i think you should ask yourself a question do you have some draggable elements i want to drag to specific targets for example you have widgets that represent pieces of different shapes that should be dragged on other widgets representing holes and each hole accepts only pieces of the same shape or do you just want to move one widget over the other widget

2428218
rss	feed
i m interested in password protecting my apps rss feed

2428218
rss	feed
so when you load a rss feed url in the browser the browser s default dialog asks for a login and password

2428248

this is why wordpress mediawiki phpbb phpmyadmin and every application i ve ever written has the user manually specify a base url as part of the application configuration

2428292
disk	ram
i know what version of the framework is going to be installed how much ram hard disk space etc

2428301

no matter where i call self mycustommethod initwithnibname viewdidload viewwillload viewwillappear viewdidappear the custom method is getting called twice - what s the deal

2428355
getter	setter
why do we make for example in java instance variables private and then use public getter and setter methods to access them

2428355
getter	setter
you still get to the instance variable but why use setter and getter methods when you can just make your variables public

2428357
pull	push
more of a push into the icommand object than a pull

2428363
children	parent
many tree algorithms require that each node have links to its children and its parent

2428386
tinyint	boolean
philip kelley ray and i think artic have all suggested modifying the comment table by adding an entity_id which can refer to either the book_id or the author_id and a flag of some sort char 1 tinyint and boolean respectively that indicates which of these is being referred to

2428394
getter	setter
the difference is that with getter and setter you control how instance fields are accessed

2428405
getter	setter
another point is encapsulation - if you choose to change the way this variable is handled to always return store a copy you can do it in one place the getter setter without breaking anything

2428455
getter	setter
a very important point that is often overlooked you don t have to provide a getter and a setter for every field

2428455
getter	setter
having classes that consist of nothing but private properties and public getter and setter is just as bad a design as using public fields

2428455
getter	setter
the point is that getter and setter allow you to add behaviour and logic to the model beyond the simple holding of data - and in many cases that means not having a getter or a setter or both

2428463
post	get
i am testing out webhooks and i created a postbin test url and i am trying to create a webservice that would listen to the postbin url and be able to get the values out of the post but i am not sure how to do this my sample postbin url could be

2428471
put	get
you could of course put the grade info in the student object but ultimately there really isn t much you can do to get rid of that extra class

2428485
getter	setter
in the first place not all data members should have getter and setter and i imagine you can see the virtue of keeping those variables private

2428485
getter	setter
if there s getter and setter you may be able to compensate for that so that setting a value can do something more or less complicated in the internals to get the same effect as it previously had

2428489
boost	allocator
add an allocator to my class definition have and proceed similarly to the vector example given in boost

2428565
strtol	strtok
use strtok to break the string into individual tokens then convert each token to an integer value using strtol

2428565
int	chars
if that chars is anything other than whitespace or 0 then the string was not a valid int and we can reject it before assigning it to our target array

2428623
youtube	vimeo
i want a php code to turn a youtube dailymotion vimeo metacafe.

2428632

i m working in eclipse and find myself always replacing multiple copies of the same word but i always have to take my hands off the keyboard and screen to get the mouse hover over the word double click to select and then copy or rewrite the word

2428634
int	boolean
notions of type safety and distinguishing boolean from int did not seem important until much later -

2428695
put	get
i m trying to use subwcrev to get the current revision number of our svn repository and put it in a file so i can show it in the ui

2428697
strtol	atoi
i would recommend strtol which provides better error handling than atoi or sscanf

2428733
mri	rubinius
unfortunately many popular ruby implementations are not capable of running multiple threads at the same time including mri yarv and rubinius

2428765
16-bit	64bit
why not 16-bit or 64bit

2428773
for-loop	arrays
my solution was to create a for-loop that ran that code and then check answer to see if it was an arrays using php method is_array and executing the method call again if it wasn t

2428803
charindex	substr
use substr but you ll have to use either charindex or patindex to get the location of the character you want the substr to stop at

i have a tableview with custom tablecellviews that has uilabel and uibutton on it

2428995
pull	push
in this context start by identifying your concurrent development effort and decide on a publication push pull process

2429014
std	ostream
to actually write objects binary use std ostream write

2429059
width	height
i didn t expect this to work because the this reference inside the area function should be pointing to the area function itself so i wouldn t have access to width and height from this

2429077
put	get
when i click the run button i get a popup that tells warns me what s going to happen...it s going to put a row into a new table

2429077

if you try to put multiple statements in and run them you ll get that error

2429080
mouse	keyboard
i m not sure how citrix vm vs mikogo vs ultravnc work with displaying information but i ve always guessed it s a combination of sending mouse and keyboard instructions and then refreshing the image to show what the display of the desktop is

2429166
for-loop	loops
you can loops through the items with a for-loop like this

2429213
min	max
i can give you an hint in how to obtain max and min values

2429228
int	chars	int	double
is there a way to turn a chars into a string or a string with one letter into a chars like how you can turn an int into a double and a double into an int

2429265
put	get
if you want it to be a type then get rid of the element declaration in your address schema and put in instead

2429283
put	get
trying to put optional parameters in uri segments and things start to get weird

2429294
folder	directory
i m using dir.mktmpdir as the default scratch directory which gives a really ugly path for example var folder zz zzzivhrrnamviuee+++1ve+++yo -tmp- d20100311-70034-abz5zj

2429339
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i know that webkit safari google-chrome supports them but firefox at least 3.5 does not

2429344
min	max
so set your label for datapoint0 to 10 max value and for datapoint1 set the label to 5 min value

2429344
range	max	range	min	min	max
this will then look just like one range bar with the min value on the left and the max value on the right

2429350
getter	setter
you can inject ejb s in a jsf model and delegate it in action methods and maybe also getter setter but you should not do the other way round do not define the jsf model in an ejb this leads to tight coupling and would make ejb s unuseable outside the jsf context

2429355
inherited	properties
getattr does a lot more than a lookup in the object s __dict__ it supports properties and other descriptors attributes inherited from the class and its bases such as methods attributes that may be dynamically generated via a __getattr__ method in the object s class or again one of its bases

2429400
google-chrome	firefox
the error definitely doesn t occur in google-chrome 4 ie 8 or firefox 3.5

put	get
i get compile errors if i put anywhere in my xaml

2429475

folder	directory
i opened the project properties and added the path to the zlib-vc zlib include folder to the list of additional include directory and tried to build again

2429566
jar	war
if you mean you have a shared project that turns into a jar or war or dll or assembly that several projects use you can check in the artifact and have other projects simply check it out like any other 3rd party jar

2429581
int	boolean
types narrower than int are widened to int in expressions anyway - so the boolean operators would still work on int operands

2429591
inherited	properties
combine the common settings with the specific settings using properties inherited to manage the configurations - the properties manager tab allows you to do this

2429602
vb.net	vb6	vbscript	vb6	fortran	ada

2429661
post	get
what their ajax is doing is making a get post request to another web page and dynamically loading the results

2429682
octal	decimal
the 013 is in octal so treated as a decimal you get 11

2429684
vsto	add-in
wrote a vsto add-in for excel that draws a grid dynamically

2429684
width	height
so basically i have no way of telling what my new width and height are

2429687
min	max
edit group by loses all except the first unique value so replacing min with max will not work

2429689
octal	decimal
13 octal is 11 decimal

2429695
octal	decimal
it s string concatenation of decimal 17 and octal 13 equivalent to decimal 11

2429698
octal	decimal
i would just add to reed s explanation that 013 is interpreted as octal 13 which is decimal 11

2429703
min	max
substitute max for min

2429715
post	get
if you have problems with this part please post here and when i get some time i will update my answer with that functionality

2429729
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie8

2429764
subtract	add
yes it is important to get the sign correct when using esp in this case subtract but also sometimes you need to add when referencing something already on the stack like arguments inside a function

2429803
google-chrome	firefox
i ve also tested it in the latest versions of firefox 3.6 and google-chrome whose version escapes me

2429817
setinterval	clearinterval
you can use setinterval to begin triggering the event at regular intervals on hover and use clearinterval to stop it when the user stops hovering

2429838
width	margin
as noted by the op it seems to make more sense to have a pre-defined width from which margin padding and border-width are subtracted than to have a width to which these are then added

2429855
post	put
to me an external url would be page on that isn t part of my domain ie i own www.example.com and put a form that post to www.spamfoo.com

2429872
hash	salt
after user is added unverified combine email with a salt a secret and create the sha1 hash of the email salt combo

2429904
min	max
it s possible to establish a min max character count

2429930
int	double
the method abs int in the type math is not applicable for the arguments double

2429952
stdout	stderr
a process run as part of a command substitution can write to stderr to provide output to the user while the stdout output is captured by the command substitution

2429952
stdout	stderr
where the sandbox command sends most of its output to stderr and just the final â directory to chdir toâ to stdout

2430029
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
because google-chrome and firefox and ie and safari all behave slightly differently with the same javascript code web developers have to spend a great deal of time testing their code on the various browsers detecting which one you re using and adapting the code to the slightly different sets of libraries bugs etc

2430031
salt	md5
generate the token as a checksum md5 crc whatever over the user id the image id and maybe the current day of the year and be sure to mix in an unguessable salt

2430039
int	double
if i wanted to use the same specialization for all builtin numeric types int float double etc. i would write those lines many times

2430084
int	double
is there a straightforward way of determining the number of decimal places in a n int double value in php

2430126
apache	nginx	postgresql	mysql
i have developed 3 simple blogging system in php apache mysql python nginx postgresql and in erlang yaws mnesia

i would suggest coming up to speed on opencv emgucv s the .net port i use

2430174
gridview	detailsview	gridview	formview	formview	detailsview
bind method is only for the gridview detailsview and the formview control

2430207
width	font-size
you can then check if the width of the text is greater than 800px and reduce the font-size until the width is less than or equal to

2430207
width	font-size
you can also check if the width is too short maybe less than 200px and increase the font-size accordingly

2430207
width	font-size
that is repeatedly reduce the font-size by 5 until the total width is less than or equal to 800px

2430347
post	get
i can post more specifics when i get home and have access to said books

2430374

2430377
weka	orange
to name a few weka rapidminer knime orange

2430467
versioning	upgrade
svn will automatically upgrade a working copy when it needs one and if a different client is using an older versioning it may no longer have access

2430501
for-loop	loops
i know it s more pythonic to use a for-loop for iterators but i wanted to implement a while loops within a generator that s called by a for-loop.

2430507
post	get
edit if this isn t exactly what you re looking for you might want to tag this post with javascript to get more people who know about js form validation to answer the question

2430520
nsurlcache	nsurlconnection
nsurlconnection has support for caching in the style of nsurlcache and it does a lot of work for you behind the scenes

2430528
post	get
another option is using ajax to pass as get post directly.

2430540
put	get
then test style.background attribute on url string and if it matches then get path between url and and put it into array

2430574
width	height
so if in your editable area you can add a fullcontainer rule which you should be able to if you re editing the css file at all you very likely could redefine that div to get rid of the width and height declarations width auto and height auto should do and similarly reset or override other things overflow hidden if necessary

2430575
lxml	beautifulsoup
lxml also has more features and offers beautifulsoup too

2430589
inherited	properties
that will make that your objy inherited also the properties added to the objx.prototype and as you see i changed the objy.prototype.constructor since the assignment in the line above will make this properties to wrongly point to objx

2430695
libxml2	libxslt	exslt	libxslt
it uses libxml2 and libxslt to handle xpath xslt and exslt

2430716
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
like a checkbox button or dropdownlistfor or all the above

2430720
profiling	instrumentation
i assume you understand how profiling works the profiling will do some instrumentation and attach an agent to the jvm all this affects performance

2430762
hide	show
it sounds like you re looking for a static setup but likely you will show hide windows depending on what you re debugging and size them to different situations

2430785
int	chars
for each int you read ada.integer_text_io.get uses the default width of zero so it skips any leading blanks line terminators or page terminators then reads a plus sign if present or for a signed type only a minus sign if present then reads the longest possible sequence of chars matching the syntax of a numeric literal without a point. a subsequent ada.text_io.new_line leaves the line terminator there for ada.text_io.get_line to trip over and zero is not within namerange

2430786
portrait	landscape
i need to rotate my device to portrait and then rotate to landscape

2430816
scatter	graphing
based on my experience with zedgraph i could not set both of x and y axes scale same to have a correct scatter graphing

2430842
ant	maven
these can also run with ant maven as part of the build

2430844
put	get
as you can see the more higher we get the more demanding it becomes and the more pressure it put on how things can be presented in the web page

2430912
folder	directory
however when i deploy it to a virtual directory in iis it looks for the fckeditor files javascript stylesheets etc... in the fckeditor folder not in the myvirtualdir fkceditor

2430926
pop-up	dialog
if you are using sharepoint 2010 you could use the dialog framework to show a pop-up get this done

opera	firefox
note just tested on firefox 3.6 opera 10 and ie6

2430951
nlb	iis
we have 2 iis 7 webservers in an nlb running their webroots off a shared nas to be more clear they re using the exact same webroot on the nas

2430957
atoi	strtok	strtol	atoi	strtol	strtok
functions like strtol strtok and atoi are often useful

2430984
int	double
long long if it needs be just a little bit bigger float or double if n isn t too big and you don t mind some imprecision or big int if you want the exact values of really big factorials

2431026
width	height
of course you could just refactor your current x y and width height to use the point etc for storage

2431063
google-chrome	firefox
i dont think this is a local caching problem ive disabled caching in all browsers the problem occurs in ie firefox google-chrome

2431069
width	height
i am interested in finding out the height for a given width taken by the webpage for the given html content

2431069
width	height
how can i find out the height the webpage corresponding to the given content for a given width

2431075
union	distinct
a union will do an implicit distinct on the result rows but we know there ll be no overlap here because we re varying checking for null

2431095
set	bag
i ve tried using a custom convention implementing ihasmanyconvention but the instance parameter does not seem to contain the information about whether its a list a bag or a set and also does not contain the column details for the index column

2431150
width	height
this cannot be done unless there are attributes or css rules that define their width or height

2431173
children	parent
if i change some value for a parent sprite the same value will affect all of its children

2431197
int	double
primitive types such as int float double etc can be printed in the same fashion they are printed in c using printf fprintf etc

2431197
nsstring	nsobject
if you need to print the data of a class you can often use nsobject s method to get a nsstring representing the data of the object

2431212
gson	jackson
jackson and gson are the most complete java json packages regarding actual data binding support

2431212
gson	jackson
since i am more familiar with jackson here are some aspects where i think jackson has more complete support than gson apologies if i miss a gson feature

2431212
getter	setter
field and getter setter access earlier gson versions only used fields this may have changed

2431218
folder	directory
to prevent this do the update on the branch you need only or remove the .svn folder in the upper directory

2431237
subtraction	addition
yeah that s not strictly possible the closest thing you can do is nest addition and subtraction functions inside

2431289
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
can i inherit some class from uinavigationcontroller and override it s - id initwithrootviewcontroller uiviewcontroller rootviewcontroller method to realize this

2431317
folder	directory
which you could have used to your advantage - launch each exe setting the current directory to the folder containing the oss dlls

2431362
portrait	landscape
you can test the behavior of your app through switching between portrait and landscape modus control + f11 in the emulator

2431365
cvs	svn
but there just seems to be a large trend of people using git svn cvs etc

2431370
folder	directory
rvm also makes incredibly easy to remove a ruby version and all its data since it installs everything in a folder within your home directory

2431399
websphere	ibm
i know about those 2 policy xml filesbut java ee service which i m trying to call is hosted on a ibm websphere process server to which i don t have access

2431454
hide	show
at the moment i rolled a custom solution which show hide menu items via css class and a programmatic check of the role that the user is in

2431454
hide	show
is there a way i could leverage the roles attribute in the sitemap file to show hide menu items for my custom control below even when some pages are not in the sitemap

2431465
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
for that you need to use the good old malloc realloc and free do not mix malloc realloc free and new delete

2431473
free	malloc
you had to use malloc free instead of new delete to use it

2431475
antialiasing	transparent
the trouble with transparent images is that the half-transparent pixels at the border will be partly colored with the color you specified as the transparent color if you can live with that then you can use the antialiasing arcs library you specified just put the following at the beginning of their example i used the optimized version

2431493
git-rebase	undo
in any case i don t really need to undo the git-rebase i just want to be able to recover the changes in the two files

2431498
post	get
i tried to post on telerik forum but now each time i try to open my thread i get

2431516
voip	rtp
actually i figured out that opal 3.8 is voip lib supported rtp h264

2431587
getter	setter
if it is recommended using the getter wouldn t it be more consistent if one would use setter for the new instance as well

2431696
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
i ve tested this with ie8 mozilla opera google-chrome and safari

2431775
ssl	https
in terms of redirecting users to https areas i usually just forward the pages i want secured for example if a user navigates to i ll immediately redirect the request to response.redirect ... then take them out of the ssl secured area once they are successfully authenticated

2431789
getter	setter
the object philosophy would prevent that and enforce access through getter setter to ensure representation independence

2431841
width	height
if the image dimensions width height are within max dimensions i use a simple copy direct to folder userpics

2431841
width	height
if the original dimensions are bigger than max dimensions i want to resize the width and height to be within max

2431841
gif	png
tried imagetypes uploaded jpg jpeg gif and png same result for all of them

2431857

2432074
haskell	scheme
haskell scheme or clisp

2432111

2432147
entity-relationship	diagram
smartdraw - for entity-relationship diagram its one of the best i have seen so far

2432155
mouseover	mouseleave

2432167
erd	diagram
you can generate an erd diagram from an existing schema in the database

2432183
memcached	apc
you can use anything from per-request caching which will be pretty useless for this particular problem to things like apc memcached a local database or even just saving the raw results to files

2432193
profiler	visualvm
maybe you can attach visualvm to your pid when running ant to see what s going on with memory or perhaps a profiler to pin it down

i have an object of a subclassing extending its superclass

2432249
superclass	subclassing

ant	maven
so people have to judge between how easy they can adjust their builds for how maven works and how long they can wait for a bug fix and how hard it will become to maintain a complex ant build script

2432299
ant	maven
on the other hand maven doesn t prevent configuration so it can be tweaked and can use ant if necessary

2432299
ant	maven
i would prefer maven for a new project because i can follow sensible maven conventions but would use ant build scripts for existing projects

2432299
ant	maven
correction for existing projects i would take a long hard look at migrating to maven and only then if i m really pushed against the wall use ant

2432299
ant	maven
the more i use maven the more i realize how valuable a tool it really is and how hard it becomes to justify ant immediately valuable plugins not building blocks like with ant standardization juniors have no problem jumping into a new project and building code dependency management integration with hudson jenkins...hard to justify ant any more except for extreme end-of-project-life builds at least on the types of projects i work on

2432310
post	get
this is be true for both get and post requests

2432479
folder	directory
and the wait to write a new set of file to the directory after the folder is released by the thread that started procesing the folder

2432484

i am inexperienced with jquery and i m having some trouble with the slideup and slidedown animations

width	height
note that the texture width and height needs to be a power-of-2 so you ll have to pad the margins and adjust your vertices to get the correct placement if the image is not power-of-2

2432769
int	double
passing a single pointer to a struct 4 bytes will take fewer instructions than passing an int 3 double and a pointer 32 bytes but if you have to fill the struct with those 32 bytes before doing the call then you ve lost the advantage

i have migrate a web application from myeclipse to eclipse wtp and i am now in the middle of the first major upgrade to the code base and web pages after the migration and it is frankly driving me mad that saving a jsp page causes a redeployment of the whole application as it takes time and that my backend connection does not survive the serialization-deserialization of the session object which is non-trivial to fix

the event only reaches the parent if it came from one of the groupbox s children

2432981
openssl	opensc
openssl may offer something similar with the help of opensc but the driver shall then support the pkcs#11 api

2432981
openssl	crypto++
apart from openssl and nss you might want to investigate crypto++ which is quite mature and supposedly c++-friendly

2432986
awt	swing
i believe the reason is because swing was built off of awt and container is a top level awt object

2432986
awt	swing
it really isn t the greatest design choice though since you generally don t want to mix awt heavyweight objects with swing lightweight

2433020
bonjour	jmdns
see are there any other java libraries for bonjour zeroconf apart from jmdns

2433057

ostream	ostringstream
ok so operator is returning ostream instead of ostringstream - how about casting it back to an ostringstream

2433071
ostringstream	std	std	ostream	ostream	ostringstream
2 why does operator on the temporary std ostringstream call the ostream operator

2433071
ostream	ostringstream
surely the temporary has a type of ostringstream not ostream

i want to design a view view controler that automaticaly show hide a subview when in landscape orientation

2433298
distance	polygons
since the polyhedron is defined by many polygons in a 3d space one way that occurs to me is to compare the distance to each polygons and choose the shortest distance

2433306
ienumerable	iqueryable
see also what is the difference between iqueryable t and ienumerable t

2433319
ienumerable	iqueryable
ienumerable is great for working with in-memory collections but iqueryable allows for a remote data source like a database or web service

2433350
prepare	execute
native prepare statements cannot execute certains types of queries like show tables

2433394
vb.net	vb6
i program in delphi as well as vb6 along with vb.net and c# but creating activex controls is the easiest in vb6 compares to all other development tools

2433397
ienumerable	iqueryable
then with an iqueryable the generated sql will contain but with an ienumerable many more roles will be pulled back from the database then the check will be done by .net

2433400
pull	push
what i would like to do is have 1 person be the administrator and only that person is allowed to commit push pull to the repository

2433599
getter	setter
java programmers get around this by creating from the start getter and setter for every public facing attribute whether it has any kind of processing or not just in case

2433599
getter	setter
i ve seen java programmers starting on other languages that do have properties doing the same sin of using getter and setter thing

2433599
getter	setter
getter setter

2433621
hide	show
and i am using jquery to show hide the sub-list

2433627

you can subscribe to mailing lists to get mail into your gmail account subscribe into rss feed with google reader and have it notify you via gmail and then see if it s possible to subscribe to svn updates on the repositories

2433832
mouse	keyboard
this should allow you to catch most keyboard and mouse interactions

2433835
atomic	interlocked
reading and writing a data type that fits into a single word int on a 32-bit processor long on a 64-bit processor is technically atomic but the jitter and or processor can decide to reorder instructions and thus create unexpected race conditions so you either need to serialize access with lock use the interlocked class for writes and in some cases reads or declare the variable volatile

2433836
hide	show
would i just have different user controls for each page and create show and destroy hide them on request

2433852
rss	feed
wordpress has an xml-rpc interface so you could write some middleware to feed your blog with an rss feed or simply submit content via the xml-rpc api itself

2433852
rss	feed
i m sure there are probably some plugins there are many to choose from to read rss feed for wordpress too but you ll have to scowl the wordpress site for the specifics

2433876
loops	while-loop
however when the while-loop gets stepped into it won t break out of loops when everything has been printed to the console and there is nothing else to read

2433886

than the same thing with getter and setter

2433913
versioning	upgrade
it may actually be in your best interest to simply let their versioning languish until you re ready to upgrade

2433913
versioning	upgrade
it would probably be best for you to upgrade your versioning in a sweep with your own app s versioning changes

2433916
getter	setter
i have a domain object employee with the properties firstname and lastname which are transient and when invoking their setter getter methods they encrypt decrypt the data

2433918
japplet	jdialog
i found it helpful to understand that swing provides three generally useful top-level container classes jframe jdialog and japplet

2433950

when i start this small app i get the message from the header of this post

2433962
floating-point	fractions
bear in mind when you get the result that floating-point numbers cannot in general represent decimal fractions precisely

2433962
floating-point	integer
so once you have the mathematically correct answer it will not necessarily give you an integer answer when you do a floating-point multiplication

2433964
width	height
my window width is 1280 and height 960

2433976
mouseleave	mouseenter
and then point all of the buttons mouseenter and mouseleave events to those functions

2434001

2434071
portrait	landscape
this is for a game where the user can choose levels some of which are int portrait orientation and some are landscape orientation

2434071
portrait	landscape
for example ideally the activity would know before even oncreate was called whether it should be landscape or portrait depending on some property of the launching intent but unless i ve missed something that isn t possible

2434071
portrait	landscape
this was done with a simple int representing portrait or landscape determined when the player selected a level

2434071
portrait	landscape
lastly i just had to add a line to the manifest stating that gamelandscape would always run in landscape and gamelogic would always run in portrait

2434075
x86	64bit
after getting the problem on vista i changed the target platform to x86 as people have suggested with the 64bit problem but tis didn t fix the issue

2434165
integer	fractions
you might also want to round off the newheight newwidth to integer values - in almost all cases you ll get some fractions result and images don t have fractions pixels

2434165
disk	ram
this way the transaction will hide the record as it s not committed yet there s no way for two or more simultaneous uploads to get the same id number and if anything fails during image processing insufficient ram disk space corrupt source image etc... you just roll back the transaction and clean up the mess

2434290
hide	show
now since iphone os 3.0 uitableviewcontroller automatically resizes its tableview when the system keyboards show and hide

2434338
vb.net	vb6
it s also a vb.net project upgraded from vb6 if that makes a difference.

2434341
width	height
a you are returning two values that really should be encapsulated in one object height and width of something so you should return an object that represents that something or b this is a code smell and you really need to think about why the method is returning two values the method is really doing two things

2434350
submit	submission
ms bug report here connect.microsoft.com submit button value not posted with form submission

2434432
hide	show
if you don t want to use a plugin like the one in slaks answer you have to either position a label above the password field what the plugin does or hide the password field and show a text input in its place until it gets the focus

2434432
google-chrome	firefox
here s an example that works in at least ie7 it should work in ie6 but i haven t tried it google-chrome and firefox

2434448
width	height
the parameters to glviewport are the lower left corner of your viewport as x and y then width and height

2434458
width	height
i would like to know if it is technically possible to resize an image at a client-side with javascript really resize not just change width and height

2434463
portrait	landscape
you could make two activities - one for portrait levels the other for landscape levels - and then set the activity s orientation in androidmanifest.xml using the android screenorientation attribute

2434463
portrait	landscape
use your current activity as the base activity and just create the landscape portrait activities as subclasses of that activity

2434465
put	get
but this code is being repeated in many pages so i tried to put this function in a c# class and try to call it but i get errors..

2434530

2434595
cifs	smb
i m looking for some stand alone library to access smb cifs shares

2434606
post	get
when sending data via post or get with jquery you use for format so i thought is there a way to do it with this kind of code

2434613
google-chrome	firefox
i m used to debugging javascript in google-chrome or firefox just because their built in developer tools are a lot cleaner than ie s

2434613
google-chrome	firefox
i like being able to step through code as if i was in visual studio and that is pretty nice about ie however when trying to do a simple console.log on an object that i have in firefox google-chrome etc

2434613
google-chrome	firefox
is there any way to drill down into that object in ie like in google-chrome firefox etc

2434634
serializable	deserialization
more importantly though you re not going through the serializable deserialization code - you re just reading from the network and putting the bytes directly into the object

2434859
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
to actually build an arrays with the math you re describing you ll probably have to loops over it in at least one axis with a for-loop

daemons	systemd
systemd who can do any thing to the systemd includes admin and internal daemons

2434979
accessor	properties
apple recommends using lazy initialization wherever possible so i think you re heading down the right path though you might want to consider making the method name something that looks like a properties accessor -names rather than -load especially since there s a class method named +load that means something quite different

2434987
inherited	properties
the current dir is a per-process properties a child process usually inherited it from the parent process but the reverse should not happen and it doesn s

2435004
children	parent
i built a dynamic query based on input from users to return the listing of parent entities along with their children using predicate builder

2435055
kerberos	ntlm
when you run your site from visual studio you are launching the visual studio web server under your own account and this web server will authenticate to sql server using ntlm kerberos as you since is running under your credentials

this.getcomponent 0 is returning the scrollpane s jviewport not your jtextpane

2435935
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
you already know the answer to the very oriented body of your question there is no ant equivalent to this minimal pom.xml because unlike maven ant does not define a set of standards patterns conventions in other words a lingua franca or shared language for project management that would make it possible so ant can t beat maven on this sample

2435935
ant	maven
does this make ant more complex than maven

2435935
ant	maven
somehow yes and i believe that most complains about maven s complexity are due to ignorance i know ant well i know how to do things in ant ant is simple i don t know maven i don t get it i don t know how to do things i feel lost i feel constrained i don t want to learn it maven is complex. and fud

2435935
ant	maven
but maven and ant are so different that there is no real point at comparing them and maven is still much more than ant + dependency management

2435935
ant	maven
so at the end no offense here such questions don t change anything and i ll just quote maven and ant guys youâ ll never agree

2435939

i need to return the max added date and corresponding user and max updated date and corresponding user for each distinct record when tables a b c d are union ed

2436126
folder	directory
yes we ended up rolling back if that s what you call it when you have to re-get everything from sourcesafe to a completely new directory because there is no auto-rollback feature with the framework conversion only a backup folder that has been screwed with and dumped into another folder and will never work again because all references are now broken and the web.config has a bunch of illegal entries and the iis metabase ended up corrupted and intermittent database locking caused permissions to be wiped and around 15 or 20 other problems..

2436134
ubuntu	linux
as stated in the title the program is working on my local machine ubuntu 9.10 but not on the server linux

2436175

2436194
rss	feed
most feed readers won t be able to consume your rss feed if you put a password on it

2436199

currently we are using nunit moq and i m starting to investigate structuremap

2436230

i know you re asking a programming question but you could avoid the whole thing by abandoning the effort to write an isapi filter and instead use an off-the-shelf general purpose rewriter like iirf

2436304
lisp	scheme
common lisp is a weakly functional mixed-paradigm language and scheme is more strongly functional but still not pure

2436338
width	height
i can t figure out why this would be happening if i m fetching the width after i set it to visible with its new dimensions which by the way are relative when i m setting them with layoutparams fill_content for both width and height

2436431
hex	binary
i d love to be able to just see 32-character hex hash while mysql would convert it to from 16 binary bytes and index that as programs using the database might have some troubles with arbitrary binary data that i d rather avoid if possible also i m a bit afraid that mysql might get some strange ideas about character sets and for example overalocating storage for that by 3 1 because it thinks it might need utf8 how do i avoid that for cure

2436431
hex	binary
it seems some kind of solution would be binary 16 null for storage unhex md5 url for insertion comparison hex url_hash for retrieval not that it really needs retrieval there will be unindexed url column there anyway

2436459
put	get
if i try to put the decimal-format outside the template then i get the message that the xsl if is not allowed in this position in the sthylsheet

2436460

boost	allocator
further do you understand your code and how boost interprocess fits in or how the allocator works

2436585

implements the dispatch using non-template methods then using a mixin template a template class that takes its base class as a template parameter to extends that with additional features may not be so bad though

2436619
width	height
msdn says to set dmpapersize to 0 when you want to specify width and height whereas the microsoft support correction says to set it to dmpaper_user

2436729
put	get
i put in an event to get called when the qtreewidgetitem is dropped but it seems the object gets deleted as soon as it s dropped

2436733
int	chars
i m familiar with how type affinity works in sqlite you can declare column types as anything you want and all that matters is whether the type name contains int chars floa etc

2436753
children	parent
if the parent mc is resized if in the transform dialog it reads other than 100 then that transformation is passed on to any children

2436755
powerpc	i386
i have seen the -arch compiler flag before and have seen values passed to it such as powerpc i386 and x86_64 which i assume maps to the cpu language but my understanding stops there

2436766
google-chrome	firefox
because this works perfectly for me on ie8 compatibility mode firefox and google-chrome

2436790
folder	directory
at the end of each method typically you tell it to render a particular view stored in a folder named after the controller in the views directory which is a lot like a classic asp page with all of the logic separated out

solaris	aix
i ve done a little research on macos x linux aix solaris and hp-ux and there are some interesting results

2436811

say we have an 8-bit unsigned integer n

2436884
integer	unsigned
the resulting unsigned integer type is

foldable	traversable
using ghc extensions you can also derive instances of the following classes typeable data functor foldable and traversable

2436890
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer types implement modulo arithmetic

2437070
int	double
you can avoid the messiness of mapping from double to int by using random s api directly

2437111
put	get
i think the only way to work with memcache is to try to get data out of it with the expectation that it might not be there even if you put it in before

2437114
youtube	vimeo
why aren t you using video hosting service free like for example youtube vimeo for this which are way better prepared for handling this then you could ever be

2437122
opera	firefox
once firefox and opera got a 302 from the server they both tried using home testajax with a slash at the end

2437122
google-chrome	safari
on the other hand the reason why ie safari and google-chrome were working is because they still had x-request-with set to xmlhttprequest in redirected request

2437122
opera	firefox
it is still a mystery to me as to why firefox and opera didn t but i am not going to worry about it at this point

2437164
octal	decimal
the zero-padding could cause trouble if it s interpreted as an octal number 00010 is 9 decimal and is most likely not what you re intending

is there maybe a scrollable panels that would work

2437283
int	chars
issue i am mostly concerned about is bit order when converting of negative bits from chars to int

2437293
int	chars
there is going to be no portable way to do this because nothing says chars has to be eight bits and nothing says unsigned int needs to be 4 bytes wide

2437300
client-side	server-side
however if i am doing extra server-side validations like checking if username is already taken that aren t present in the client-side rules then the validation plugin clears these validation messages when user tabs out of these fields

2437308
google-chrome	safari
now i need to extend this to apple safari and google-chrome on all supported platforms

2437319
versioning	upgrade

working correctly in firefox safari opera google-chrome ie8

2437345
hash	md5

int	double	strcpy	strtod	strcpy	strtok	strtod	strtok	fgets	strtol	fgets	strtok	fgets	strtod	fgets	strcpy	strtol	strtok	strtol	strtod	strtol	strcpy
i would use fgets to read a line from the file strtok to break it on the semicolons strcpy to copy strings strtod to convert to double and strtol to convert to long and then cast down to int

2437542
cos	sin
i assume its going to take cos and sin to some extent just not sure where or why

the simplest method is to create an outlet for the tablecell in your tableviewcontroller and then wire that outlet to the custom cells in interface builder

2438524
content-disposition	content-length	content-disposition	content-type	content-length	content-type
to send a http response all you need to do is to write some content to the outputstream of the response along with a set of response headers representing the content content-type content-length and or content-disposition

i think the point of prepare statements - besides security in query building - is prepare once execute many prepare statements are meant to be run multiple times

2440288
width	height
there would be a way to divine at least the number of bytes per pixel if you could tell how many frames the cursor has but since you can t that information isn t set as of 10.6.1 â x-radar problem 7751530 you are left trying to figure out two factors of a four-factor product bytes per pixel ã width ã height ã number of frames where you only have the width the height and the product

2441575
disk	ram
in a lot of situations the cost of disk space and availability of ram mean that we no longer need to squeeze every last bit of storage out of computers as we did 20 years ago so we can sacrifice a bit of storage efficiency in order to save on development maintenance costs

2441575
16-bit	64bit
however where large amounts of data are used or we are working with systems with small memories embedded controllers or when we are transmitting data over networks using 32 or 64bit to represent a 16-bit value is just a waste of memory bandwidth

parentheses that are used to disambiguate infix operators are not obviously redundant even when they are redundant except perhaps in the very special case of multiplication and addition operators

2442640
getter	setter
in other words in ruby variables are always private the only way to access them is via a getter and or setter method or as they are called in ruby an attribute reader and or writer

2442640
getter	setter
so we have covered the field part java field ruby instance variable we have covered the public and private parts in ruby instance variables are always private if you want to make them public use a public getter setter method and we have covered the static part java static field ruby class instance variable

2442640
getter	setter
don t provide a setter method only a getter

2442658
hash	md5
still it would probably be cleaner to simply use a time-tested hash with a larger space md5 instead of crc32 or sha1 instead of md5 than bet on your own solutions like storing file size

typedef	struct
typedef struct bitstream_impl bitstream

2442673
expression-blend	silverlight
i want to make a silverlight application in expression-blend because of the rich ui and navigation of blend

2442997
rss	feed
why not try to parse your data with a component built specifically to parse rss atom feed like zend_feed_reader

2443107
mcc	mex
my possible solutions are to use a mex file for the main program or have the main program call a mcc library which then calls a mex file which then calls the proper grader

2443129
int	double
but the int are converted to double before comparison to 5.2

2443129
int	double
the type error probably misled you the list of int wasn t being converted to double by comparison to 5.2 the real problem is that only double can be compared to double so you must pass a list of double to belowthreshold

i am on a macbookpro and i have found that the keyboard is on the same usb hub that one of the two usb slots is on and the bluetooth is on the same usb hub that the other of the two usb slots is on which explains the association between those two devices - but what is causing the loss of the other devices

2443670
width	height
so i think i ve to dynamically change width and height attributes in img tag

2443678
width	height
just leaving off the width and height attributes and styles should do

2443687
width	height

2444060
folder	directory
it s also important that you structure the views into sub folder to avoid a messy view directory

lisp	smalltalk
here i tried to implement the smalltalk approach in common lisp which is a good illustration of how metaprogramming is poorly supported in the latter

2444073
google-chrome	firefox
and it works in firefox but not in google-chrome

2444084
google-chrome	safari
if i remove it the code does not work in safari and google-chrome

2444086
maven	pom.xml
oh and about the super pom.xml -- from this page in maven s docs

2444086
maven	pom.xml
the super pom.xml is maven s default pom.xml

2444086
super	extends
all poms extends the super pom unless explicitly set meaning the configuration specified in the super pom is inherited by the poms you created for your projects

i need to grab an uiimage from a uitextview or uilabel

2444151
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason firefox 3.6 for windows isn t issuing a right-click event but google-chrome and ie do

2444151
google-chrome	firefox
if you right-click #test then you get nothing in firefox but you get an alert under google-chrome and ie

2444162
post	get
for web services soap is an example of something that is not rest because the implementer of the service creates it s own verbs via methods rather than the standard get post etc

2444185
versioning	upgrade
which can be problematic - i have a number of rails 2.3.5 and earlier apps in production that require maintenance and won t be upgrade to the new versioning

2444192
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3.6 gives the alert just fine on either left or right click on my mac osx 10.5 as do safari and google-chrome

2444206
put	get
sinatra should respect the order of routes so if you put administration route first and a request matches it get slug won t be called at all

2444228
width	height
if youâ d prefer to keep the width and height attributes in your html then in php you want the getimagesize method in the gd library

inherited	subclassing
edit 2 i now think the best soluton is to create listeningview.h that just includes a listeningview protocol instead of subclassing listeningview since we can t do multiple inherited in obj-c

2444321
hash	md5
if md5 hash any arbitrary string into a 32-digit hex value then according to the pigeonhole principle surely this can not be unique as there are more unique arbitrary strings than there are unique 32-digit hex values

2444336
hash	md5
the answer above still holds but you shouldn t expect an md5 hash to serve as any kind of security check against manipulation

2444351
hash	md5
is there a hash function that returns a 16-digit hex value as md5 returns 32-digit or is there a library for c++ in which i can use md5 or sha-1 which returns a 16-digit value

2444354
extjs	gxt	extjs	smartgwt	gxt	smartgwt
as a base framework for a more complex customized one - examples include extjs gwt gxt and smartgwt

2444355
hash	md5
since you re willing to live with the much-higher collision rate you can just truncate the md5 hash of the data

2444384
put	get
i recommend you do your sorting with the built-in sort method and put your energy into defining the right key-extractor function to get things sorted the exact way you want -- a much more productive use of your time

2444393
hash	md5
as others have pointed out the goal of a hash function like md5 is to provide a way of easily checking whether two objects are equivalent without knowing what they originally were passwords or comparing them in their entirety big files

2444397
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for kguest

2444397
pecl	pear
warning pear archive_zip is deprecated in favor of pecl zip

2444451
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
this is why you should always make sure to add a salt if you are using md5 to store password hash if you include a salt in the input string a matching input string has to include exactly the same salt in order to result in the same output string because otherwise the raw input string that matches the output will fail to match after the automated salting you can t just reverse the md5 and use it to log in because the reversed md5 hash will most likely not be the salt string that originally resulted in the creation of the hash

2444451
hash	salt
so hash are not unique but the authentication mechanism can be made to make it sufficiently unique which is one somewhat plausible argument for password restrictions in lieu of salting the set of strings that results in the same hash will probably contain many strings that do not obey the password restrictions so it s more difficult to reverse the hash by brute force -- obviously salt are still a good idea nevertheless

2444451
hash	md5
bigger hash mean a larger set of possible hash for the same input set so a lower chance of overlap but until processing power advances sufficiently to make brute-forcing md5 trivial it s still a decent choice for most purposes

2444475
width	height
if the page loads with the imageâ s width and height included as attributes in the source

2444475
width	height
use removeattribute width and height the first time you change its source

2444504
single-quotes	double-quotes
you can t nest the double-quotes inside the single-quotes

2444540
rss	feed
every time i ve tried to read in the contents of an rss feed using the syndicationfeed class the .content element for each syndicationitem is null

2444540
rss	feed
i suspect i may just be missing a step somewhere but i can t seem to find a good tutorial on how to consume rss feed using these classes

2444570
rss	feed
the rss feed you linked to puts its content in the element

2444570

as documented the element of an rss feed maps to the summary property

2444689
atexit	main
use the atexit module to register in the main thread a function that set the global threadstop to true or more simply set the daemon attribute of the thread object to true so it won t keep the process alive if the main thread exits

versioning	upgrade
i have a live marketplace versioning of my application and now want to start developing my next versioning but want to be able to have the newer dev upgrade for testing and existing live versioning for demoing both on the same device but i dont want to create a whole separate project to do this

2444796
client-side	server-side
as for javascript client-side versus asp.net server-side i think you are likely to wind up with some combination of both not an either or

2444853
spaces	delimiter
i have tried using cut to keep the columns that i do want and having as my delimiter however because of the file size figures it messes up using spaces as a delimiter

2444872
spaces	delimiter
if you had mixed spaces and tab delimiter you would need to convert one to the other as cut does not like multiple delimiter

this allows you to set a percentage of the enclosing component s width or height

2444956
action-filter	onactionexecuting
i noticed that inside the iactionfilter.onactionexecuting the value for filtercontext.controller.viewdata.model is always null despite the fact that it looks like the model binder is always invoked before the action-filter onactionexecuting method

you should try something like to check for the 0xd octal 15 being equivalent to hex 0xd

2445423
rss	feed
rss 1.0 which is built around rdf does still crop up from time to time so you should built support for it along with the other 8 versions of rss and the ability to recover from errors since many rss feed are invalid and not well formed

2445463
inherited	subclassing
however while technically possible most of the time you are subclassing builtins such as str you are looking at a has-a kind of relationship not is-a therefore composition should be used not inherited meaning you should create a class with a string as an instance attribute rather than subclassing string

2445506
put	get
get column and rows of cursor and put your html tag there

2445512

2446633
lotus	groupwise
but in folders like tasklist and calendar those are from groupwise but i think i remember lotus had similar things i get the items in there as instances of imapmessage and so they are processed as if they were mail

2446639
tostring	getter
edit the same rules about not accessing the class properties directly applies to tostring method as well - only using the getter guarantees that the information really contained in the class is returned

2446642
post	get
however you should have something that works in the href but since this appears to be making a significant change on the server you should be using post not get so a link is the wrong tool

2446652
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseleave
the standard events are mouseover and mouseout but they can be a bit tricky to work with because they bubble you get mouseout for instance whenever the mouseleave any descendant element

2446652
mouseover	mouseout
with appropriate logic though they re not to bad to work with and in fact if you have lots of these you probably want to use mouseover and mouseout rather than the alternative below because you can set them on just a parent container and then work out which descendant element is involved which can be simpler in some cases and more complicated in others

2446652
mouseleave	mouseenter
ie provides mouseenter and mouseleave which are much easier to work with because they don t bubble but of course ie-specific

2446652
mouseleave	mouseenter
...which is really just a shortcut for setting up mouseenter and mouseleave handlers but still wonderfully concise

you could configure mysql using the postgresql-sql-mode and you could also make a dump ready to import in postgresql by using --compatible in mysqldump

2446732
width	height	width	margin	margin	height	box-sizing	margin
i would completely remove those box-sizing properties and use more compliant properies like padding margin width and height for the sizing

2446733
implements	extends
first you don t extends interfaces but you do implements interfaces

2446749
viewdidload	dealloc
if you want it to start when the view is first created and keep ticking firing even when the view is not shown then you need to create it during init or viewdidload and then be sure to stop it when you dealloc or viewdidunload

2446759
versioning	upgrade
the lite versioning can have a link to upgrade to the full versioning but it must be a functioning app in its own right

if i just want a sorted list of just dates int or double is it really necessary to have to define a sortedlist of int int

2446931
width	height
if you have set the height and the width of your bitmapdata to the same width and height of the movieclip your reflecting you will get cut off

2446931
width	height
what you need to do it collect the real width and height of the rotating movieclip and when you redraw the bitmapdata use the new values

2446944
serializable	deserialization
there are methods for handing this though and custom serializable can be implemented by creating a readobject and writeobject method for deserialization and serializable

the mouseout of div1 should only get triggered when the mouseleave div1

2447147
mouseout	mouseleave
changed the mouseout to mouseleave and the code worked.

2447153
fadein	fadeout
the fadein and fadeout work in all browsers

2447173
post	get
the issue i have is that foreign key fields and those using initial take all associated entries all records associated with that record other then the one entry i wanted e.g instead of getting a primary key i get the primary key post subject post body and all other values attributed with that record

2447177
mouseout	mouseleave
use the mouseleave event instead or mouseout for this it handles your specific issue

2447177
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseleave event differs from mouseout in the way it handles event bubbling

2447193
rank	max
instead of getting the first value for the max date it rank the dates and gets all values for the latest date

now to use it get inputstream from httpconnection and put it all in saxparser.parse

2447429
ogre	irrlicht
in my opinion going with irrlicht or ogre is a good idea

2447457
getter	setter
the spec requires that both a setter and getter are defined to be able to use the syntactic sugar for calling the setter

2447457
getter	setter
furthermore the getter must be visible in order to use the setter

2447477

google-chrome	safari
although there is another alignment problems with ie but not in google-chrome or safari

2447511
google-chrome	safari
i had it working before but the only thing i can think of to do is target safari and google-chrome

2447511
google-chrome	safari
need to change these for google-chrome and safari

2447531
inherited	properties
i would make use of aggregation instead of inherited create a new vcl component that delegates its methods to the existing component you then have full control over what properties to publish

2447580
int	chars	int	double
sizeof int sizeof float sizeof double sizeof chars sizeof 167 sizeof 3.1415926 and

2447587
innodb	myisam
if in addition you need to do continuously transactions on these tables as opposed to just load data every now and then and mostly query that data you probably need to look into innodb and not the default myisam tables

2447614
opera	google-chrome
also try with some other browsers like opera or google-chrome if you have access to them

2447635
punctuation	words

what i do is i set the foreground div with the draggable as the droppable but use the dropover and dropout features to determine if the item is outside the foreground div

2447823
post	put	post	get	put	get
the reset action is a idempotent action if you call it n times you will always get the same result so imho you should use a put call instead post as post is not idempotent

in school portal there s a student profile and a parent profile now the problem is how can i achieve a relationship between this two.actually the scenario is one dad can have multiple children studying in different school now suppose dad wants to look out the result remarks of his all children on what basis he can achieve that this is my question

2447876
post	put
consider placing an order if you put to orders my-new-order the meaning can only ever be update the resource identified by orders my-new-order whereas post orders can mean place a new order if the post accepting resource has the appropriate semantics

2447877
post	get
are there any disadvantages to using a simple http post to get the data from the ws instead of using soap over http

2447909

parent can register multiple children with different id s aswell

2448159
rss	feed
here is an example of an implementation of the player using an media rss feed in silverlight

2448242
typedef	struct
it looks like it s working if i use a class instead of struct so is it not possible with typedef struct

2448252
children	parent
say i have an parent entity each of which have a number of children

2448252
children	parent
i want to get all the parent sorted by their number of children

2448274
equals	gethashcode
do i implement these keys as classes and override gethashcode equals etc or do i use struct instead

2448299
typedef	struct
you don t need to do an explicit typedef for classes and struct

2448307
typedef	struct
the problem is you can t template a typedef also there is no need to typedef struct in c++

2448316
typedef	struct
note that there is no need for the typedef trick in c++ you can use struct without the struct modifier just fine in c++

2448318
boost	stl
note that boost s ptr_vector cannot be used safely with some of the stl algorithms which may be a problem for you

2448378
children	parent
you might consider maintaining a derived attribute on your parent entity call it childrencount that reflects the number of children related to the parent if this is feasible for your situation

2448378
children	parent
it s not the cleanest solution but if you keep it as an nsnumber in the parent entity you d have access to it even if children is faulted and you can sort on it directly

2448383
put	get
once you create your api url and get your results back you can then put them in an array and send that data to a uitableview

2448391
serializable	deserialization
however if you already have the flowdocuments as xml files than it would be easier just to dump them into a nvarchar max field with no added serializable deserialization overhead

2448434
sorting	grouping
on myisam tables in some cases the subselects tend to be faster than grouping by queries due to the fact that grouping by in myisam is quite expensive due to sorting materialization overhead

2448464
getter	setter
when you bind a component the getter and setter are supposed to be simple - only get set - no logic inside them

2448475
cairngorm	mate
use some mvc framework like cairngorm or mate to begin with

2448508
getter	setter
getter setter fuxors tomayko

2448526
matlab	simulink
the code is generated automatically using matlab simulink so i do have access to a scripting language to help with the structure creation

2448543
direct3d	gdi
i m trying to redirect the output of a gdi application to a buffer preferably a direct3d texture but i ll settle for a system memory buffer that i can then copy to a direct3d texture

2448580
width	height
it displays java.awt.dimension width 1024 height 768 is that not what you expect

2448580
subtract	add
i needed to add subtract from my my

2448592
setinterval	settimeout
you can also pre-load the in-page cache in the background using setinterval or better settimeout

2448628
getter	setter
and indeed you should preferably not do any business logic in getter setter

2448659
min	max
i ve been grabbing all of the matching records and using php to calculate the min and max value for each page which seems inefficient and likely to cause scaling problems

2448659
min	max
the only possible technique i ve been able to come up with is some way of having a calculated variable that increments every x records x records to a page grouping by that and selecting min max for each page grouping.

2448661
procfs	bsd
the linux kernel does not provide a mechanism in procfs to report on tcp socket states unlike bsd and other unix-like oss

2448667
width	height
right i have an a tag which is a block element fixed width and height

2448669

but now windows 7 64bit won t run 16-bit programs anymore

2448697
mouseup	mousedown
my plan is to initiate part of a movie clip on mousedown and complete it only when mouseup has been initiated

2448697
mouseup	mousedown
this works well for the first time but after that it does not recognise my mousedown only my mouseup

2448719
icmp	tcp
isreachable will use icmp echo request s if the privilege can be obtained otherwise it will try to establish a tcp connection on port 7 echo of the destination host

2448738
width	height
so if the window is and the user changes the width to 600 i want to change the height to 450 automatically

2448738

i have fabric scripts that can automatically set up and configure nginx + apache mod_wsgi on an ubuntu vps or configure the equivalent on webfaction shared hosting and then deploy the project

2448744
apache	nginx
fab staging enable enable the apache nginx config for this site

2448744
apache	nginx
fab staging reload_server reload apache nginx config

2448752
x86	64bit
note i have 64bit win 7 thus the x86 in the program files folder name.

2448798
many-to-one	one-to-many
transparent navigation between associations one-to-one many-to-one one-to-many and many-to-many-through-intermediate-relation can be achieved either by lazy or by eager fetching strategies

2448799
ready	each
note this will write each file after the changes are made so make sure you re ready for this

2448817
gridview	linqdatasource
i m trying to connect my gridview to a linqdatasource to select update insert and delete records

2448828
mvp	presenter
with mvp you normally bind the view ui with the presenter in the presenter

2448906
stdout	stderr
this will interleave stdout and stderr as desired in a real file that is conveniently open for you

2448917
put	get
if you put the code in the app your will not be able to maintain it and you ll get rsi from all that clicking

2448940
min	max
to figure this the min and max per page you d need to use temporary tables and then calculate the per page min max for your entire resultset from this temp table

2448953
children	parent
parent has children

2448979
for-loop	loops
it s been a while since i ve used delphi but my guess based on the error is that the excelworksheet collection is not enumerated which would mean doing a for each style loops would not work and you d need to use a c-like for-loop

2449043
capitalization	uppercase
navigation and logos should start with an uppercase or if it s a name the proper spelling for the name iphone not iphone or iphone. only use css capitalization for stylization

2449052
cos	sin
you have the angle and the length of movement which is your hypotenuse so you should be able to use sin or cos to calculate the amount of x and y movement required

2449074
getter	setter
you could do this by altering your getter setter for the parameters property so anything that uses the paramters would validate them on the first use

2449198
vsto	add-in
in the case of a vsto add-in this is set to the user documents folder automatically

2449198
vsto	add-in
if your file will be deployed to the same folder as your vsto add-in assembly you can use appdomain.currentdomain.basedirectory to build the full path to the file

2449199
post	get
browsers only support get and post for sending forms

2449243
getter	setter
here s an example that adds a getter and setter

2449260
post	get
according to the html4 spec form element only supports get and post

2449279
firefox	safari
ran in the same problem and this solved it for me in all major browsers ie6+ firefox safari in mac xp

2449297
int	chars
take one dictionary that maps chars to int

2449301
stdout	stderr
it does not return the output from stdout or stderr

2449301
stdout	stderr
to grab the output from stdout or stderr use subprocess.popen

2449334
qtableview	qtablewidget
i would recommend changing from a qtablewidget to a qtableview with an appropriate model

2449343
inherited	properties
i know that this is normal dependency properties behaviour because the properties is inherited but that s not what i want in this case

2449370
post	put
the reason to use post as insert and put as update is that post is the only nonidempotent and unsafe operation according to http

2449393
hash	salt
i have used a salt string with hash passwords but not with a two-way encryption

2449400
post	put
when the intention is to create a new resource we can use put if we know what the identifier of the resource should be and we can use post if we want the server to determine the identifier of the new resource

2449404
calloc	malloc
which was previously allocated using malloc or calloc

2449404
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
free and malloc calloc etc is used for basic types but in c++ new and delete can be used for them likewise so there isn t much reason to use malloc in c++ except for compatibility reasons

2449408
free	malloc
and one more thing you should never pair malloc delete or new free

2449414
free	malloc
when new and delete are used with standard c types in c++ source they behave like malloc and free

2449472
int	boolean	int	chars
many of the native object types such as boolean byte chars int long object short string vector hashtable are implicitly persistable

2449478
m2e	pom.xml
if you just want to create a default pom.xml and enable m2e features so i m assuming you do not currently have an alternative automated build setup you re trying to import and i m assuming you re talking about the m2e plugin

2449478
m2e	pom.xml
the m2e plugin provides a right-click option on a project to add this default pom.xml

2449554
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation uses dtrace under the hood and provides a huge wealth of profiling and measurement tools

2449554
profiling	instrumentation
the time profiling template will get you time profiling and call stacks but i don t think there is any way to get a call graph for the entire execution though there s so much in instrumentation i may easily be wrong

2449569
globalization	localization
the datetime object has the ability to offset from local time to utc gmt time using .getutcxxx this will convert from the local time instance to a utc offset based on the current globalization localization setting being used in the runtime

2449601
maven-jar-plugin	pom.xml
i ve got an existing pom.xml file that includes a maven-jar-plugin section

2449635
mouse	keyboard
haveâ for instance mouse or keyboard timing inputâ that are then

2449638
inherited	properties
i read in wpf unleashed that wrapping something in a frame control ..isolates the content from the rest of the ui and properties that would normally be inherited down the element tree stop when they reach the frame but wrapping the button in the example above in a frame doesn t work

2449648
pop-up	dialog
i need to have a pop-up dialog like the color dialog or save dialog but for choosing a date from a calendar

2449648
pop-up	dialog
the datetimepicker is what i need but i don t know how to launch this like a pop-up dialog in c#

2449663
debian-based	ubuntu
for debian-based distros like ubuntu you ll want to create a .deb file

2449695
versioning	upgrade
the commenter below correctly mentions that the express editions don t come with mfc so i guess your option is to either link to mfc dynamically or upgrade to a versioning that supports static linking

2449701
ubuntu	debian
for ubuntu debian you could read the ubuntu packaging guide

2449701
redhat	fedora
for redhat here is the rpm guide from fedora

2449723
try-catch	exception-handling
a try-catch is expensive when an exception-handling is thrown and usually you want to try and detect that situation before the exception-handling is thrown

2449730
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	webkit	gecko
you can use csssandpaper to use the transform property which can be used to rotate elements in gecko firefox webkit safari google-chrome opera and even internet explorer

2449772
subtract	add
note that since it allocates space for one audiobuffer as part of the struct itself you subtract one from the number you really want to get the space to add on to the allocation

2449781
postgresql	vertica	pivot-table	crosstab
what is the vertica equivalent of crosstab or pivot-table found in postgresql and other rdbms s

almost any distribution system out there has an package generator - try checkinstall for debian-based ubuntu etc. deb packages - just run it and it will do all the stuff required for you

2449844
google-chrome	firefox
one good way to get that is to have your script installed as part of a plug-in for firefox or google-chrome using a toolkit such as greasemonkey

2449875
octal	hex
as to what actual octal hex values ã is associated with i m not sure

2449882
maven	pom.xml
as far as i know there is nothing that will automagically convert an eclipse project into a maven project modify the layout create a pom.xml generate and feed it with metadata detect libraries and their versions to add them to the pom.xml etc

2449939
hide	show
option 1 use conditional-suppression logic to hide show redundant fields

2449944
button	checkbox
to deselect all checkbox you can iterate the container s children or easier use buttongroup.getelements to enumerate the button in a particular group

2449964
post	put
anyway - i just put up a quick blog post on it as well here

2450006
glassfish	weblogic
if you want to use a more robust mainstream java server instead of jetty you can deploy a war bundle of your application to tomcat glassfish weblogic etc

2450024
ilist	icollection
an ilist is an icollection

2450024
ilist	icollection
you could implement icollection and if you need more methods from ilist in the future you can just change it without causing harm to the clients

2450121
inherited	properties
you can t just say don t inherited because the control has to inherited its properties values from somewhere

2450157
unsigned	short
you need to special case the non-promoted types char short and their unsigned signed versions thereof since applied to two of such operands of differing types the result will be neither of them

2450178
for-loop	loops
also as mark byers pointed out loops would be simpler to understand if you refactored it into a for-loop rather than a while

2450286
google-chrome	firefox
anyway the above code will do what you re after tested here in google-chrome and firefox looks good and only requesting the page once

2450357
unsigned	short
retrieving from unsigned short

2450368
put	get
i think that real problem with code quality or testing is that you have to put a lot of work into it and you get nothing back

2450377
integer	unsigned
you can replace the integer types uintxx_t with the corresponding type of your language like unsigned long

2450474
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
but it seems to only be broken in ie7 ie8 ff3 safari opera google-chrome camino all worked

2450483
width	height
they have a font which itself has a name and a size a numberformat height width orientation etc

2450507
jboss	glassfish
ps is there a tutorial out there that explains how to write a better better can mean anything but in my case it s all about performance in high demand requests jms publisher and subscriber that i can run on application server such as jboss or glassfish

2450508
ready	each
make sure to index a dummy term in between each name so that ready phil doesn t match the document

2450530
apache-poi	xlrd
i could not find a decrypt method under apache-poi or python s xlrd module

the drop-downs show correctly above the main content in google-chrome firefox safari ie6 ie7

2450621
width	height
try to set width and height

2450685
children	parent
everything works great when saving the parent and the children

2450685
children	parent
i can t seem to get all the children with a specific parent

2450687
fflush	gets
my problem is that application_endrequest never gets called on a 404 error so if my view does not render i completely block database access until my fflush takes place

2450709
getter	setter
take a look on getter and setter in frontcontroller view layout and viewrenderer classes

2450726
width	height	portrait	landscape
unfortunately when in landscape mode the width and height remains the same as in portrait mode

2450795
for-loop	loops
and you could make use of a for-loop instead of a while loops for example

2450814
realloc	malloc
start by malloc ing a reasonably-sized buffer copy data into it and realloc yourself more space as needed

2450818
gif	png
in mac os x textures as gif don t work only png and jpg

2450860
qdialog	qwidget
if you want to call resize you need to create your own qwidget or qdialog

2450862
lan	localhost
i know my rmi app works correctly - it works fine when the server is on localhost and inside the lan but when connecting to an external rmi server it fails when trying to make stub calls

2450891
post	get
in particular you ll see that it needs to be sent as a post rather than the more common get

2450896
implements	extends
i chose the second option and derived a cursor by extends the sqlitecursor class and implements the sqlitedatabase.cursorfactory interface with the following code

2450901
actionlink	redirecttoaction
is there a simple way of specifying the route values with redirecttoaction or actionlink so that the url s get generated like the above example

2450902

what apis are provided by windows for cpu power management i m interested in cpu frequency scaling setting min and max cpu frequency - similar to what you can do in control panel in power plans but in a programmatic way

2450906
width	height
i m looking for an easy way to get width and height dimensions for image files in ruby without having to use imagemagick or imagescience running snow leapard

2450910
swt	swing
you can also script swing or swt with jruby either directly or via one of the numerous frameworks

2450910
webkit	gecko
you might manage to integrate protovis via a webkit or gecko like redcar does embedding or a java html renderer there are some

2451001
cairngorm	mate	cairngorm	puremvc	mate	puremvc
everything else i ve seen primarily cairngorm puremvc mate still has a lot of either code or xml bloat which is something i want to avoid

2451161
ironruby	ironpython
i ve given thought to using ironpython ironruby and luainterface but frankly they re all a bit overpowered for what i want to do

2451161
scatter	graphing
to come up with the data for the graphing the user will choose whether it s a bar graphing scatter plot etc. and then to actually obtain the data i would like to obtain some kind of list from the user simply entering something sql-ish along the lines of

2451202
inherited	properties
i have a series of models all which inherited from a base model properties

2451252
titlebar	window
i get a window whose full size is 500x500 including the title bar etc. where i really need a window whose size is something like 504x520 to account for the window border and titlebar

2451255
int	double
is not applicable for the arguments int double

2451262
jboss	glassfish
apart from jboss and glassfish you may be interested in jetty - an extremely lightweight yet powerful alternative

2451300
chgrp	chmod
as bob belongs to dev i can set the permissions correctly with chmod but it appears chgrp is throwing back operation errors

2451313
int	double
the method put int map in the type map is not applicable for the arguments int double

2451313
int	double
so the type of pegplprices.put int double is double

2451321
hide	show
specifically i want to show or hide pictures based on a value in the data

2451337
opera	google-chrome
tested to work on ff3.6 ie7 google-chrome 4 and opera 10

2451456
hide	show
you want to show the panel when the user hovers over the original button and hide it again when the user moves their mouse away from the menu

2451456
mouseover	mouseout
a better approach is to have the mouseout event initiate a timer which will start the transition after a brief delay and then cancel this timer if you receive another mouseover event in the meantime

2451468
qiodevice	qnetworkreply
qnetworkreply in its turn is an inheritor of qiodevice therefore you are able to call its readall method in order to receive the response data

2451473
post	get
this is a long post basically summarizing all the things i learned about django in order to get static files to work it took me a while to understand how all the different parts fit together

2451493
stdout	stderr
route stdout and stderr to a file

2451535
nsurl	nsstring
i know one upper bound is 2 32 - 1 bytes because that s the maximum length of a nsstring on the iphone and nsurl can be converted to nsstrings

2451552
strsplit	substr
finally note that you can use substr to extract your letters and numbers instead of doing strsplit

2451594
for-loop	arrays
a divide-by-two search in a sorted arrays of size n can be written as a non-nested for-loop too but it would have o log n time

2451605
stdout	stderr
redirecting the standard error stderr and stdout to file use the following syntax

2451634
bmp	png
it is entirely probable the data is simply jpg bmp or png and the tool is basically an sql frontend

2451644
jgit	egit
egit jgit is a reimplementation of git

2451660
for-loop	arrays
there are more verbose ways of iterating over characters in an arrays regular for-loop characteriterator etc but if you re willing to pay the cost tochararray for-each is the most concise

2451671
profiling	debugging
if you ve already tried to execute a .php file remove the existing run profiling you maybe weren t aware that you created run debugging configurations...

2451674
integer	unsigned
type if t is a unsigned integer type then the same type as t if t is an signed integer type then the corresponding unsigned type

2451674
int	chars
otherwise if t is an enumerated or chars type chars or wchar_t then an unsigned int type with the same width as t

2451677
google-chrome	firefox
a useful way of reverse-engineering something like this is to go into a browser like firefox or google-chrome others do this as well but these are the two i use most right-click on the element and select inspect element. this will give you a nicely-formatted at least firefox formats it i think google-chrome might not view of the markup as well as currently applied styles

2451683
awt	swing
either of these should be inside a awt frame or swing jframe

2451683
awt	swing
window creation is handled by java via awt or swing

2451735
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
note that this code will work equally well if you replace all the instances of jradiobutton with jcheckbox

2451735
button	checkbox
however this is not recommended because the standard way to indicate that only one thing can be chosen is to use radio button rather than checkbox

2451735
button	checkbox
if you really don t like the way jradiobutton button look then i suggest playing with your swing look-and-feel to change all of your checkbox and radio button in your application until you are happy with the result

2451747
put	get
i want to put an encrypted license list on the web so that valid users can use my app to get that list and check to see if their license ids are on the list so the apps can be activated

2451752
portrait	landscape
im writing a report with reporting services that is almost always only going to be used as exported to pdf but the pdfs i get are always in landscape mode and i want them in portrait but only for this report

2451767
midi	osc
in addition chuck supports midi osc hid device and multi-channel audio

2451775
width	height
to change my reports to landscape i simply swap the pagesize property s height and width values on the report itself

2451775
width	height
if i make the width 29.7cm and the height 21cm i get a landscape report

2451775
width	height	portrait	landscape
reports are portrait by default though - if yours are showing up as landscape and nobody has changed the height and width of the page then i m not sure what s happening

2451776
multiplying	addition
it was one where it would multiplying by addition

2451790
folder	directory
remember you also have a sites folder in your home directory that you can use you can get to that by typing your-short-username into the location bar of any device on the same network that supports bonjour previously rendezvouz

2451792
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
if you want only one value stored you need a single variable you can also allocate memory dinamically but it requires a good knolewdge of pointers and memory allocation management functions malloc realloc free etc.

2451819
postgresql	mysql
it s better to always use case which is standard sql and works in all compliant databases including sqlite and mysql and mssql oracle postgresql access sybase.

2451843
webrat	cucumber
i am using cucumber webrat and pickle in conjunction

2451859

2451874
width	height
mdi was first invented for two obsolete modes which are mosaic where every window is arranged to have about the same height width and cascade

2451914
int	chars
means read an int and put it in int1. so you feed it z which is not a valid chars in an int and it simply aborts the read and leaves whatever in int1

2451926
width	height
what i mean is something that gives the height of elements like the status bar tab bar navigation bar default tableviewcell height and such things as width of accessory view indentation etc default icon sizes default font sizes for ui elements if they need to be mimicked for instance etc etc etc

2451934
accessor	properties
xsd.exe will autogenerate the xxxspecified properties and accessor if you set the minoccurs attribute as minoccurs 0 for an element .

2452038
rss	feed
can anyone give me really good tutorials that i could build a similar iphone app for my rss feed

2452080
uicontrol	uibutton
then for each uibutton you can use the uicontrol method -addtarget action forcontrolevents

2452088

integer	unsigned
by dropping the sign bit bit 64 you end up with 63 0 bits xoring with 1 bits gives you 63 1 bits add +1 and the whole thing rolls over to give you an unsigned integer having bit 64 set to 1 and the rest set to 0 - which is the same thing you got with cout but as a negative number

union	distinct
union potentially if you want a distinct list of entries i beleive it only does a distinct is another alternative

2457708
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
all our information is encrypted using public key encryption and the keypair is user dependent its generated on the server and the private key is symmetric encrypted using the users password which is also hash on the database so basically on first run the user sends in his password via a ssl connection and the password is used with the addition of salt to generate an md5 hash also the password is used to encrypt the private key and the private key is stored on the server

2457710
google-chrome	firefox
we had a similar problem couple months ago where we wouldn t have any problem with it in firefox or google-chrome but when we were to show the combobox on ie the screen would freeze and it would start responding again in a couple minutes

2457715
memcached	apc
generally the delay involved in reading the file from disk is much higher than a caching system such as memcached or apc

2457749

concave	convex
so how can i automatically break apart a concave polygon into convex ones or even all triangles

2457919
affinity	processors
edit as the documentation on queryperformancecounter states it should not matter which processors is called - and in fact the whole hacking around with thread affinity is only needed if the apic acpi detection fails and the system resorts to using the tsc

2457947
width	height
my xib has the proper height width but it seems to get overridden when i call it like this

2458153
google-chrome	safari
current webkit based browsers as of 3 16 2010 safari and google-chrome exhibit the following bugs

2458153
hash	md5
the only fix i can think of is this when you save the state from the first time you visit page a take a md5 or sha1 hash of the page and store that with the input element state

2458153
hash	md5
when you go back to page a only restore state if the md5 or sha1 hash is the same

2458163
mouse	keyboard
to detect what event you got with you mouse or keyboard to test it u can use

2458169

equals	gethashcode
yes i could implement equals gethashcode to make them seem the same

2458211
post	get
seems like you just want the answer to your homework so i wont post more than this but this should be enough to get you on the right track

2458233
free	malloc
malloc error for object 0x60e2c4 pointer being free was not allocated

2458250
equals	gethashcode
you should implement equals gethashcode methods

2458274
post	get
the post has a similar refinement and the getnewform combines the definition of http method and path into one so that get requests for appointments new are handled by that method

2458310

uilabel	uitextview
both seem to work fine for uilabel but fail for uitextview elements

2458389

hopefully linux i assume that s what you are running on could handle millions of files in a directory otherwise you might need to hash on the task id to get a sub folder

2458440
jar	war
however following that advice along with how i think i m supposed to make an executable jar war isn t working

2458440
jar	war
to fix the first one i put the jetty jar files in the base of the war file and tried again -- same error

2458469
implements	extends
also if you want it baked in you will probably need to extends the gridview and implements your own code

2458495
integer	unsigned
i know java doesn t allow unsigned types so i was wondering how it casts an integer to a byte

2458536
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
as of c89 you do not have to cast the result of malloc calloc or realloc and doing so can suppress a potentially useful warning

2458536
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
it unclutters the code a little bit and you don t have to go back and update all your malloc calloc realloc calls if you change the type of a

2458549
intersect	contains
i m not familiar with triangular bezier patch but if it can always be contains within a triangle then if the ray intersect the triangle it must intersect the curve inside it too

2458600
children	parent
inherited attributes which must be passed down from parent nodes to children nodes of the abstract syntax tree during the semantic analysis of the parsing process are a problem for bottom-up parsing because in bottom-up parsing the parent nodes of the abstract syntax tree are created after creation of all of their children

2458613
width	height
you have to specify width and height

2458697
filesystems	xfs
also the kinds of filesystems that support this xfs ext4 are not normally used on usb sticks

the question that i have is how do i get video id and how do i post my video to the server

2459044
hash	salt
it s quite easy to store a salt hash of a credit card number rather than the number itself for secure lookups

2459044
hash	salt
that s why we salt our hash

2459044
hash	salt
for the case of credit cards this should be the same -- a random salt for each instance of the credit card being hash

2459044
hash	salt
the salt and hash are right there and don t need to change while still allowing for audit checks of the hash

2459071
sharepoint	spsite	spweb	spsite
problem creating a site column using the sharepoint api object model with incorrect case in the url for the spsite or spweb object will cause the new column to throw an exception if an attempt to edit it is made through the site columns gallery

2459071
sharepoint	spsite	spweb	spsite
then if i create a new site column using the sharepoint object model and happen to use when instantiating the spsite and spweb objects the site column will be made available but when trying to access it through the gallery the error above is generated

2459080
ironruby	ironpython
i m wary using ironruby though because it doesn t appear as mature as ironpython

2459090
post	get
disclaimer i have no idea how the panda video converter works this is just an example of using requestbuilder to make get and post requests to a server

2459090
post	get
since the only elements of this process are post and get requests you can use the requestbuilder to make these requests for you in gwt

2459090
post	get
this just serves as a basic example of using requestbuilder to make get post calls

2459105
doc	rtf
use rtf rather than doc

2459117
children	parent
it has a mdi parent form that is hosting a few children forms

2459155
win64	windows
however you are defining a win64 as a wix variable not a windows installer property

2459155
win64	windows
if has the right value when the setup is created then this will cause a win64 property to be recorded in the windows installer database the msi file and the property will be available during installation for use in a condition element

2459179
portrait	landscape
i want my uiview subclass to behave so that when it is fitted in portrait orientation is has a certain size and another size when fitted in landscape mode

fossil recently changed the details of how it saves passwords which impacted the way authentication is done during clone push pull and sync

2459209
post	put	post	get	put	get
rest-based services get post put

2459291
put	get
the problem is that if i put a list of exam_normal at an exam class if i try to persist exam i get an error because it tries to persist exam_normal first but it cant because the primary key of exam is missing because it isn t persisted.

2459349
google-chrome	firefox
i ve reproduced the problem in firefox and google-chrome so far

2459403
operands	scalar
unqualified scalar type and the operands shall have scalar type

works nicely except i am at a loss as to how to attempt the next steps

2459529
telerik	componentart
telerik or componentart

cvs	svn
svn newbie although so far i really like it coming from cvs

2459615
width	height
incidentally however there is no css width or height specifier for the rest of the page

2459659
folder	directory
one solution could be to make the images folder a virtual directory on the iis but i would like to know if this can be done without creating a virtual directory for the images folder

2459694
folder	directory
you open up the internet information services manager and find the file you want to modify the caching settings for or you can do it on the folder that contains the file - for example if you want to do all files in a directory which is pretty common

2459719
inherited	properties
your class c does not inherited from object or any other new-style class so it is an old-style class and therefore does not support properties

2459731
hash	md5
if it is the exact same file the md5 hash will be the same for both images

2459787
merb	ruby-on-rails
i m porting an application from merb 1.1 1.8.7 to ruby-on-rails 3 beta 1.9.1 that uses json responses containing html fragments a json container specifying an update on a user record and the updated user row looks like

2459787
merb	ruby-on-rails	put	get
in merb since whatever a controller method returns is given to the client one can put together a hash assign a rendered partial to one of the keys and return hash.to_json though that certainly may not be the best way. in ruby-on-rails it seems that to get data back to the client one must use render and render can only be called once so rendering the hash to json won t work because of the partial render

2459795
jsf	seam
a nice article besides seam in action book about jsf seam can be found here

2459829
richfaces	tomahawk
if you look at component frameworks richfaces tomahawk etc - they do it this way

2459830
hash	md5
that means that it s likely an md5 hash

2459831
rss	feed
what i thought of is to publish an rss feed of entries in asp.net site and routinely scrape that data into mysql on linux host

2459855
width	height
in which case you might need to either maximize the layoutroot inside the page or specify a proper width and height for the itself

2459882
folder	directory
however my os file system has a limit on the number of sub directory meaning storing the original folder structure is not going to work

2459886
boost	allocator
boost interprocess vector takes an allocator type as a template parameter

2459886
boost	allocator
this is wrong and is exactly why boost interprocess vector needs a shared memory allocator

2459932
vim	emacs
you should get your environment set up be it vim emacs or an ide such that you can easily move back and forth between static code in text files and an interactive repl

2459997
int	chars
to get the ascii code for a chars just get the chars into a chars and cast the chars to an int

put	get
i have an application that uses msword automation to edit some documents after they save and close word i need to grab the modified file and put it back on the repository there is only one scenario where i can t get it to work and that is

2460117
put	get
basically how can i get error details and put them in message of send mail task

2460123

kde	gnome
could anyone please point me to some article detailing the relationship between qt gtk kde gnome x

2460139
kde	gnome
i run qt applications regularly on my mac and occasionally on windows and i m entirely certain that neither the macs nor the windows pcs have kde installed nor gnome for that matter

2460146
getter	setter
- avoids defensive getter and setter

2460198
ia-32	x86
as i understand it the x86 ia-32 architecture still has the same basic limited register set today that it always did but the internal register count has grown tremendously but these internal registers are not generally available and are used with register renaming to achieve parallel pipelining of code that otherwise could not be parallelizable

2460208
gif	png
this uses a negative lookahead to ensure that the regex matches a string only if the string does not contain pdf png jpg or gif at the specified position

2460209
rss	feed
track their rss feed to find new content

2460240
gilead	dozer
this will result in b not being fetched by default but b_id will be available even after the session is closed and running your result through something like dozer or gilead

2460261
opera	firefox
my plugin works perfectly on firefox and opera

2460291
dictionary	map
f# map - c# dictionary

2460296

2460322
ubuntu	linux
i tested your code on a linux machine ubuntu 9.10 python 2.6.4 and got the valueerror

2460330
perl	tcl
that ruled out perl python and tcl along with scheme

2460464
nsurl	nsstring
you can then use the path-manipulation methods of nsstring or of nsurl or the equivalent function for cfurl to tack a sub-path onto that

2460464
nsuserdefaults	cfpreferences
if you want to save a preferences file you probably should be using nsuserdefaults or cfpreferences instead of handling plists yourself

2460464
nsuserdefaults	cfpreferences
nsuserdefaults and cfpreferences work as expected in a sandbox

2460566
maven	pom.xml
execute the maven test goal over the parent pom.xml you will notice that 3 4 tests from org.seamoo.persistence.jdo.jdogenericdaoimpltest passed while all tests from org.seamoo.persistence.jpa.jpagenericdaoimpltest failed

2460576
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
also you generally don t want to explicitly make uinavigationcontroller s view a subview of another view unless that other view is your uiwindow

2460662
width	height
is it possible to set the height width of an element in percent using javascript or jquery

2460674
mouse	keyboard
so as you can understand the features are quite obvious ability to easily simulate keyboard and mouse functions read input process and display output execute programs manipulate windows register hotkeys etc

2460677
google-chrome	safari
if you are using firebug or the google-chrome safari developer tools execute the above in the console and you ll see the stack overflow header shrink by 50

2460688
serializable	deserialization
if both the client and the server are written in .net c# i would recommend wcf insted of raw sockets as it saves you a from a lot of plumbing code with serializable and deserialization synchronization of messages etc

2460764
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for firefox google-chrome and safari nothing happens

2460797
selecteditem	selectedindex
you can use selectedindex or selecteditem properties of the combobox

2460803
wicket	stripes
you should employ some rapid web development framework for that i would like you to look into wicket or stripes

2460880
width	height
the question is what do you want the div s height width to be a percent of

2460880
width	height
by default if you assign a percentage value to a height width it will be relative to it s direct parent dimensions

2460901
implements	extends
i tried changing the extends to implements however it didn t seem to work that way

2460940
folder	directory
every time i recompile the code it is deleting the .svn folder in the bin debug directory and hence svn is showing obstructed error

2460951
downcasting	upcasting
i feel that also using collections.checkedset and friends are not needed since it is statically certain that the returned collection only contains someclass objects this would not be the case when downcasting instead of upcasting but that s not what i m doing

2460967
post	put
this is to have a clean start - in case people put additional thigns in with a post build event script

2460991
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
my code starts with mousedown and then records all points on mousemove until it receives a mouseup event which then calls recognizer.recognize on a stroke generated from all these points typically in the range of 100 points or so

2460993
oledb	openrowset
what is significance of openrowset property of oledb destination control in ssis

2460996
superclass	subclassing
now imagine that someone has your returned collection - and they try to insert a different subclassing of superclass someotherclass

2460997
post	get
that s a completely different thing than what session_start does creating a session or resuming the current one based on a session identifier passed via a get or post request or passed via a cookie

2461013
folder	directory
install directions that include linking alaising public_html mymodule to a sub directory in your module folder is about the simplest it gets

2461017
ubuntu	linux
back home tested on linux ubuntu - lucid lynx - both with openjdk and sun-java from distribution repo and it works i used the .class file compiled on windows

2461057
put	get
but if you put an alert in between you get the result because the ajax call returns a result and assigns x in the time delay

2461098
ocl	uml
ocl and uml 2.2 demo in french language 3mn

2461098
sysml	uml
the interesting point of this demo is that using a single model for the entire project allows to be flexible enough to extend traditional uml and avoid sysml bpmn dsl additionals models because all information is built on the top of the uml 2.2 metamodel

2461179
rss	feed
out-of-the-box for node creation from rss feed

2461179
implements	extends
if as it sounds you have some control over the way the sharepoint data gets exposed you should be able to use feedapi successfully without any modifications at all but maybe you ll need to implements your own parser extension again check the additional modules already written to extends feedapi for examples if not solutions

2461249
tabcontrol	tabitem
it works on the first tabitem of my tabcontrol but not on the second

2461272
atoi	atof
atoi atof

2461307
hide	show
this allows you to hide show portions of the page when it gets printed

2461322
xapian	whoosh
in general is it a proper solution to do full text search like this or would you recommend using a search engine like solr whoosh or xapian

2461336
set	bag
for example i can expose an ilist from an interface and then as the implementer of a class that implements this interface i have the freedom to choose to use a sortedlist bag set or whatever collection best suites my needs

2461357
for-loop	loops
i highly recommend against playing with the for-loop counters from within loops itself

2461375
std	ostream	ostream	istream
std ostream and std istream

2461383
atoi	atof	strtol	atoi	strtol	atof
the functions atoi atof strtol

2461383
strtol	atoi
all have more or less cumbersome and non-obvious error checking involving errno strtol is way much better than atoi in any case so avoid using atoi

2461418
persistent	transient
this explains transient persistent objects

2461426
post	get
search queries should probably be gets rather than post because they are not changing anything - they are simply passing parameters to get certain information

2461435
post	get	trac	bugzilla
using a free trac or bugzilla instance to share the tasks look at the root post to get even more alternatives

2461448
mousemove	mousehover
to show the tooltip you can catch the mousehover and mousemove events

2461448
mousehover	mouseenter
note the mousehover event will only show up the first time the mouseenter a control

2461465
punctuation	words
soundex will give you a degree of confidence that two strings sound the same but you may have to do some upfront cleaning first like removing punctuation and tokenizing the string into separate words

2461469
javadb	hsqldb
use an embedded database like hsqldb h2 or derby javadb

2461472
stdout	stderr
run prg get its stdout and stderr separately

2461501
xapian	whoosh
we ve used haystack search a modular search application for django supporting many search engines solr xapian whoosh etc...

2461530
stdout	stderr
you can use the backtics to execute your external program and capture its stdout and stderr

2461530
stdout	stderr
by default the backticks discard the stderr and return only the stdout of the external program.so

2461530
stdout	stderr
will capture the stdout of the program cmd and discard stderr

2461530
stdout	stderr
to capture both stdout and stderr you can do

2461530
stdout	stderr
using the above you ll not be able to differenciate stderr from stdout

2461530
stdout	stderr
to separte stdout from stderr can redirect both to a separate file and read the files

2461552
children	parent
for each checked parent if it has zero children i delete it else i redirect to children edit view

2461552
children	parent
when there is no more child linked to the initial parent i must return to the parent delete action and continue from where i left delete the current parent whose children i just re-affected then delete the next checked parent

2461552
children	parent
my problem is how do i write the return from children edit to the parent delete

2461562
persistent	transient
or if your operation involves creating new entities you ll have to create transient ones with new and then call persistent or save see section 10.2

2461581
stdout	stderr
to capture a command s stdout stderr is unaffected

2461581
stdout	stderr
to capture a command s stderr and stdout together

2461581
stdout	stderr
to capture a command s stderr but discard its stdout ordering is important here

2461581
stdout	stderr
to exchange a command s stdout and stderr in order to capture the stderr but leave its stdout to come out the old stderr

2461581
stdout	stderr
to read both a command s stdout and its stderr separately it s easiest to redirect them separately to files and then read from those files when the program is done

2461588
primefaces	richfaces
i m using jsf 1.2 richfaces primefaces and facelets

2461615
udp	tcp
i would guess that protocoltype.ip opens a raw ip socket in other words it just squirts raw bytes onto the network as ip packets rather than going through the tcp or udp protocol layers

2461706
post	get
and since the post is triggered through javascript and the result is immediately relocated it would be no trivial matter to actually get a link to the original page

2461713
nsnull	nsstring
an nsstring pointer that contains a null pointer is not an nsnull instance it s still just a null pointer

2461719
mp3	wav
and is there a big difference if i should to it on mp3 instead of wav

2461751
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
furthermore i want to create classes that inherited from this superclass dynamically and the name of those subclassing should depend on user input

2461756
post	get
it would have to be a pretty lame popup blocker that allowed the popup to open and then translated the post to a get

2461785
addclass	removeclass
the .classname syntax is only used for selector syntax but not when checking adding removing class with hasclass addclass removeclass

2461847
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
serving files like say videos from the filesystem is something that webservers do pretty well -- you can even use something lighter like lighttpd nginx ... than the webserver used to run your application apache iis ... if needed

2461847
gif	png
store images jpg gif png in filesystem or db

2461849
fast-forward	merge
then merge on the parent branch b2 if no evolutions took place on b2 this is actually a fast-forward merge

2461900
for-loop	loops
i break the code of the for-loop without using break like i have for-loop given below.and when i is 1 or 2 or 3 or any else but if condition is true then loops will be terminated because i will be 5 if the condition is true.and so no need of break is needed there.beacause i do not want to use break .i have done like this here.it works

2461900
for-loop	loops
like in the above for-loop i have initialize i to 5 when condition is true.in the foreach loops anything like that to do to avoid break

2461958
hash	md5
i like to store a md5 hash of a file which makes detecting duplicates easy

2461975
width	height
finally the width and height of the display object can be retreived and set by getting the child of the rotation wrapper and accessing the display object directly

2461975
width	height
should i maybe use matrixes if so how would you keep a static width height after rotation

2461992
post	get
if you get post with code description then issue could be with your test code

2462048
uiview	subviews
have a large uiview containing whole area so its frame is 5000x5000 as a uiscrollview s subviews

2462080

look for .htaccess files note files in parent directories affect all children and check the httpd.conf httpd-vhosts.conf and other log files for any rewriterule settings

2462180
hide	show
the way you have your show hide statements written is a little weird

2462184
int	chars
to be specific what extension means code points which are equal as int designate the same chars

2462199
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome and firefox but in ie it doesn t

2462288
ubuntu	debian
first you need git and a compiler here is how you install them on debian ubuntu this depends on your package manager

2462332
width	height
the wrapper doesn t force new lines which is good and it takes on the width and height of its contents

2462352
terminate	timeout
as you can see i already set a timeout and was hoping the code would just terminate after the timeout time has expired

2462369
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this attribute is standardized in html5 and it s already works on nearly all recent browsers firefox opera safari ie8 google-chrome

2462394
phpunit	simpletest
unit testing with phpunit or simpletest

2462435
pop-up	dialog

the problem is that on the mac in firefox camino and google-chrome when i scroll down such that the quicktime player is no longer visible any method calls on the quicktime movie no longer work

2462640
hide	show
basically the code allows me to click on an image and hide show a div while changing a list of elements such as class id name

2462669
typemock	moles
only typemock isolator and perhaps moles can perform these stunts

2462671
int	chars
the usual way to deal with this is if you re going to cast a chars to int cast it through unsigned chars first

2462685
aptana	radrails
for ror i have aptana radrails installed

2462719
cvs	svn
i see that svn handles tagging differently then cvs

2462788
int	chars
however try to use an unsigned int to hold this value for all practical purposes it never makes sense to use a signed type to hold chars values ever if you are going to print them pass around

2462790
post	get
you need to aggregate the post by user using group by u.user_id get a count value for the number of post and order by that number in descending order

2462810
for-loop	arrays
thus the way the operator works in a for-loop iterating through an arrays

2462813
hide	show
also since you are using .net there is an ajax control toolkit extender the hovermenuextender that show or hide a panel when mousing over out that you can easily use to set this up

2462850
children	parent
my sql query is only returning the children of the parent i need it to return the parent as well

2462877
maven	pom.xml
the most up-to-date version clearly states how to configure eclipse project from within maven pom.xml by specifying project s nature and builders

2462887
hide	show
that second solution is darn close to workable except that i actually am looking for show hide behavior out of my flag so i d want a less intrusive thing to change that will make ie refresh the styles

2462896
invokerequired	begininvoke
edit personally i probably wouldn t bother testing invokerequired first - i d just call invoke or begininvoke

2462947
folder	directory
in iis under your root application select your folder which has own web.cofig with httpmodules defined right click and select property on directory tab click on create button

2462998
ceil	sqrt
given n objects the size of the resulting square is ceil sqrt n with special shortcut cases for n 0 don t draw anything or n 1 just a 1x1 square

2463002
inherited	properties
for each statements are complicated because they enumerate inherited prototype properties

2463005
integer	unsigned
this converts the value cst_iec into a 32-bit unsigned integer

2463093
width	height
even if your data isn t really tabular data then you still don t need to use that horrid mess of tags you only need one for each box four tags in total with a width optional height and float left applied

2463108
versioning	upgrade
we have a problem in our swing based application since we ve upgrade our java versioning from 6u5 to 6u18 the application runs over winxp

2463203
min	max
i have set my java min max heap size to be the same as outlined in the sun docs for precise heap sizing using the following

2463224
datediff	difference
datediff can return the difference in days between two dates

2463249
width	height
from my personal experience the only situation where putting certain base styles on both html and body is necessary is when you re doing some funky hacks that rely on 100 width or height sticky divs or some such

2463285
migrate	upgrade
my team would like to migrate our .net 3.5 app to the .net 4.0 framework but the company is not ready to upgrade tfs to tfs 2010

2463313
unix	solaris
what are the chances of linux unix solaris osx etc

2463330
bazaar	git
you might wanna try bazaar or mercurial if you find git doesn t work very well in your environment

2463346
width	height
everything else i need to keep track of maps very easily to your typical control properties position height width etc.

2463385
folder	directory
sometimes this directory is massive with lots of generated folder and files

2463390
button	checkbox
i am developing a page on windows vista but when i view it from a windows xp machine it looks different like the button checkbox etc

2463395
vb.net	vb6
iâ m having some problem to convert my vb6 project to vb.net

2463404
button	checkbox
if you use standard widgets like button and checkbox etc

2463413
firefox	safari
firefox safari etc implement this as a native object

2463430
button	checkbox
the default appearance of form elements such as button and checkbox is dictated by the os

2463452
folder	directory
but it does weird stuff for directory - normal folder have unknown file type white paper icons recycle bin has vlc icon etc

2463452
folder	directory
i understand that base icon for directory would now be the one of unknown file but why do some folder have totally strange icon

2463455
facebook	fbconnect
in the fbconnect folder in your xcode project you should have a fbdialog.m with a initwithsession fbsession session in there you should find everything about the facebook login and logout buttons including the .png images that they point to

2463464
disk	ram
mysql is working with this table on disk not ram because of the mediumtext right

2463508
postgresql	mysql
that seems to work fine for mysql but postgresql flips out on it

2463525
put	get
that having been said for the featured businesses the easiest way to do it is to put a featured field on the business table and get your list of featured businesses by querying for

2463574
draggable	droppable
i am using the scriptaculous draggable droppable scripts and have a problem when dragging into a scrolling div

2463574
draggable	droppable
i have another div with draggable items while all of the img elements are droppable

2463574
draggable	droppable
even if i set the scroll attribute when creating the draggable items it will scroll the grid div but not use the proper droppable item

2463574
draggable	droppable
is there any way to make the draggable items drop onto the proper droppable element regardless of if the containing div is scrolled or not

2463576
children	parent
the sql returns parent and children for each parent i need the child to nest in a list

2463609
accessor	properties
finally i created an interface iggy that contained the accessor to the common properties

2463640
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that this is only possible in ie - firefox and google-chrome natively prevent text from being entered into upload input fields

2463728
vb.net	vb6
likely the problem is that you ve defined it here as a long which in vb6 is a 32-bit value but in vb.net is a 64-bit value

2463758
versioning	upgrade
and you should also have a story for upgrade scenarios perhaps using an application metadata versioning upgrad e step

2463793
vb.net	vb6
the length of integers and longs is different in vb6 than in vb.net

2463815
post	get
you can also check out this blog post which will show you how to dot source inside of the api and how to use this api to get at the other data streams in powershell

2463828
free	malloc
i just started out with c and have very little knowledge about performance issues with malloc and free

2463828
free	malloc
my question is this if i were to call malloc followed by free inside a while loop that loops for say 20 iterations would it run slower compared to calling free outside the loop

2463832
int	double
you are taking a long double which is a floating point format and printing it with ld which is an int format

2463841
linefeed	delimiter
also the terminated is the cr linefeed that typical text files are delimiter per row

2463856
free	malloc
it depends on the implementation of malloc and free

2463867
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
first i can assume that all urls that end with jpeg jpg bmp png or gif are images and others aren t

2463870
free	malloc
but remember you need to balance the number of malloc and free otherwise you get a memory leak.

2463889
free	malloc
certainly malloc ing and free ing at every iteration is a waste of resources since you can happily re-use the buffer

2463891
free	malloc
for 20 iterations you shouldn t be worrying about the performance of malloc free

2463891
free	malloc
even if you were to move the malloc free outside the loop using a maximum buffer as suggested by justin you shouldn t need to explicitly clear the buffer

2463896
free	malloc
you can t call free outside the loop if you are calling malloc inside

2463896
free	malloc
you will have malloc ed num_files times but only free once - you leaked the memory from all but the last

2463896
realloc	malloc
there are two main choices - malloc before the loop or just use an array if you know a size that will work for everything or use realloc

2463939
tapestry	wicket
as cletus said frameworks like tapestry ex wicket ex and others have some sort of client validation that uses javascript to validate forms etc

2463939
jstl	taglib
you can write your own validation jstl taglib maybe with the help of a js library jquery ... and plugins like jquery validation plugin

2463956
onresume	onpause
of course when the activity is still active no notification should be posted so you should mention to your service when your activity is active in onresume and when not in onpause if it s active the service could let your activity start the correct activity

2464008
postgresql	mysql
edit the following tags were removed mysql postgresql to make room for other more representative tags

2464015
ubuntu	linux
it s running on a linux ubuntu server with php 5.2.6

2464040
ends-with	substr
you can use a combination of substr and string-length both of which are in xpath 1.0 to simulate ends-with

2464064
freebsd	linux
it definitely relies on the underlying os for notifications on linux freebsd and mac os and i think windows

2464069
int	double
to check for #n a the cell would be an int data type not a double

2464082
vpn	lan
i would only entertain the second two options both look do-able if your users are remote off lan vpn

2464112
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox google-chrome and safari however the effect doesn t appear to work at all in any internet explorer

2464162
google-chrome	firefox
i ve got an app that s working pretty flawlessly in google-chrome and firefox however when i view it in ie all is well until i click on a header element to activate it jquery accordion

2464178
return-value-optimization	nrvo
the c++ standard gives permission for the compiler to elide the unnecessary copy in this case it s called the named return-value-optimization usually abbreviated to nrvo

2464178
return-value-optimization	nrvo
nearly all reasonably recent c++ compilers implement both nrvo and return-value-optimization so generally speaking you can ignore the fact that this construct wouldn t otherwise be particularly efficient

2464181
execl	fork
fork + execl or exec variants which is essentially how system is implemented

2464240
google-chrome	safari
in safari desktop as well as mobile and google-chrome the h264-compressed test.mp4 file will be played

2464258
accessor	properties
you can create your own accessor and properties for example

2464277
public	protected
package protected class makes sense - it is visible to the classes inside the package and not really for public consumption

2464311
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in fact apple s documentation strictly says not to subclass either uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller

2464337
superclass	subclassing
the field in the subclassing will hide the field in the superclass but both exists

2464341
submit	submission
1 when submission a form i use formviews almost exclusively if that helps if potentially dangerous characters are detected automatically strip them out and submit

2464464
hide	show
it will show fire an asynchronous request and then immediately hide

2464480
folder	directory
say for example i have a folder called pages which holds all my pages can i deny access to someone if they type in www.website.com pages so that they can t see the directory

2464535
prepare	execute
however if i prepare and execute a statement in php

2464541
getter	setter
in this pattern the class s data are all static but the getter setter are non-static

2464701
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome everything is ok but in ie 8 in my case when i select a state the cities dropdown isn t loaded

2464710
clistctrl	cdialog
i found that in some such as headers in clistctrls or cpropertysheets don t need you to call setmaxtipwidth every time as mentioned above but others cview cdialog cpropertypage clistctrl ctreectrl do require you to call it every time the tooltip is going to pop up

2464733
ganglia	metrics
metrics subsystem to files or ganglia

2464768
hide	show
i want to use variables in jquery to hide show divs

2464870
width	height
i can t get it by modifying the width and height properties on the .js file as described on the site

2464878
int	chars
here i have used int and not chars for variable s now for using s for chars conversion safely i have to make it chars again because when scanf reads a chars it only overwrites one byte of the variable it is assigning it to and not all four that int has

2464890
glut	sdl
so when you create your window with glut sdl or wgl or whatever you have to specify the size

2464915
int	chars
the argument to scanf is a pointer to int and scanf is expecting a pointer to chars

2464915
put	get	int	chars
the two data type int and chars have different sizes at least on most architectures so the data may get put in the wrong spot in memeory and the other part of s may not get properly cleared

2464915
int	chars
the answers suggesting manipulation of the result after using a pointer to int rely on unspecified behavior that scanf will put the chars value it has in the least significant byte of the int you re pointing to and are not safe

2464923
int	chars
the c format calls for a chars you ve passed it an int which will roughly speaking be reinterpreted

2464923
int	chars
even assuming that the pointer value is still good after reinterpreting storing an arbitrary chars to the first byte of an int and then reading it back as int is undefined behaviour

2464923
int	chars
writing converts the value from int to chars and then back to int again

2464923
int	chars
and then either or according to whether you want negative-valued chars to result in a negative int or a positive int up to 255 assuming 8-bit chars

2464934
google-chrome	firefox
i am using pagination and the results show fine in ie but disappear in google-chrome and firefox when advancing forward from page 1

2464975
ssms	sqlcmd
ssms can be made to do this by checking the option open query widows in sqlcmd mode

2464983
codeigniter	cakephp
it is not my goal to create a second cakephp or codeigniter and i m also not planning to build my websites with any of the available frameworks as i prefer to use things i ve created myself in general

2465032
children	parent
the problem with using node.children to obtain the children and then move the children to the font node s parent node is that none of the children nodes include the text found within the font node

2465037
memcached	apc
you should use pdo which already provides a lot of power and if that s not enough you can extend that possibly with your own functions such as checking for hits on memcached apc before actually querying the database

2465037
implements	extends
you can also extends the class to implements your own sql functions like

2465203
cifs	smb
we did extensive trials with the source stored on a smb cifs mounted disk in the enterprise software company where i work and the conclusion was that it is not possible to tweak this to any acceptable performance since cifs performance for handling big amounts of small files is so poor

2465206
post	put
-- i put -- to be able to post the hyperlink and from other links but still the same problem

2465210
firefox	safari
this is for using in safari though it could probably be used on firefox as well

2465210
opera	google-chrome
in google-chrome you have to add a plugin anyway which generally allow for custom css per domain and opera already allows this to be done without needing any css

2465216
solaris	aix
will it work on hp-ux aix and solaris out of the box

2465239
children	parent
you need to preserve the children then append them to the parent node

2465253
folder	directory
so from the iis on the server create a ftp site and point the root directory to the folder that you want to upload or download and manually change the username and password mine username administrator password sweet123 from the properties of the site if necessary

google-chrome	safari
is there a way to get this functionality with the debugger tool in safari google-chrome

2465281
post	get
if you get a response make sure you post it back here

2465286
put	get
or put extern c before the declaration in your c++ code so the name doesn t get mangled

2465320
inherited	properties
if you re willing to code for each inherited properties there aren t very many of them it can be much simpler

2465370
rss	feed
i know the uiwebview is loading content properly because if you hard code say into the nsurl then it loads fine however when i m passing the url that i parsed from an rss feed back from the uitableview it won t load the url properly

2465465
flac	ogg
if you re open to other digital audio formats i would recommend looking at ogg vorbis or flac

2465473
disk	ram
more ram means less disk access

2465517
put	get
now i need to get all the non-null values from temp and put it in info

2465533
dictionary	map
the reason is that without having used dictionary 1 before the call to causes the internal map to create the data that does not exist even if the only thing i wanted was to do some debugging output which of course is a fatal application error

2465542
xpand	xtend
use oaw tools xtend xpand for model transformation and code generation

2465548
post	get
the problem appears to be when i get the form post back the validator seems to not know about the validation rule i set up for the free agent drop down

2465555
strdup	malloc	strcpy	strdup	strcpy	malloc
to solve this problem you can duplicate the strings in graphinsertv using malloc + strcpy or by using the non-standard strdup

2465632
firefox	safari
as tom said firebug will do the same thing in firefox and safari has a similar option that i can t remember off hand what it s called

2465706
feedback	review
is there a place where people can share their designs and others can browse search through the catalog to review and provide feedback on them

2465754
vim	emacs
caveat that i am a windows guy with no emacs or vim skills so leveraging that was not an option

2465756
content-disposition	content-type
first of all content-disposition is set as attachment so this is good but i can t seem to get around content-type

2465794
spaces	delimiter
just to make things clear i hope i am trying to match a constant length starting delimiter followed by the shortest string that allows a match and does not contain the starting delimiter followed by a spaces followed by an equals sign followed by the shortest string that allows a match that ends with the ending delimiter

2465799
junit	testng
i am using testng but you can show in junit if you want

2470363
metaphone	soundex
to come with more complicated spell checkings where there may be errors then you need something to come up with candidates words that may be correct but mispelled like say using the soundex metaphone or double metaphone algos and then use things like the levenhstein edit-distance algorithm to check candidates versus known good words or the much more complicated tree made of levenhstein edit-distance that google use for its find as you type

2470874
unixodbc	iodbc
the sqlgetprivateprofilestring function which is typically used by the odbc administrator for reading such information is probably the best one to use as this would be os independent and implemented by most odbc driver managers on none windows platforms like iodbc unixodbc etc

2471142
equals	tostring
for the s if i have tried tostring and also the equals

2471148
put	get
so i am getting off on a tangent use the put get to talk to registers you have to use the trm and the arm arm to place the interrupt handler code somewhere you have to enable the interrupt most likely in more than one place in the arm as well as in the peripheral

2471148
put	get
so now you take your test program that can run on the arm if compiled that way and instead compile it on the lost linking it to the put get whatever abstraction layer

2471148
put	get
if you use some sort of abstraction like my put get you can write your peripheral code one time in one file linking it different ways that one file program function can be used with the perhipheral only in simulation for quickly developing your code then run with the arm in place in simulation adding the complexity of the arm exceptions and arm interrupt system and later on the real chip as you were running on the simulated chip

2471150
implements	extends
since dude already implements the interface as well we could have the plugins extends dude but that would be conceptually wrong because extends creates an is-a relationship but a plugin is not a dude

2471272
width	height
i would use a calculation where you get the width in pixels divided by the square width and then the height divided by the square height

2471272
width	height
then you can find a way to change the resolution to the result or grab the color of every pixel at position height and width 2 of the square your looking for

2471839
config	ini
earlier i was using multiple ini files but now i plan to go for single xml file which will be containing all config details of the project

2471839
config	ini
problem is if somebody wants config file in ini or db or anything else and not the default one in this case xml my code should handle that part

2471839
config	ini
if somebody wants to go for other config option like ini he will have to create ini file similar to my xml config file and my config manager should take care everything like parsing storing in cache

2471839
config	ini
for that i need a mechanism lets say proper interface for my config data where the underlying data store can be anything xml db ini etc also i don t want it to be dependent on these underlying store and anytime in future this should be extensible to other file formats

most people have upgraded to firefox 3+ by now and webkit browsers safari google-chrome etc have had it implemented for awhile and even ie5.5+ supports font-face

2472000
profiler	yourkit
i would suggest using a profiler like yourkit homepage so that you can easily find what is allocating so much memory

2472004
cvs	svn
we integrate the google adt plugins into the eclipse core along with cvs svn and mylyn

2472004
ubuntu	linux
linux support is tested on ubuntu and fedora but it may or may not work on others

uiview	subviews
i have a custom uiviewcontroller which is the only subviews of uiview

2472126
equals	gethashcode
equals nor gethashcode has been overridden at this point

2472145
uiview	subviews
i d like to be able to create my own container subclasses of uiview which can react first to touches before their subviews

2472161
equals	gethashcode
you haven t shown any thing about paymenttypeinfo - does it override equals and gethashcode appropriately

2472161
equals	gethashcode
either make paymenttypeinfo override equals and gethashcode or pass an appropriate into the contains method

2472161
equals	gethashcode
as slaks mentions in the comments in this case gethashcode won t actually get called - but you should always override both equals and gethashcode or neither of them

2472189

2472251
bazaar	git
so why are dvcs such as git mercurial and bazaar better than subversion at branching and merging

2472251
pull	push
there are no virtual directories by design and branches are hard objects in dvcs which it needs to be such in order to work simply with synchronization of repositories push and pull

2472251
bazaar	git
the first thing you do when you work with a dvcs is to clone repositories git s clone hg s clone and bazaar s branch

2472251
fast-forward	merge
what later needs to be done is to push in those changes again to origin which will result into a fast-forward merge since the merge commit is a direct descendant of the latest in the origin repository

2472251
bazaar	git
since i don t want this answer to be any more verbose i ll let you read the git mercurial or bazaar docs about that instead

2472251
bazaar	git
there is also the issue of sending patches between each developer that was a huge problem in subversion which is mitigated in git hg and bazaar by uniquely identifiable revisions

2472263
width	height
as stated in the docs the height_field and width_field are names of fields where to store the original image s height and width -- not to coerce the image to a certain size

2472344
width	height
in regards to the bounds below i verified the bounds being used by the code are basically the height and width of the entire screen area less the status bar

2472348
sudo	passwd
sudo attempts to open the terminal device tty to read the passwd

2472348

csv	tsv
what s the easiest fastest way to grab data out of a yui datatable and turn it into a single csv or tsv string

2472439
sudoers	visudo
what i had to do is add to my etc sudoers file using sudo visudo obviously

2472439
sudo	passwd
eval-ing shell-command sudo etc init.d apache2 restart now prompts me for a passwd instead of trying to guess it unsuccessfully

2472501
put	get
has anyone successfully put nservicebus onto a clustered server if so how did you get it working

2472523

hide	show
you could certainly use the buttons that you want in your menu to show and hide a uitableview

2472600
squash	merge
i do not use squash to flatten commits but i rebase to avoid the extra merge commits

2472624

2472707
komodo	aptana
i use komodo edit or aptana

2472915
subtraction	addition
please note i m not asking someone to do the whole thing for me as i want to learn and i m confident i can do the rest including addition subtraction etc

2473017
ready	each
then during development rather than updating the build configuration as each component becomes implemented the build itself could determine if a subproject is ready for inclusion yet perhaps it tries to grab the code compile it and run a pre-determined test suite

2473041
width	height
im thinking i somehow need to figure out when the added width of the divs is at the full page width and set equal height on those

2473049
inherited	properties
it is quite simple to write your own trivialtextblock control which has a string parameter and simply draws it using the inherited textelement properties such as fontsize fontweight etc

2473073
post	get
what am i supposed to get from the fact that one is called send and one is called post

2473085
width	height
my question is how do you implement percentage width height in the measure method of your custom component

2473088
min	max
however the next problem is that this general purpose routine should be computing max min mean variance etc

2473109
width	height
google maps default icons are 20px width and 34px height so you could use something like this to emulate

2473113
cpu	processors
if is your range then if you could generate 10 10 random numbers per second if you have a 3 ghz processors and about 4 cores on which you generate one random number per cpu cycle - which is imposible and ruby will even slow it down a lot then it would take about 10 180 years to exhaust all the numbers

2473171
google-chrome	firefox
the same example tested in ie8 firefox and google-chrome behaves exactly as expected

2473182
cells	tablecell

2473205
innodb	myisam
are your tables myisam or innodb

2473238
put	get
here is a link to get you started on streaming or better yet just don t use images more than 30kb or so else put them on the filesystem not in tables

2473252
children	parent
the relatively positioned #panel parent doesn t have layout and hence ie forgets to redraw its children when it get resized repositioned

implements	extends
i find it helpful to at a glance and know which what the interfaces classes are which ones extends implements each other especially when i m attending a design review for someone else

2473296
comparator	icomparer
another way is to create a class that implements icomparer then there is an overload to pass in the comparator class

2473300
qlist	qdatastream
ideally i would be able to write a qlist to a qdatastream but i m not exactly sure how to go about doing this

2473312
ienumerable	iqueryable
one option i tried is to just make iadapter return ienumerable or iqueryable but the problem there is that i then do not have access to the methods itable provides insertonsubmit

2473323
rss	feed
i am using the nsxmlparser to get new rss stories from a feed and am displaying them in a uitableview

2473329

2473558
client-side	server-side
second if the server-side code is only used to retrieve data from a database and to save results after client-side computation then the app server will very likely not be the bottleneck the database will

2473603
post	get
nice input validation system with strict validation being the default and not only for get post but all other inputs like headers files and cookies as well

2473603
cakephp	kohana
a bit short on documentation but it has the only true mvc implementation in comparison to kohana cakephp zend and all those other frameworks...just have a look at it and ask questions on irc or the user mailing list

2473623
post	get
assuming that the markup looks exactly like you showed in your post you could just strip the tags out like this run this on the email field after you get it from your db

2473624
google-chrome	firefox
most things that work in ie will render correctly in firefox and google-chrome

2473628
int	double
when i try to use a static_cast to cast a double to an int i get the following error

2473628
int	double
i understand that there would be problems converting between a double and an int but why is there a problem converting between a double and an int

2473647
int	double
unless you want take a int -level look at a double

2473654
int	double
you can convert between a double and an int with but not between pointers to different types

2473662
int	double
that having been said if you really want to interpret your double as an int will work fine

2473683

2473785
hash	md5
anyway you should just use a bigger hash - find an md5 function - if you re actually hashing something or a uuid generator with more than 4 characters and yes you could use a while loop but just generate a big enough one so that conflicts are incredibly unlikely

2473829
vbscript	jscript
i have been asked dozens of times over the years for my list of tips and tricks that people can use to optimize their vbscript their jscript their active server pages their vb their c# code

i m using python s max and min functions on lists for a minimax algorithm and i need the index of the value returned by max or min

2474015
min	max
in other words i need to know which move produced the max at a first player s turn or min second player value

2474015
min	max
i need to be able to return the actual index of the min or max value not just the value

2474040
queue	fifo
if you want to limit the array s length use a function in which you check the length and optionally remove the oldest element as you append a new one this is in principle a fifo queue

2474082
implements	extends
if you have document based application and a view that you want to dump to printer then in our mydocument or whatever you call it that extends nsdocument you would implements

2474092
versioning	upgrade
in that case then you would be well advised to upgrade to the latest versioning

2474095
versioning	upgrade
the only time you should update immediately is when the versioning of the framework you rely upon is out of your control and the client is likely to do the upgrade

2474109

heroku	engineyard
i would highly recommend checking out both heroku and engineyard s cloud-based offerings

2474156
hiphop	xcache
let me clear up a misconception you might have about hiphop and xcache

2474156
hiphop	xcache
xcache works by adding opcode caching to zend s php implementation like apc and friends while facebook s hiphop allows for php code to be transformed into c++ code and then compiled using g++

2474156
hiphop	xcache
it s not possible to run xcache with hiphop as hiphop doesn t depend on zend interpreter and doesn t even use php opcodes as it s compiled to bytecode after transformed to c++

2474205
postgresql	mysql
inserting into the database - use the mysqldb library for python i use postgresql mostly from ruby and java so i m not fully hip to the latest python mysql libraries

2474238
min	max
you can find the min max index and value at the same time if you enumerate the items in the list but perform min max on the original values of the list

2474238
min	max
this way the list will only be traversed once for min or max

2474277
serializable	deserialization
if you have a schema you can use the xsd.exe tool from visual studio to automatically make classes and use built in .net xml serializable deserialization

2474287
svg	vml
it s cross-browser because it uses vml in ie and svg in other browsers

2474296
allocator	stl
as other have suggested though the stl library has some much nicer less easy to do something stupid with memory allocator collections in it you can use

2474310
put	get
i put a login box alone with a keyword search box in 404.html in a django project so in case a 404 error is raised visitors get more options to jump to other parts

2474334
int	double
you declare var i as an int and then try to nslog it at as double value without a cast

2474351
width	height
my goal is to make a layout that is 200 width and height with four containers of equal height and width 100 each using no javascript as the bear minimum or preferably no hacks

2474351
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in safari 4 firefox 3.5 and google-chrome 5

2474358
isapi	httpmodule
so iis7 in integrated pipeline mode uses a isapifiltermodule to shim isapi filter dll s and fire off the correct events on the filters which is quite different than previous versions of iis or iis7 in classic mode because this means that httpmodule fire off right along side isapi filters in integrated pipeline mode

2474358
isapi	httpmodule
so does anyone happen to know how isapi events and the httpmodule events line up

2474392
width	height
it s a variant of drawroundrect but with 8 parameters the final four being the diameter of each corner x y width height top left top right bottom left bottom right

2474405
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox 3.6 google-chrome 4 and ie 8 compat

2474406

2474572
caliburn	prism
are there any sample applications avaliable that make use of both caliburn and prism

2474622
int	boolean
anyways i was working though it some more tonight and i realized that i may be completely wrong about my assumption on garbage collection and primitive types int boolean float are these primitive type variables that i create in a 10 line function that gets called 20

2474622
int	boolean
so to rephrase my question are primitive types int float boolean etc included when seeing this message

2474643
jobs	cron
the query cache isn t nearly as important as you might think particularly during off-peak periods which i assume is when you would run the cron jobs

2474646
vbscript	vb6
vb6 vbscript etc you can set it up via odbc and have the username password there

2474666

however this isn t working that well with my vsto excel add-in projects when i create a separate unit test project and go to add reference projects there is no project to pick

2474715
apache	lighttpd
in lighttpd i know there is a global etc lighttpd.conf file but is there something local like the apache htaccess file

2474726
jobs	cron
i m using a method outline by gregor create cronjob with zend framework to create command line execution for parts of my application such as cron jobs admin tasks and the like

2474733
x86	64bit
i am not sure why the 64bit debugging is not working but if you switch to an x86 configuration instead of x64 or anycpu apparently it works for you as per comments attached to question

2474744
public	protected
in the end it really boils down to a much simpler question though what would public protected partial methods add that you can t already accomplish with abstract methods

2474744
public	protected
there isn t really any use for a public or protected partial method other than to confuse the compiler and the poor bastard trying to make sense of it all

2474744
public	protected
so instead of opening up that pandora s box the team said forget it - public protected partial methods aren t much use anyway so just make them private

2474820
gif	png
i ve trying png gif and jpg formats none of them work

2474829
viewdidload	viewwillappear
a better method though is to create properties on the view controller that you set and then either in viewdidload or in viewwillappear you use those properties to set values for your outlets

2474874
int	chars
a mapping from an abstract chars repertoire to a set of nonnegative int

2474928
width	height
use getwindowrect to get the width and height to pass to movewindow

2474962
post	get
also unless specified request is get by default your url suggests it is expecting post data type post

2475006
google-chrome	firefox
it s working fine in ie and firefox i can visit mydomain news but in google-chrome it still redirects to cakephp app folder

2475027
google-chrome	safari
it uses browser detection that specifies safari jquery.browser.safari when it should be jquery.browser.webkit which both safari and google-chrome use

2475034
serializable	deserialization
accessing your data from an asp.net application over web-services would just cause you to incur the serializable deserialization penalty for pretty much no gain

2475076
google-chrome	firefox
2 the image on the right seems to have blue border on firefox ie but google-chrome displays the

2475138
int	chars
int main int chars caught exception from int foo bar int

int	chars
int main int chars caught exception from foo foo

2475141
jobs	cron
you can t run cron jobs from within php

2475141

i m trying to learn how to use actionscript over mxml for flexibility

2475201
actionscript	mxml
i have this simple block of mxml that i m trying to convert to actionscript but i m stuck half way though

2475211
caliburn	prism
however if you look in caliburn s samples you will find a basic sample configured to use prism with caliburn

2475218
actionscript	mxml
the properties in mxml are just dot properties in actionscript and the values are what s next so it s not too bad

2475222
atomic	interlocked
does interlocked guarantee visibility of the atomic operation to all threads or do i still have to use the volatile keyword on the value in order to guarantee visibility of the change

2475232
google-chrome	safari
this worked out fine in google-chrome and safari

2475372
pull	push
now i m just wondering how on earth i should go about to pull and push between the default and the dev repositories

int	double
when you do an operation on floats or int that could potentially benefit from more precision the type is promoted to a double

2475565
mouse	keyboard
actually at first i wanted to rebuilt everything too but i thought i have to build the caret fonctionnalities the selection brush manage a lot of different events like selection with mouse or keyboard deletion copy cut paste etc etc.

2475572
move	drag
to move a rectangle around as the user drag the mouse you have to handle mouse move events

2475785
opera	google-chrome
with opera and google-chrome after i plug the cable back in the video continues to load

2475785
firefox	safari
but with safari and firefox it never does

2475785
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
using wireshark to look at the traffic i found that opera and google-chrome simply ack the first packet from youtube after the cable has been plugged back in but safari and firefox set the rst flag 0x4 in the tcp header and no more traffic follows

2475785
firefox	safari
so it seems that if safari and firefox sees a multicast connection close and then later see data on that same connection they will send a rst

2475813
min	max
i need to know the difference between the max date and the min date

2475813
min	max
and the max time and the min time

2475843

2475860
profiling	instrumentation
simply choose product- profiling from xcode and look for these profiling once instrumentation launches

2475865
squash	branch	squash	merge
the other feature i like which influence merge is the ability to squash commits in a branch not yet pushed to another repo in order to present

2475873

put	get
first i put all their project types in a single array so it s easier to loop through but by the time i ask the last nested project for its employee members i get an unrecognized selector error

2475994
getter	setter
to make things easier you can use objective-c properties that allow you to automatically generate setter getter methods with desired memory management behavior

2476005
implements	extends
i ve implements an interface which should notify the activity but the problem is that the listener is always null since the broadcast from the process is done via intent hence the class that extends broadcastreceiver will be newly instantiated

2476012
jruby	mri
i don t know how different the performance might be on jruby but in mri i believe that marshal is usually fastest

2476071
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
i implemented nsurlconnection using nsoperationqueue

2476105
children	parent
layout children figure every time bounds are changed for the parent in parent layout method

2476105
swt	swing
note that question is about eclipse gef not bare swt jface or swing

2476120
getter	setter
but i don t see a way to do this for the setter and getter of a c# property because neither of them provides this collection where you add the attributes

2476201
hide	show
it is beside the hide show comments button

2476228
pull	push
so you put a copy of the tree on some central server somewhere that other people can pull from or on your private server so you have a backup and when you feel like it you push some bits across to there

2476241
width	height
for fixed width layouts fixed width stretchable height you ll need three divs and three images

2476241
width	height
for a fluid width layout stretchable width and height you ll need nine divs and nine images

2476243
disk	ram
if so just throw in some more ram or get a faster disk array.

2476245
profiling	debugging
a rich xml editor with support for diverse types of validation xslt debugging and profiling and all the other extra bits that make it more than just a text editor with syntax highlighting

2476248
caliburn	prism
what are the advantages of caliburn over prism

2476303
put	get
however i can t get it to work the event handlers for the individual icons work perfectly and the event handler for the add-them-all button does give me an alert if i put that in

2476310
viewdidload	viewdidappear
so that means that the uitoolbar is ready to retrieve it s buttons on viewdidappear and not on viewdidload message

2476317
keydown	keyup
then you can work with the keyup keydown event and fire a custom postback yourself

2476318
floating-point	integer
beware if val is an integer type rather than a floating-point type then dividing by 100 will lose the two least significant digits

2476319
inherited	properties
here you use the inherited for it s mechanical properties automatic registering of new instances but to achieve the same purpose it would be as easy to make objects says missile derive from some managedobject common class and make it add new instances to some unique global objects managing list of instances or do it without inherited by overriding default new and delete for missiles

2476345
mouseleave	mouseenter
you might go for mouseenter mouseleave

hide	show
then i want to show a page with custom progress bar on login request and hide the page when i get back the response

2476456
pull	push
most projects do have a central repository but each repository is equal in the sense that they have the full history and can push and pull patches between each other

2476456
pull	push
each repository is self-contained and complete and can push and or pull changes from any other

2476456
pull	push
both systems are acting as peers and they push and pull changesets between each other

2476467
post	get
change get to post

2476480
post	get
post back if you can t get it working

i wana ask is there a pssibilty to hide the record if order_date year in 2009 and show only the records where order_date year in 2010

2476528
public	protected
i set this class property as protected which mean i don t want the user of my class access this property directly and made a public wrapper for this property in partial class

2476569
perforce	svn
and if you just want something faster or more scalable than svn then just buy a commercial product - i ve used both perforce and rational clearcase and they scale up to huge projects without any problems

2476611
serializable	deserialization
this ended up being a problem with the serializable deserialization of the user model in the entire object graph

2476614
ord	chr
many system functions like inc dec chr ord are inlined

2476622
opera	firefox
the problem occurs in different browsers tested firefox 3.6 opera 10 ie6 so i guess it might be a dojo-problem -bug

2476657
width	height
a screen width a height of higher than 240 is likely a touch screen.

2476676
cpu	processors
in your situation you need to use the performance counter l process program_you_are_interested_in_name processors time for cpu utilization and possibly l process program_you_are_interested_in_name data bytes sec for disk operations

2476676
cpu	processors
if for example you have a concurrent program with the name a_program_name.exe you can find its cpu utilization measuring at least twice the performance counter l process a_program_name processors time

2476676
cpu	processors
by the way measuring with this test a multithreaded application running on a multicore processors might give cpu utilization which is more than 100

2476689
inherited	properties
in windowforms i would just have inherited from tabitem added some custom properties and controls and done

2476801
ord	chr
actually the chr and ord functions are only there for pascal being a strictly typed language prohibiting the use of bytes where characters are requested

2476803
rss	feed
after doing a severe search over the rss feed webpart on my sharepoint site i got the answer to my question

2476803
rss	feed
navigate to the blog site which is the source for the rss feed webpart

2476803
rss	feed
now check the rss feed webpart

2476808
ceil	floor
then ceil rows and ceil columns is a solution while floor rows and floor columns are too small to be a solution together if rows and columns are not integers

2476808
ceil	floor
floor rows ceil columns

2476808
ceil	floor
ceil rows floor columns

2476907

2477038
caliburn	prism
prism and caliburn are complimentary frameworks

2477038
caliburn	prism
caliburn really enables a lot of the things that are shortcomings when you focus on mvvm in wpf and prism allows that nice modularity among other things

2477038
caliburn	prism
caliburn has builtin prism support so you can use both

2477038
caliburn	prism
also if you download caliburn there is a sample included that demonstrates the prism integration

2477090
squash	branch
the commit from your repo could be isolated in a special branch when all kind of squash can take place in order to export a cleaner history

2477132
perforce	svn
then whatever current vcs you are using svn perforce ... will take those git commit files and will commit them in turn but with the right format

2477148
nginx	lighttpd
and setup your web-server nginx lighttpd whatever to serve directory you save images to under virtual directory images

2477169
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
fundamentally datatable and the child entities don t support inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged so they are not acting the way the data binding would like them to be

2477175
children	parent
balancing involves changing the structure of the tree by telling nodes who their children parent and siblings are via re-assigning pointers but this is an implementation detail

2477196
implements	extends
you can extends java.lang.thread or better - implements java.lang.runnable and pass arguments to the constructor of the new object

2477211
skip-lists	tree
that said a skip-lists or tree is a very likely implementation of std map so links will be updated and the relative ordering will change but the actual data is not going to be moving around

2477220
squash	branch
then set up a branch to hold your pushes back to subversion squash each release onto it and commit it back to svn

2477231
aggregate-functions	sum
all the previous examples i ve been able to find use something like sum around the case statements so i guess that is the aggregate-functions

2477249
datagridviewlinkcolumn	datagridviewbuttoncolumn
datagridviewtextboxcolumn datagridviewcheckboxcolumn datagridviewimagecolumn datagridviewbuttoncolumn datagridviewcomboboxcolumn datagridviewlinkcolumn

2477269
min	max
if you mean min max values for numeric types they are usually defined as constants on that type

2477277
portrait	landscape
i set autoresizingmask uiviewautoresizingflexiblewidth so it will adjust the cell width and the button positions properly when the application starts with the device either in landscape or portrait mode

2477298
free	malloc
in c++ you can use any mechanism you want to allocate free memory the stack malloc free new delete or any other custom implementation

2477298
free	malloc
the only requirement is that if you allocated a block of memory with one mechanism you have to free it with the same mechanism so you can t call free on a stack variable and you can t call delete on malloc ed memory

2477307
ssl	https
the https protocol is a mixture of http and ssl

2477334
sortedmap	sortedset
depending on what the collection is you can also look at sortedset or sortedmap

2477336

i use slicehost they have very straightforward instructions for installing postgresql mysql and tomcat is pretty easy to install

2477415
jquery	curvycorners
i m using the curvycorners jquery plugin to force ie to render rounded corners on divs

2477420
mouse	keyboard
it s more neat for a checkbox any control for that matter to be agnostic of the source of user input keyboard mouse etc so for this i will just make the programmatic setting of checkbox really programmatic

2477420
mouse	keyboard
using this approach your code can respond neatly to both user s mouse input and keyboard input via one event only via checkchanged

2477438
x86	64bit
for x86 this function for 64bit is implemented as

2477449

2477693
versioning	upgrade
lite versioning has a button upgrade

2477715
cvs	svn
the cvs project works since you put it under version control in svn

2477715
bazaar	git
i would suggest you look into what distributed version control systems dvcs like git mercurial or bazaar can offer you

2477715
cvs	svn
all these dvcs s come with some ways to interact with upstream cvs or svn repositories

2477722
for-loop	arrays
i trying a var_debug on compiled_tags and as soon i enter the for-loop is not an arrays anymore but an integer

width	height
how to scale down web view content to show data in small size as per webview height and width

2477757
win64	windows
when 64-bit windows arrived themathworks needed a way that people were to be able to compile the same mex-function for both win32 and win64 thus they changed the extension to .mexw32 and .mexw64 respectively

2477768
equals	gethashcode
you mention that it doesn t work and this is likely because you haven t overridden equals and gethashcode to determine value equality

2477847
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
see inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged

2477926
portrait	landscape
just detect whether the device orientation is landscape or portrait mode and define the reusablecellidentifier with a different name for each

2478323
bonjour	avahi
avahi and bonjour are basically the same thing both implementing mdns

2478364
allocator	stl
adding your own allocator to stl containers is an easy task

2478364
allocator	stl
so the idea is to build the adjacent list out of stl containers which seems possible after a quick look at the bgl documentaiton which have own allocator types

2478364
allocator	stl
allocator stl

2478364
boost	allocator
try to build the boost graph with allocator

2478364
allocator	stl
again take a look at adding your own allocator to stl containers

that way if you want to tweak the number of tabs switch to spaces add delimiter or whatever you don t have to recompile

2478394
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
if you re fixed on rolling your own then the basic process is to attach mousedown mouseup events on the parent div to initiate the dragging stuff slap a handler on mousemove to capture the motion events and adjust the parent div s scroll offsets as appropriate

2478463
gif	png
png beats gif on everything except that animations are not supported mng supports them though

so you can play with margin-left and margin-top with negative values a half of image sizes respectively width and height

2478550
post	get
i kinda didn t get your problem but i think it might be that you have to make a post request to the same url you are actually into

2478595
post	put	post	get	put	get
the problem is that most implementations will issue get for the new resource address after post or put that got 302

2478674
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
flowlayout boxlayout gridbaglayout

2478700
put	get
this will put you in a position where moving to an orm tool will be a little less arduous when you get to that point

if i have have some overloaded ostream operators defined for library local objects is its okay for them to go to std namespace

2479274
cvs	svn
my employer is considering a switch from cvs to svn but i m wondering whether i should push for mercurial or some other dvcs instead

2479274
pull	push
i think people will find it very annoying if they have to pull and push updates from a lot of different places but they will also find it annoying if they have to pull push the entire company codebase

2479297
range	max
i need an expression to match a decimal number or the string all as in a range validator that allows the word all represent the max range

2479346
apache	nginx
i m having a problem running apache + subversion with ssl behind an nginx proxy and i m hoping someone might have the answer

2479346
apache	nginx
here are the relevant parts i think of the nginx and apache config files in question

2479346
apache	nginx
from what i could tell while researching this problem the server name has to match on both the apache server as well as the nginx server which i ve done

2479349
inherited	properties
suppose i create a constructor bird and another called parrot which i make to inherited the properties of bird by assigning an instance of it to parrot s prototype like the following code shows

2479360

int	chars
try to code chars 256 and you will either get the chars with the ordinal value 0 or 1 depending on your computers internal representation of int

2479465
httphandler	httpmodule
i ve peeked at their source in this way and they accomplish the progress bar through a combination of a custom httpmodule and httphandler along with their control

2479465
httphandler	httpmodule
so in order to make this work you have to update some standardized state server-side during your file processing in the httpmodule which is transmitted back to the client via xmlhttprequest calls handled by the httphandler

2479497
stdout	stderr
one vibration the application was compiled with debugging support but it is unable to reach monodevelop on the specified ip address and port to setup stdout stderr

2479497
stdout	stderr
three vibrations could not setup stdout stderr to the application

2479499
jar	.war
we deploy our app in an .ear which contains among others the above mentioned .war file and the custom layout class in a separate jar file let s call it commons

2479499
jar	war
so my only remaining guess is that matcher is loaded by two different classloaders when it is used from the jar and the war and then attempted to pass from one to the other

2479546
cos	sin
since sin cos and tan are mathematical functions which are calculated by summing a series developers will sometimes use lookup tables to avoid the expensive calculation

2479566
wma	speex
in conversation people have suggested speex and wma for instance but i haven t found any libraries or examples that work without requiring reference to dll s that won t work in a sl4 project

2479606
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
while the quick answer is that they are more expensive than the primitive math functions addition multiplication subtraction etc... they are not -expensive- in terms of human time

2479609
subtract	add
certainly integer add and subtract will be among them

2479609
division	multiplication
depending upon the processor there may be multiplication and division as well

2479635
rss	feed
although i was passing the rss feed directly through the handler writing the read stream directly i just needed to specify the following from within the handler

2479660
jar	war
the jar needs to be added to the lib folder in war web-inf

2479709
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
on the intel x86 processor floating point addition or subtraction requires 6 clock cycles multiplication requires 8 clock cycles and division 30-44 clock cycles

2479752
valgrind	memcheck
i suggest you stop and read the valgrind quick start paying particular attention to section 4 interpreting memcheck s output and look over the faq

2479755
free	realloc
this is presumably done so that a caller can still do free on it like realloc

2479779
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
tested with firefox google-chrome ie8 and opera

2479792

i d advise debugging this in firebug for firefox or through the google-chrome javascript console

2479879
hide	show
in login i show the navigationbar hide the backbutton1 and add a new rightbutton1 then i check if settings.bundle login and pass are set

2479954
vmware	bootcamp
you could try vmware fusion or use bootcamp instead

2479954
vmware	bootcamp	parallels	bootcamp
parallels does support running a windows on a bootcamp partition - as does vmware fusion

2479966
hash	md5
maybe it s not answer to your direct question but why would t you pull image and its md5 or any other hash that can verify correctnes of this image

2479967
int	double
my suggestions would be to double check that e_id and e_type are really just native int

2479991
cassini	iis
havent tried asp.net development but i assume its going to be fine since the iis server or cassini would be hosted on the vm

2480049
post	get
post some samples of how your events are wired up and i get give a more specific example

2480078
ubuntu	linux
i am setting up a new svn server on ubuntu linux

i would like to show content from other websites using rss feed into my drupal site and show it inside a page

2480180
post	get
uzbekjon has a great blog post on this as well get url parameters values with jquery

2480320
jquery	simplemodal
my problem has to do with the simplemodal jquery plugin

2480320
slideup	slidedown
edit i think it would help to explain my problem by showing two screenshots before after -- basically i am using jquery s slideup slidedown functionality to hide the credit card form depending on whether the user is paying via cash cheque or credit card

2480320
slideup	slidedown
i tried adding in a callback element of slideup slidedown but to no avail -- in fact setposition is throwing a js error because apparently the function doesn t exist

2480333
qmenubar	qmainwindow
i would like to add a qmenubar to a window of my program not the qmainwindow from qtdesigner but i do not see this widget in there and it seems the only way to do this from designer is to use a mainwindow

put	get
your verbs get set will become the http standard get put

2480339
daemons	launchd
i am attempting to write a python daemons that will launchd at boot

2480339
daemons	launchd
the problem comes in when i start the daemons at boot if i launchd from the shell it runs perfectly and completes the work

2480347
equals	gethashcode
you need to implement equals and gethashcode on your exampleclass

2480358
width	height
it was not possible to do pixel graphics with these except by printing repeated periods and micro-advancing the print head and paper the width height of a period instead of a character row of text respectively which would generally wear out the period character of the daisy-wheel or ball really quickly so many of them had metal-reinforced periods for that very reason

2480367
equals	gethashcode
it does not implement any equality testing such as overriding equals and gethashcode so nunit will eventually do a reference comparison

2480379
for-loop	loops
i mean in asp.net suppose you have a linq file called catalogue and you then use a for-loop to loops through catalogue.products and print each product name

2480390
int	chars
a chars has an int value

2480398
postgresql	mysql
i ve used pentaho data integration to migrate from oracle to mysql i also migrated the same data to postgresql which was about 50 quicker which i guess was largely due to the different jdbc drivers being used

2480419
ienumerable	iqueryable
the linq to sql provider is in collusion with the c# compiler the iqueryable interface behaves a little differently upon compilation as opposed to a standard in memory collection ienumerable

2480425
hash	salt
he then hash this token using a salt i m combing code from different functions

2480425
hash	salt
i was wondering if theres any reason to to run the token through the salt hash

2480425
hash	salt
i ve read that simply randomly generating strings was a naive way of making random passwords but is the sh1 hash and salt necessary

2480439
stdout	stderr
if you need to capture both stderr and stdout and don t want to resort to logging following is a simple solution adapted from this post

2480447
yslow	pagespeed
i m checking my pages with two plugins for firebug yslow and pagespeed

2480447
yslow	pagespeed
both seem to say that my files are caching add expires headers in yslow and leverage browser caching in pagespeed are both checked

2480456
many-to-many	one-to-many
don t forget to use singularname property in one-to-many many-to-many for nicer looking generated functions adddog dog dog vs adddogs dog dogs .

2480456
many-to-many	one-to-many
usually make more sense for one-to-many or many-to-many relationship

2480456
many-to-many	one-to-many
if you access the one-to-many many-to-many array or struct directly make sure the corresponding array struct exists before use

2480463
subtract	add
you basically want to add everyone that matches a criteria but subtract everyone that has a criteria that doesn t match

2480475
hash	md5
salting a hash is used to decrease the possibility of collision and ensure that the hash can t be found in a database like this - if everybody is using md5 for storing their passwords then a password file database could be de-hashed by looking up the md5 d value of the password

2480475
hash	salt
using a salt there is an added unknown element to the hash which means the code for generating the salt must also be known to try and brute force the hash

2480482
width	height
increasing the size of the stage increases that scaling value which through some set of concatenations of matrices results in the movieclip getting scaled and translated at that same percentage as the stage even if you explicitly set the x y width height values

2480482
width	height
anyway the fix is to set the stage to an explicit width and height

2480491
rpm	yum
if there is software on your system that depends on the existing fontconfig rpm then you won t be able to uninstall the version yum has given you

2480511
accessor	properties
make sure to expose properties accessor get

2480647
post	put	post	get	put	get
now i get it that i can put a post with all of its details in memcache and call the key post 123 that is ok and i can do it for each post

2480647

but how to deal with the case when i query the table post to get the list of all post with their titles

2480657
managed	loaderlock
loaderlock is an mda managed debugging assistant warning from the debugger

2480673
cos	sin
so then instead of cos for x and sin for y above you should use sin for x and cos for y

2480753
pull	push
i think people will find it very annoying if they have to pull and push updates from a lot of different places but they will also find it annoying if they have to pull push the entire company codebase

2480764
move	drag
i have a movieclip that i want the user to be able to drag inside the stage but i don t want it to be able to move outside the stage

2480780
portrait	landscape
all i want is for my button s origin to stay locked to the bottom-left in portrait and bottom-right in landscape so it basically stays in the same place

2480780
portrait	landscape
it should also stay in place for portrait upside down and landscape right

2480799
cvs	svn
the oft-repeated statement that there is no central repository is very scary to people who have been locked into the cvs svn model since time immemorial and can t imagine anything else especially so for management and senior experienced and or cynical developers who want strong source code tracking and reproducibility and perhaps also if you have to satisfy certain standards regarding your development processes like we did at a place i once worked

2480803
mvp	presenter
i think the problem here is that you shouldn t need both the iview and ipresenter interfaces to be generic - in an mvp framework either the view should call the presenter directly to drive the form in which case the view should be generic for some presenter type or the view should be totally unaware of the presenter and communicate through events in which case the presenter should be generic for a particular view type

2480821
accessor	properties
with auto-implemented properties both a get and set accessor are required

2480821
accessor	properties
a read-only properties has no set accessor

2480821
accessor	properties
a properties without a set accessor is considered read-only

2480833
ubuntu	linux
for reference the subversion repository is hosted on a linux server with ubuntu 9 something installed and i have complete root access to the machine

2480864
base	fractions
the fractions part of numbers for example 0.11 is represented as multiples of inverse powers of 10 since the base is 10

2480864
base	fractions
just as base 10 is not capable enough to represent every fractions number in a finite manner base-2 cannot represent all fractions numbers given a limited amount of space

2480923
squash	branch
so basically when starting on a new feature i create a branch for it go through the usual hack then commit cycle and when i think i m done with it i squash it into a single commit using git rebase --interactive master and i always end up editing the multitude of commit messages into something looking like the example in the article reproduced here

2480933
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop that loops over one array.

2480939
width	height

2480997
uiview	calayer
the problem with this is that setframe on a uiview by default has no animation but setframe on a calayer does

2480997
uiview	calayer
i cant just disable the animations on the calayers setframe because if i were to call setframe on the uiview inside a uiview animation block the calayer would still have its animation disabled

2480997
uiview	subviews	uiview	calayer	width	height
unfortunately the best solution is to not use a calayer at all and just add a uiview as a subviews and draw into that just like i am drawing into my layer and hope that with autoresizingmask set to height and width that everything will just work

2481002
lisp	smalltalk
as a latecomer to discussion the main problem with smalltalk and lisp is that you can t run them with cgi or fastcgi on shared hosting

2481008
aggregate-functions	sum

2481225
translation	localization
is a modern localization workflow and crowdsourcing platform suited for software and dynamic content translation

2481226
jobs	cron
that being said if you don t want to use buildbot or hudson and you simply want to run your tests every 24 hours or so you can install your scripts as cron jobs or write a master script that will run all your tests and install that as a cron job

2481252
operands	scalar
i think it s referred to as subquery as a scalar operands

2481323
public	protected
provide either a public virtual destructor or a protected non-virtual destructor for each class that has virtual methods

put	get
after using read-tree you could use this to get the individual file you want to change modify it then put it back in with update-index

2481474
int	chars
chars is a single chars actually int so if you want to compare strings use strcmp instead

2481494
sql-insert	sql-delete	sql-insert	sql-update	sql-delete	sql-update

google-chrome	safari
if your application only uses something that supports some of the html5 spec webkit-based safari 5 google-chrome chromium for instance you can do a lot ahem guessing your question stems from steve jobs mentioning html5 in a keynoteâ ...but will struggle with cross-platform support

the common pattern for this in python is to use a dictionary to map

2481595
spreadsheetml	presentationml
the one thing to keep in mind is that spreadsheetml is more similiar to presentationml than it is to wordprocessingml in file structure inside the package for every sheet there is a seperate file

int	chars
chars charat int index

2481631
superclass	subclassing
so the general rule should be to never call a magic method directly but always indirectly through a built-in unless you know exactly why you need to do that when you re overriding such a method in a subclassing if the subclassing needs to defer to the superclass that must be done through explicit call to the magic method

2481636
post	get
it is a post method not get

serializable	deserialization
this makes use of the wcf datacontract serializable with handles graphs very efficiently and maintains object reference even after deserialization

background-size is working in google-chrome 4.1 but so far i couldn t make it work in firefox 3.6

2481710
accessor	properties
the accessor for your keyedthings properties won t collide with any kvc accessor so you re also fine there

2481713
portrait	landscape
i understand that when the orientation changes from portrait to landscape or vice versa the activity is destroyed and then re-created

2481715
width	height
machine elf and stefan kendall are both very close but both incomplete so you just combine each as so machine elf didn t account for scrollbars and setfan didn t account for the height and width of the div itself

2481715
width	height
you may also need to set the css of your div to a fix height and width and its display is set to block

2481778
yslow	pagespeed
yslow and pagespeed

2481793
portrait	landscape
i have created a main.xml and designed one for the res layout-land landscape format and another one for portrait in res layout

2481793
portrait	landscape
when i rotate the emulator ctrl-f11 my app rotates properly to landscape using the correct main.xml but a subsequent rotation back to portrait just keeps the landscape mail.xml

2481798
udp	rtp
for example if you plan to use wifi access points outside of the home many of these will not support rtp using udp delivery

2481826
udp	tcp	udp	rtp
in practice when this is done the difference between interleaved rtp over tcp and rtp sent over udp is how these two perform over a lossy network with insufficient bandwidth available for the user

2481893
put	get
i alway remember what a teacher once told me when i was learning c-- with c you get a kevlar boot and a gun it is up to you whether or not you put the boot on before you shoot yourself in the foot because you will shoot yourself at some point... good luck to you on learning c++ just hang in there and don t get discouraged

2481895
codeigniter	kohana
kohana is strictly php5 and was initially created as a fork of codeigniter it used to be called blue flame but it has since been rewritten

2481901
width	height
it also automatically detects the size of the content being loaded so you don t have to specify a width and height

2481915
for-loop	loops
i ve done a small experiment as will be shown below and it looks like that a while loops is faster than a for-loop in perl

2481915
for-loop	loops
the one that has the while loops took 57 minutes 17 seconds to finish while the for-loop equivalent took 1 hour 7 minutes 54 seconds

2481936
public	protected
it keeps the public interface clean but still isn t great - baselinedate was made protected and a derived class is required both solely for testing

2481957
daemons	systemd
i have a process x which uses systemd c function to start ntpd daemons

2481975
google-chrome	firefox
it worked for me in ie8 it gives me the complete path but in firefox and google-chrome is just prints the file name

2482037
for-loop	loops
the while loops uses the notation but the for-loop uses

2482037
hash	md5
it prints the md5 hash of the factorial rather than the factorial itself because it is easier to compare the results etc

2482037
for-loop	loops
i consistently see a small 1 penalty for the while loops over the corresponding for-loop but i don t have good explanation for it

2482103
mouse	keyboard
the intention is to detect the last input time keyboard or mouse of the user

otherwise you might try sending confirmation e-mails to your own accounts on major e-mail sites like yahoo hotmail and gmail and then tweaking the wording until it gets past the spam filters

2482214
printf	strtol
parse it with strtol then convert to a string with one of the printf functions

opera	google-chrome
i tried max-width on top instead and in opera and google-chrome i see the border of top as 500width but the images continue to render pass it

2482404
margin	height
i found this solution but it wasn t working on single images there isn t always 2 images so i wrote my own little bit of code which seems to be working except it sometimes doesn t subtract the height of the image from the height of the div and so i end up with a margin of 310px

2482437
for-loop	loops
i would like the label to update itself with every loops however the program is not updating the gui label with every loops instead it only updates itself once the entire for-loop is completed and displays only the last command that was executed

2482457
width	margin
to center the top-level div something like margin 0 auto should do it if the parent has a width or the good old tag if not

post	get
if you want to use post rather than get you can provide a data type as the fourth parameter

2482596
firefox	safari
if you need something more precise than ip geolocation you could use the w3c geolocation api in supported browsers notably firefox 3.5 and mobile safari to request the user s latitude and longitude and then use google s client-side reverse geocoding service to guess the user s approximate street address

2482649
gif	png
is there a way to convert a wmf picture to gif or png with the delphi 2009 or newer run time libraries

2482657
int	chars
the function getchar is typed to return int and not chars

2482660
printf	getchar
however if you know you are just doing characters then getchar and putchar will be more efficient since the printf and scanf variants will have to parse the string each time to determine how to process your request

2482693

has already been asked and answered - how to get image size height width using javascript

2483080
width	height
you can use .attr width and .attr height unless you mean size in bytes

2483092
width	height
if the image already has width height styles attributes applied to it you will not get the image s width height but you will get the resized dimensions

2483182
mp3	flac
if a flac file is newer than the corresponding mp3 file or the corresponding mp3 file doesn t exist then i want to run a bunch of commands to convert the flac file to an mp3 file and copy the tags across

2483182
mp3	flac
the kicker i need to search the flac directory recursively and create corresponding subdirectories in the mp3 directory

opera	firefox
if you look at the bottom of this blogpost of mine svg at the movies take 2 you ll find a simple wrapper script that implements parsexml should work fine in opera firefox and webkit

2483291
subobject	instances
a pointer to a derived class can always be converted to a pointer to a base class because a derived class object always contains a base class subobject but not every base class instances is a subobject of a particular derived class type

how to get width and height measured in pixels of such string displayed on the screen

2483480
cpython	ironpython
using multiple processes lets you exploit multiple cpu cores at the same time while in cpython using threads doesn t threads take turns using a single cpu core -- so if you have cpu intensive work and absolutely want to use threads you should consider jython or ironpython

2483480
unix	bsd	opensolaris	bsd
net of this crucial consideration threads might often be a better choice performance-wise on windows where making a new process is a heavy task but less often on unix variants linux bsd versions opensolaris macosx ... since making a new process is faster there but if you re using ironpython or jython you should check on the platforms you care about that this still applies in the virtual machines in question -- clr with either .net or mono for ironpython your jvm of choice for jython

for example a rectangle can have it s width and height each set separately and this of course is impossible with a square

jar	war
you have to provide a jar with the remote interfaces to your war also known as a client ejb-jar there is no other option

2483721
jar	war
and if your remote interfaces do use entities or any other dependencies then your war must obviously be aware of them you also need to include entities and any other dependency in a jar and to package it in the war

2483755
sudo	passwd
is there a way to mimic the sudo command behavior ask for user passwd to temporarily gain root privileges and perform the particular task

2483770
sudo	passwd
ask for the users passwd in a dialog of your own and pipe that into the shell when sudo asks for it

2483802
daemons	systemd
a lot of daemons etc are also set up under modern systemd to run as their own user with most of the privileges they need

versioning	upgrade
what you ll miss though is if there are any files deleted in the upgrade versioning

2483892
free	malloc
you should have the same number of free s as you have malloc s

2483895
free	malloc
the key is to always free memory in the same manner as you malloc ed it

memcpy	malloc
you should check for errors ideally on each malloc and memcpy but just doing it once at the end will be sufficient cudageterrorstring cudagetlasterror

try-catch	exception-handling
now normally i could wrap a call to this method in a try-catch block with 2 catch clauses to handle the logging situations for each of the exception-handling

2484042
serializable	deserialization
fortunately on most cases you will only need the special features when you are actually working with the object so you can serializable a simplified but complete enough version of it and reconstruct the advanced object upon deserialization

2484079
int	double
i think the best choice here is to keep arrays and decode your int or double manually into it and concatenate strings onto the beginning and end

2484096
hide	show
you can t show the div once you hide it since the link is inside the div

2484105
hash	salt
a simple way to generate the random unique string is to take a hash sha-1 for example of the real id + some salt value

2484105
hash	salt
it makes it very difficult nearly impossible for an attacker to reverse engineer the real id from the public id by brute-forcing the hash which can be quite easy without a salt if the id is short and numeric

2484141

the much better and cleaner way would be to have them the central bank in that case publish the data in a defined form as a web service rss feed or xml output that you can access

websphere	ibm
from the updater tech notes it seems like it was a pain to get running with websphere and you needed a special updater from ibm to get the patches

implements	extends
i would like to implements an observer pattern in objective-c where the observer implements an interface similar to skpaymenttransactionobserver and the observable class just extends my base observable

2484359
put	get	public	protected
p.s. it s not that personal if someone really wants it it could never be 100 protected and if it was that important i wouldnt put it in the public folder also if the dude really wants to get it that hard he should deserve it

memcached	apc
if content is changing a lot it may not be worth caching data but if a lot of more static then maybe using something like memcached or apc will be of use

hash	salt
as a sidenote do not use salt hash google don t hash secrets and do not use an encrypted version of your data

2484504
serializable	deserialization
the idea here is that ttype is a concrete representation of that type an algebraic datatype with int float constructors and so on and you have here a value whose type is concealed but that carries a concrete representation of that type that you can use for example to get a safer serializable deserialization

2484541
redhat	fedora
depending on platform you can modify ld.so.conf via etc ld.so.conf.d redhat fedora come to mind which makes deploying changes to ld.so easier from a deployment scenario

2484569
awt	swing
in answer to your question i would definitely do what you describe as an awt solution--that way you can track the objects created and be able to allow the user to reload them onto an edit canvas and more than likely each of the shapes the user creates would be a layer not the layer swing container but an object that would store and track what shapes are drawn and be able to redraw them--the main thing to keep in mind is draw order

2484569
awt	swing
mostly you want to use awt over swing due to the fact swing is not thread safe--that way you do not paint yourself in the corner early on in your design

2484569
awt	swing
swing is built over the awt and adds a great deal of complexity that an application like this doesn t need

2484569
awt	swing
the developer community--myself included--were well on the way to creating a lot of what swing offered in slickness and component based design but what we were building was totally awt based

versioning	upgrade
the instructions that come with the download seem to be for a major versioning upgrade and are way too much trouble for frequent security updates

2484703
getter	setter
while getter and setter in and of themselves are not necessarily evil they are sometimes a sign that your subsystems are too strongly coupled

2484731
getter	setter
if you feel you have too many getter and setter in your model class maybe you have too many fields altogether

2484731
getter	setter
in general java is a verbose language which expects you to put all those getter and setter and a lot more in place

google-chrome	firefox
and im trying to figure out a way for firefox or google-chrome to setup anytime it sees for instance a a web based page for equipment like cisco linksys sonicwall t1 controllers from the manufacture in the title bar or from the originating page place a set up 2 - 3 passwords to auto log on with

2485210
post	get
thanks to goran for pushing me to get the real source tables to post here which i m still not going to post because i m too lazy to redact them as appropriate for easy viewing and protection of the innocent but i should have at least printed them out before asking

2485242
lisp	scheme
source scheme lisp nested loops and recursion

2485271
ordinals	difference
on the off chance that perhaps the ordinals position of the indexed field might make a difference i also tried a unique index on the second column only and this came out exactly the same size

2485277
haskell	ocaml
f# is definitely based on ocaml and takes ideas from other languages such as haskell and shares many aspects with them however there is also a lot of other things

2485286
google-chrome	firefox
tested to work in firefox ie google-chrome although thinking about handling document.onload too

2485308
nsstring	nsxmlparser
i am usin the nsxmlparser and am wondering how i can parse iso-8859-1 correctly into an nsstring

2485315
put	get
put this together and we get

2485343
children	parent
yet another approach is to use a layered div approach in which the top content and bottom are all children of a parent div that contains the background

2485382
dictionary	map
generally you would map a simpler dictionary string string as

2485387
int	chars	unsigned	short
when i step into each line of the above code the debug cursor jumps straight from the unsigned short port line to the first local_address.sin line even though i am using step into f11 it does not stop at struct int chars or socket lines it jumps straight over them

2485392
rss	feed
it is able to parse a variety of rss and atom syndication feed and versions and emit whatever syndication feed format version you want

2485392
rss	feed
publishing rss and atom feed

2485462
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
but possibly it is the uinavigationcontroller that is responding to this notification or uitabbarcontroller

2485490
versioning	upgrade
any paid content each has on the app store versioning should be available for their beta though as usual for app upgrade and one-owner multiple-devices scenarios

2485532
required	placeholder
the contents of this placeholder can obviously vary from child to child and is obviously not required to be used

2485563
min	max
i would like to display salary sal min sal mid and sal max using a line graph

2485613
post	get
strangely however if you limit to just one friend f_id1 you will get back post user_id made to their friends wall

2485631
width	height
with the code below i m getting an argument exception invalid parameter when creating the new bitmap with the new height and width and i really don t understand why.

2485635
junit	jmock
are junit and jmock still considered relevant or are there other newer frameworks that have come around that we should investigate

2485643
unsigned	short
thing is java does not have unsigned primitives so i am not able to send values greater than max value of signed short allowed

2485643
unsigned	short
how can i do this converting int to short and send over the network without worrying about truncation and signed unsigned int

2485667
unsigned	short
firstly java int short and byte types are all signed not unsigned

2485667
division	multiplication
on the other hand the semantic of multiplication and division are such that signed and unsigned flavors have to be handled separately

2485682
width	height
if you try to create a bitmap with zero height and width that is the exception you ll get

2485691
int	chars	getchar	fgetc
forget the name - remember that getc and getchar and fgetc return an int not a chars

2485691
int	chars
they have to return an int because they need to return every possible valid chars value plus eof

2485691
stdout	stderr
the bogus character messages are printed on stderr not stdout

2485697
width	height
it works independent of screen size because the blackberry app just gets all three parts and generates an appropriately sized bitmap using the screen width and height

2485697
width	height
however i have not found any way to get the height width of the window in android

2485697
width	height
i think this might be possible using the dimensions of my layout managers but i cannot get the height width of them in the oncreate method so i m not sure what to do exactly

2485698
gridview	objectdatasource
it s ok to use datatable in the ui a gridview and other controls can be binded easily to its data through an objectdatasource and paging and sorting is automagic

2485725
equals	compareto
in the end compareto must also be consistent with equals

2485732
int	chars
not exactly sure if the string that is being validated should check whether the contents only contains numbers or can be actually represented in the valid range of an int one way to approach this problem is to iterate over the chars of a string and check that the chars are only composed of numbers

2485733
processors	hyperthreading
hyperthreading twin processors

2485756
google-chrome	safari
it s just a layout issue with your page in webkit the rendering engine in safari and google-chrome

2485771
facebook	fbconnect
something where i could create my own custom login screen asking for the facebook login username and password and then using the fbconnect native methods to validate that info and retrieve a valid session

2485839
hide	show
try using a dataview as your binding source and use dataview.rowfilter to hide rows or show rows of your choosing

2485863
hide	show
it turns out that my first view the one with the map on it didn t have a title set in fact i hide the navigation bar because i didn t want to show it

2485909
quicksort	heapsort
some more common and more efficient algorithms include quicksort merge sort and heapsort among many others

2485915
filtering	grouping
next we filtering the blank lines out and determine each line s index and grouping them by the modulus of the aforementioned index

2485946
int	chars
you could also define a specific and replace every either3 int string chars with mytype every left3 with myint every mid3 with mystr and every right3 with mychar

2485979
disk	ram
in that i can get only ram size i can t get the specific disk space like c and d

2485999
width	height
svg width 500 height 200 version 1.1

2485999
width	height
rect id simplerect width 100px height 75px

2486023
portrait	landscape
as the title of this question implies our best-case scenario is the ability to detect the orientation change and use it to alter the css on the fly so as to present a slightly different page for landscape versus portrait

2486071
superclass	subclassing
but you can t do that if you actually have a -- those pointers must always be to b or subclassing thereof not to a a superclass of b

2486092
disk	ram
if the maximum ram can be allocated to innodb_buffer_pool_size is 1gb is it possible to specify which tables to loaded into memory while keep others always read from disk

2486098
post	get
i did get a fair number of warnings on the console though regarding bytes per row setting not being high enough - after reading answers to this post i ended up setting it to 0 which lets the system determine the right value

2486133
min	max
instead of an array or a min heap i would use a max heap since you only want to check for distances less than the 10th closest point

2486144
opera	firefox
now the above script works fine in firefox opera and ie8

2486144
opera	firefox
firefox opera ie9 etc

2486185

and i also want to induce sleep between cron jobs

2486220
public	protected
however by convention the access modifier public private protected is always given first static and or final if applicable are given next followed by the return-type

2486294
put	get
you should get the same values out of a list that you put in to them

2486327
post	get
however even with these meaures they will still have access to the scripts so long as they know how to post the data and also get the new code each day

2486334
width	height
i have the css set on the new window so that the image height and width are both 100 and overflow is set to hidden so that the window can be resized

2486334
width	height
is it just because the height and width are never exactly the right ratio should i manually set the width to a round number ever time or is there something else i m doing wrong

2486347
post	put
to protect you against this you could put a cookie into the browser and have the cookie value sent in the post form too by hidden field or just add it to .post

2486349
config	ini
python has the configparser or configparser in 3.0 that is geared towards ini style config files

2486368
translation	localization
in localization file config locals fr.yml these categories were translation to french

are there any better way to handle the strings and string operations so that it can be bstr complaints as well as we can have naive cstring operations

2486437
pop-up	dialog
is it possible for a webpage to pop-up a open folder dialog ask the user to select a folder then show the contents of that folder in a list or something in the webpage

2486464
cstring	bstr
you can use _bstr_t attach to create _bstr_t instance from cstring allocsysstring call in this case you don t need to care about bstr release

2486582
atomic	interlocked
and to be thread-safe the increment and decrement-check operations have to be interlocked atomic which can have a severely negative effect on multiple cores

2486662
bazaar	git
i too have been looking for a case where say subversion fails to merge a branch and mercurial and git bazaar ... does the right thing

2486732
post	put
are you sure you need put and can not use a post which will send the file to a url where your asp script can read it from the request stream

i put it live and get an error saying warning call-time pass-by-reference has been deprecated

2486802
rss	feed
we have some funny restrictions where we can t simply publish the rss feed to the public

2486812
goto	break
there might be a more structured command to control the flow like a break or a continue which has been implemented by the compiler in the same way as a goto so that reflector can t tell the difference

2486859
rss	feed
you have put in a template to match and correct the elements with the wrong media rss namespace but you don t have anything to match the other elements attributes in the rss feed

2486859
rss	feed
that does not preserve the original rss feed s xml and produces output that is not valid rss xml structure

2486893
integer	unsigned
also nw i change d to ld and use 40000l bt when i use unsigned integer then also i need to use l with 40000

comparator	comparable
make each object s class implement java.lang.comparable and write the comparison logic for each class there then just accept comparable instead of object and call comparator

2486971
vrml	x3d
given that the w3c seems to follow closely that project and that several render backends are planned to be used actually webgl but later google o3d for example maybe the old dream of vrml x3d guys could become reality in a not so distant future

2487005
versioning	upgrade
it appears that all post-fsfs format upgrade are optional not mandatory â so all you need to do is ensure that your repository was created by the oldest versioning of subversion involved

2487036
free	malloc
if you were out of memory in a defect free program malloc would return an error indication

2487070
post	get
well because post methods are built to add stuff to an app get methods are supposed to be used to get information without side effects

2487070
post	get
so rather than your .post call expecting data and handling the callback what i d recommend is having your controller expose a method for creating new chat messages via post and then another method that get the last x chat messages or the messages since a certain timestamp or whatever

2487090
width	height
this happens because firefox draws a 1px dashed border around the element with 100 width and height when you click on it making it too large for the window to fit by just 1px

2487096
hide	show
what you should do is create new jpanel for all the windows you want to show then remove or hide the panel you want to hide and add or show the one you want to show

lwp	libwww-perl
you could use libwww-perl perldoc lwp and have more control about the download process

2487164
hash	md5
doing an md5 or sha hash is very easy and match the downloaded one with what you re expecting

2487223
min	max
however if i read you correct the 2 resultsets are fundamentally different the min max is an operation on the 1st result set after filtering and not on the original data

2487225
vbscript	vb6
interestingly a very similar issue occurs in vb6 vbscript where for function byref x function x function x and call function x are all slightly different in which value they pass by reference function x passes a reference to the result of the x expression and not x

2487291
apache	nginx
alternatively you may find nginx + apache + mod_wsgi a more stable approach - nginx is a fantastic front-end webserver for serving static content but apache is excellent for hosting dynamic processes

2487622
subclass	abstract-class
i m handling this by defining an abstract-class outputprovider that i will subclass for each individual case

2487679
profiler	vtune
added to that i would use a real profiler like vtune ptu than the one available in any visual studio version

2487689
google-chrome	firefox	mouse	keyboard
what i d like is a javascript function that can be called in order to restore keyboard and mouse focus to the flash app and which will work in ie firefox and google-chrome

2487726
superclass	subclassing	ivar	subclassing
a subclassing can t have a declared ivar with the same name as one of its superclass s declared ivars even if the superclass s ivar is private

2487726
superclass	subclassing
this seems to me like a violation of the meaning of private since the subclassing is affected by the superclass s choice of something private

2487734
range	infinity
the range for the above decibels is negative infinity to zero and for linear is 0.0 to 1.0

2487739
vtune	shark
to decide where to apply this you may use a sample-based analyzer like shark vtune or zoom to highlight the instructions slowed by denormal values

2487797
draggable	droppable
i m using the jquery droppable draggable to reorder a treeview made up of ul li items

2487797
draggable	droppable
when i define the items to be draggable the code doesnâ t work any more the items are classed as droppable but the drop event wonâ t run

2487820
draggable	droppable
however if you want a tree view you should be using sortable instead of draggable droppable

2487823
public	protected
the private protected and public directives exist for the benefit of the compiler

2487823
ivar	subclassing
there is still objective-c s relatively flat namespace to content with and that is what prevents you from having an ivar of the same name in a subclassing

2487852
config	ini
you cannot instantiate a database logger from an ini config yet

2487857
client-side	server-side
you didn t specify in your question if you own the server-side method or just the client-side call so the excerpt below covers both cases

2487868
width	height
it requires that all images be fully loaded so it can custom resize each individual image based on it s own aspect ratio width height etc calculate the width of containing div and calculate the slide distance from one image to another

2487876
imap	nntp
executive summary essentially the author eventually gives up on using this header and recommends and shows a different approach which is also implemented in the c-client library part of the uw imap toolkit open source package which is not for imap only -- don t let the name fool you it also works for pop nntp local mailboxes c

2487879
for-loop	arrays

is there some c c++ ide for windows which is integrated with the llvm compiler and clang c c++ analyzer just like modern xcode do

2487931
clang	llvm
yes clang was not able to be used with complex c++ code but trunk clang already can compile llvm itself

2488093
addition	multiplication
matrix multiplication addition fft s convolution etc

2488184
inherited	properties
the hasownproperty checks are because this statement iterates over all properties inherited or not and if something like some javascript frameworks augmented the array.prototype or object.prototype objects those augmented properties will be also iterated

2488214
javadb	hsqldb
instead of a fullfledged database server you can also consider an embedded javabased database such as sun oracle javadb apache derby hsqldb or sqlite each which are of course accessible through the jdbc api the usual way

2488395
jtextpane	jeditorpane
but you can use jtextpane or jeditorpane

2488412
post	get

2488508
post	put	post	get	put	get
each rest method get post put delete is a simple condition in the view function

2488537
width	height
i simply inserted width and height values into the html and the script was then able to properly format the show without the images being loaded as it grabs the necessary data straight from the markup as opposed to the images themselves

2488552
post	get
never send anything that can be changed by the user such as get or post data straight to a database without at least using this function

2488555
freebsd	netbsd
the bsd family netbsd freebsd

it seems to me that subclassing should be able to see superclass because package a.b.c is a subpackage of a.b.

2489122
cstdio	iostream
however stringstreams iostream are far far superior to the cstring and cstdio lot

2489122
printf	strlen
if you re using strings always use the c++ string libraries over strlen printf and that

2489174
getter	setter
if i need such a generic getter method i have no clue how to transform this generic setter above to a generic getter method

2489215
min	max
also using new ternary if instead of min and max seems to be consistently faster

2489254
pascal	delphi
delphi or free pascal projects at

2489281

the code works great only if the form stays in the foreground not minimized to tray but if you add a notifyicon and minimize the form to tray and turn the showintaskbar to false so that you only have an icon in the tray the program wont catch any clipboard changes anymore .

2489323
viewdidload	viewwillappear
viewdidload and viewwillappear in commentsubmissionview do not fire

when you set center the frame s x y height and width are adjusted around that center point.

2489397
button	checkbox
regardless when a user clicks a button on the page i want to loop through the items in myitemscontrol and determine if the checkbox element associated with the item is checked

2489398
put	get
this situation may seem a bit like a chicken and egg problem application developers won t move to 3.x till the libraries get there libraries developers would rather only maintain one branch and are waiting in an attempt to time the porting to py3k in a way that they can put the their py2.x branches in maintenance shortly thereafter

2489421
error-handling	exception-handling
more to the point you should only use exception-handling when error-handling would otherwise mess up the structure of your code which shouldn t be the case in an is the data in this form ok - yes fine accept and close event handler

2489451
postgresql	mysql
for example pyqt is already available for python 3 as well as 2 and you can use postgresql a splendid open-source sql database engine much more standard than mysql via py-postgresql

2489451
postgresql	mysql
so if the third party extensions you re pining for are say wxpython and mysqldb perhaps you can try these alternatives i m biased of course since i ve long preferred qt to wxwidgets and postgresql to mysql on purely technical grounds -- but the prompt porting of the related python extensions to python 3 does also hint that these extensions are being more actively and vigorously developed so that might be another nudge to try them

2489514
floor	sqrt
floor and adding 0.5 is done to prevent cases like sqrt 4 returning 1.9999999.

2489548
nhibernate	queryover
i m using the queryover api that is part of nhibernate 3.x

2489576
pop-up	dialog
i usually prefer and recommend to other developers the use of the jquery-ui dialog widget but in this scenario the images are actually webcam feeds that the user will want to pop out of the main window and have open even if the main window is closed so while i appreciate the move from pop-up windows in general please avoid suggesting alternatives that involve same-window widgets

2489612
winpcap	jpcap
jpcap is just a wrapper for winpcap and this underlying mechanism can not drop observed packets

mouse	keyboard
i would like to have a background image in my qgraphicsview that is always scaled and cropped if necessary to the size of the viewport without scrollbars and without scrolling with the keyboard and mouse

2489769
client-side	server-side
personally if your client-side and server-side validation results in a different error message being presented then i think that s your problem not the split between the two

2489792
client-side	server-side
server-side is always required because you can t always assume client-side validation was correct

2489858
firefox	safari
i tested multiple versions of firefox ie7 ie6 and safari

2489867
writetofile	nsdata

2489893
integer	unsigned
and just as an optimization hint store your ip addresses as an unsigned integer field not varchar 15

2489899
uiview	calayer
the lightest-wight solution would be to create a small helper class in the the file as the uiview that s using the calayer

2489907
min	max
that s a special case that you can use but the general way to scan convert a convex polygon like a triangle is to put all the points into a list and then for each scan line draw a line between the min and max column

2489909
inherited	properties
i guess having that particular properties return object just abstracts the return type somewhat not locking it in to an object further down the inherited chain

2489987
g++	gcc
g++ the c++ compiler is a sibling of gcc the c compiler and g++ is allowing you to use that c99 feature while vs has no such thing

2489994
pos-tagging	stemming
leaving other practical questions aside parsing pos-tagging stemming and of course the very issue of identifying mapping a given word.

2490016

the viewdidappear and viewwillappear methods will only be called if you are

2490016
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
in the situation you have where you are adding a view to another view you must invoke viewwillappear and viewdidappear on the view controller yourself or they won t happen

2490016
accessor	properties
it will always be invoked after loadview when the view properties accessor is invoked on the controller for the first time unless an error occurs

2490029

if you re talking about the image that displays when you call setdivider or android divider in xml i don t think you can hide it on some rows and show it on other rows

2490418
hide	show
the problem is you re trying to hide and show an inline element

2490418
width	height
they re easy to animate growing and shrinking because you simply animate their height and or width

answer thank s to fazil s investigations upgrade matlab to a versioning greater than 2009a

2490486

you can do this by making your type implements comparable or by providing a separate comparator

2490486
comparator	comparable
when to use comparable vs comparator

2490513

2490654
width	height
i know in advance that this bitmap is a 24bpp and its width and height

2490662
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
from memory i think there are quite significant size differences in the default sizes of buttons between ie firefox and safari - i dont really use opera but i assume there are size issues there - so if you were then to set a padding on the button in css it might not render correctly any more in safari and firefox

2490666

2490893
pop-up	dialog
i want to be able to create an object for handling a modal pop-up jquery ui dialog

2490915
grizzly	netty
grizzly and netty are also good nio based network frameworks but if you want to use jsp and find that tomcat is not sufficient i guess jetty would be the best bet

2490915
pull	push
also it s not like there are only push and pull models

2490921
for-loop	loops
below is the for-loop where i try to loops thru the page count

2490951
int	double
you invocation fails because you require object not a value type like int -- obviously is not a - it won t work with any vt like double or bool

2490952
rss	feed
fyi my app downloads and parsers an rss feed using a class which is referenced by ciparser - which in turn stores the downloaded content in an array that i need to search

2491018
globalization	localization
software localization and globalization have always been tough and at times unwanted tasks for developers

2491027
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
this will target webkit browsers only google-chrome safari and i think a version of opera too

2491072
width	height
it has no width or height

2491080
width	height
span s are by default displayed inline which means they don t have a height and width

2491081
width	height
you can change its display attribute to block for instance and its height width attributes will start to take effect

2491086
width	height
span is by default an inline element which cannot take width and height properties

2491093

while you can use exp imp to upgrade from an older versioning i wouldn t do it

2491143
affinity	processors
you may have a look at processors affinity

2491143
affinity	processors
the following line will change current process affinity to processors 1 2

hide	show
the toggle function in this code is not working as expected though it show the #menu items when clicked it doesn t hide them always

2491335
servicebehavior	was
my initial draft approach was to use windows service as a wcf host with service contract implementing class that is decorated with servicebehavior instancecontextmode instancecontextmode.single concurrencymode concurrencymode.multiple that has a list object and a custom locking for accessing it

2491384
pull	push
the live application would be connecting directly to a database so i would not have to pull my data from an xml file query and then push it out again as xml

i think the answer to that will depend on usage and other factors within your application but the pattern you re probably looking for is data transfer object which has properties getter and setter but nothing else

2491822
int	boolean
because of numerical jitter a boolean comparison of an int with itself is not always computed as exactly equal

2491879

2492028
uilabel	uitextview
it is working fine on uilabel but no uitextview with this message

2492032
folder	directory
as a quick fix this should be ok but if your server disallows directory creation from php in general you ll face trouble down the road as many modules will want to create their own directory structures within the files folder

2492110
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly on ie google-chrome firefox opera safari on both windows and mac - except for firefox on the mac which does not play the file

2492316
ubuntu	linux
you ll have to install code blocks manually on the linux host the packages aren t in the ubuntu repositories for example

2492323
sip	sdp
i solved it by forcing all sip message to pass through the pbx and to modify the sdp body so the stream passes through it and gets recorded

2492369

if you have any trouble post on the devel list or sf forums and you ll get a quick reply

2492547
apache	nginx
note that you should not be able to get the best performance with the nginx as a media server hidden behind apache with mod_proxy

2492561
objectcontext	transactionscope
i have also tried creating the transactionscope before creating the objectcontext in an attempt to influence the underlying transaction being used during savechanges

2492576
int	boolean
the reason is that several primitive types are not nullable including number also boolean int and uint

2492581
openssl	crypto++
on the external libraries front you have plenty of choice including nss openssl crypto++ .

2492585
vsto	add-in
further vsto does not enable the creating of user defined worksheet functions udfs so you would need a vba front-end or create a managed com add-in without using vsto in order to do this

2492585
vsto	add-in
unfortunately vsto is only available for excel 2003 and above and i think you have to create separate add-in for excel 2003 and excel 2007

2492585
vsto	add-in
managed com add-in made without using vsto on the other hand can be made compatible for excel 2000 and above with no difficulty

2492585
vsto	add-in
lastly vsto does not support the creation of udfs and therefore you d have to either create a managed automation add-in for that or utilize a vba front-end which calls your vsto functions

2492621
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
ideally what i d do is tell the current view controller to add a tab bar to the bottom but i m not sure if that s doable so i might have to swap the uiviewcontroller with a uitabbarcontroller

2492624
folder	directory
i got round this during development by having the image stored in a folder which was part of the project but after release of the project to the server the application refuses to allow the image to be saved in any directory within c inetpub wwwroot

2492649
folder	directory
i don t know why you can t save with the wwwroot this is probably just a permissions problem and could be overcome or you could create a virtual directory within your site that points at you images folder and use this virtual directory url in your page

2492661
hash	salt
hash is generated based on user s salt from when they first registered and the new token

2492683

2493207
namedtuple	dictionary
edit it looks like the _namedtuple function is provided by pylast and will use a real namedtuple in python 2.6+ but will fall back to a plain old dictionary in python 2.5 or older

2493443
children	parent
i have it in subclass persona and the collection is made only with parent class and not with children classes

2493579
post	get
do they have any advantages over using a get or post method instead even though i can handle all of the requests with get and post

2493599

for-loop	loops
here is a translation of your for-loop into a while loops just to clarify his observation even more.

2493905
classcastexception	illegalargumentexception
error handling omitted but of course you want to throw illegalargumentexception wherever incorrect types are passed around i prefer to let classcastexception be jvm generated and throw iae in my own code when i detect something wrong

2493922
pop-up	dialog
use ajax to both send the data from a form in the pop-up jquery dialog really back to the server and to populate the dialog when you want to do the editing

2493996
restrict	shared
feel free to shared little tricks and idioms but try to restrict yourselves to core and contrib

2494099
outputstream	inputstream
since many clients can connect to the same server every client will make the server socket generate a new socket that is an opened tcp connection that is returned from .accept through which you can send and receive using its inputstream and outputstream

2494110
stdout	stderr
stderr needs to be redirected to stdout

2494112
width	height
you want scenerect not just width and height

2494311

2494347
entities	entitymanager
given jpa annotated entities is it possible to generate before runtime the list of queries that will be performed by hibernate for crud operations performed against entitymanager

2494359
factors	matrix
there doesn t appear to be a way you can initialize lu with a pre-existing upper triangular matrix lu s constructor makes no assumptions and just starts factors but i would think you could either use it as is and live with the performance hit of the redundant factors or just take solve method and adapt it to your needs

2494386
width	height
i m not an expert on css but isn t using style a better idea than width height attributes

2494412
awt	swing
what component would you choose to display xml data in a awt swing java gui

2494439
realloc	calloc
secondly comment 2 why did you call calloc when the realloc on a double pointer was called previously..

2494439
realloc	calloc
assume n has value of 5 then realloc is called on double pointer a meaning now calloc is called thus has a new block of memory.

2494520
x86	64bit
my development workstation is running 64bit windows 7 and i do a fair amount of work with unmanaged code so i immediately checked that the .net assembly and the vc++ library both had x86 targets

2494551
bash	subshell
in addition to the example given in the advanced bash scripting guide referenced by jefromi these examples show how pipes create subshell

2494562

just because you launch an exe doesn t mean its working directory will be the folder it resides in

2494578
lisp	scheme
i m talking lisp scheme style macros

2494587
post	put
on the post put request you have to reconstruct the actual entities touched

2494660
pull	push
now as you note you can build both push and pull style iterators easily if you have coroutines available

2494666
width	height
so i render a table within a div inside some height width contrained relatively positioned element

2494679
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
on the domain root i placed wide-open crossdomain.xml and clientaccesspolicy.xml files

it s better to worry about having enough memory to cache the indexes in ram and leave the data on disk

2494811
folder	directory
changing the current directory to the plugins folder

2494817
post	get
you can call request.getparameter value1 to get the post data value

if you create a simple button and then choose edit template - edit a copy blend will automatically generate a style area along with all the button states mouseenter mouseleave pressed etc

2494942
aggregate-functions	sum
still the join resolution might not make a lot of sense but you could be using some other aggregate-functions sum avg etc. joined to the grouped month

2494946
put	get
how can i make my menuitem get those .txt files and put the filenames in the menuitem so that it creates a list of all .txt files in that folder

2494963
spaces	delimiter
the solution if you indeed deem it correct to break up string tokenizer class into three words would be to pass add the non-breaking spaces as delimiter to the stringtokenizer class resp

2494996
put	get
put another way if i convert foo to bytes i get 112 111 111

2495044
mouseup	mousedown
assuming a popup menu is open and the mouse exists the leftdown leftup events are fired i know this works as i log them in nslog s for mousedown and mouseup the timer is invalidated but the pop up menu is still showing and the other button clicked on by the fake events doesn t show anything

2495044
mouseup	mousedown
also the whole thing gets into a loop and there s frantic mousedown mouseup being sent for some reason

2495061
firefox	safari
this can be reproduced on both firefox 3.6 and safari 4.0.4

2495061
firefox	safari
i m really clueless i was wondering if x is maybe a reserved keyword in js firefox safari

2495135
post	get
i have set up the parameters for the client and i have created a http post object to be sent but for some reason when i excute the request i get a reposnse that says the get method is not supported which is true cause i have only made a dopost method in my servlet

2495142
phpmyadmin	heidisql
you should run your queries at the command line or through something like phpmyadmin heidisql etc

2495163
getter	setter
since you are putting the xmlelement on the fields it is grabbing both your public getter setter methods and any field w xmlelement on it

2495222
gif	png
for performance reasons you wouldn t want to configure apache to not send certain file types gif jpg png etc to php for handling

2495256
directx	directdraw
i m rendering using directx mobile with directdraw as a fallback path

2495260
outputstream	inputstream

2495416
integer	unsigned
no unsigned integer types

2495439
debian	linux	debian	centos	centos	linux	redhat	fedora
now the interesting thing here is that this behavior happens only on redhat linux and clones fedora centos etc. while on debian systems the memory is returned back to the os after all freeing is done

2495479
google-chrome	firefox
just to elaborate here .contentdocument property works in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie 8

2495612
int	chars
some people think they can say new this foo x int x +7 within the body of foo foo chars

2495654
cpu	processors
when executing on a machine with multiple processors does flushing thread-local memory simply refer to the flushing of the cpu cache into ram

2495686
pull	push
if users from site b can ssh into site a they should be able to push pull directly from the repo on site a - push pull via ssh is one of the main ways to work with remotes in git

2495686
pull	push
if you really have bad bandwidth limitations and need to push pull very frequently i suppose this could indeed be a performance problem

2495708
octal	decimal
you can convert between octal and decimal with the functions octdec and decoct

2495712
width	height
now to create an image you create an instance of your transcoder and pass it the desired width and height by setting transcodinghints

2495763
int	chars
if the signatures of the functions are simple then it should take 10 minutes to setup - ie if they take 2 chars and return an int

2495812
hide	show
i d like to hide and show edittext with animation

2495856
jobs	cron
i am just a solo developer for hobby more or less but the apps i create do actually have production versions that are running on rather frequent cron jobs so its almost like an amateur production environment

2495859
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
if for some reason you want to re-invent the wheel you ll need to set up a function that s called periodically via the settimeout cleartimeout or setinterval and clearinterval functions to control the animation after establishing the state open or closed via a onclick handler

2495861
int	double
re edit i see you want to return boxed types like int double etc

2495890
put	get
however if 2 columns have each have present then those 2 columns should be not be shown anymore and 2 new columns get put in its place with other dropdown lists

2495899
ubuntu	linux
i have something similar working on a linux machine ubuntu 8.10

2495928
portrait	landscape
for example the tag would still say portrait but the actual imageview would still be in landscape layout

2495955
sorting	filtering
you don t want to transfer all that data at once to the client side on a single request and then do the paging filtering sorting actions over there

2495961
mouseup	mousedown
start it on mousedown and stop it on mouseup

2496008
octal	decimal
when you convert with you always get a string in decimal base it doesn t matter if you write the number in octal mode or in decimal mode an int is an int and it has not itself a base

2496038
hash	md5
a simple approach would be to calculate a checksum or hash md5 over the numbers and send this to the client with the data

2496038
hash	md5
convert the numbers to strings concatenate them and calculate the md5 hash over it

2496079
public	protected
if you want to define variables in a function method just declare them without the public private protected

2496095
public	protected
you cannot request a variable from a function therefore it can t be defined as public private protected

2496113
width	height
i have an int of rgb data width height and scanlinestride where i would like to create an nsimage

2496247
user-controls	elementhost
in order to take advantage of the spell checking ability of wpf textboxes i have added one to a user-controls with the use of elementhost

2496259
maven	pom.xml
if you take the core additional stuff more additional stuff approach maven can help because it can track the version of each component pretty cleanly using pom.xml

2496279
udp	tcp
existing extensions allow you access to tcp udp layer but not below

2496287
viewdidload	viewdidappear
for performance reasons set a flag so you don t repeat the same functionality in viewdidload with viewdidappear for the first screen view

2496295
pull	push
the key is to push changes from all instances of a subrepos to its clone master so that other clones that include that subrepos are able to pull that revision if needed

2496297
actionscript	mxml
flex is just the name for the marriage between the mxml markup and actionscript 3 language while flash is the compiled output

2496340
inherited	subclassing
the subclassing should not need to also implement idisposable it is idisposable via inherited

2496341
oncreate	onstart
essentially it s that you can t get a view s height until after oncreate onstart and onpause have all finished because before then the activity hasn t finished drawing itself on the screen

2496388
superclass	subclassing
the child class should override the virtual dispose do any disposing specific to the subclassing and call the superclass dispose which in turn will do its own work

2496393
free	malloc
i encountered similar problems when writing my own memory manager and wanted to overrule malloc and free

2496448
folder	directory
edit once referenced you will have to browse to the install folder of the starter kit to add the reference the dlls will be be copied to the output directory because the copylocal property of the reference in vs will be true so when you publish the project via vs or compile the dlls will be included in the bin folder so no you will not have to install the starter kit on the server also

2496467
folder	directory
usually hosts give you access to at least one directory above that in which case a much better solution would be to create a folder there into which you put your application

2496467
config	ini
assuming your sensitive ini xml files are for use with zend_config the component also supports php arrays for config see example #1 at

2496477
getter	setter
when you put self.myarray you tell xcode to use the getter or setter but when you just do myarray you are responsible for everything right

2496489
put	get
as of now the best method i have is to use php to get the field titles from the first row of the file and then put together a create table query

2496492
int	boolean
i say that the mechanism you are describing is a c style because in c the standard way to handle errors is to return an int that maps to a define and then pass in by reference the value you are looking for in this case a boolean

2496575
client-side	server-side
obviously this has to happen on the server-side for the client-side silverlight app to consume it

2496575
post	get
the more recent the blog post the more likely you are to get this to work

2496581
disk	ram
i need to read system information like cpu ram disk usage in c++

2496599
bibtex	latex
i m using latex and bibtex for an article and i want to able to cite the title of an article i reference

2496628
free	strdup
keep in mind that the char array returned by strdup must be free once you are done with it otherwise you ll have a leak

2496671
width	height
then once you get that scrolllview to work with your app you should have a custom method that calculates the height and the width of the uiviews ie the icons and you uicolor colorwithpatternimage uiimage image so you can give it an image

2496691
mvp	presenter
is the presenter first mvp pattern the same as the passive view

2496718
width	height
position relative the anchor and a dummy div inside that expands at width and height 100 absolutely positioned to overlay the anchor exactly

2496719
portrait	landscape
if i have the portrait view up and the device rotates i push the landscape view and then pop the landscape view when it return to portrait

2496719
portrait	landscape
these are the two methods i used to swap out my portrait and landscape views

2496719
portrait	landscape
when the device rotates back to portrait it pops the landscape

2496733
free	malloc
the code highlights the programmer s responsibility to manage the memory - for every malloc there s a free if not you have a memory leak

2496745
nsstring	nserror
this is actually not how i do it though - i simply created a generic myhttprequest wrapper class that is the delegate of the nsurlconnection it accepts a url nsstring post body processes all the network stuff and returns an nsstring result and an nserror to the caller - a little bit higher abstraction

2496761
width	height
for example if my window is 200px by 200px and the user wants to resize it i want the ratio between the width and the height at 1 1 so that if the new width is 400px the new height is forced to 400px

2496798
superclass	subclassing
how do i pass the e.getx and e.gety from the mousehandler subclassing to its superclass jpanel

2496798
getter	setter
i tried with getter setter super and cant get the data transfer between subclass and parent class

2496812
int	boolean
boolean hasnextint returns true if the next token in this scanner s input can be interpreted as an int value in the default radix using the nextint method

2496879
printf	fgets
use printf to print your prompt then use fgets to read the reply

2496882
many-to-many	one-to-many
here assuming this really is a one-to-many relation between message and groupassoc and not a many-to-many relation between message and group entities you should have something like this

2496965
versioning	upgrade
you might want to upgrade to the express versioning of sql server which is free and can handle databases up to 4gb

2496966
mp4	h.264
and to transcode to mp4 h.264 aac same bitrates assuming vlc supports m4a aac audio

2496966
mp3	ogg
just for giggles i also use the html5 audio element when available and here s how i transcode an mp3 to ogg vorbis using lame and vorbis-tools at 128kbps vbr and high quality

2496978
g++	gcc
the cpath environment variable is much like the path environment variable it is a colon separated list of directories except that the directories in that variable will automatically be used by gcc and g++ as if they were specified on the commandline with the -i flag headers will be searched in those paths

2497082
iprincipal	iidentity
implement custom iidentity and iprincipal types and somehow hook these into formsauthentication

2497147
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to set up subversion on ubuntu linux

2497164
dictionary	map
and you can refer to a map dictionary as a map whether backed by a red-black tree or a hashtable

2497183
ubuntu	linux
if you re not running linux i recommend booting a ubuntu live cd just for the wealth of simple-yet-effective command line utilities

2497266
width	height
width and height or in other words a

2497280
post	get
if i could get the same model objects value that were sent to the page to post with the page that would help

2497308
width	height
i found this post about making the body 100 border around 100 body height and width html 4.01 strict but it doesn t add scrollbars

2497344
g++	gcc
is there an environment variable for gcc g++ to look for .h files during compilation

2497358
firefox	safari
one more quick plug for jquery if you try to do this with straight js you ll run into issues with ie not supporting the same height properties as firefox and safari

2497364
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to be regardless of browser ie firefox google-chrome and platform windows mac linux

2497371
put	get
it s most likely some kind of hack they ve put together to get a cool effect but i don t know how easily reproducible this is

2497401
hash	md5
i just compiled a simple console application under .net 1.1 and 2.0 that performs a md5 hash and they both produce the same value

2497401
hash	salt
another thing to check is if the method you re using a uses salt that you ve forgotten about that would certainly cause different hash to be generated

2497411
countif	sumifs
the desired functionality is similar to that of sumifs or countif but neither of those return data that is necessary

2497478
min	max
i took the coordinates min x min y max x max y of the sprite image

2497480
bibtex	latex
trying to get bibtex to extract the title for you by means of a latex command is possible but it would require that you

2497498
ant	maven
i can t take the chance that some plugin i ve installed for my latest project maven based will interfere with the build process of one of the legacy systems ant based

2497563
maven	m2e
the best approach is to run maven clean from the eclipse plugin i use m2e and this seems to work well

2497618
typemock	moles
unless you use typemock or moles you can t

2497623
temp	tmp
clean up your temp directory in the system tmp directory or any staging files in the user s web root home directory

2497666
profiling	benchmarking
before you spend a lot of time benchmarking spend some time profiling and looking for hot spots

2497681
fadein	hide
i m kind of new to jquery i really don t know how to code in the hide so that it hide the following code from begin displayed until clicked and then have it fade in using the fadein

2497681
fadein	hide	hide	show
can some one show me how to code in the hide and fadein correctly into my jquery code

2497748
maven	pom.xml
you could use the maven help plugin with the effective pom.xml to see if it comes out right for idea

2497759
datediff	difference
you can use the datediff function to get the difference in days between tbl_stuff.dateadded and curdate

2497824
qnetworkrequest	qiodevice
i think put const qnetworkrequest qiodevice will read only chunk-by-chunk from qiodevice

2497906
directx	gdi
if you want wide compatibility with handheld devices that have no hardware 3d acceleration every desktop computer for many years has supported render targets then you might have an easier time using gdi instead of directx

2497937
httphandler	httpmodule
i m more interested in learning about the under the hood plumbing that goes on to implement the framework on top of asp.net do they use httphandler httpmodule

2498020
hash	salt
the salt is appended to the converted string and hash

2498020
hash	salt
the salt is appended to the hash

2498030
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome 4 and firefox 3.6 but i load it up in ie8 and somehow the ajax call fails

2498030
google-chrome	firefox
is there anything blatantly wrong with my ajax call here that could be preventing me from seeing it in ie where it works in firefox google-chrome

2498063
width	height
if you know the height width of that div for instance it will be 100px x 200px then you can do it like this

2498141
post	get
so whenever you get id of a page or post you can redirect or show link to that page post

2498165
voip	sip
asterisk is a server software which can connect various voip clients iax sip etc

2498165
voip	sip
if you just want to have voip between 2 computers then install asterisk on one of them and install some kind of iax or sip softphone on both

2498171
accessor	properties
that syntax informs cocoa that it should use the properties accessor to set the value of filteredlistcontent which will then send the appropriate retain and release messages for you

2498183
free	malloc
in c i would use malloc and later free

2498309
explode	implode
this is more or less a follow up question to something i had previously posted regarding comma separated values explode implode

2498378
free	malloc
the advantage of the c++ new operators over c s malloc and free is that the former throws an exception if there is not enough memory rather than returning null

2498405
width	height
i don t know how to access the width height information of the image

2498408
inherited	properties
dependency properties is another type of properties that can notify when its value change also it can inherited and support multiple provider

2498411
rss	feed
if you just want to display it look for a weather site with an rss feed

2498418
rss	feed
â yahoo has a weather rss feed

2498419
int	chars
those factory release methods should take only pod types if they need any paramaters plain-old-data int chars etc.

2498423
flyweight-pattern	singleton
in essence it can be seen as a degenerated case of flyweight-pattern or a use of proxy over singleton

2498451
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	binary
hex octal binary with preceding 0x or 0x etc

2498473
portrait	landscape
despite the landscape mode the device is when the app starts the alertview always shows in portrait

2498480
width	height
there is no direct way since you have to wait the image to be loaded to access width and height

2498505
sorting	grouping
this avoids the cost of client side sorting and hash manipulations for grouping

2498522
jsf	seam
consider using seam with jsf

2498539
inherited	properties
the values for a dependency properties can also be inherited from an ancestor - which is really useful for things like datacontext

2498540
opera	firefox
it looks like you found a bug in opera because it works in ie 8 and firefox 3.6

2498556
hide	show

2498724
post	get
change from get to post

2498787
iprincipal	iidentity
i ve already implemented iprincipal and iidentity

2498800
width	height
the default .aspx and .htm test pages are designed to allow the plugin to do that you just need to move the width and height properties from the usercontrol to the inner layoutroot element and set the layoutroot to have center horizontalalignment and verticalalignment

2498806
post	get
you could post a few examples of your garbled filenames as raw bytes encoded in hex to get a more definite answer

2498845
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested it with ie and firefox as well but there i couldn t see a suspicious rise of memory-usage compared to google-chrome

2498877
mvp	presenter
the mvp pattern used in presenter first approach is a slight variation around the passive view described by martin fowler

2498979
min	max
if you know min and max of the integer sequence and min 0 create an array min max filled with zeros
