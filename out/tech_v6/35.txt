reiserfs obsolete really awesome for lookups zfs xfs and ntfs all have fantastic hashing algorithms linux ext4 looks promising too

3304651
min	max
for my example i ll be using a min of 20 000 and a max of 20 000 000 for output because that s what i needed when i sat down to figure this out

3304651
min	max
since i am basically going to increase by 1000 times from min to max i want 10 3 so my slider is going to be 0-3 10 0 evaluates to 1

int	chars
and compiling as c++ will give a different result unless you re using an unusual platform where int and chars are the same size

3304941
post	get
also anyone know of a resource to learn about get post as i haven t ran into these concepts before

microsoft explained to me that since the common use of the itemssource property of the datagridcomboboxcolumn is to bind it to staticresource or to any other resource that is not different for each row it s evaluated with the datagrid once not per row so in order to update the itemssource for each row individually a datagridtemplatecolumn and an inner combobox which this one s itemssource does bind per row

3308870
fast-forward	merge
if the repository is at some point at the last commit then updates are made and you pull the pull should always be a fast-forward which by definition cannot cause merge conflicts

3308914
rss	feed
you can easily scrap any existing web page into an rss feed for example with just an xslt file serving as the binding

3308975
put	get
in theory yes because you can build a custom toast from a layout in xml but i tried to put a button in it and couldn t get it to register the click

3308995
onchange	onblur
give your function a name and attach it to onblur or onchange

3309048
portrait	landscape
you can rotate the image to landscape mode but what i want to be able to do is when the back button is pushed and the app returns to the previous screen i was the app to automatically rotate to give a portrait view

3309070
hide	show
you see the video titles are arranged in a chapter - wise manner using javascript to hide show chapter title

3309079
width	height
b i can t seem to rely on the width or height property of the image when loaded

3309093
uicontrol	uiresponder
for more information take a look at uicontrol documentation and uiresponder documentation

3309165
range	median
each query has a range l r and you are to find the median of the given range l r

3309180
post	get
get or post

3309182
portrait	landscape
if the previous view controller supports landscape but you want it to rotate to portrait if it was originally in portrait you can probably force it by changing what shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation returns when navigating back

3309208
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
this might not actually switch back the orientation so if this alone doesn t work you might have to call setstatusbarorientation animated on uiapplication in your table view controller s viewwillappear or viewdidappear methods

3309215
fadein	fadeout
the images should change from one to the other with a fadein fadeout effect

3309236

i decided to put some executable on prebuild event of the setup project and that .exe will parse .vdproj file get every single file name involved in installation and calculate its hash and save this information into an encoded file

3309321
ubuntu	debian
the use is not widespread yet but it s now part of debian testing and ubuntu lucid lynx in addition to godi so you can expect a number of people to test it for bugs

3309328
hide	show
you just need to apply a click handler on the chapters and hide show the content

3309351

3309464
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works for firefox and google-chrome safari does it right anyway

3309485
width	margin
this is called margin collapsing and what actually happens is that because the outer div the width 200px is empty it takes its children margin and uses it instead of the children

3309549
stdout	stderr
there is a option to display error to stderr instead of stdout so you won t see them on you webpage but only in the logs

3309563
accessor	properties
self.text is not an object it is a properties which means it is the pair of accessor -text and -settext if it has an instance variable backing it and it has retain or copy semantics you must release the instance variable in -dealloc

3309564
inline	inlining
whether a particular lambda expression is inline is entirely dependent upon the compiler and whether it decides it is worth inlining

3309575
inline	inlining
short version you can t guarantee it s inlining or non-inlining but you should trust your compiler and if in doubt make it easy and simple to inline

3309599
firefox	safari
is there an easy way to have a daemon listening for changes in the filesystem and when there is one to send a refresh message to firefox or safari

3309654
rss	feed
i can see where to get an rss feed for the bug list however i would like to get rss updates for modifications to current bugs if possible

3309675

this yields an array width height which you can extract a 0 for width etc.

3309708
qpushbutton	qframe
say there is a qpushbutton named draw a qlineedit and a qframe

3309755
decoder	encoder
if so you can simply use the unicode string encoder to decoder it

3309858
freemarker	velocity
you can certainly choose freemarker velocity and other cool viewer but if your entire team is already comfortable dealing with jsp you need to take account of your project deadline and all the learning curves when taking on a new technology

3309869
google-chrome	firefox
problem is that in google-chrome works fine in firefox and ie when popoutimageurl is defined when i hover over the 1st vertical submenu it expands to half the screen

3309892
mouse	keyboard	hid	keyboard
anyway i do not think adobe flash player supports officially other hid devices rather then keyboard or mouse

3309927
setinterval	settimeout
i would suggest looking into the settimeout setinterval functions in javascript that will call a specific function after the time has elapsed

3309946
google-chrome	safari
i don t use safari or google-chrome too much so i don t know about options there

3309963

3309963
haskell	agda
you can probably implement them in languages with more expressive type systems such as scala haskell ml agda epigram guru

3310027
width	height
this waits till the image is loaded to grab the height and width

3310030
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if you need to build a complex web app now silverlight can do it and even though some browsers like google-chrome safari and firefox have already implemented parts of html5 the support is too jagged to allow you to build a stable cross-browser application

3310036
width	height
in jquery-frameddialog.js i changed the width and height to be 100 not px and then changed the fix for jqueryui 1.7 to be the following instead

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in other terms i want to load a css file only if it is safari firefox o google-chrome

3310137
versioning	upgrade
i made changes to the database to support a new versioning new tables etc and i want the diagram be be part of the upgrade script

3310158
rss	feed
obviously it s impractical to keep a full history in your rss feed if you have a frequently updated site

3310158
rss	feed
sites like the bbc would end up with rss feed several mb long if that were the case

3310186
inherited	properties
but perhaps there is a use case with nested inherited classes or perhaps where a get set might contain logic instead of just giving back the value of the properties although i would tend to keep properties strictly simple and let explicit methods do any logic getencodedpassword

3310229
mouseover	mouseenter
instead of mouseover which fires when entering the child element as well use mouseenter like this

3310229
mouseover	mouseenter
the mouseenter event differs from mouseover in the way it handles event bubbling

3310241
inherited	properties
perhaps there is a use case with nested inherited classes or perhaps where a get set might contain logic instead of just giving back the value of the properties

3310241
getter	setter
i personally use this even when i don t need logic on the getter or setter of a property

3310241
getter	setter
this gives you a public getter but keeps the setter private

3310289
range	median
this is called the range median query problem

3310289
range	median
the following paper might be relevant towards optimal range median

3310289
range	median
higher-dimensional range median

3310289
range	median
reduces a range median query to a

3310339
width	height
isn t the masterpage height and width just the document s height and width

3310339
width	height
and by offsetwidth and offsetheight do you mean you want the width and height

3310339
width	height
use jquery s width and height methods

3310340
integer	unsigned
i am lead to believe that the size of a std string object is limited to size of an unsigned integer on the architecture of your system

3310358
implements	extends
you may find google reflections useful to find classes implements extends a certain interface superclass in the classpath

3310440
mongoid	mongomapper
if you can go with mongoid or mongomapper embedded versioned documents are sweet

3310464
draggable	droppable
it sounds like both controls use the jquery ui draggable and droppable widgets and that you have a preliminary approach

3310464
post	get
i would encourage you to post your code when you are done or if you get stuck along the way.

3310477
getter	setter
create a deep copy of mrootdata both in the getter and the setter

3310477
getter	setter
or remove the getter and setter altogether possibly together with moving data processing methods from other classes into the singleton where these can be properly guarded by mutexes

3310497
inherited	properties
basically every properties of a parametersbase derived class that inherited from type parametersbase is recursed into and flattened into a single list of parameters

3310501
int	chars
i have another function b and it takes a chars and returns an int and a function c that accepts int and returns a bool

3310501
boost	stl
i know boost bind works but i am looking for stl solution

3310548
draggable	droppable
but i ve gone away from draggable droppable and simply want the user to click the button and have it duplicated in the other list

3310551
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works with internet explorer 8 and firefox 3.6 but not with google-chrome 5

3310582

even though i put it into the footertemplate you should be able to get the point

3310704
pull	push
once you ve verified that the users can push pull properly with the new remote you can delete the copy from the old machine

3310737
boost	stl
when a function should take a shared_ptr from boost or c++11 stl are you passing it

3310790
jstl	taglib
use tag of the jstl core taglib

3310790
jstl	taglib
use fn escapexml function of the jstl functions taglib

3310796
super	extends
also seems like you should be using extends in the generics instead of super unless i m just misunderstanding what you re trying to do

3310799
post	get
a form on the get version of the page with method post will result in the post version getting called

3310819

cannot connect subclipse to visualsvn on windows 7

3310857
post	get
pure http - using get and post - this may be badly extensible

check your header footer to make sure that nothing is wider than your page width and check that there are no elements which extend into the left or right margin

3310957
mvp	presenter
in a gui app using mvp mvvm say the presenter viewmodel presents a list collection and one or more of the items can be selected at a time

3310961
versioning	upgrade
if you experience this issue after upgrading to nunit 2.5.5 then you will need to upgrade nant to the latest versioning for me it was .91 alpha

3310979
affinity	processors
on windows you can use setthreadaffinitymask to set the processors affinity for a thread

3310999
cpu	affinity
in windows for example you can do that in the task manager by locating the process in the processes tab rightclicking the process in question usually java.exe choosing set affinity and tick the cpu s cores

3311031
try-catch	exception-handling
without the try-catch block the exception-handling propagates out of main where terminate is called

submit	submission
when submission a form with extjs i can see the form items have values with this code just before the submit

3311225
sorting	filtering
how can i create one view that does all of that sorting and filtering combined

3311249
hide	show
the special one uses some custom css from here to hide the calendar part so only the month years show up

3311255
getter	setter
if logging.config.fileconfig some.log is the setter what s the getter

3311257
google-chrome	firefox
i have a horizontal cfmenu inside of a div and in ie7 ie7 firefox google-chrome the menu is floated to the right as specified in my css but in ie6 the menu shifts to the left of the div that contains it and it s width expands beyond the boundaries of the containing div

mouseleave	mouseenter
but if i have a photo inside photo div which on mouseenter will be replaced with the flash movie everything brakes the movie isn t loaded properly and it isn t replaced promptly with fff on mouseleave

3311283
ienumerable	idictionary
i want to create a read-only keyed collection that implements idictionary k v and ienumerable v

3311283
idictionary	ilist
one thought that comes to mind is providing members that return the desired view of the data member x.list ilist v and member x.dict idictionary k v

3311337
ubuntu	debian
if using ubuntu lucid use the tutorial here which is based on the debian package

3311346
firefox	safari
no big deal - this is an internal app and i can tell people to use firefox or ie but i know that some of them do use safari

3311350
ienumerable	iqueryable
i believe the asenumerable just tells the compiler which extension methods to use in this case the ones defined for ienumerable instead of those for iqueryable

3311393
goto	break
i would never use a goto as the target of another goto so if there s some additional processing at the end of the function use break exit for otherwise just return early

3311432
int	double
but because the nodes don t use int double etc

3311508
width	height
public images logo.png width 338px height 63px div

3311599
ubuntu	linux
when i push the app to my linux production server ubuntu running apache2 nginx pdb it no longer works on the site

3311646
hide	show
if your setup is more complex you might want to create a list of fields that should be visible for each item in your combo box and then show hide using the same technique

3311647
width	margin
if i put a position relative on your id main-inner and either on the id content i change the left margin from 240px to 239px or change the id sidebar-left width from 240px to 239px it seems to work

3311745
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the firefox or mozilla plugin will be used by all mozilla based browsers firefox google-chrome safari and you will therefore be able to use the same javascript to detect the firefox plugin in all of these browsers and therefore determine whether your plugin custom protocol application is installed

3311758
fadein	fadeout
what is the difference between fadein vs fadeout vs fadeto

3311788
implements	extends
i have not found a lot of times when implements an interface would be a better system than extends a superclass

3311788
implements	extends
so when do you implements an interface and when do you extends a superclass

3311791
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
if you must have an open-source .net ide you have two choices that i m aware of monodevelop and sharpdevelop

3311831
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
if you only want to inherited method signatures name arguments return type in the subclassing use an interface but if you also want to inherited implementation code use a superclass

3311904
centos	linux
we have a few linux based centos virtual machines which are to be used as distributable virtual appliances

3311930
inherited	properties	children	parent
if #parent of any generation back says all my children who meet qualification x in your case span are going to be given an inherited of y whatever css properties it doesn t matter what the single individual #child wants it needs the authority of the #parent to get it if the parent has stated otherwise

3311951
inherited	properties
i think that interfaces work best when you use them to express that the object has a certain properties or behavior that spans multiple inherited trees and is only clearly defined for each class

3311951
inherited	properties	comparator	comparable
if you wanted to create a class comparable to be extended by other classes it would have to be very high on the inherited tree possible right after object and the properties it expresses is that two objects of that type can be compared but there s no way to define that generally you can t have an implementation of comparator directly in the comparable class it s different for every class that implements it

3311964
inherited	subclassing
is it ok to simply not subclassing or inherited

3311965
hide	show
when i click the currently displayed div i want to hide it and show the other one

3311989
ssl	https
if you start with a trusted https website you can make cross-domain tls ssl xmlhttprequests to the web servers that are running your application

3311999
width	height
flexible width and height on the other hand work as you would expect

3312022
subclass	abstract-class
you then subclass that abstract-class to provide the concrete implementations for a and b

3312033
superclass	subclassing
i use very little subclassing because it tightly couples the subclassing to the superclass and makes your code really hard to read

3312038
folder	directory
a copy of the folder in the directory with copies of the files placed in their original places in the original directory

3312064
inherited	properties
i ve created a base class from which all business objects inherited but i am not able to figure out how to fill individual object properties from a common method

3312074
public	protected
groovy won t add accessors if the member is declared with an access modifier private protected or public

3312084
getter	setter
the first thing i see is that the getter and setter is not public

3312089
abstract-class	superclass
you can think of extends from a superclass if the derived class is of the same type.i mean that when a class extends an abstract-class they both should be of the same type the only difference being that the superclass has a more general behavior and the sub class has a more specific behavior

3312104
put	get
if you get 3 data sources as csv files and want to put them into three different object models and maybe persist them into a database you could create a csv transformer base and then override some methods when you inherit from it in order to handle the different specific objects

3312106
vsto	add-in
i have a vsto word add-in i ve been developing for awhile

3312108
rss	feed
then they can all be thrown to an rss feed easily to provide lists of things on your web page

3312147
stdout	fflush
based on the symptom of output not appearing on the terminal i suggested that you add fflush stdout prior to the getchar call

3312147
stdout	fflush
i just guessed that your printf output was going into a buffer and that calling fflush stdout would cause that buffer to be sent to the terminal solving your symptom

3312164
pop-up	dialog
when the user pushes a button the dialog pop-up with a form-editing screen in the iframe

3312217
put	get
i don t care how a list adds removes elements so long as i can call add something and get 0 to put and get elements

3312224
rss	feed
i m trying to write some xsl to style an rss feed

3312274
width	height
it removes the standard take picture etc buttons and replaces it with a black bar with the same width height of the default overlay

3312299
min	max
ps also note that in many database engines apart from mysql it is illegal to use a group by clause and then selecting columns without aggregating them via functions like min max or count

3312300
fiddler	charles
the real thing is that you can t hide anything from a sniffer like fiddler wireshark charles so a dynamic token is probably the only way to go resorting to https amf and anything palliative for securing the transport layer will just be an extra as your primary token would still be in the clear.

3312305
superclass	subclassing
if a class depends on a method of a superclass and the superclass changes the implementation of that method in some release the subclassing may break

3312305
inherited	subclassing
is it ok to simply not subclassing or inherited

3312310
folder	directory
i have an image named 5.jpg that has been put in a sub-folder that is in every folder in a directory

3312362
int	chars
the code works fine as long as sortvalue is an int labelid is an int as well or int separated by the delimiter chars sortvalue 420|421| compares against 420 and 421

3312362
int	chars
no problem when the string results were guaranteed to contain only numeric chars but sql refuses to cast understandably the non-numeric string to an int throwing out an error

3312388
hash	md5
i create a md5 hash from a salt.data1.data2

3312388
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
the z in your explanation becomes the md5 hash calculated from salt + data1 + data2.

3312394
width	height
i am trying to set the top gridview s column s width to the body s column width and then the left columns height to the body s coloumns height

jquery	simplemodal
i ve used one jquery plugin actually simplemodal plugin in my page

3312402
hash	salt
hash and salt

3312402
hash	salt
if your only goal is to verify the originality of x and y you can create a salt hash out of the two values

3312402
hash	salt
this means that you re taking x y and a salt password known by both the server and the client and create a hash out of it

3312442
accessor	properties
my implementation of inotifypropertychanged was pretty stock just fired the event from the setter of the properties accessor with a string value containing the respective properties name

3312442
button	checkbox
if i comment out the event notification code in the property set for the boolean propery being set by the aforementioned bulk-edit button the hang goes away entirely and the grid is snappy again -- but i sacrifice the grid updates the checkbox column cells do not update.

3312457
free	malloc
you will need a pointer that will hold the value returned by malloc so that you can free it later

3312492
inherited	properties
inherited seems to pop up mostly when i m storing collections of things where the different kinds of things will have data properties in common

3312502

i m trying to config a wcf service for silverlight to use either http or https and it works fine with iis but not the web server built into visual studio cassini

3312769
cassini	iis
this works great with iis but not cassini

3312799
mouse	keyboard
you can set up a hook to monitor among others keyboard and mouse events

3312799
mouse	keyboard
in particular there are only two that you can use the low-level keyboard and mouse hooks known as wh_keyboard_ll and wh_mouse_ll

3312855
uiview	subviews
in the loadview method of the view controller class allocate and initalize the uiview object and add your text fields to it as subviews

3313030
width	height
i m trying to make a div with a static height and variable width

3313038
superclass	subclassing
in the standard insertion pattern you have a machine generated superclass and then a human written subclassing

3313038
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
automatic alterations of the machine class are transparently inherited by the human-written class see mogenerator for a good objective-c example of this. in the reverse insertion pattern you would have a human-written superclass and then the machine generated with macro expansion subclassing

when attempting to listen to any .wav file in firefox or google-chrome in ubuntu haven t tested other oses yet the plugin errors location not found. however right-clicking and choosing save link as allows the user to download the .wav file

3313153
children	parent
here i d like to find some potential errors in the file a children doesn t have any mutation from his parent using drools

3313155
width	height
the biggest thing that +imagenamed does is decode the image data from the source file which almost always significantly inflates the data size for example a screen sized png file might consume a few dozen kbs when compressed but consumes over half a mb decompressed - width height 4

3313187
post	put
however when i add or update a record the json produced for the post put has the data nested under a root field

3313232
getter	setter
before auto properties were around people would implement the getter and omit the setter for properties which are meant to be read-only

3313279
public	protected
the theory is that someone extending your class with protected access knows more about what they are doing than someone who is merely using it with public access

3313282
d3.js	protovis
the team behind protovis has since created d3.js so this is likely a better option than protovis

3313378
mvp	presenter
in an mvp pattern if your model exposes some properties for your presenter i would write

3313416
addclass	removeclass
i believe you re looking for addclass and removeclass

3313427
min	max
with more complex data types the set can be ordered with some other key that can be unrelated to the min max values

3313443
inherited	derived-class	inherited	base-class	base-class	derived-class
imho the primary reason to use inherited is to allow code which was written to operate upon a base-class object to operate upon a derived-class object instead

3313458
getter	setter
here s the uservo without the getter setter

3313513
width	height
for example i used to try and get the screen height and width in the oncreate but it doesn t work because it s not set up yet

3313566
width	height
width 530 height 410 id usa_locator align

3313566
width	height
xmlfile1 app_themes theme1 usa_locator.xml quality high wmode transparent bgcolor #f5f5f5 width 530 height 410 name usa_locator align

3313598
folder	directory
i can see website when i have the plugins directory not named plugins which changing it to any name will not show up in the wp system since it requires a folder by that name

3313679
gif	png	tiff	png	docx	xlsx
i developed a mass file up loader a swing application recently.one of the new requirements is to support uploading thousands of documents gif jpg png docx xlsx each of these are like 3mb-10mb of size and we don t want to upload these huge files we generally support tiff files which has small byte size like 60kb-100kb

3313727
client-side	server-side
but javascript is for client-side code only and should not be used for server-side for security reasons and you could use ajax jquery to retrieve and send data to server but that depends on your needs and application

3313731
stdout	stderr
change the destination of the stdout using system#setout and eventually also the stderr

3313731
stdout	stderr
this will redirect all stdout stderr to tomcat s logfile

3313731
stdout	stderr
using stdout stderr instead of logger is a poor practice

3313731
stdout	stderr
replace all stdout stderr calls by a fullworthy logger like the currently legacy log4j or its successor slf4j which gives you a high degree of freedom in configuring the logged information logging destination logging format etcetera

3313774
ocl	uml
the benefit of defining ocl constraints on your models is the possibility of specifying all the business rules of your domain that you cannot represent with the graphical constructs of the uml for instance multiplicities are constraints that can be graphically represented as part of an association definition saying that the attribute a of class c has to be greater than 5 is also a constraint but in this case has to be defined in ocl since uml does not provide a graphical syntax for this

3313799
width	height
you need to retrieve the canvas image data using the method getimagedata x y width height and then modify each pixel with values from your byte array

3313813
width	height
we def need some code but perhaps you re not setting the parent objects to some height or width

3313834
viewdidload	viewwillappear
are awakefromnib viewdidload viewwillappear being called at all

3313904
int	boolean
on some platforms with no built-in boolean datatype the int constant that serves as a logical true is -1 - all one bits

3313911
hide	show
#front and #back and a div for toggling which div is displayed in the foreground.the effect i am after is not a show and hide as both divs are displayed at the same time but only one can be in the foreground

3313996
folder	directory
to do this decided to turn my home folder into a git directory and ignore everything except for a few select files and directory

3314113
hash	md5
this is for the purpose of having a nice short url which refers to an md5 hash in a database

3314142
folder	directory
the only problem is the -i flag which installs the compiled module into the modules directory of apache requires root or administrator privileges to access that folder

3314228
inherited	properties
if you don t want to use inherited for some reason you can keep one object inside the other and redirect calls to the other s properties from the outer object dynamically via magic methods like __get and __set see here

3314237
mouseleave	mouseenter
we re using mouseenter and mouseleave because these are the events that .hover binds to

3314241
move	drag
ultimately i want to be able to create a drag and drop interface where users can move files between catalogs of any format

3314242
portrait	landscape
obviously on portrait view fewer slides can fit in per row than on landscape view

3314288
textchanged	keyup
i would recommend binding an event handler to the textchanged event that invokes the keyup event

3314322
hash	md5
basically you have 16-bytes of data in the md5 hash string

3314331
int	chars
and you still can t store that number in a plain 32-bit int - if you drop to 5 chars you once again reduce the space to just under one billion 916 132 832 but now you have something that can fit in a signed 32-bit int albeit it is somewhat wasteful

3314351
cvs	svn
doing this in svn or worse yet cvs would mean pain and suffering

3314369
put	get
similarly if you want each property to belong to only one category you can put a propertyid column in the category table and get rid of the categoryproperty table

3314389
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade cucumber to versioning 0.8.5 but i m getting some unexpected errors with authlogic

3314465
textview	imageview
it displays imageview and textview but two textview are absolutely the same

3314538
hide	show
then it is only a matter of running jquery s show or hide functions on your selected elements

3314541
google-chrome	firefox
but with firefox google-chrome the following is printed

3314546
put	get
actually i usually get a little fancier and put the three groups into their own components

3314550
rss	feed
right i m working on a site with a couple different rss feed

3314557
opera	firefox
when looking at it in ie opera and firefox the actual image looks fine

3314599
implements	extends
extends classes can choose how to implements the abstract methods while they also have the partial implementation provided by the superclass

3314599
implements	extends
java allows only single implementation inheritance whereas it allows multiple interface inheritance meaning that a class can implements multiple interfaces but can extends only one class

3314599
subclass	abstract-class	implements	extends
so choosing a pure abstract-class over the interface will mean that the subclass will not be allowed to extends any other class while implements the abstract methods

3314640
min	max
can functions such as min or max possibly destroy the integrity of a record

3314640
min	max
what if i changed one min to a max

3314650
min	max
i m not sure what you mean by destroying record integrity but there is nothing wrong with calling min or max functions

3314658
mouseover	mouseout
i also tried separating them into mouseover and mouseout events and they don t work as well

3314661
pull	push
you could set up your empty repository on your server and then push and pull from your dev machine

3314670
for-loop	loops
there s absolutely no reason to use a foreach loops instead of a for-loop if i understand your situation

3314674
single-quotes	double-quotes
the shell will expand variables in double-quotes but not in single-quotes

3314679
folder	directory
i have build a vb.net application which uses php command line to run some scripts in a folder in the same directory

3314708
mouseover	mouseout
i have a site with three tabs that i m trying to dynamically add mouseover mouseout event depending on which tab is clicked the problem is that it appears that the mouseover out events are bound to the tab after they re called

3314803
int	double
will work with int double string and anything else which supports the symbol

3314814
min	max
set min size max size

3314816
mouseout	mousedown
the challenge i am trying solve is the fact the dropdown menu spans over the item container and when you move the mousedown to the dropdown menu the itemcontainer mouseout logic kicks in and hides the dropdown menu and item container

3314834
yacc	bison	yacc	jflex	bison	jflex
there are many lexical analyzer and parser generators out there - lex flex and yacc bison jflex and javacup gplex and gppg etc

3314846
cvs	svn
then add a pre-commit hook to cvs or svn that updates that special variable with the new version of the file when a change is committed

3314885
children	parent	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
instead of the mouseover and mouseout events if the elements are children you want the mouseenter and mouseleave events which won t fire when going from parent to child

3314885
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseleave event differs from mouseout in the way it handles event bubbling

3314886
gtk	gdk
i d say reading the source to gtk gdk x11 the x backend to gtk and the source to your favorite couple of wms would go a long way

3314919
ubuntu	linux
i m fairly new to linux ubuntu 10.04 and a total novice to assembler

3314951
getter	setter
hence i have added a list of countries in the user class with the getter and setter method

3314981
jar	war	jar	.war
a war jar file is actually a zip file - if you renamed a .war to a .zip you can use a zip utility to view unzip it

3315001
google-chrome	firefox
when i tried it over google-chrome firefox it worked

3315075
viewdidload	dealloc
one error that a lot of people do on the iphone is allocate memory in a uiviewcontroller s viewdidload method and then release it in the dealloc method instead of the viewdidunload method

3315139
width	height
i don t think your code will work because you are trying to get the width and height of the view that is a child of your popup window

3315139
width	height
since you are anchoring the popupwindow to the v view maybe set the width and height according to the anchor view or at a ratio based on them

3315152
asterisk	pbx
how do i program asterisk pbx using php

3315166

if i wanted to start an ecommerce website say for selling books - i have plenty of options like using oscommerce prestashop opencart spree ubercart etc etc

3315203
google-chrome	firefox
try using google-chrome or firefox to perform a timing-test of a page s resources

3315210
firefox	safari
can t find the source now and just tested firefox and safari and they do download it

3315307
valgrind	callgrind
you may want to look at valgrind callgrind which can track function calls into a pretty graph

3315323
int	boolean
it may be a numeric string boolean false int etc.

3315354
disk	ram
i wish to move this folder to a ram disk so i m trying to see how big this should be set to

3315354
disk	ram
this is only for my development machine to help speed up compiling - temp crap goes to ram instead of the disk

3315389
ddms	adb
i use adb logcat from command line and pipe the output to a file since the ddms has a very limited buffer

3315429
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox 3.6 and google-chrome using xhr.send file just puts the raw contents into the body of the request and it is not a true multipart form-data upload

3315441
kde	gnome
windows xp vista 7 gnome kde osx

3315455
domcontentloaded	onload

3315581
postgresql	mysql
postgresql s interface cleans up on mysql

3315600
children	parent
when initially connected the client requests the immediate children both files and directories just like ls or dir with no options then when a user navigates into a directory this step repeats with the new parent like you might expect

3315608
postgresql	mysql
1 yes there are jdbc drivers for all the major dbms oracle mysql postgresql db2... and also some interesting java dbms like hsql

3315608
postgresql	mysql
2 as far as i know oracle db2 postgresql and probably mysql all have xml column types

3315632
ant	maven
note that ant uses by default as delimiters for token couldn t get it to use maven style delimiters so the log4j.properties became

3315634
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you could use the nsmutablestring method -appendstring or pull the html in through a file with the nsstring method -stringwithcontentsoffile encoding error

3315638
super	extends
also super admin panel means that there is a lot of javascript functions classes and it probably will be harder to extends

3315661
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
in this release a file channel can be obtained from an existing fileinputstream fileoutputstream or randomaccessfile object by invoking that object s getchannel method which returns a file channel that is connected to the same underlying file

3315666
xul	xbl
one of the cool things about xul is that you can create new xul elements using xbl bindings which is very easy to do

3315666
xul	xbl
since your new element will be relatively similar to the built-in xul element you might want to start by looking at its xbl bindings

3315666
google-chrome	firefox
just point your firefox browser at google-chrome global content bindings scale.xml and then maybe you can extend modify it to get what you need

3315689
pull	push
the two part question is what s the best structure for me to work locally push pull to test server and then update live server when test is solid and how do i get it setup from where i m at

3315728
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
more in viewwillappear and viewdidappear

3316110
zen-cart	magento
right now i m looking at zen-cart ubercart and magento as alternatives

3316153
filtering	grouping
although i d be tempted to perform the filtering before the grouping - at which point you can just grouping the row name

3316168
pull	push
you can set up both the repositories as remotes and push pull to and from both of them

3316169
post	get
then you can do a simple ajax request to the same server it could be for anything -- even an empty text file -- and it could also just be an http head request rather than a post or get

superclass	subclassing
i m sitting here with a solution there i have 1 superclass that has 2 subclassing and i m currently mapping this using joinedsubclass but i get that this method is obsolete and says that i should classmap and subclassmap but if i do this the automapping does not work and i don t want that

3316349
temp	tmp
again this one would store per default in files in your temp directory tmp on linux

3316360

3316534
put	get
i started a project on my home pc and then decided to put it in a repository so that i could get the code for development on my laptop and not have to keep transferring files between the two computers and also just to get some practice at using source control

a malloc request for n bytes is serviced by calculating n the closest 2 k n then looking up the first area in the list for k and then returning the first free block in the free-list for the given area

3316598
width	height
the right way to do this is with an absolutely positioned div with width and height set to 100 within the container alongside the text

3316697
stdout	stderr
i m using jam and had to manually redirect 2 1 stdout to stderr console in order to see anything in the tab build problems

3316770
postgresql	mysql
the two most prominent open-source players are postgresql used by stack overflow and mysql

3316770
postgresql	mysql
while mysql has a larger user base postgresql is gaining more an more popularity ever since implementing several crucial features that were missing in earlier versions

3316771
int	double
if not you could have a cache for values but be careful that double can have very many values you might want to fold the double into a known interval from 0 to 1 folds into int from 0 to 99

3316779
serializable	deserialization
serializable means to convert an object into that string and deserialization is its inverse operation

3316823

google-chrome	firefox
it works fine and shows the map correctly in my google-chrome browser by it shows missing plugin in firefox browser

3316955
stdout	stderr
qt creator reads the errors from stderr and stdout and jam probably doesn t output them there or in a way qt creator understands cl.exe

3316969
memcached	apc
for high concurrency i o you may also consider a nosql approach like apc or memcached

3317000
put	get
i either keep a local reference to the objectcontext in which case the second service to use it sees it as disposed and throws and error or i put a wrapper property around the singleton class wherever i need it and then all my changes get thrown away because i m getting a new instance of the object if another call has disposed it

postgresql	mysql
my current thinking is to use a simple mysql postgresql table with a string key and a binary value

portrait	landscape
for example rotating from portrait to landscape it stills shows mylayout.xml from within the layout -folder and not the layout-land -folder as it should

3317511
pop-up	dialog
i am not sure how you can do this prior to office 2007 but in 07 onwards there is an application.getsaveasfilename method which pop-up a save as dialog

is there any simple test i can try to benchmark apc and memcached just to get a sense of the performance benefits of using them

3318102
treeview	treelist
i have developed a generic treelist control in c# which combines a treeview with a listview to obtain a multi-column treeview

3318121
post	get
the questions is how to create kind of generic post action method wich allows to get all this models on post

3318133
imagemagick	mogrify
i have a strange probleam with running imagemagick mogrify on several files

3318168
memcached	apc
play around with different apc memcached settings even disabling them to watch how those figures change.

3318185
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
in fact i ran some tests at dhtml kitchen and found that in firefox opera and google-chrome document.write was actually faster on the first load and comparable in speed of standard html on subsequent refreshes

3318233
inherited	subclassing
i don t know how to handle the inherited i can see that associations are done with pk and fk s but what about subclassing

3318234
jruby	mri
n sort which is written in c in mri and yarv and java in jruby

3318237
for-loop	loops
just rerun the same for-loop in servlet as you did in jsp you truly know loops conditions and do request.getparameter i on every iteration and if necessary add every parameter value to a so that you can easily process it afterwards

3318274
firefox	safari
it s a css3-only feature that only firefox and safari have implemented so far as far as i know

3318306
treeview	treelist
the issue is that i want to keep a generic version of my treelist control but i also want a specialised version that will use a derived treeview control within it

3318323
put	get
so i guess i need either a way to get the contents of the into a property somehow some extended macrodef implementation might have that or i need a sort of that could print out whatever xml tree you put inside

3318347
post	get	post	put	put	get
i am developing a servlet application i was using jwebunit to check all the basic responses but now i have to start using other http methods different to get post put and delete

3318347
post	put
so i found httpunit it looks that have support for what i need post and put methods are available there and i guess i can walk around the delete method through the head which is supported by httpunit

3318352
inline	inlining
i think you are confusing the location of the inline functions object code with the implications of inlining

3318401
mouse	keyboard
i would like to set the boundries of the #character to be #map via keyboard - the boundries work with the mouse

3318468
post	get
if you would like to know how to get rid of the default beamer warnings have a look at this blog post regarding beamer warnings

3318480
client-side	server-side
since the ids weren t being generated server-side as far as i could tell although admittedly i didn t try roatin s solution because i had thought of mine before i saw his answer + mine seemed simpler since i m already doing a bunch of stuff client-side inside javascript i looked around to see what i was already getting and realized that was already getting me an extremely similar value to what i was already looking for only instead of it saying sunlocale it said sunactivity

3318485
cpu	processors
retrieving a dword at an address which isn t divisible by 4 requires at least one extra cpu cycle on a 32 bit processors

3318558
perl	tcl
currently it supports python perl jruby lua javascript beanshell and tcl

3318574
client-side	server-side
or do you already know how you can accomplish this but you re having trouble getting the control via server-side or client-side code so that you can set the maxlength property

3318623
getter	setter
self.bar uses property syntax to access the bar ivar by calling the getter setter methods -bar and -setbar on self

3318623
getter	setter
referring to the ivar directly without self. bypasses the getter setter

3318645
post	get
without passing get post variables to php

3318714
cout	ofstream
is there a way in c++ to check if an ostream object is cout or a ofstream object

3318723
icmp	udp
consider connected udp sockets - you ll get better performance and icmp error reporting

3318743
hide	show	hide	removeclass
removeclass hidden to hide or show the element

3318781
put	get
if not you still start to get a feel for how the project is put together

3318785
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
so i created the clientaccesspolicy.xml and also a crossdomain.xml but now i found out that so called cross-zone - calls are not allowed

3318787
oncreate	ondestroy
the only way i could think of fixing it was using an static instance count that would be incremented when the activities oncreate and decrement when the ondestroy was called

3318794
textview	imageview
you just need to replace the imageadapter by textadapter and put textview in it instead of imageview

3318806
backgrounding	multitasking
as you probably know ios4 introduced multitasking so our application can run in backgrounding - and it is

3318806
backgrounding	multitasking
this solution has one big advantage it does not change default system behavior - users aware of ios4 multitasking usage could still press home button to run app in the backgrounding and close it iphone-way

3318841
post	get
i m using nsurlrequest to get and post data from server

3318856
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
you can use the right tools firefox google-chrome opera to inspect which part of your code is playing tricks with you

3318863
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
now the problem is that - according to the man page - realloc needs a pointer which has been returned by malloc or calloc before

3318863
free	malloc
that s even worse than to expect them to provide a malloc d pointer which would imply that the caller has to free it

3318891
pull	push
set your default path for pull to . to prevent accidentally pushing to the wrong tracking branch when hg push is invoked with no arguments

3318936
realloc	malloc
be aware that if realloc fails it returns a null pointer but the original malloc ed memory is left untouched this is a common source of memory leaks

3319052
folder	directory
i have included separate sub folder in the app_code directory for classes of each language

3319085
children	parent
this looks a bit like composite pattern except that there you can take advantage of the similarity of parent and children in a hierarchical structure to minimize your coding

3319096
hide	show
i ve followed the code from an online sample and it s similar to a lot of the other online examples but when i run it the popup panel will quick show then then hide again

3319096
hide	show
i ve set the targetcontrol to a linkbutton and when i click it it will show the popup triggers a postback then hide it afterwards thus causing a quick flicker

3319125
justmock	typemock
with telerik s justmock product newly available it has a lot of similarities to typemock in the ability to mock concrete classes not just abstract classes or interfaces

3319125
justmock	typemock
seems like justmock might be shy on some of the features typemock has been around for a while but it had some good features

3319205
arc4random	srand
using arc4random over rand and random is simpler because it does not require seeding calling srand or srandom

3319216
memcpy	malloc
if the buffer passed in is too small just malloc a new bigger one and memcpy the content of the passed in buffer to it

3319230
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if you are sure it is not a bom causing the error check your httpd.conf and any .htaccess files if the prepend any other files

3319250
cassini	iis
i try to use elmah on my asp.net mvc2 application it works fine on the test server cassini x86 while using the x86 version but when i deploy it on the production server with the x86_64 version i get a 404 error when i try to access elmah.axd and no errors are logged on iis but they are logged in cassini

3319304
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
one strategy that may or may not be worth the effort ime it isn t is to hide malloc realloc and free behind some kind of memory manager that keeps track of allocated pointers and sizes

3319307
free	malloc
for this reason i would avoid the high frequency use of malloc and free and add the extra complexity of a freelist

3319319
disk	ram
ram and a fast hard disk in this case

3319341
vbscript	vba
some colleagues and i were comparing past languages we had programmed in and were talking about our experience with vbscript with its odd features such as 1-based index instead of 0-based indexes like almost every other language has the reasoning being that it was a language for users excel vba instead of a language for developers

3319352
width	height
overlayimagepixels new int width height

3319358
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a gridview bound to a sqldatasource with a default selectcommand defined as such

unsigned int find_mismatch unsigned chars a unsigned chars b

3319430
accessor	properties
but yes properties accessor are normally heavily optimized

3319495
singleton	facade
a good example of this is the facade that is facades can be implemented as singleton because often one facade object is needed across the system

3319525
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
filtering sorting and grouping

3319527
put	get
i ve put breakpoints on my property set get and they never get hit at all

3319581
mbunit	nunit
it is not as easy to use as nunit mbunit but it seems to work pretty well

3319717
int	chars
ideally it would also work for regular types as well like chars and int in addition to bitfields

3319723
free	malloc
if memory is never free malloc will tend to run pretty fast

3319723
free	malloc
if many blocks of memory are used and free malloc may become quite slow

3319781
google-chrome	firefox
i am building a new input method as an extension of firefox google-chrome

3319801
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
what s happening is that when you resize the column row width height with the gridsplitter it sets the actualheight or actualwidth of the column row

3319826
cstdio	iostream
if it s possible to use cstdio instead of iostream then you can

3319834
postgresql	mysql
php is certainly being helped by the fact that mysql and postgresql to a smaller extent have become so much more powerful

3319911
post	get
all data that gets transmitted including get and post data is encrypted

3319924
typedef	struct
typedef struct mem_info void ptr

3319951
folder	directory
i m storing the javascript css files in a folder called static which is outside of the application directory in codeignitor

3320001
unix	solaris
development happens on unix servers should run on hp-ux solaris at least

3320062
firefox	safari
it may be safari or firefox etc

3320106
bazaar	git
if it s purely a matter of perception - that they perceive git to be too complex try suggesting mercurial or bazaar - they might not be familiar enough with them to have formed an inaccurate preconception

3320108
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in ie google-chrome safari it honors the line breaks a bit more strictly than say firefox or opera

3320111
jobs	cron
for example we have both cron jobs and on-demand offline tasks backed by amqp which is similar to jms

3320134
profiler	aqtime
secondly aqtime contains many tools to help you including a resource profiler that can keep the links between where the code that created the resources is and how it was called along with counts of the total numbers of handles

3320291
width	height
it s not guaranteed to work according to the specifications for setminimumx since the width and height are still dependent on the parent view but it should work pretty well for almost every situation

3320320
pdostatement	bindvalue
warning pdostatement bindvalue pdostatement.bindvalue sqlstate hy093 invalid parameter number parameter was not defined in long file path on line 39

3320323
irc	nntp
you can have a jabber bot that will take commands and post to an irc server email them to someone run a command read from an nntp server and monitor a web page for changes

3320324
width	height
i would size the advanceddatagrid to it s full height and width and let the canvas handle scrolling

3320333
put	get
probably the best answer you re going to get is to put your binary files into a separate directory and use the spare directory features to manage them - ie do not check out the files until you need them

3320381
oncreate	onstart
if the service is killed and then restarted it s oncreate is called but not onstart

3320381
oncreate	onstart
so you can for example add call to onstart from oncreate to make it behave like the runkeeperservice

3320405
proficy	historian
on my machine it is stored as c program files ge fanuc proficy historian docs ihistorian.chm and i have version 3.5 installed

3320422
firefox	safari
i have verified the behavior in both safari and firefox on a connection with negligible latency

3320441
profiling	instrumentation
the real secret here is that you need good instrumentation profiling in order to be frugal with your complexity adding optimization s

3320472
equals	gethashcode
note that this assumes that windowsidentity overrides equals and gethashcode appropriately - or that you re happy with reference type equality

3320479
getter	setter
note that i use reflection to get all the properties on type t and filter to the properties that have both getter and setter

3320513
width	height
set the size of the td to be the same as the size of the textarea via css width and height then set overflow hidden on the td so that the text you want to hide is outside the bounding box

3320574
bindparam	bindvalue
i don t bother with using bindparam or bindvalue

3320605
udp	tcp
it seems boost asio defines a separate endpoint class for each protocol which is irritating if you want to perform both udp and tcp operations on a particular endpoint have to convert from one to the other

3320605
udp	tcp
i d always just thought of an endpoint as an ip address v4 or v6 and the port number regardless of tcp or udp

3320605
udp	tcp
couldn t both tcp socket and udp socket accept something like ip endpoint

3320607
pop-up	dialog
so i m trying to make my 3 radio buttons each pop-up with a different dialog box using jquery

3320650
vim	emacs
use vim or emacs since they will offer you speed

3320675
sorting	filtering
views will handle any data manipulation like filtering and sorting you might want to do

3320705
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have a problem on my page with code executing multiple times in ie and opera though it works in firefox google-chrome and safari

3320722
cvs	svn
it s not the sexy distributed source control that all the cool kids are using but and this is the reason i am suggesting it svn should be an easy migration from cvs

3320722
cvs	svn
there are utilities out there to migrate your code from cvs to svn but not without some pain

3320730
firefox	safari
this worked on ie7-8 firefox and safari

3320730
inherited	properties
apparently the visibility properties acts on the element and unlike opacity propagates to the child elements by inherited so that if one explicitly sets a child element visibility it no longer inherited the hidden but uses its own setting of visible and the fact that the wrapper is hidden does not matter

3320857
equals	gethashcode
msdn gives a good set of instructions on how to implement equals and gethashcode

3320860
keydown	keyup
when this property is set to true the form will receive all keypress keydown and keyup events

3320866
equals	gethashcode
equals the gethashcode methods for the

3320879
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu server on my linux box and here are the tutorial i have used

3320888
put	get
i haven t found a way to do this on android it seems like the only way to get accelerometer readings is to put a listener that can listen at different intervals

3320901
google-chrome	firefox
i have run into the exact opposite problem in firefox and google-chrome

3320901
google-chrome	firefox
edit i have just corrected persistence problems i was having with firefox google-chrome by adding these php lines to my page

3320908
pull	push
i did a 4 part blog post on this that gets you up and running from scratch with iis including active directory integration setting up of security privileges for push pull customization of the template i d reproduce it here but it s quite long winded being that mercurial was really designed to be hosted on linux apache

3320922
keydown	keyup
i typed all that out only to realize i should have been handling keydown instead of keyup

3320922
keydown	keyup
keyup obviously fires after the keydown of the textbox even though it does fire before the keyup of the textbox

3320927
post	get	pull	push
there s a pretty good post at that ll get you started but if you need more detail or to go further than the writer did i ve got a 4 part blog post that covers everything you need to know about getting up and running on iis including active directory integration pull push privileges customization of the ui

3320935
aggregate-functions	sum
in my opinion this belongs to the aggregate-functions like avg and sum

3320972
udp	tcp
see man 7 udp or man 7 tcp for more information i m assuming linux since you didn t tag your question

3320972
udp	tcp
to solve your problem extract the ip and port from a tcp endpoint and instantiate a udp endpoint

3320978
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is no result when i start with table for looping i have multiple tables and have no id for the table. when i use tr it works well in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

3320986
submit	submission
submit the paypal information using their apis rather than submission a form directly to them

3321000
viewdidload	didreceivememorywarning
fixed by persisting state in the didreceivememorywarning method and loading from state in the viewdidload method

3321029
serializable	deserialization
i m writing some serializable deserialization code in python that will read write an inheritance hierarchy from some json

3321049
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i want to create different style sheets for the different browsers firefox google-chrome ie opera safari etc.. and specify which one to use from the master page

3321053
ienumerable	ienumerator
use a custom implementation of ienumerable and ienumerator

3321064
switching	screens
using the mvc pattern you d have a different view for when you switching screens and the variables you pass into it could be passed into the new view s controller and stored as members of that class

3321155
folder	directory
the only thing i can think of right now is i could name all platform packages exactly the same package name serial.connector with the same filenames and place them in different folder in the project archive and then upon compilation specify the directory libraries to look in for the files with -i argument and change directory names for different platforms

3321199
button	checkbox
basically users select multiple checkbox and then hits a button that executes ajax processing of their selections

3321206
vim	textmate
make sure you create this file using an editor that allows for unix formatting like pspad or vim textmate etc. using notepad will give you a parsing error - it has something to do with invisible end of file characters clrf

3321209
createfile	deviceiocontrol
you will have to use the windows api methods directly p invoke createfile deviceiocontrol etc

3321310
implements	extends
very easy to use just extends one of the existing ga classes and implements your fitness function

3321408
vim	emacs
i once tried emacs but i was already pretty familiar with vim so i didn t really have any incentive to get good at emacs

3321422
vim	emacs
as a novice programmer i just find vim s use of modes more appealing than the keyboard combinations used in emacs

3321428
vim	emacs
i tried emacs for a while and then vim and decided to stay with vim

3321428
vim	emacs
the reason was that in emacs you constantly had to use shift ctrl alt which was uncomfortable compared to vim

3321459
postgresql	mysql
anyway you solution will break in mysql and postgresql when foreign-key constraints are involved and if there aren t any you might get troubles with the sequences

3321486
width	height
two double data fields named width and height that specify the width and height of the rectangle

3321486
width	height
a no-arg constructor that creates a default rectangle with width 1 and height 1

3321486
width	height
a constructor that creates a rectangle with the specified width and height

3321486
width	height
assign width 4 and height 40 to the first object and width 3.5 and height 35.9 to the second

3321488
vim	emacs
now i use vim and still wish that emacs wasn t so painful physically and figeratively to use

3321505
int	double
wrapper.dll has a function called startacquisition int string double int

3321509
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
with ie finally getting its act together with ie 9 google s google-chrome and other safari like browsers coming along nicely and firefox rock stable as always is this an issue i need to worry about

3321509
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
is opera really that innovative to where it s market share will shoot up past safari firefox ie and google-chrome

3321563
opera	firefox
in some regions opera is the top 3 browser not too far behind ie and firefox for example russia so you should care about opera if you don t want to lose customers

3321580
minimum	max
a series of functions generate varying number of data frames minimum of 1 and a max of 11

3321648
maven	pom.xml
i personally didn t bind it to a phase since i don t want deployment to happen on every invocation of maven and didn t intend on writing another pom.xml profile to handle invoking the plugin

3321680
integer	unsigned	width	height
as a trivial example a very primitive bitmap image format could start with one unsigned 32-bit integer representing the width of the bitmap and then one more such integer representing the height of the bitmap

3321680
decoder	encoder
if you havn t been working with file formats before i would suggest that you learn a very simple format such as the windows 3 bitmap format and write your own bmp encoder decoder programs that creates and reads bmp files from scratch and displays the read bmp files

3321692
floating-point	integer
the computation may be done either by floating-point hardware or in software based on integer arithmetic

3321695
hide	show
problem i am trying to hide show elements of a page based on the language selected

3321714
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
this could be an still image bmp png jpg etc icon animated gif etc

3321714
folder	directory
to include an image into your project you can simply drag it into one of the res drawable folder in your project directory in eclipse

3321776
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
when firefox google-chrome and ie would render websites opera and mobile phones would find their own errors

3321779
ddms	adb
you need to learn how to debug in eclipse and how to use the adb and ddms tools

3321780
mvp	presenter
depending on the flavor of mvp you would either have the presenter call a property on the view to pass it the selected index and your view would pass it to the control or the view takes the index from the model directly

3321807
put	get
if you can use a hierarchical query to get all of the related data and put it in one dataset i would recommend that

3321823
versioning	upgrade
i m using the following versioning and i m having the hardest time trying to figure out if i should upgrade

3321825
min	max
basically i set up a test to see which method is the fastest way to get data from another computer my network for a server with only a few clients 10 at max 1 at min

3321832
folder	directory
if you delete the folder from your local working directory it won t affect the version in the repository

3321838
post	get
i am writing a facebook app for iphone however when i send a request to post a comment i get the following error

3321850

width	height
or does it scale according to the height width density of the phone

3321908
rss	feed
i am getting an html fragment from an rss feed and am attempting to load it into a uiwebview using the loadhtmlstring method

3321965
post	get
just make sure that the method get post is the same and the field names are the same

3322076
ddms	adb
also when you get application has stopped unexpectedly try again use adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse to examine the java stack trace associated with the error

3322118
jquery	jqtransform
does anyone know how to fix this problem using jqtransform and jquery 1.4.2

i need this to repeat until i get to the end of the file but when i put this in a loop it craps out

3322276
g++	gcc
all i need is the way to transparently append -m64 to every gcc g++ call

3322302
git-svn	svn2git
git-svn will gives you a branches for each branches and tag in svn unless you use a ruby script like svn2git

3322302
pull	push
for the sake of simplicity and interoperating with a less-capable system svn it is recommended that all git svn users clone fetch and dcommit directly from the svn server and avoid all git clone pull merge push operations between git repositories and branches

3322331
hide	show
based on some condition i do need hide authenticateuser div tag and show forcetochangepassword div tag

3322331
fadein	fadeout
i really like the jquery fadein fadeout effect

3322331
fadein	fadeout
i tried to call javascript method from code behind that method has a fadein fadeout logic but it seems like that javascript method is never been called

3322344
public	protected
so you can mark the class as public protected internal or private

3322347
stdout	stderr
i m adding a feature to the c server when i can request it to fork run a new process via a socket and pass back stdin stdout stderr

3322380
fadein	fadeout
if you make any ajax request then you must have to call the function which handling fadein fadeout logic within the response callback function

3322431
mouse	keyboard
when i execute myvbs.vbs via mouse or keyboard enter command it works fine

3322434
hide	show
the above assumes that you re creating and destroying the respected s as you hide and show them

3322434
hide	show
if you need them to all exist in the source and you ll show and hide them you ll need something like the following

3322509
stdout	stderr
which forks detatches from the controlling terminal reopens all of stdin stdout stderr to dev null and changes the working directory to the root directory

3322581
width	height
i made a test i opened windows paint.exe made a surface of the windows width and height and black as filled color

sorting	grouping
if your data is complex you could give jorder a try as it s designed to deal with fast search sorting grouping on the js side

3322628
implements	extends
i d create a custom class that extends textarea and implements your call to save the data right there

3322649
maven	cargo
the maven cargo plugin this a container agnostic plugin that now supports glassfish 3

3322677
floating-point	integer
for example the add method or + operator in the integer class might perform integer addition while the add method in the float class performs floating-point addition and the add method in the bignum class performs the correct operations for an arbitrary-size number

3322706
division	modulo
first of all you can t do i o in a sensible way without the basic operations division and modulo

3322706
division	modulo
fortunately you can implement division modulo by one word much more efficiently than when it comes to two bigint s

3322723
tunnel	vpn
note that i define proxied i mean using some kind of tunnel vpn ssh etc to another computer that does not share your ip address

3322755
tunnel	vpn
vpn is almost undetectable unless you re using a blacklist as all the traffic is routed through the tunnel not just http

3322759
fontfamily	font-size
you may also want to check out this discussion on determining the font being used changing body font-size based on fontfamily with jquery

3322795
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox handles it just fine but safari google-chrome opera and ie all throw hissy fits

3322799
stdout	stderr
only relay stderr and not stdout

3322825
stdout	stderr
otherwise you ll need to redirect stdout to devnull and stderr to stdout

3322826
client-side	server-side
and location instead of having some code server-side and some browser client-side in different languages it s definitely an exciting technology

3322829
versioning	upgrade
i m using the following versioning and i m having the hardest time trying to figure out if i should upgrade

3322900
versioning	upgrade
the issue with displaying the site was caused by the wrong versioning of .net the server needed to be upgrade from 1.1 to support 2.0 3.0 and 3.5

3322922
hex	binary
however i cannot find a way to uncompress the hex data even if i convert it to a binary string with it still gives an error about wrong data

3322928
folder	directory
i copied the dll of the isapi in a folder and created a virtual directory in the iis of the server

3322942
fgets	getline
my suggestion is to dump fscanf_s and use either fgets or std getline

3322950
mef	linfu
for instance mef usually works by finding classes with the export annotation and linfu by finding classes with the implements annotation

3322959
int	boolean
from that perspective generating lots and lots of strings and computing hash codes on those strings seems like an expensive way to avoid an equals operation that consists of 3 int and 1 boolean comparison

3323002
notepad++	textpad
what about something like textpad or notepad++

3323006
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
so until you re confident that you re able to recognize valid nullpointerexception i d recommend to use illegalargumentexception when you want to tell to your api user that null is not a valid argument value

3323019
hash	hmac
you definitely don t want to try to combine a key with the hash in an amateurish way this has been broken already which is why we have hmac s

3323023
ant	maven
i ve implemented that behavior using a copy task with the ant plug-in on maven

3323025
hide	show
or if they can t hover and javascript is off setting a php session and reloading the page then inserting a style to the style tag at the end of the page which will overwrite the visibility and display according to whether the clicked to show or hide

3323037
put	get
my recommendation would be that if you have objects that are either cheap to copy or expensive to copy but don t get copied often put them into the container as a value

3323081
aggregate-functions	sum
i changed out total for sum which is more consistent with other databases sqlite aggregate-functions

3323097
queue	fifo
this could easily be implemented on an array or arraycollection as a fifo queue

3323139
django	turbogears
i am new to using frameworks for web development and i have noticed that frameworks like django turbogears etc come with auth packages which contains user models

3323153
ubuntu	linux
i d like to start using emacs but i want also a gui in which it will be available in windows ubuntu linux desktop and mac osx

3323161
config	ini
it asks you to create an ini file called crunksauce.ini i kid you not in the same directory as the executing script and contains config variables

3323196
jsf	wicket
many presentation frameworks support bean validation jsf 2.0 wicket spring mvc.

3323204
put	get
you will have to deliver the messages in the end via smtp i still suggest using your own from and put the sender in the reply-to unless these are corporate customers that you can get to add your smtp server to their spf records

3323207
firefox	safari
it removes it in safari but i m have no luck with firefox

3323208
prepare	execute
next we tell the prepare statement to run itself using the execute method passing an array of variables

3323208
prepare	execute
once again we prepare a query with placeholders then execute with the actual variables

3323222
width	height
3 the img tag try adding width and height does it change anything

3323232
google-chrome	safari
only popular browsers which allows the outline tag are safari and google-chrome not sure about linux browsers

3323282
subclass	abstract-class
it s an abstract-class so you ll need to derive your own concrete subclass es but that s easy enough

3323292
onclick	onsubmit
are you using an onclick instead of onsubmit

3323292
onclick	onsubmit
then the answer to this problem ...cannot get the form to submit when the return key is pressed is use onsubmit instead of onclick

3323347
sproutcore	cappuccino
kinda like ext-js and sproutcore but without the acidental complexity and lack of fluidity and more like cappuccino but without requiring a mac and the horrible load times from objective-j which also has no ide support

3323363
folder	directory
i currently have a c# program that goes through every folder and file and tries to copy the whole backup directory to a dated backup-backup directory which is how i discovered this problem in the first place

3323363
folder	directory
does anyone have any clue how i could say on an access denied exception in my existing copy code force the delete of these folder so rysnc can recreate the directory again and get the whole thing synced again

3323368
multiplying	add
once you have a number of hours add 15 and multiplying by your normal hourly rate

3323461
min	max
i use coercion to ensure that value remains between the min and max inclusive

3323483
children	parent
parent elements do not take the height of floated children

3323530
width	height
cgrects are not cpobjects but simply javascript objects with x y width and height members

3323531
margin	height
you could try setting a negative margin on the #large_div that was equal to the height of the h2

3323561
xna	spritebatch
in this version of xna you can easily specify your own vertex shader for spritebatch

3323561
xna	spritebatch
2 you could use a custom vertex shader with spritebatch in xna 3.1 it s just not as easy

3323576
google-chrome	firefox
take a look at this link inside firefox google-chrome browser content browser.xul

3323594
lisp	sml
if you look at a language like sml for example and compare it with lisp the functional core of each is almost identical

3323596
add-on	xpcom
the development of extensions or add-on is done in xul and xpcom i am assuming you did not mean plugins pardon me i am wrong and this answer then would be only half of what you want to know.

3323664
move	drag
i need to get the location updated when the user drag move zoom the mapview

3323689
free	malloc
you could use and instead of malloc and free here but i assume the only reason that you would do this is to inter-operate with c code

3323750
for-loop	loops
on your other question it is definitely necessary for you to know how to do a for-loop and believe me it isn t hard just like you need to know how to do a while loops

3323769
g++	gcc
using g++ in place of gcc should allow you to use c++ code

3323771
multiplying	add
i am currently using the cramer s rule method of solving the system and it works quite well it seems that my processor really likes add and multiplying operations it gets solutions in 1 microsecond despite the explicit equations being over 2 pages in length

3323794
subtract	add
it should convert it to a unix timestamp where you can add or subtract seconds to it etc

3323814
button	checkbox
specify a name for your database click the from device radio button and browse to your databasename.bak file make sure and select the checkbox after choosing your file

3323835
onkeyup	onmouseup
saveselection is attached to the onmouseup and onkeyup events of the div and saves the selection to the variable savedrange

3323835
onclick	onmousedown
to achieve this the onclick and onmousedown events are canceled by the function cancelevent which is a cross browser function to cancel the event

3323835
onfocus	onblur
the variable isinfocus stores whether it is in focus and is changed to false onblur and true onfocus

3323835
onclick	onmousedown
or similar then simply remove the onclick and onmousedown events

3323859
accessor	properties
typically dependency injection frameworks use attributes and reflection to discover which fields properties and methods of a class require dependencies to be injected at creation time and then use reflection to actually inject the dependencies - thus getting around the normal accessor restrictions - injecting into private fields for example

3323861
for-loop	loops
i do not have experience on your language but it seams to me you are using to nested loops one is for-loop another is repeat lope inside for loop.if so then my suggestion is you can use either loops with break statement

3323861
for-loop	loops
if you really want to use both loops then you have to use goto statement to come out of the for-loop

3323885
voip	sip
it seems there is something for apple open source voip sip objective-c code

3323904
put	get
one option would be to put the value main index#user profile 33 inside a hidden field and get the contents of this from your controller

3323922
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
firefox just provides far more access to its own internals and system to the extensions so its technically possible to do more with them than with opera widgets or google-chrome extensions

3323927
tapestry	struts	tapestry	stripes	tapestry	wicket	struts	stripes	struts	wicket	wicket	stripes
if your requirement is for a more traditional web application then compare click with struts stripes wicket tapestry etc

3323935
x86	64bit
on x86 with optimizations on the results of subexpressions are not necessarily stored into a 64bit memory location before being used as part of a larger expression

3323948
width	height
this can be achieved by dynamically loading the css based on iframe width and height

3323954
ubuntu	linux
i am on ubuntu linux and i could compile it

3323962
bash	zsh
also learning the kill yanking keys will help you when using bash zsh shells and other old-school programs that welcome emacs users by implementing compatible keystrokes

3324008
firefox	safari
i want to update my entire site to use html5 through firefox safari flash for older browsers and hopefully for android and iphones

3324053
hash	salt
there is an object customer and it has among other two properties of type one property for password salt the second one for password hash

3324062
mouse	keyboard
i find that quite annoying because i m totally keyboard oriented and that is practically the only thing for which i have to use the mouse when in eclipse

3324087
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception	illegalstateexception	illegalstateexception	illegalargumentexception
if the value you have to return is null then clearly the caller has either given you bad arguments illegalargumentexception you are not in a valid state illegalstateexception or some other much more meaningful exceptional condition has occurred other than nullpointerexception which usually indicates a programming error

3324089
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
its working fine in opera firefox and safari

3324113
viewdidload	viewwillappear
inside your viewcontroller in viewdidload or in viewwillappear try this

3324150
voip	sip
check siphon which is described as home of the world s first free sip voip application for iphone and ipod touch 1 and 2

3324195
for-loop	arrays
in my current c# project there is one place that still uses a traditional for-loop and that deals with shifting an arrays left and right to find the best match between two curves

3324195
for-loop	loops
i think eventually we will see the purpose of the traditional for-loop fade in preference for a foreach style loops

3324210
rss	feed
i am getting the html data from rss feed

3324214
post	get
after more detailed digging -- autogenned wsdl has different declarations for post get vs soap responses and the diff is that they just reference the autogenned elem type for array and not the whole response type elem which has new name

3324214
post	get
slightly different declarations for get post - misses the new name

3324222
for-loop	loops
why do you have the for-loop if you do not want to loops through it

3324259
feedback	review
the .net team review stuff like this based on consumer feedback - presumably enough people petitioned them to say the existing settings were incorrect so they changed them

3324260
jdom	dom4j
your rendering code could use the w3c dom apis directly or jdom dom4j etc to access access the metadata .

3324263
accessor	properties
for retained properties i have grown accustomed to a specific way of using the accessor methods to alloc initialize the actual ivars

3324385
flip	slide
depending on which revision of jqtouch that you are using you will need to add an animation class to your link like slide flip disolve in order to actually cause a transition from one psuedo page to the next

3324393
width	height
i think you need to specify elements width and height with this background image

3324487
post	get
that should help you get a feel for what it s like to post text to one s wall

3324515
robocopy	xcopy
for the second option you can use xcopy s or robocopy s

3324516
post	get
apparently default model binder is capable of binding from the url querystring parameters to the viewmodel on post so even if the textbox for slug is disabled it can get the value from the querystring

3324546
hash	md5
sig on the other hand is a md5 hash of all session data combined with your application s private key

3324572
folder	directory
that file wants a path to a file folder which it will move to another directory and will then return done if it successfully moved the file

3324634
width	height
so i m trying to find some ways to get actual size of loaded page then i can change height width of control or change scale of loaded page to fit it to the actual webcontrol control

3324701
codeigniter	cakephp
i know also there is some good php frameworks like codeigniter cakephp etc.

3324715
quicksort	heapsort
i don t see how we could apply quicksort and thing like heapsort require to know the index of the card within the deck

3324725
stdout	stderr
what i d like to do is similar to what visual studio does in its output window or other editors in their tool windows start another process b from my process a and capture its stdout stderr output

3324725
stdout	fflush
i wrote my own test program that outputs something and does an fflush stdout directly afterwards

3324762
integer	unsigned
does the complement and implicitly converts to an integer like all numeric operations do then masks out everything except the lower 8 bits to get the unsigned value again as an integer

3324788
dictionary	map
i realise i could just create a dictionary to map the operator to the function but is there a nicer way to do it

3324801
happy	alex
i m trying to build a simple lexer parser with alex happy in haskell and i would like to

3324805
move	drag
when drag starts see if there is a draggable object under the mouse that you want to drag store it locally and use the draggable interface method to move the object around

3324805
move	drag
on drag end remove the draggable object from your local store and stop calling its move method

3324910
pull	push
you would still have to download a repo to push it on the heroku node but at least you can control what to pull push and do some cleaning between each push

3324942
hash	md5
i actually don t really need md5 just a simple hash function which i can compare against a stored value to see if its changed

3324986
jboss	glassfish
is anyone using mobicents with glassfish in place of jboss

3325119
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
i myself intend writing a simple subclass of id with a few object methods and all the nsurlconnection and nsxmlparser delegate methods contained in it -- so that responsibility is with this subclass and can simply be instantiated in a viewcontroller

3325143
min	max
say i set min and max allowed values and jquery decides how to deal with it

3325155
aggregate-functions	sum
my goal is to make an aggregate-functions sum and group the elements but there is an error

3325171
domxpath	domdocument
for instance load the html in a domdocument instance search the table with either domxpath or getelementsbytagname and use the replacenode or other manipulation functions

3325234
free	malloc
edit basically i m supposing that the electric fence library replaces the malloc free calls of the regular libc

3325251
freemarker	velocity
click supports velocity freemarker jsp

3325252
stdout	stderr
your description sounds like printing to stderr works since that s where warn goes whereas printing to stdout does not

3325252
stdout	fflush
update as per daotoad s excellent suggestion this could also be attributed to lack of fflush - if so then setting autoflush on stdout would solve it

3325282
introspection	typechecking
the language doesn t have features behind the scenes like garbage collection reference counting synchronisation reflection introspection bounds-checking run-time typechecking meta-classes and so on each of which can impose a cost on general operation

3325286
outputstream	inputstream
if the flash file is stored outside the public webcontent then you ll need to create a servlet which gets an inputstream of the file from the local disk file system and writes it to the outputstream of the response along a correct set of http headers and then let the url of the element point to that instead

3325292
post	get
i need to send data via http protocol get or post request from the function or trigger

3325319
getter	setter
if you do you spring perhaps occasionally to create the bean or you don t really like having a lot of temporary variables in the method which constructs that bean you can also use getter and setter

3325343
public	protected
for example it does not support private public protected access level modifiers

3325373
public	protected
access modifiers public private protected etc are not required for class-based programming

3325410
client-side	server-side
i tried checking both client-side and server-side debugging settings on the website s but nothing changes

3325436
yslow	pagespeed
i ve been working 2 days on doing improvements on ui using yslow and pagespeed

3325457
superclass	subclassing
- create only a table for the superclass all attributes and associations of subclassing are moved to the table corresponding to the superclass with the possibility of taking a null value

3325457
superclass	subclassing
- create only tables for the subclassing all attributes and associations of the superclass are repeated in each subclassing

3325457
superclass	subclassing
- create tables both for the superclass and for each of the subclassing

3325457
superclass	subclassing
in this case the pk of the subclassing is at the same table a fk to the superclass this ensures that all identifiers in a subclassing table correspond to an existing identifier in the superclass table

3325464
std	ostream
c 1500tb libs cross-adol-c-2.1.0 adolc_base lib libadolc.a adouble.o in function std ostream std ostream _m_insert double

lisp	scheme
i am beginning to learn common lisp and having some background in scheme this intrigues me

3325511
stdout	fflush
if the output has not been fflush in the offending process it s not actually been written to stdout in the first place

3325517
equals	gethashcode
i ve 2 lists of class a a has implemented equals object obj and gethashcode this 2 methods working correctly code is below

3325520
gridview	detailsview	gridview	formview	gridview	objectdatasource	formview	detailsview	objectdatasource	detailsview	objectdatasource	formview
if we want to add editing support to the gridview with a custom shaped type we d want to either move to using an objectdatasource control where we could supply a custom update method method to handle the updates or have the user navigate to a new page when performing updates - and display a detailsview or formview control that was bound to a product entity for editing and not try and do inline editing with the grid

3325525
hide	show
you will need to edit the portfolio.js file in the public javascripts directory to show hide the correct titles and descriptions on the portfolio page

3325555
std	ostream
using overloading with an ostream left operand std cout is of ostream type it s used as a stream operator to print data of various types

3325580
postgresql	mysql
it s compatible with the syntax from mysql and postgresql

3325580
postgresql	mysql
mysql supports both syntax forms and its docs claim that the second syntax with offset was meant to provide compatibility with postgresql

3325581
melt	reshape
if so if you reshape melt the data first you can create one multidimensional table

3325594
width	height
that is when the view itself decides its width and height

3325615
int	boolean
there s no logical conversion i can think of between an int and a boolean value

3325635
cpython	pypy
the current version of pypy is 99 compatible with cpython version 2.5 and can run django twisted and many other python programs

3325635
cpython	pypy
there used to be a limitation of not being able to run existing cpython c extensions but that is also being addressed with cpyext module in pypy

3325635
cpython	pypy
an alternative to pypy is unladden swallow a google project which aims to speed up cpython implementation by using llvm s jit capabilities but progress on unladden swallow was slowed because the developer needed to deal with bugs in llvm

3325662
int	chars
therefore you can simplify things a lot by sticking to an int type and converting that to a chars int8_t when writing

3325663
voip	sip
i want to build an iphone app which has the option to make calls over sip voip but at this moment i have no idea how to start

3325682
post	get
i am trying to get pagination working with the wp pagenavi plugin and a custom post type portfolio page in wordpress and i am having no luck

3325701
mp3	ogg	mp3	flac	flac	ogg
i want to create a very simple audio sequencer in c# that would work mostly with mp3 files or optionally any other compressed format like ogg or flac

3325723
width	height
the images contain different plain-coloured irregular shapes and i d like to find the point or pixel where the maximum width matches the maximum height see figure below

3325728
mouse	keyboard
this is a sad moment in most any usability study seeing the subject banging away at the mouse and keyboard and not understanding why it doesn t work

3325745
put	get
i m going to expand on the comment i made earlier suggesting that common functionality should be put into a library to avoid duplicated effort in maintaining the same code base in two places and suggest that if you can get away with making each instance a branch of the common codebase then that s probably ideal

3325747
int	chars
i only use chars in context of strings and never use short as it s as long as an int on most desktop systems anyway

3325764
versioning	upgrade
these models are representing the upgrade versioning along with time and released

3325822
post	get
depending on the sensitivity of the data you could store it in a session variable and check for the presence of post or get variables prior to falling back to the session variables when the form is being displayed

3325828
websphere	ibm
disclaimer i m an ibm websphere consultant so i can t claim to be unbiased

3325831
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
the easiest and fastest way of doing client side data manipulation sorting filtering grouping is jorder

3325874
rss	feed
a better approach might be to find the rss feed for the site and get the content that way because that will be stripped down as is

3325877
portrait	landscape
the buttons extend to each side of the screen so i ll need two images for each layout portrait and landscape

3325877
portrait	landscape
as such do i need to have two different nib files for each layout portrait and landscape or is there a way to just use one nib file and specify which images to use for the buttons depending on which layout the app is running in

3325898
rss	feed
with the json feed it removes all but the standard rss and atom tags and then translates to json

3325914
16-bit	64bit
for the same reason it would not be feasible to have made short 32-bit and int 64bit a 16-bit type is essential for many things audio processing being the first that comes to mind

3325924
updatepanel	scriptmanager
by adding the trigger you are telling the scriptmanager to update this updatepanel whenever button1 is clicked

3326009
portrait	landscape
i have a universal ios app with a custom view that has three buttons each with an image background that extends to the sides of the screen for each orientation portrait and landscape

3326009
portrait	landscape
ipad in both portrait and landscape mode

3326009
portrait	landscape
iphone in both portrait and landscape mode

3326027
unsigned	short
as far as memory goes you may find it trivial but when i use known sizes that are unsigned and not unreasonably large i use unsigned short s for my for loops

3326027
unsigned	short
very small change to note the loop is going only 10 times so you might as well use an unsigned char rather than a short

3326034
mouseover	mouseout
or is it something wrong with mouseover mouseout

3326049
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseover to mouseenter and mouseout to mouseleave changes are because the former events will happen when entering leaving a child as well which you usually don t want

3326054
inherited	properties
document2 is of an inherited type the properties might be overloaded to return something different

3326081
google-chrome	firefox
the scripts run and work perfectly in google-chrome but the document.ready functions don t run in firefox and ie6

3326119
post	put
put ads in your blog post with the

lisp	scheme
yes it s very possible although a standard hm-style type system is usually the wrong choice for most idiomatic lisp scheme code

3326198
scheme	racket	lisp	racket	lisp	scheme
see typed racket for a recent language that is a full lisp more like scheme actually with static typing

3326199
google-chrome	firefox
i m using firefox but also in google-chrome

3326217
maven	m2e
the most up to date documentation on using the scala tooling for eclipse with maven via m2e can be found here

3326274
m2e	pom.xml
dependencies must be declared in the pom.xml either by editing the pom.xml manually or by using m2e wizards

3326307
puts	gets
if i press enter it automatically puts the curser on the first option and selects it so when i start typing that part gets replaced

an important point here your question isn t defined for concave shapes - on concave shapes you will have a list of height for every x and the maximal height line may not intersect the maximal width

3326930
onmousedown	onmousemove
though it may be more complicated why not just have an onmousedown event on the element and thet event will then attach an onmousemove event and onmouseout event so that if there is a mouse movement while the button is down then remove the class on the span elements and once the user exits the element then you can put them back

range	infinity
it further assumes that all your input data is in a reasonable range away from infinity and nan

3326976
keydown	keyup
the stackoverflow site does a bit more because it does syntax highlighting too but the basic idea is to listen to the keyboard events - keydown better keypress or keyup not so good if a button is continuously pressed and in its callback update the value of the target container with the value of the source container

3326976
keydown	keyup
the best solution is to bind to both - keyup and keydown or keypress

you re only accessing the properties when you send an accessor message to the properties s holder self in your examples

3327460
accessor	ivar
that s the key difference hitting the accessor may cause side effects whereas accessing the ivar directly never will

3327460
accessor	properties
hence the best practice use the properties in all your instance methods as you probably want the accessor side effects except in init methods and dealloc where side effects would be a bad thing

ant	maven
like i said you may have reason to use make with java such as an existing project but for any new project you should absolutely use ant or maven instead in my opinion

3327932

a2 imo a better alternative to this would be to ditch the existing makefile and create your own build file using either ant or maven

3327956
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in order to use a uitabbar you would need a uitabbarcontroller which is different than the uinavigationcontroller

3327956

if you want to automatically switch between both landscape and portrait orientations as the phone is rotated

3328027
portrait	landscape
but switching between landscape and portrait alters the backbuffer dimensions short-and-wide vs

3328027

getter	setter
note that this will result in a getter function being generated when you use synthesize but not a setter function

3328433
apache	nginx
php is something of a standard for web development and so is what people usually care about with servers so just because nginx or apache are optimised to run an obscure programming language y times faster than the other is irrelevant unless it s php

but if that doesn t work out ghci starts being confused about which interpretation of the literal he must make int double float ...

3328864
http	spdy
both s3 and cloudfront allow domain aliases however cloudfront allows multiple aliases so that d1.mystatics.com d2.mystatics.com and d3.mystatics.com could all point to the same location increasing the capacity for parallel downloads this used to be recommended by google but with the introduction of spdy and http 2 is of lesser importance

3328866
int	double
this can be awkward to work with so ghci implements type defaulting it assumes that bare numbers are int or double if the type is ambiguous

from an overall standpoint never pass a string to settimeout or setinterval if you can avoid it it results in many unwanted side-effects...like this one

3329272
maven	pom.xml
use a second repository like nexus for storing those jars and only reference a txt file or a pom.xml file for maven project in order to fetch the right jar versions

3329283

3329415
for-loop	loops
i don t think an anonymous function is a substitute for a for-loop nor do i think it s necessary to replace for loops with them

3329415
lisp	scheme
sure if you re using lisp or scheme they are but that s out of necessity

3329415
for-loop	loops
i think recursion would just be unnecessary if the task is just as easily accomplished with a for-loop and therefore you re not kissing for loops good bye

int	double
sadly your best bet is to implement the extension method on all objects and do a switch based on type or to create a set of methods for int double floats etc

3329604
free	malloc
the function g_list_free can do the job but don t forget to free the data before if allocated dynamically as also said here in that case you have to go through each element of the list and use g_free if allocated with g_malloc or free if allocated with malloc or whatever matches the alloc function e.g delete for new in c++ ...

3329610

in this case you want to constrain your generic to icomparable interface which gives you access to the compareto method since this interface allows you to answer the question shouldbegreaterthan

3329615
128bit	64bit
gcc supports built-in __int128_t and __uint128_t types on 64bit platforms but it looks like formatting support for 128bit integers is less common in libc

3329855
getter	setter
most models in rails inherit from activerecord base which has all of the conventional getter and setter and the association methods validations and support

3329864
ant	maven
still for production use i d recommend formally compiling using ant or maven and the jdk

3329870
next	except
interestingly the next line which you did not query is syntactically valid but is not giving you the answer you want except in the case where

3329874
hide	show
also another problem with this code is that once you show the tracklist then hide it again the words stop toggling

3329880
rss	feed
rss feed is not a html document

3329880
rss	feed
my answer is that you should not use html elements inside rss feed

3329953
rubygems	bundler
i m certainly no ruby developer but i have an application on my server using rubygems and bundler

3329959

3329977
rss	feed
i was wondering how would i convert datetime using php to work with rss feed pubdate

3329991
width	height
or i can set the width to more than 36 and it appears to grow by width-36 but if for instance i set both the height and width of one of these narrow cells to the same number lets say 60px the height of what gets displayed is greater than the width and it appears as a rectangle not a square

3329995
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
to sum up the enhanced for-loop offers a concise higher level syntax to loops over a list or arrays which improves clarity and readability

3329997
pull	push
nobody will see any changes until you push those commits to another repository or the original one or until someone pull commits from your repository if it is publicly accessible

3330008
postgresql	mysql
personally i d try something that s popular and free such as mysql or postgresql so you can more easily google your way out of problems

3330047
inherited	properties
iâ ll create a new extendedmembershipuser class that inherited all the default properties from the membershipuser

3330076
mkplacemark	mkreversegeocoder
gets called when mkreversegeocoder finds info for your coordinate you can retrieve info you need from corresponding fields of mkplacemark instance you get

3330084
curb	libcurl
i ve installed the curb and curb-fu gem and libcurl on my ubuntu box

3330132
quicksort	heapsort
so for instance heapsort is faster than quicksort in the worst case but slower in the average case

3330146
inherited	properties
if your control inherited from combobox and you don t override the defaultstylekey properties it will use the same style as combobox thus the same template

3330149
for-loop	arrays
use a normal for-loop to iterate over an arrays

3330182
inherited	properties
if your clientside objects are not inherited from other custom objects you see if you could use the javascript s object.hasownproperty method to find out if a certain properties exists in the object itself and not up in the inherited chain via the prototype object

3330185
post	get
when ever i pass a value from a form using submit to a php file using load .get or post and try to receive data or load it in general as shown below i just get ruturned a null or undefined value

3330216
post	get
without needing javascript seperate get urls etc just plain old html the original post just add the id to the name of the button

3330226
r-tree	quadtree
if your objects are sparse then a quadtree or related data structure r-tree etc. is probably better

3330234
width	height
if you want more control over this you would use .footers 1 .shapes.addpicture instead as that let s you set the width height top left etc

3330253
put	get
i also put a breakpoint on the dealloc routine for the core data objects and it doesn t seem to get called at least not unless i specifically add additional releases

3330258
hide	show
you can hide and show the right view using the mode that is show in the above code

3330260
getter	setter
i think it was late night coding that made me overlook my getter and setter on the view- model

3330260
getter	setter
i was missing a getter and a setter for both properties

3330277
for-loop	arrays
if you are passing arrays use a standard for-loop

3330359
nsmutablestring	nsstring
stringbyreplacingoccurrencesofregex returns an nsstring which can t be cast to an nsmutablestring you ll likely get a crash later on when you send a mutating method to the string

3330407
inline-functions	inlining
you may -- though note that i never have -- want to consider playing with the optimization flags too so that only inline-functions are considered for inlining though of course this has a global effect and that may not be what you want

3330429
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
try not to overuse inherited in the first place - this is only going to become an issue when you ve got a subclassing deriving from a superclass other than object designing for inherited is tricky

3330431
post	get
thinking about rest it s relatively easy to map http methods to crud actions post for create get for read etc

3330431
post	get
post would spring to mind but i think get is also an appropriate method because 99 of the time you only supply a bunch of parameters to these types of actions

3330440
queue	fifo
the java.util.concurrent concurrentlinkedqueue class supplies an efficient scalable thread-safe non-blocking fifo queue

3330461
post	get
you should use post if your request modifies data and get if it only reads it

3330481
superclass	subclassing
a superclass constructor is always implicitely explicitely called before a subclassing constructor

3330489
post	get
i would try loading the web page with webbrowser class if it s a server side calculator you should figure out the get post parameters to give input and choose desired functionality you could do this by analyzing the html source and request the answer page

3330493
post	get
i think in the general case we might well supply various payload parameters and these plausibly might exceed what s possible with get so post is quite reasonable - the action of starting a job doesn t to me fit well with get sematics

3330499
vmware	virtualbox
i realize this has been well-answered already but i d like to add a couple of notes about virtualbox 1 in my experience it is much faster than vmware when running as a linux host and 2 the snapshot features have been greatly improved in recent versions the comprehensive snapshot functionality is what kept me in vmware for a long time.

3330520
public	protected
methods must be public package-private or protected methods must be

3330542
post	get
i sort of understand what rest is - the use of existing http procedures post get etc. to facilitate the creation use of web services

3330551
inherited	subclassing
activerecord normally detects when you subclassing an already subclassing activerecord base and uses this to turn sti single table inherited on

3330568
int	double	int	chars
note that i assume here that unsigned chars is 1 byte unsigned int is 4 bytes and double is 8 bytes large. the t is also used for stl containers because i use them a lot a vector a map and a list are used in many of the functions involved in processing files

3330568
int	chars
everything works perfectly fine with built-in datatypes chars int etc.

3330568
memcpy	memcmp	fread	memcmp
note that i m using mainly c functions for reading no streams here but some memcpy and memcmp fread etc.

3330570
folder	directory
i noticed that there was now a net.rim.ejde.componentpack4.5.0_4.5.0.28 directory in my eclipse plugins folder so thinking that perhaps i updated the component packs without realizing it i adjusted the target path of the ichabod library and rebuilt it with bb-ant-tools

3330595
move	drag
i tried hooking into the click event but i can t get the drag to work right i want the other elements to move out of the way once i drag an element over a suitable spot so the user can see where it would end up

3330614
post	get
basically it seems that it is about using http methods get post delete to identify the exposure of resources the application allows

3330614
post	get
we can further define what methods are allowed to this url - get for retrieval of the resource post for updating creating delete for deleting

3330625
draggable	droppable
have you considered jquery ui s droppable draggable functionality

3330654
debian	linux
i have never seen a problem like this before so i think the problem is with my django server it s running through apache 2.2.9-10 on debian linux

3330669
division	modulo
this code should be general purpose since you will be able to reuse it for part of your general division modulo code

3330670
memcpy	memcmp
it s actually not safe to memcpy or memcmp many many c++ types and using them is a habit that you definitely should cut

3330677
implements	extends
i ve tried to use stringio but it doesn t extends django.core.files.file and thus doesn t implements method chunks

3330682
post	get
as suggested in other post you may be able to come up with some shell game to arrange to run sudo for you for some enumerated list of commands but that s all you are going to get

3330694
google-chrome	firefox
the following line of code throws an argumentnullexception under google-chrome and firefox in silverlight

3330726
folder	directory
it had to be built in another folder different than the root directory

3330750
webkit	gecko
it appears to be used in gecko and webkit browsers to test if a lazy-loaded stylesheet has been completely downloaded of course if you won t be lazy-loading stylesheets you can remove that section completely

3330757
slider	supersized
i want an image slider plugin to crossfade backgrounds for performance reasons i cannot use the supersized plugin

3330764

3330789
post	get
the other link is in the comments i cannot post it until i get 10 pts of reputation

3330818
innodb	myisam
the default myisam does not support transactions i recommend using innodb

3330819
spaces	delimiter
i have to write an argument parser it is passed in as a string ala a b c delimiter is comma with a spaces after it but it can be escaped with a pipe | before it

3330850
mouseleave	mouseenter
now this is fine the issue is when the mouseleave menu2 whether the mouseenter submenu or not #menu2 should hide

3330892
margin	height
you don t need to add any padding or margin to the li just be sure the height of each li is less than the div#menu height + padding

3330920
apache	nginx
so the classic setup is nginx accepting external requests proxying them to the local apache

3330920
apache	nginx
apache handles the requests and gives back the responses to the nginx to transfer to the clients

3330920
freebsd	linux
that s epoll for linux kqueue for freebsd

3330953
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
another possibility is to use nsdatecomponents and nscalendar

3330981
lisp	scheme
including clojure which is otherwise closer to common lisp than to scheme

3330981

3331173
width	height
qimage qimage const uchar data int width int height format format

3331216
int	chars
the overall size is larger largely because i ve used templates throughout so the numbers can be an arbitrary int type and the chars can be an arbitrary chars type and it uses iterators for both so it can read from write to arbitrary collections streams stringstreams vectors etc.

3331221
free	realloc
from what i have seen so far it seems that if realloc fails you have to free old pointer

3331239
int	double
| numeric long int double etc. | if obj.property 0 then |

free	realloc
when realloc fails what is it you want to do free the old block or keep it alive and unchanged

3331391
folder	directory
you can pre-compile your web site and put them in your bin folder of your virtual directory

width	height
i had to listen for the width and height to be greater than zero before proceeding

3332106
xdebug	xhprof
unless you have identified creating database connections as the one thing that is a bottleneck in your script this means you ve done code profiling using xdebug and or xhprof you should not consider persistent connections as a solution to anything

3332114
post	get
for example if you want to secure post calls to myaccount the pattern for a servlet then you would be redirected to the login page only when a http post is made while the get request would be accepted even without a user authentication

3332114
post	get
the implication is you want to allow authenticated users access to post request while get requests are permitted to everyone

3332129

3332259
width	height
the way i usually do this is to look at the ratio between the original width and the new width and the ratio between the original height and the new height

3332259
width	height
for example if you wanted to resize an 800x600 image into a 400x400 image the width ratio would be 2 and the height ratio would be 1.5

3333243
kde	gnome
i want to check which window manager the user is using like gnome or kde etc.

3333259
getter	setter
there s no error handling in the above example though so it ll fail horribly if you try setting a property that doesn t exist or isn t a string or doesn t have a getter setter

3333273
google-chrome	firefox
the easiest way to implement such a crawler is to write addon firefox or extension google-chrome then inject your javascript code into the visited page

3333284
portrait	landscape
viewing a print preview of this page in portrait mode doesn t give a problem but switching to landscape causes a blank page to be shown and at the top the page counts states page 1 of x where x is a continually increasing number

3333318
maven	pom.xml
i changed the version from jfreechart in the pom.xml of my maven project from 1.0.12 to 1.0.13

3333324

button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i want to retain data in the view controls like dropdownlistfor radio button checkbox textbox while displaying same view again with validation fail message

3333473
google-chrome	firefox
this ceases to matter if the user zooms the page instead of increasing the text size as is the default in firefox and google-chrome now and is an option in ie

3333529
margin	height
iâ m guessing in your code about-text is placed within other text where adding top bottom margin of 1em height of text makes sense

3333537
hide	show
the following chunk lists the post id post owner global privacy setting and the hide from show to user ids

3333590
children	parent
this is basically some kind of generic tree with double links to children and parent

3333634
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
you might consider moving the actual load request in a background thread using nsoperationqueue or use nsurlconnection to asynchronously load the image

3333677
ssl	https
this caused ssl certificates to be invalid and oauth request to fail as well as anything else that used https

3333705
chunked	transfer-encoding
however if i remove the transfer-encoding chunked header the content is sent to the browser correctly but all in one big piece at the end of the script as expected

3333712
integer	fractions
to avoid messing with decimal formats i would format the whole part as an integer and use an array lookup for the fractions part

3333761
width	text-align
or decrease the width of div#outer to 630px and removing text-align as you dont really need that

3333781
hide	show
this will show your image for two seconds then hide it and show the contents of your mycontent grid

3333812
charindex	substr
edit combination of charindex and substr etc

3333873

the problem is when i attempt to take a screenshot of a maximized window running windows 7 the titlebar and the border and sometimes other parts of the window are black

3333921
onchange	onkeyup
to get around this i have tried hooking into the textbox onchange onkeypress onkeyup events etc and checking if there is any text in the text box and if there is none display the default list

3333934
inherited	properties
dependency properties need to be created in the view class as vm do not inherited from dependencyobject

3333967
equals	gethashcode
there s a lot of information on the internet about how to override gethashcode when equals is overriden

3333967
equals	tostring
this class called businesslogica contains a tostring implementation some basic functionality for my framework and the following equals override

3333990
equals	gethashcode
also see this question for an implementation - why is it important to override gethashcode when equals method is overridden

3333994
equals	gethashcode
equals ... and gethashcode ... should always be implemented equivalently

3334005
equals	gethashcode
since you are using id to determine if objects are equals your gethashcode implementation should be using id too

3334009
equals	gethashcode
the most important thing to always remember when writing an equals and gethashcode method is that you should never have one without the other and that they agree with eachother

3334010
put	get
seemingly the only way i can get this to render is to put

3334027
wordpress	expressionengine
cms systems like expressionengine wordpress modx etc

3334063
rss	feed
i see an rss feed but not sure how that works or if it can help me with monitoring or how

3334097
width	height
one way to improve page loading is to specify image dimesions height width

3334100
rss	feed
instead of trying to scrappe the page like you said a better solution could be to use its rss feed -- for example in your case

3334100
rss	feed
to extract data from that xml feed you can use simplexml to work with the xml data by-hand or some library like simplepie that knows rss atom

3334100
rss	feed
then in you case you have to keep track of the last update -- and each time you fetch the rss feed check if there is an update that s more recent than the last one you saw the previous time

3334154
folder	directory
the font is installed on my windows 7 pc and are also located in the folder fonts in the directory where my actionscript sources are located

3334170
clang	llvm
recently i ve read a lot about the benefits of the llvm stack and especially the benefits that the llvm clang parser brings to c++ compilation

3334184
min	max
is there a single command which resizes and repositions a window and also sets the system menu to reflect a new max min res window state

3334185
imperative	declarative
the blue line resulted from the imperative approach forloop the red line from the declarative code linq

3334217
getter	setter
i would suggest creating getter and setter methods for the fields of your bean and then using then introspector and beaninfo classes from the java.beans package

3334228
imperative	declarative
whenever possible i favor the declarative way of programming instead of imperative

3334242
ssl	https
i m php developer and i know very little when it comes to https ssl but i would like to offer my client safest possible way of uploading file to webpage webftp as part of client service on page

3334243
dictionary	map
if you really want to use just a single return you could make a dictionary to map the switch variable to return values

3334252
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog that will then pop-up you can select the already running instance of visual studio

3334258
int	chars
sizeof a chars literal 3 is 4 because chars literals are int in c language but not c++

3334283
int	chars
an int requires 4 chars s of space to hold it

3334287
for-loop	loops
your original for-loop looks like it should be iterating over the contents of jarray but you don t use jarray or i anywhere in loops

3334294
int	chars
what is the fastest way to read from stdin a number of 1000000 chars int and split it into an array of one chars int not strings

3334306
put	get
then whenever you get new data you will instantiate a new data object that you can put into the list

3334389
post	get
i think that if i get it to post to the first url i will be able to recreate a new post to the second url - which is my original target

3334392
exif	jfif
oh and not to forget there are different file formats for jpg apparently jfif and exif that you will ened to understand.

3334441
sorting	filtering
this would bring all the business logic involved with filtering sorting into the vm which is the right place for it

3334449
instances	transient
since transient components don t have any end arbitrary end of lifetime and you can produce heaps of their instances during the lifespan of the app there s no other way than being explicit and saying to the container hey i m not gonna use this object anymore feel free to get rid of it thanks for all the fish.

3334454
maven	pom.xml
if i use jetty.port in my child pom.xml in the end-point configuration this works fine if and only if i explicitly pass -djetty.port when invoking maven

3334466
int	chars
this will split any string into an array of int ignoring any non-numeric chars

3334477
rss	feed
the website uses iso-8859-1 as it s character encoding however at this point i want to switch it to utf-8 for some reasons related to rss feed

3334486
portrait	landscape
i need a portrait view and a landscape view for my app

3334486
portrait	landscape
now when i create 2 buttons that show me a portrait view and a landscape view forced by shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation they show up just fine

3334509
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested it on in ie firefox and google-chrome

3334559
uiview	subviews
to do this i have a uiview subclass which acts as the graph background and simply use the drawrect method to draw the scale data elements will get added as subviews to this view since i want the user to be able to interact with them

3334574
textblock	itemscontrol
if you remove that attribute the textblock will get its datacontext from the current item in the itemscontrol which will be the keyvaluepair for that row

3334667
inherited	properties
now i can have objects that either inherited from foo or bar thus number needs to be the way it is now ie directly expose the val properties of x

3334671
width	height
width 1040 height 716

3334671
width	height
set size in the width and height of the flashvars of the wrapper html

3334697
onclick	onchange
another way to state what i want to do i think is do a postback when both the onchange and onclick events fire at the same time

3334727
width	height
i have a specific problem getting values for width and height out of some xml that has namespace prefixes defined

3334727
width	height
i can get other values such as sometext from relatedmaterial quite easily using normal xpath with namespace n but unable to get values for width and height

3334739
hide	show
in zend framework whats the best way or recommended way to show or hide parts of a page depending on some criteria technically just a variable

3334745
oncreate	setcontentview
however if you desire you can customize the screen layout by setting your own view layout with setcontentview in oncreate

3334784
free	malloc
read the parts about malloc and free

3334826
sysv	systemd
when building a program on a systemd with the sysv semantics interrupting signals you should always replace calls to signal with calls to bsd_signal which you can define yourself in terms of sigaction if it doesn t exist

3334833
put	get
thus when writing x data a filesystem needs to get the content block put your writing over it then push back the block on the disk

3334868
mktime	strtotime
you could use mktime as others have suggested but strtotime is a bit more flexible and user friendly

3334899
fileoutputstream	printwriter
simply defer the creating of the fileoutputstream and printwriter until you need it

3334935
button	checkbox
i want to select a checkbox when a button is clicked

3334989
width	height
i ve set a page size of 6 inches width and 5 inches height

3334991
postgresql	mysql
i try to learn scheme and as a test project i wanted to create a very simple website with 1-2 database queries mysql preferred but postgresql would be ok too

3335022
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works on google-chrome firefox and safari but not ie

3335075
profiling	debugging
i have a valid certificate and provisioning profiling for developer and debugging

3335075
profiling	debugging
using the ad hoc distribution profiling won t work because it doesn t have debugging rights

3335095
rss	feed
i am trying to parse itunes top movies top songs albums etc rss feed using php

3335119
hash	md5
as an example if we consider a hash function like md5 where the

3335130
pop-up	dialog
now internet explorer did pop-up the open save cancel dialog box

3335211
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
i use the method onitemclicklistener onclicklistener don t works on gridview but the grid item is not clicked

3335221
width	height
percentage values for width and height are relative to the parent not the window

3335261
matplotlib	scipy
it s a fairly large download but it has tons of tools including several matplotlib numpy scipy ipython etc that i needed wanted

3335264
trojan	virus
so i m pretty sure my site s been infected with some kind of trojan or virus that attached itself to the scripting within the site

3335299
inherited	properties
so you want to inherited all the functionalities of the filesystemwatcher while adding your properties

3335325
google-chrome	firefox
and use google-chrome or firebug for firefox to see whats taking the time on the client side

3335345
getter	setter
this would create two extension methods that act as getter setter for your property that you use like so

3335415
put	get
when i run the service on the production server the file does not get converted nor put into the output directory

3335421
free	malloc
free maybe used when you ve used c and malloc otherwise you should use release and autorelease

3335456
google-chrome	firefox
for example it seems that chances are higher that the applet load in firefox also not always but mostly at least after clicking one or two times on reload and less likely on google-chrome but if i am lucky it also works sometimes

3335458
free	malloc
free is the opposite of malloc and is used in c

3335467
svcutil.exe	wcftestclient
i would recommend that you use the wcftestclient or command line svcutil.exe

3335467
serializable	deserialization
if all else fails would recommend that you run a serializable deserialization unit test against your entity entity graph

3335512
ssl	https
however this solution hinders compatibility by requiring a plugin to be installed is much more complex and ultimately rendered unnecessary by the existence of http over ssl tls https

3335536
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
you d have a couple of tables within that database where the user s permissions are defined in as well when the user logs in from either the webmail application or the music download application the security database is checked for valid credentials and you can persist the login through-out and across multiple sites by passing something like a salt md5 hash so that a user only have to login once and when forwarded to the next website automatically get logged in

3335576
hide	show
my workaround is to hide a non modal alwaysontop window show modal window hide modal window restore show again the non modal alwaysontop window

3335582
mouse	keyboard
thrown when code that is dependent on a keyboard display or mouse is called in an environment that does not support a keyboard display or mouse

3335591
free	strdup	free	malloc	strdup	malloc
free is a c function that you use to dispose of no longer needed memory you obtained through malloc or other function that is documented to require free to deallocate its memory strdup

3335595
jar	war
however because often a service conceptually belongs in the jar far more than the war and certainly auto-wired repositories and transactional classes do

3335595
jar	war
obviously i know you cannot remove all spring dependencies if you want to use annotations and transactions since they are actually spring classes but is there some best practice people use that limit the liability if there are changes to spring or there are projects that use older spring versions in their war than what is included in the jar

3335599
accessor	properties
get accessor provide read access to a properties and set accessor provide write access

3335599
accessor	properties
add a get accessor to the properties

3335620
chown	chmod
search for chown and chmod

3335625
put	get
the first thing to do is put some structure in place get the whole mess into a version system so at least you can track what you re doing and roll back if needed

3335630
getter	setter
you might not like it but that what even the automatic properties syntax does after compilation - it generates a private field and uses that in the getter and setter

3335694
range	min	range	max	min	max
if max - min is not so huge for example you define bounds in 1..1024 you could use just an array which point every x to the list of range

3335721
firefox	safari
my favourite is support gradients for nice modern browsers new safari firefox versions internet explorer and use a normal background-color as fallback for the bad browsers old safari firefox versions

3335786
pop-up	dialog
the web server has only one screen and the dialog boxes will pop-up according to the people browsing the web page

3335786
pop-up	dialog
all of these points combined means that the servlet won t be configured to have access to a graphics environment and there will be no opportunity to display a pop-up dialog

3335786
awt	swing
in general you can t mix swing awt code with servlets

3335786
awt	swing
however there is a subset of graphics operations available in both swing and awt which allow image manipulation without needing a graphical environment

3335808
post	get
post would spring to mind but i think get is a more appropriate method because 99 of the time you only supply a bunch of parameters to these types of actions

3335808
post	get
you could use a post to create a new batchjob resource and allow the user to do a get to see the progress of the job so far

3335860
vb.net	vb6	int	boolean
this made quite a few things difficult for the migration to .net because the loose type system of vb6 allowed to mix int and boolean in the same expression and 2 and true meant something else in vb6 than in vb.net

3335866
viewdidload	dealloc
we would need your property declarations and the viewdidload viewdidunload dealloc methods of the controller in question

3335867
jstl	taglib
use taglib like jstl and or el in jsp to render html css js content conditionally

3335887
width	height	portrait	landscape
i would expect that i get something like width 320.000 height 480.000 when in portrait and width 480.000 height 320.000 in the landscape mode

3335887
width	height
instead i always got width 320.000 height 480.000 what ever the actual orientation is

3335908
dependencyobject	observablecollection	inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
these are primarily the dependencyobject dependency properties inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged and the observablecollection t

3335969
gzipinputstream	filechannel
i ve played around with extracting gzip archives using gzipinputstream but this won t take a filechannel

3335969
fileinputstream	filechannel
i don t have access to the original fileinputstream that the filechannel was taken from

3335979
clang	llvm
llvm is an alternative that might be even easier to install but less people know how to use it at the moment need the base llvm plus clang i normally build from sources but that takes forever

3335996
margin	height
i d like to include all padding margin in my height

3336024
accessor	properties
as far as i understand when you use properties the compiler still converts them to accessor methods during compilation

3336045
margin	height
if you want to include the padding and border use outerheight false if you want to include padding border and margin use outerheight true and if you want to include only the height of the element use height

3336048
javadoc	scaladoc
i wish to compile scaladoc and javadoc in a project with both scala and java in it

3336048
javadoc	scaladoc
suggestions of how to get scaladoc and javadoc out of src and tweetstream4j src

3336055
hash	md5
using the md5 hash of the username is not a very good idea because anyone can automate that

3336062
gmail	hotmail
i generally test against gmail hotmail and a server running spamassassin to check mails i send out

3336062
salt	md5
however if you salt the md5 you can easily prevent people from generating the md5 s in an automated way that s an open invitation for automated signups

3336096
hash	md5
the md5 hash is fine if you re hashing with a timestamp

3336114
client-side	server-side
can be easily achieved with server-side languages like php but i have no idea if it can be achieved with client-side languages like javascript if so i d love to see an answer about it too

3336146
opera	firefox
that works great on firefox and opera

3336150
bash	tcsh
it worked when i was using a bash shell however the is treated differently in the tcsh shell

he wants me to set up the rss feed so that when he posts to his wordpress blog the rss feed generates a feed with the title of the blog

3336208
int	boolean
if you wanted to make it a little more clean and easier to debug as the code grows larger use a boolean or int to indicate the status of your loop condition

3336247
rss	feed
i d use wordpress built-in plugin search to search for an rss plugin feed and go through each of their features

3336247
rss	feed
some even comes with other configurations you can make and it automatically usually updates the wordpress blog indicating to the bot where the rss feed is and even puts on a nice rss feed image for you to use

3336262
post	get
i used a post request to prevent the browser from caching the response but this should work equally well with get requests

3336288
opera	firefox
it is working elsewhere including firefox opera etc

3336299
rss	feed
wordpress has full built-in rss capabilities wordpress feed â wordpress codex

3336299

google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and google-chrome but only sporadically in internet explorer 8

3336400
range	minimum
i think what you want to do is known as range minimum query

3336440
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome after execution i check the html and everything has worked alright

3336441
children	parent
and even then i don t know for sure if it would work because i don t know if tortoisesvn shows the status of external children in the icon of the parent

3336455
uninstall	upgrade
be careful to test upgrade to ensure that you add the other parts of the condition remove all so that the upgrade of the old product stays an uninstall and doesn t flip to repair

3336470
ant	maven
i use maven not ant

3336474
margin	height
if you want the height including padding or margin then you can use outerheight

3336505
getter	setter
i ve put breakpoints on the filestream property setter and getter and the size property of the stream is always correct never zero

3336558
width	height
i am trying to get the height and width of images via a url in java without an imageobserver

3336558

doc	rtf
anytopdf is a perl script that converts openoffice.org microsoft office word doc excel xls rtf html and other openoffice.org readable file formats to the pdf format

3336668

storing the password in the database you should store a salt hash instead

3336698
public	protected
this allows for an instantiated class or public static method to access it s own private protected static methods

3336745
width	height
try getting the width height in

3336764
children	parent
if i have a branch that i essentially am using as parent i create a few children branches from it and then rename copy and delete the parent won t the children branches be fatherless and hence lose considerable amount of their history

3336766
draggable	droppable
i m wondering since i haven t played around with your specific problem yet if you could set your tbody as droppable and your tr as draggable

3336767
inherited	properties
i wish to be able to inherited these properties methods in a child class

3336770
width	height
i use a simple jquery script to center it in the available width and height on window.resize event

3336783
postgresql	mysql
i m one of those that recently decided to migrate from mysql to postgresql and with it a lot of old habits are being torn apart

3336783
postgresql	mysql
however there is functionality from mysql i would like to preserve in postgresql

3336818
fastcgi	scgi
as such for hosting wsgi applications in conjunction with apache it has a lower memory overhead and performs better than existing wsgi adapters for mod_python or alternative fastcgi scgi cgi or proxy based solutions

3336821
width	height
you are not supposed to set width height of any resizable yourself

3336841
portrait	landscape
it s seems to be ok at time of launch but if i turn the device to landscape then back to portrait the table in the popover will have an additional blank row at top so that i have to scroll down to see the others..

3336877
min	max
for each of your subranges min max you can find the iterators i_min and i_max and

3336922
accessor	ivar
if that s true what s the point of creating the ivar manually ignoring the obvious that there are sometimes valid reasons for not using the g setter accessor

3336922
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
or asked differently should i only ever create an ivar for a properties when i need to bypass the accessor

3336926
children	parent
i would try having a parent process which forks out children processes

3336926
children	parent
the parent process will still need to have a longer max_execution_time setting which can be set within the script itself while the children have a max_execution_time setting of 30 seconds

3336964
globalization	localization
globalization and localization demystified in asp.net 2.0

the server-side file handler displays a document in the context of the browser rather than opening the document in a client-side application infopath excel etc.

3337040
cpu	processors
what s the easiest way to retrieve similar windows metrics such as the processors queue length or cpu utilisation either in pure java or via jni

3337049
integer	fractions
the most natural extensions are either integer programs similar to lp s but all variables must take on integer values--that is no fractions components or convex programming perhaps a more general extension

3337089
put	get
when you start tweaking things and get into non-standard configurations then that s one more thing you or your dba s have to remember to do when you put your application into production

webkit	gecko
the result works with webkit and gecko but ie 7 + 8 what a surprise they load no content

3337138
put	get	min	max	filtering	grouping
the key is to always think in terms of sets and how do those sets get put together through joins filtering through where conditions or on conditions within a join and when necessary grouping and aggregated min max avg etc.

3337194
post	get
even in the most trivial of cases a bland post on a forum didn t happen or some such i would match rather get a cryptic message that at least gives me the idea that something went wrong and if i care i should try again or call somebody then just say update complete when it really isn t

3337203
getter	setter
essentially getter and setter are allowed to have side-effects other than just setting a variable

3337210
min	max
this program takes in the max and min that the data can be and throws out data that is less than the min or greater than the max

3337210
range	minimum
this case only happens when the minimum range of the variable being checked is 0

3337214
mouseleave	mouseenter
then when the mouseenter for the panel fires set it to true...then stop the mouseleave logic from firing unless it is set to false

3337251
min	max
and throws out data that is less than the min or greater than the max

3337251
min	max
then you need to set 0 as the min value and -1 as the max value --- which does not make sense

3337251
min	max
and throws out data that is less than the min and greater than the max

3337289
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i have a uiimageview that responds to touchesmoved touchesbegan it works perfectly

3337290
integer	fractions
this by the way is a special program called a binary integer program or bip for short because all the variables are integers no fractions values and all values are either 0 or 1

3337314
width	height
is there a way to efficiently assign other cell properties top left width height to an array

3337314
width	height
my current method of iterating over the cells in the usedrange is slow since it requires repeatedly polling for the top left width height of the cells

3337314
width	height
1 find the interesting set of rows in the used range by looking at the tops and height of the first cell in each row my understanding is that all the cells in the row must have the same top and height but not left and width

3337351
children	parent
in the above parent with parent_id 5 may have 1 children that have graduated

3337351
children	parent
parent with parent_id 6 either has no children at all or has children but none of them has graduated

3337352
dijit.form	dojo
when i call this the scope within the dojo method is dijit.form

3337364
range	min	range	max	min	max
if you need to generate a single forumala for all of these cells i think it should be possible using the offset in combination with max min and row to generate the appropriate range with just a little arithmatic

3337408
min	max
2 generate the value and look for the max and min existing unique identifiers

3337408
range	min	range	max	min	max
the min and max value give you a range of available values to work from if the random value is already assigned

folder	directory
the also explained why the application ran well on other computers with their tomcat folder directly on the root directory

3337664
post	get
if â on the other hand â your app is a native app youâ ll most likely want to use core data for storage and get incremental updates in a separate thread or using libdispatch in case youâ re only targetting post 4.0 devices using a separate managed object context which you can then merge to the main thread using mergechangesfromcontextdidsavenotification

3337680
post	get
this will always respect your current permalink structure and is the safest way to get post s url

3337715
post	get
first make sure your form that post to the search page is a get operation this way the search details are in your query string

uiview	subviews
each subviews is a custom uiview subclass not a uilabel or uiimageview

3337734
uiview	subviews
the uiview has a number of subviews

3337734
uiview	subviews
this handling should be transparent uiview and its subviews should still receive their touch events even if they intersect with the specified rectangle

3337866
google-chrome	firefox
works great in google-chrome and firefox but it doesn t fire in ie

3337879
hide	show
that means that when it overflow horrozontally it will just hide the content rather than show a scroll bar

3337883
hash	hmac
but the existence of collision attacks implies that the compression function on which the hash function is built is not a random oracle and this voids the hmac security proof

i thought the delegation keyword was just shorthand for a class which inherits from multicastdelegate

3338451
multicastdelegate	delegation
but tbh just use delegation in place of multicastdelegate

i think i stand by david blevins in the sense that glassfish now means oracle and we all know the legacy they left behind with oc4j

3338977

what if i want to extract the auto value basically to be able to get the new height or width

3339257
tabcontrol	tabitem
i intended to disable and enable the buttons outside the tabcontrol just like those inside the tabitem when the current tab is changed

3339274
floating-point	integer
secondly just because some floating-point type uses some specific number of bits it does not mean that this type can precisely represent an integer value using all these bits if that s what you want

3339539
hash	salt
at the very least salt and hash your passwords then store the hash

3339553
getter	setter
moose is an excellent module for oop in perl because it creates an enforceable oo layer and automagically handles accessor methods so you don t have to define a bunch of getter and setter

3339573

use composition instead of inherited lionextended would expose properties for feeding and socialnature that are implemented not in some base animal class but in smaller classes that deal with just one concern

3339932
google-chrome	firefox
the way the code works on ie8 google-chrome firefox is it collapses all of the comments bellow the initial message so just their subjects appear

3339940
jobs	cron
as for purely improving efficiency http headers to check for the last-updated time are inaccurate and i don t think cron jobs would give me the live results which i m looking to get

jquery	jqmodal
i m using the jquery plugin jqmodal

3340359
width	height
is there an exact ratio of width height i can depend on to measure this

3340408
width	height
it is not a problem with the width and height setting

3340469
postgresql	mysql
this is one thing that sql is consistent about - if you don t provide a time portion on a date data type that includes a time portion ie oracle postgresql while mysql and sql server explicitly call it datetime then the time portion is defaulting to exactly midnight of that date - 00 00 00

3340477
width	height
components added to north in borderlayout will occupy complete width and height will be preffered height of component

3340479

width	height
lets say i want the image to only display a width of 200px and a height of 200px

3340547
put	get	width	height	background-image	background-position
you could put it as a background-image for the div make it a block with set width height use background-position to get the position you wanted

3340575
width	height
its bottom-right corner is 210px from the top and 230px from the left which gives you your 200px of width and height

3340577
try-catch	exception-handling
whatever overhead try-catch incurs is probably negligible but what draws my attention more with the first case is that it s misleading you re catching an exception-handling only to abort the loop

3340663
super	self
i m only initializing self with super init which is initializing a base class pointer to a derived class

3340669
getter	setter
i am starting with android and java and i am starting to understand it but i am wondering why i should use getter and setter and not just public variables

3340682
getter	setter
for example you can provide a getter but not a setter so that they may be read but not written

3340694
getter	setter	mutators	setter	mutators	getter
some of the advantages are you can specify different access level for setter mutators and getter accessors for example public getter and private setter

3340760
getter	setter
since the clients of the class only see the getter setter you can easily change the implementation of the class methods by switching the phone number representation to a phonenumber object

3340773
emacs	aquamacs
and as is asked and answered in running clojure and other lisp at the same time on emacs i could use both clojure lisp on aquamacs

3340842
opera	firefox
this works in firefox but it fails in ie and opera

3340858
integer	unsigned
for example you need an unsigned 32-bit integer type

3340858
integer	unsigned
that s why you typedef a separate type to be 32-bit unsigned integer and use the new type in your code

3340932
int	chars
when you have just an array of abstract chars s int s or something else

3340939
getter	setter
for example if i have an instance variable that i am going to write my own setter getter and do not declare it as a property does that make that instance variable atomic

3340945
filesystems	ntfs
evidently core filesystems technology moves slowly fat32 ext3 ntfs everything else is small fish what debugging techniques are employed

3340960
accessor	properties

something that i just thought of that could cause a hang would be if arping was actually a link to a setuid root program that did sudo on the real arping and it is waiting on a passwd to be typed in but the terminal for that program isn t set correctly

3345466
servicepoint	httpwebrequest
httpwebrequest has a servicepoint property which in turn has bindipendpointdelegate which may be what you re looking for

3345539
scheme	racket
i m not sure that the rename was useful as anything other than a marketing gimmick but racket is definitely a distinct dialect of scheme

3345543

hide	show
use a combination of media tags in css to show hide objects for printing

3345761

i agree with the others that you should get off the thread that the read is happening as soon as possible - don t block the ftdi event handler for any longer than at takes to put the buffer into another queue

3345772
translation	localization
localization i ve seen attached properties used to access the resources and provide the translation value

does an unsigned char or unsigned short suit your needs

3346262
metaclass	subclassing
should my metaclass be a subclassing of enthought s metaclass

3346315

i need the stderr of the child process to go to an already existing named pipe the stdout of the child to go to the stdout of the parent and the stdin of the child tp come from the same place as the stdin of the parent

3346335
children	parent
besides wrapping a around the first part of the list item and running the function on that is there a selector that will let me run something on the parent but not any of its children specifically not the child lists and list items

3346379
spaces	delimiter
but i can not use spaces as delimiter

3346414
for-loop	loops
you could use a for-loop to loops over the length of the smaller of the strings and check at each position individually

3346433
for-loop	arrays
i would split the strings by spaces then i would do a for-loop looking for numbers in the resulting arrays

3346447
width	height
other question if there is no width or height to the specified what is the best way to solve the issue

3346447
width	height
download all the images and get the corresponding attributes of width and height then add them back to the string

3346447
width	height
the correct tag is the one that closes with and have the valid width height

3346450
int	double
i ve seen them both being used in numerous pieces of c# code and i d like to know when to use i++ or ++i i being a number variable like int float double etc

3346452
width	height
i am trying to set the width and height of images in a datalist in the codebehind

3346452
width	height
the plan is to do something more complex than this based on the width height so setting width and height in the aspx file to 50 is not an option

3346452
width	height
for some reason i always get 0 for width and height

3346484
stdout	stderr
if you re totally confident no-one has pulled any stunts on you like closing stdout you can avoid using dup2 by closing stderr fd 2 before calling open

3346505
resharper	justcode
i do have resharper and telerink justcode installed along with some power tools

3346526
allocator	stl
i am extracting exported methods from the pe export table and facing strange lengthy allocator where stl containers were used in the original source code

3346568
post	get
as described in my blog post you need to do the following to get this working

3346568
tortoisehg	hgsubversion
now the tortoisehg binary will be used when you invoke hg from the command line and the hgsubversion extension will work as advertised

3346594
getter	setter
should i have a normal getter and setter for every field

3346595
width	height
have you tried declaring defining an onload handler for the image and setting the height width in there

3346608
width	height
your code above is referencing a image control that more then likely does not specify a width and or height

3346608
width	height
then you could determine the width and height

3346608
width	height
then you would be able to do your adjustments to the height and width and apply to the properties of the image tag

3346616
width	height
remember with an img tag you don t set width and height by default

3346616
width	height
in this case unless you set width and height they will be 0 or undefined

3346616
width	height
if you need the actual image pixels width and height you ll need to discover that for yourself by loading the image into memory

3346616
width	height
load it into a bitmap then query the width and height there

3346619
getter	setter
can you use a java.util.map instead of a class with setter getter

3346620
vb6	vba
i have a class library written in .net that i would like to make available to vb6 vba

3346629
integer	unsigned
one other hiccup you might have is that php s crc32 function will return an unsigned 32bit integer

3346639
textarea	textbox
the content of the markup has checkboxes textbox and textarea

3346657
gridview	linqdatasource
with linq to sql i can have the linqdatasource control return the products entity and then can have a templatefield in the gridview like so

3346657
gridview	rowdatabound
if i create a rowdatabound event handler for the gridview and get the product entity being bound to the row i see that the product s category property returns nothing

3346690
try-catch	exception-handling
this is mostly curiosity but i ve been reading about the history of visual studio catching seh exception-handling in a c++ try-catch construct

3346700
getter	setter
i m not at all sure i like this one as it means additional complexity but without it finding the particular getter setter you want say via autocompletion in an ide becomes a nightmare

3346725
nstabview	nsviewcontroller
you create an nsviewcontroller subclass for each tab and assign it to the nstabview using nstabviewitem

3346771
textarea	textbox
you didn t mention how and where the checkboxes textbox and textarea will be used so i m not sure how to incorporate them in my example

3346780
mouse	keyboard	keyup	mouseup
since they might paste a url via mouse or via keyboard you could try binding to both keyup and mouseup and check whether a valid url is present

3346784
hash	salt
the best way to handle the password is store a random salt value for each user and the result of a hash of the password + salt

3346784
hash	salt
when the user wants to login compute hash password + salt and see it if is the same as the hash value you stored when the password was originally set

3346828
getter	setter
then create whatever code templates you want getter setter constants

3346866
single-quotes	backslash
that s why there are single-quotes around it and your backslash has been escaped

3346926
public	protected
when it is protected or public it depends on what it does

3346928
filewriter	printwriter
though i have a hunch that its because of the printwriter and filewriter if anyone could point me to why this issue is occurring it would be of great help

3346953
metaclass	subclassing
should my metaclass be a subclassing of enthought s metaclass

3346953
metaclass	subclassing
if the metaclass of a derived class is not a subclassing of the metaclass of all of its bases then python will throw a typeerror when you try to create the derived class

3346964
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox and ie but google-chrome just ignore the instructions

3346988
vim	textmate
for example the rails bundle within textmate on the mac lets you quickly open the view file associated with a particular model and there s a plugin for vim that provides an equivalent feature

3347004
stdout	stdio
if this were a c program the way to fix it would be to disable buffering on stdout or else to use write to fd 1 bypassing stdio

3347035
hash	md5
hash md5 johnny_381 example.com p4ss 0rd

3347035
hash	md5
hash md5 some_uuid_value p4ss 0rd

3347039
children	parent
using the view achieves what you want without the time overhead of having to update the child tables without the space overhead of making child rows wider by adding the redundant column and this really begins to matter when you have many rows as the wider the row the fewer rows can fit into memory at once and most importantly without the possibility of inconsistent data when the parent is updated but the children are not

3347047
put	get
and that works for the most part except for the fact that i have to put the namespace on every element or else i get the following structure in the result

3347093
terminate	timeout
while the train is enroute the js train movement function calls itself using settimeout until the backend returns a statusfinaldest of arrived at which time the train movement timeout loop is supposedly terminate

3347134
post	get
i figured you guys would get the gist from the first post but here is a more elaborated example

3347176
inherited	subclassing
since participanttypebudget is a subclassing of programbudget it inherited all programbudget s members including all nested classes - hence including itself

3347217
disk	ram
edit 2 this will not work if you have an infinite iterator or one which consumes too many gigabytes in 2010 1 gigabyte is still a large amount of ram disk space of ram disk space

3347219
implements	extends
not sure if they ve implements text functions in the gem but it s not difficult to extends to call other libgd2 functions

3347243
put	get
this doesn t get put to test often very unusual to have one app take so many taskbar buttons

3347246
quicksort	heapsort
also if you are choosing between two algorithms that have the same big-o complexity o n log n quite often one is better than the other random-pivot quicksort generally outperforms a binary heapsort

3347248
min	max
when i run the above query the min returned is larger than the max

3347248
min	max
i was thinking at first that mysql was processing the min max before it got to pline.

3347250
updatepanel	scriptmanager
update i had to change the scriptmanager extension as it still was not playing nice with updatepanel

3347328
excel	listobject
when i set the formula for a selected cell in a listobject if the listcolumn is empty excel fills the formula for the whole column rather than just the selection

3347374
width	height
as far as the bit about the width and height attributes if you re trying to display the images at their regular width and height you shouldn t need them

3347374
width	height
the only time you should need width and height is if you re displaying the image at a different size than the original image s size which doesn t appear to be the case here

3347400
filewriter	printwriter
perhaps you left this out of the code you posted but are you explicitly calling flush and close on the printwriter filewriter objects when you are done with them

3347403
min	max
-- a gcc-specific language extension providing specialized operators for implementing min and max

3347406
hash	salt
1 each password is salt differently and the salt is stored with the hash

3347406
hash	salt
it sends the password which the server salt hash and compares

3347424
subtract	addition	subtract	add	subtraction	add	subtraction	addition
the next problem is a compare is a subtract subtract and add go through the same alu and take the same time as addition so for most platforms old and new trading compares subtraction for addition wont save you anything you end up looking at the branch cost pipeline flush etc

3347426
put	get
if the latter put your settimeout within that callback and you ll only get the next request 1s after your ajax returns

3347470
hash	salt
a hash the password along with a random salt using a method producing 128-bit or longer output

3347470
128bit	64bit
now instead of guessing 128bit keys he just guesses your 64bit password and then uses the same algorithm

3347470
hash	salt
yes if you salt the key someone needs the salt to decrypt things you encrypted using the salt key s hash value

3347470
hash	salt
again the purpose of the salt is not to raise the strength of the encryption it is only to prevent precomputation attacks against your hash

3347482
hash	salt
the idea is that even if the password hash database is stolen it would be very difficult to get the actual passwords you d have to try a lot of combinations without having the salt as well

3347482
hash	salt
server adds a random salt to the password and then hash it

3347482
hash	salt
the salt and final hash are stored in separate tables

3347482
hash	salt
server hash the password and salt

3347504
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectoutputstream serializes the objects hashmap in this case in whatever format that objectinputstream will understand to deserialize and does so generically for any serializable object

3347514
post	get
the test will 1 do a get or a post to fetch a page then 2 confirm the page actually loaded and has the right stuff

3347514
post	get
the tests will 1 attempt a get or post to process a page

3347514
post	get
some tests will 2 confitrm that the get or post worked

3347514
post	get
the test will 1 do a get or a post to fetch a page then 2 confirm the page actually loaded and has the right stuff

3347526
ati	nvidia
you may be able to find it if it exists in gdc papers siggraph papers ati sdk or nvidia sdk

3347591
google-chrome	firefox
ie8 firefox google-chrome etc do not have the same behaviour

3347604
vb6	vba
i am in the middle of trying to create a class library available for use in vb6 vba

3347645
folder	directory
the idea is to store the secured files in a folder that is not available from the web not a virtual directory

3347665
client-side	server-side
this was the ideal solution too because i didn t want to implement a hack of server-side code for a specific client-side solution

3347726
google-chrome	firefox
it works with multiple languages including python and allows for testing in google-chrome firefox ie and other browsers

3347730
emacs	textmate
it works the same for emacs textmate etc

3347764
children	parent
when a user searches for the top-most product this query is supposed to return the parent its children and its children s children

3347774
g++	gcc
usual gcc version that i use 4.1.2 produced four undefined reference to errors during linking with g++ specifically to _m_widen_init and

3347799
children	parent
basically since you stated the xml is hierarchical you need to put the children indre the appropriate parent

3347799
children	parent
that way the children are beneath the parent nodes

3347830
x86	64bit
for one thing you don t know at the time your source code is being compiled to il what cpu architecture your code will be running on at runtime - 32 bit or 64bit x86

3347848
client-side	server-side
ch can be used for both server-side and client-side web development

3347857
post	get
but one service is going to be handling post request while the other is handling the get request

3347857
post	get
edit another weird thing only one of the services throws this error my jsonp get service while the regular json post service works

3347862
comparator	comparable
that happens because you use the raw type comparable and the compiler can t be sure what you re comparing against since comparator uses the type parameter of comparable

3347862
super	extends	super	implements	implements	extends
super t since you may have a class a that extends a class b which implements but a doesn t implements

3347865
textarea	textbox
i m assuming so if it has textbox textarea etc

3347890
accessor	properties
i know i can use properties but sometimes accessor methods are still needed

pull	push
i need to fall-back to command line for a workable push pull behavior

3348023
min	max
parameters-- the values of those parameters are tightly bounded by a max and min value

3348108
backgrounding	multitasking
this will kill the app when the home button is pressed instead of suspending it into the backgrounding which is what ios4 does for multitasking

3348195
put	get
don t know if you can get away with all the nil pointers i put in here but if it doesn t work just look up the docs

3348202
onmousemove	onmouseup
the above function should be attached to window.onmousedown onmouseup onmousemove whatever

3348222
pull	push
but then when i do a pull an update and change that file as user a and then try to push i get

3348245
hide	show
then when one button is tapped you check which one was tapped based on sender or tag and hide the button pressed but show the next one underneath it

3348271
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works in google-chrome and safari but if firefox you see the 2f in the address bar

3348280
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
just use a generic uipickerview and return appropriate values from your uipickerviewdelegate uipickerviewdatasource methods

3348305
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
we unfortunately have as part of our testing 7 win vm s to test just ie then two for firefox on windows firefox 3.0 and 3.x - the latest plus two vms for google-chrome and two vms for safari on windows

3348355
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
.focus and .blur both work in firefox and ie but not entirely in safari and google-chrome

3348391
memcached	apc
then you can use memcached as suggested you may also look to apc cache as well

3348403
sorting	filtering
generally you should let the database do things databases are good at - filtering sorting and joining data

3348453
profiler	visualvm
netbeans has its own profiler which is based on jdk s builtin visualvm profiler actually it s the other way round the visualvm was born out of the netbeans profiler ages ago

3348516
jar	war
put the classifier in the configuration of the jar war ear plugin

3348526
partition-problem	np-hard
this smells like a variation of the classical partition-problem which is np-hard although some heuristics exists

3348556
google-chrome	firefox
the following code is working fine in firefox and google-chrome but works sporadically in ie7 8

3348561
mousemove	mouseleave
it works great except for i would like the image to be hidden by default and to only appear when the mouse is present and then when the mouseleave to disappear again. this could normally be handled with the hover property but it does not work when placed with the mousemove property

3348615
google-chrome	firefox
this link displays properly in firefox but the flash youtube player loads way down the page in google-chrome

3348618
profiling	debugging
if i m not mistaken it should do this automatically as long as the profiling is set to debugging

3348632
onclick	onsubmit
in general you should be trapping onsubmit on the form rather than onclick on a particular button to ensure you always get informed if the form is submitted by another means such as enter being pressed

3348632
submit	submission
consequently you d use a normal submit button. use return false from the event handler to prevent the form submission from going ahead

3348637
fseek	ftell
what s the difference between fgetpos fsetpos and ftell fseek

3348647
post	put
just as the blog post suggests i ve put paperclip into the config initializers directory

3348651
fseek	ftell
well from the manpage we can see that ftell and fseek use type long int to represent offsets positions in a file and may therefore be limited to offsets which can be represented in a long int

3348657
factors	matrix
i think you have loaded your data without and what you have is a factors matrix and so your generally good idea fails

3348704
scrollable	panels
or can i have a scrollable panels

3348828
free	malloc
will this last free free everything that was malloc d or only sizeof mystruct

3348833
submit	submission
this a lot of overhead in relatively slow client-side code to be compressing submission data and it s not trivial to submit the raw bytes you will obtain from it

3348833
post	get
even in a post form the default enctype is application x-www-form-urlencoded which means a majority of bytes are going to get encoded as nn sequences

better to catch onscroll and onresize from script to call the repositioning and add a slower setinterval poller to update it for the other cases that can t be caught from events

3349104
boost	stl
if you want to use some solution based on smart pointers don t be tempted to use auto_ptr as the copy semantics are wrong for stl containers - go for something like the boost shared_ptr

post	get	post	put	put	get
handling rest in general is a pain in the neck because dispatching to a view function based on method get post put or delete isn t part of django

3349137
free	memcpy
basically you ll see there is no real hooking to speak of the c level stack is switched back and forth under the interpreter s nose so to speak except for the delicate interactions with thread state in multi-threaded code and the saving and restoring of a greenlet s state from to the stack is based on memcpy calls plus some calls to the python memory manager to allocate reallocate and free space coming from or going back to the stack

3349152
strlen	strdup
what happens is that strlen refuses to give me anything i know how strdup works and i ve tested this myself and segfaults

3349257
ant	maven
and the generation itself was probably done using ant and the ant task or maybe maven but the idea is similar

3349257
ant	maven
instead look for a build.xml an ant build script or maybe a maven script and see if you can get those file generated at build time this is just how it s supposed to be used

folder	directory
if you re using the web application project - make changes build move the files to the virtual directory target folder then test

3349325
free	malloc
one thing to be careful of when doing this sort of thing is that the allocation record used by free to determine what memory to deallocate is created by malloc and associated with the address malloc returns

3349325
free	malloc
what this means is that you can call free on any pointer pointing to the first byte of the malloc d block and it will deallocate the correct block of memory but if you call free on any address in the block other than the first byte you will at best sigsev or sigbus and at worst corrupt the allocation tables leading to bizarre and inexplicable behaviour

3349370
bash	tcsh

3349420
justmock	typemock
i just use justmock since a couple of days and one of the greatest features that i have found is that justmock let the edit and continue of visual studio work instead of typemock that lock totally your code like with the old version of visual studio

3349838
int	chars
should i add a type column like a chars or int so that i would know

3349853
hash	md5
though you might want to avoid simple hash functions for example any half-baked idea that you could think up quickly because they might not mix up the sentence data enough to avoid collisions in the first place one of the standard cryptographic hash functions would probably be quite suitable for example md5 sha-1 or sha-256

3349882
submit	submission
now the issue i have is that if the user edits one of the fields being checked at any time if they don t click out of it and try submission the form data the .blur function takes control as it should by how this is coded so it takes a second click to submit the form data

3349899
subtraction	addition
i would use a heuristic like approximating the distance with simple addition and subtraction

3349903
thin	webrick
i was getting 0.5 reqs s on the front page of my rails app a very simple mostly static page that made a couple of database calls but nothing that webrick said took longer than 0.8 ms served with thin

3349910
client-side	server-side
there is no reason why you cannot have php running on your own server computer that returns html or xml that gets consumed by your mobile application but to the best of my knowledge there is currently no way to have php running on the mobile phone itself although even if you could php is typically a server-side technology and not a client-side technology so that would be unusual

3349947
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t work in either firefox or google-chrome

3349962
children	parent
basically because indexes exist only over a single table if you have a unique constraint on your parent table then how can it enforce that uniqueness over the parent and all of its children

3349962
children	parent
the children could insert values into their tables that already exist in the parent or the parent could insert a value that already exists in one of the children

3349962
children	parent
likewise foreign keys cannot reference the parent table and or its children because it s ambiguous which row is referenced if multiple rows can exist in parent children with the same primary key or unique value

3349963
min	max
edit given a slight clarification in the op s edit of his q the heuristics i would suggest is to pick some sensible max and min relevant substring length say 2 and 5 call them minrsl and maxrsl for definiteness

3349963
range	min	range	max	min	max
but if you have many more words to index or substantially-longer words or need much-vaster range of min to max rsl then the numbers can grow worrisome and this is the case in which the savings of say a factor of three for the more complicated slower-to-search scheme may be considered worthwhile

3349975
int	chars
the first is declaring a pointer variable a variable that holds a pointer instead of an int chars or float notice that you have to specify what type of variable it will point at

3350006
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	modulo	division	subtraction	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	modulo	addition	multiplication	addition	modulo	multiplication	modulo
you have the same problem in subtraction division and modulo and it wouldn t hurt to do it the same way for addition and multiplication either

children	parent
make sure you adjust your delegate methods to reflect the size and content of the parent dictionary and children arrays

3350457

nsstring	nsdata
i have the following code for creating an nsstring to contain the body of the text file and then convert it to nsdata and output it to a file

3352395
dictionary	map
also - you need to know that the sorteddictionary is somewhat of a misnomer if you equate dictionary to map or hashtable

3352432
maven	pom.xml
can you please tell me how can amend pom.xml in maven for achieving the same

3352464
folder	directory
i created a windows service app which knows how to create virtual directory in the root folder of the iis 7.5

3352464
folder	directory	folder	dir
now lets say i created a virtual dir named myvdir within the root folder and then i want to create another virtual dir with the same c# function as above - within the myvdir virtual directory create nested virtual directory

3352480
hash	salt
looks like hash password + random salt is the way to go

3352481
put	get
even if i put the object in models instead app_code where i normally put all code in webforms i still don t get the normal intelisense so.

3352540
width	margin
if at the point that you create and populate the listbox you set the width of the child items whether textbox or textblock to a known value for instance the width of the listbox minus any margin and then set textwrapping.wrap as normal your text will wrap as you expect

3352564
children	parent
the important point is that child_first is used to iterate over the children files first before their parent folders

3352612
maven	pom.xml
why is maven downloading dependencies from repository even if the jar exists on my local repository one reason could be that jar doesn t have a pom.xml is there a way to get bypass that except with the -o option

3352617
imperative	declarative
it s important to realize that sql is a declarative language and not an imperative one

3352649
rss	feed
is there any easy way to read rss feed in windows forms

3352671
division	multiplication
exercise 14.16-17 in thompson asks me to add the operations of multiplication and integer division to the type expr which represents a simple language for arithmetic then define the functions show and eval evaluates an expression of type expr for expr

3352686
stdout	stderr
in your case file descriptor 1 stdout and file descriptor 2 stderr are open to the same file as the parent

3352697
folder	directory	temp	tmp
my temp tmp environment variable was pointing to a ram drive root folder t without any further directory nesting

3352697
temp	tmp
now my temp tmp environment variable is pointing to t temp and everything is working fine

3352725
uicontrol	uibutton
in ib view identity inspector when i type in my uicontrol subclass into the class field it reverts back to uibutton when i tab out

3352725
uicontrol	uibutton
any uibutton subclass works but not a uicontrol

3352725
uicontrol	uibutton
the first plan was to go to xcode and change the superclass of my new control temporarily to uibutton change the class of my ib buttons and then change the xcode code superclass back to uicontrol

3352749
swt	swing
file io networking and the standard guis swing and swt work on different os without changes

3352758
min	max
also it would be nice to save max min avg etc

3352797
put	get
by default objects included in a style will be shared and you will get one image object shared by every menuite but if you put them in a separate resource dictionary you can mark them as not shared

3352798
casting	autoboxing
java whatâ s the difference between autoboxing and casting

3352931
redhat	fedora
i use fedora 13 on my laptop and i use yum to install recordmydesktop just for fun.one day my boss ask me to install recordmydesktop into his computer whose operating system is redhat enterprise 5.2

3352931
redhat	fedora
i know the reason is in the yum s source but how can i use the source in fedora to the yum in rhel redhat enterprise

3352942
singleton	facade
the major gof design patterns are decorator state iterator facade strategy proxy factory method adapter observer template method composite singleton abstract factory and command

3352955
arraylist	treeset
i want to write a type-safe map method in java that returns a collection of the same type as the argument passed arraylist linkedlist treeset etc. but with a different generic type that between the angled brackets determined by the generic type of another parameter the resulting type of the generic mapping function

3352957
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
the following code does not work and throws a runtimeexception caused by nullpointerexception

3352968
google-chrome	firefox
i was just wondering is this a bad thing because when i open it in google-chrome or firefox it loads fine

3353019
unsigned	short
java does not have type like unsigned byte you have to use larger short for this for unsigned int it has to be long

3353022
invariantculture	cultureinfo
replace your use of invariantculture with new cultureinfo en-us and it will become obvious why the first parse doesn t work

3353051
mvp	presenter
another pattern that might be interesting for you is the mvp model view presenter -pattern

3353087
scheme	racket
i m using racket though any other scheme implementation will also do

3353112
width	height
you can try to use the methods winfo_screenwidth and winfo_screenheight which return respectively the width and height in pixels of your tk instance window and with some basic math you can center your window

3353112
width	height
i am calling update_idletasks method before retrieving the width and the height of the window in order to ensure that the values returned are accurate

3353116
accessor	properties
so you ll probably use both when a control exist in ajax toolkit and you need some server side properties accessor etc

3353217
public	protected
due to the fact that an ilist will not meet your needs and how you re not luckily using automapping i would set foos to be a protected private ilist nhibernate-friendly collection and then create a public readonlycollection that reads through foos

3353268
width	height
my problem is my width height and scrolling options don t actually do anything

3353286
agile	greenhopper	agile	sprint	greenhopper	sprint
you can use greenhopper another 10 purchase to do agile planning around these issues such as backlog planning and sprint tracking

3353309
mouseleave	mouseenter
jquery also fiddles a bunch of event code to try to make submit focus blur focusin focusout mouseenter mouseleave events work and bubble across browsers

3353351
client-side	server-side
asp.net ajax is part client-side but also part server-side

3353351
updatepanel	scriptmanager
if your application has any updatepanel you have no choice but to include microsoftajax.js which is coming in automatically with the scriptmanager

3353433
ant	emma
ant cant find the emma jar files make sure you have emma.jar and emma_ant.jar in your classpath

3353479
ant	maven
in other words given some makefiles and maven or ant xml files and the name of the top-level target is there a way to identify all of the files that will be generated the programs used to generate them and the input files associated with those programs

3353525
daemons	systemd
rather than reinventing the wheel do not implement your own queueing systemd for processing of messages - route the messages directly to a maildir or mailbox and run a daemons to poll the contents and process it

3353586
getter	setter
i can understand why you might want to do this sort of thing but i kind of take the same position i take with testing getter and setter they should be tested as a side effect of testing your public methods and if they don t get tested that way then why are they there to begin with

3353614
inherited	properties
classical inherited s main usefulness is if you have a number of related classes that will have identical logic for methods that operate on instance variables properties

3353614
outputstream	inputstream
for example java has the classes inputstream and outputstream

3353626
implements	extends
10 from top would be trickier you d have to implements your own positioning logic in an onload callback everytime the colorbox is shown or extends colorbox s code but no quick way to do that

3353638
hide	show
if you look at my code when i click on hide button it clear the pieflowpanel panel but when i click on show button it does not show my piechart

3353660
google-chrome	firefox
the firefox and google-chrome understand this but eval in internet explorer is failing

3353685
maven	buildr	ant	maven	ant	buildr
buildr is a framework of rake tasks that is explicitly designed as a replacement for ant and maven to build java applications

3353722
g++	gcc
there is only one file and g++-mp-4.5 is the macports executable for gcc g++ 4.5

3353722
folder	directory
warning var folder xa xaqho9peec8k-nrd0l9xwk+++tm -tmp- cc2ivfto.o can t open to read symbols no such file or directory

3353736
put	get
when my function get a img object then i d like to put the img inside another div

3353750
google-chrome	firefox
the following html in an renders in ie7 but not in firefox or google-chrome

3353783
post	get
i think it will need to be post service operation as get would assume some response but since you declare it as void it would have no response

3353784
client-side	server-side
you can do reverse geocoding both on the server-side or on the client-side but with reverse geocoding you pass one coordinate and you are returned the address of that point only

3353838
gridview	rowdatabound
i m trying to modify the output of my gridview in the rowdatabound event handler but it s not working - nothing happens

3353842
stdout	stderr
i want to read the password prompt from stdout or stderr and write the password into stdin but ssh is writing and reading from the console from which i started my mono app

3353846
x86	64bit
one solution is to go to programfiles common files microsoft shared msenv or programfiles x86 common files microsoft shared msenv for 64bit systems and right-click vslauncher.exe and select properties

3353853
centos	linux
using php 5.3.3 stable on linux centos 5.5

3353877
getter	setter
the thread class itself only refers to the m_name member in the name getter and setter

3353948
children	parent
how to you ensure that a given parent has a fixed number of children

3353950
width	height
my usercontrol width and height are set to 100

3353951
post	get
here s a similar post request note that you can send both get and post parameters in a post request

3353951
ssl	https
https is a wrapper around http where with http the client connects to the webserver and starts the conversation https first establishes a secure ssl tunnel and the http communication goes through that

3353958
post	get
without ssl data sent through post is equivalent to data sent through get or in other words not encrypted at all

3353960
maven	pom.xml
further probing google turns out that spring and maven don t get on too well with the following in my pom.xml although no solution is forthcoming

3353975
children	parent
let s say you want one parent to have only two children

3353994
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
i m only guessing here but i d presume it is because you made mywindow the key window now even if it is transparent and shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation is part of uiviewcontroller class not uiwindow

3353994
uiview	uiwindow
instead of making it a uiwindow subclass why not implement those touch events on a uiview that gets added to your view that needs the touch events handled

3353998
width	height
- put a tablelayout as root of your activity with fill_parent as width and height

3354002
maven	pom.xml
first starting from artifact c all the way through a use mvn dependency analyze to verify what dependencies are really being used and not just declared in your pom.xml this maven plugin is very useful as a first step to debug your dependency tree

3354008
post	get
data sent via post is practically as unsecure as sent via get

3354008
post	get
but if someone can sniff the link he can spy very easily user and passwords sent via a http request post or get unless ssl is used

3354048
rss	feed
i m trying to create a rss feed in my kohana app

3354062
dom4j	xom
i suggest that you use some xml dom library like xom or dom4j

3354062
dom4j	xom
you can pass inputstream directly to your sax xom dom4j parser there is no need to build string first

3354100
post	get
i will not post the whole source code to this problem here because it is quite long but i will get people started

3354127
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
i have an qmainwindow displaying a central widget and a qdockwidget containing this custom widget

3354173
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in google-chrome and firefox

3354178
post	get
i would be sending a new get post

3354184
rss	feed
would there be a formula to recognize any link out of rss feed and replace them with a fix value with regex in yahoo pipes

3354247
fuzzy	stemming
unlike other types of lucene queries wildcard prefix and fuzzy queries are not passed through the analyzer which is the component that performs operations such as stemming and lowercasing

3354272
post	get
is there a way to get all the post from a taxonomy in wordpress

3354284
hash	salt
i had an idea about hash passwords and salt values

3354284
hash	salt
would it be more secure to generate a unique salt for each user account then store the salt and hash values in the database

3354284
hash	salt
or keep a single salt value securely stored and re-use that each time i hash a password

3354284
hash	salt
the hash result and salt would then be stored in the database in the users profile when their account was created

3354307
equals	gethashcode
be sure to override equals and gethashcode on your listclientobjectx object

3354349
std	ostream	ostream	istream
you are trying to copy or assign a stream descendant of std istream or std ostream

3354376
getter	setter
note that all attributes and relationships mentioned here use vanilla kvo-compliant getter setter

3354378
plm	glm
i want to look at it since it looks like i will have to use glm instead of plm pooling for this analysis since the dependent variable is a binary variable and plm does not support these d.v. s

3354391
superclass	subclassing
a better way to do this would be to make the fields of the superclass protected instead of private - this will give you access to them in your subclassing

3354391
superclass	subclassing
note that when you defined the subclassing constructor you will need to call a constructor from the superclass as well so in that respect you ll still be able to pass in all the required variables

3354391
superclass	subclassing
and don t forget that all public methods in the superclass can be called as-is by any code that has an instance of your subclassing

3354391
superclass	subclassing
let me know if i ve misunderstood your requirements but it sounds like you want to access fields and behaviour of the superclass - which you ll have automatic access to in your subclassing so long as they re not private

3354402
stdout	fflush
you can add fflush stdout after each printf and see if that helps

3354420
google-chrome	firefox
having a stable and usable firefox driver is my #1 priority so i haven t yet spent much time testing ie google-chrome or htmlunit remote

3354434
post	get
msdn forum post regarding this issue suggested adding the contentpropertyattribute setter to the controls codebehind but i could not get that to work

3354511
google-chrome	safari
this can now be done in google-chrome safari ff4+ and ie10pp4+

3354538
hash	salt
if you believe someone will actually build a precomputed table of your one single salt to a database of passwords then look up the salt password hash they found in your database with said table then you should use a unique salt for each password

3354552
config	ini
you could define the password in php.ini or via the ini setting in the apache config or .htaccess

3354570
client-side	server-side
you should consider the importance of your data and either choose to keep it always server-side requiring internet connection or keep it at client-side making it vulnerable

3354579
width	height
i d like to know some css technique so that i can have the gradient box and the shadows within a div with undefined size i mean dynamic height and width

3354580
google-chrome	firefox
i thought i had this worked out but unfortunately it does not work in firefox or google-chrome

3354609
expander	itemscontrol
i am using an itemscontrol to place n number of expander s

3354609
expander	itemscontrol
i want to make sure my itemscontrol will always occupy the entire available height to do so it can expand some of the expander s

3354660
post	get
change the method attribute from post to get

3354677
hash	salt
re-generating the salt hash combination every time the user logs in is a bit pointless unless you ve got cpu cycles to burn

3354677
hash	salt
i d recommend using something like the rfc2898derivebytes class to generate a secure salt hash combo

3354713
scheme	racket
i m really in no huge rush to immediately learn a language that can land me a job though i d like to do it soon and i m considering using plt scheme now called racket to work through how to design programs or structure and interpretation of computer programs essentially one of the scheme classics because i have always heard that they teach people how to write high-quality usable readable code

3354713
lisp	scheme
is scheme or lisp in general really a language that one learns only to never use

3354717
hash	salt
using a salt hash does not protect against brute force dictionary attacks

3354724
uiview	subviews
for instance if i have a bunch of subviews of uiview that i ve also put into an nsarray to be able to iterate through them doesn t that double the retain count and therefore the memory use of the application

3354734
post	get
if you actually want the form to submit then you should indeed just change the form s method attribute to get instead of post

3354734
post	get
if however you do wish to stay on the form page and need to post the data to some other resource with the data in the url string there are reasons for and aganist doing this that you should look into -- scroll down to 9.3 get then just make an ajax get request otherwise just post the data using ajax

3354739
post	get
i dont know python and autoit but in teh general sense you d just need to get the name value pairs by looking at the html of the form or by examining a request being made to the server is probably better and then make a post request

3354739
post	get
as others have said if you want to just append the values to teh url then the server will need to be happy to accept a get request instead of a post

3354739
post	get
sometimes you will find that servers will do this happily they don t care how form submission is done as long as they get data other times it will be specifically looking for a post and will ignore parameters passed as part of the querystring

3354764
width	height
i guess imageview sets its width and height initially and then when it rotates it uses those dimensions

3354773
getter	setter
i was just wondering do you know any portable tricks or language patterns besides obvious getter setter

3354783
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
one way would be to bind the height and width properties of your control to the parent s actualwidth and actualheight properties

3354784
uiview	subviews
for instance if i have a bunch of subviews of uiview that i ve also put into an nsarray to be able to iterate through them doesn t that double the retain count.

3354788
stdout	stderr
you re also not checking the output either the return value or the stdout stderr streams of the compilation step at all so you have no idea whether the compilation was successful - and if not what useful error messages you got from the compiler

3354797
client-side	server-side
but not only that this is also a clear violation of cwe-602 client-side enforcement of server-side security and cwe-603 use of client-side authentication

3354807
vb6	vba
all methods and properties seem to work correctly in vba vb6 but when i try to access the method with a paramarray it won t event compile

3354838
src	attr
you can pass a function into attr to change the src attribute like this

3354885
mouse	keyboard
hooking the keyboard mouse screen scraping is pretty much the limit of what you can do with an applet

3354891
versioning	upgrade
i have an issue that popped up when i upgrade my versioning of xcode

3354897
for-loop	loops
also the for-loop isn t necessary as the inner while loops will read the entire file

3354914
x86	64bit
on x86 at least most fp operations are done in 80-bit internal registers but only have 64bit in memory

3354941
public	protected
as a side note it doesn t make sense to have an abstract class with a public constructor -- the constructor should be protected because the constructor can only be called by classes deriving from it anyway

3354972
freemarker	velocity
use velocity or freemarker to transform that xml file into a template by replacing your dummy data with variables and macros what would produce the same result

3355027
mouseleave	mouseenter
you shouldn t need to handle the mouseenter and mouseleave events at all

3355068
post	get
then when you post you should get an instance of that view-model out

3355085
range	max
what is the max range of input line ids

3355094
post	get
post is not the same as get -- if you append the data that you want to the url the page will not see your variables

3355123
width	height
the problem comes from the fact that if you don t supply a height and width for any control it will try and determine it s available area based off it s parent container

3355123
width	height
if i define a grid that has 2 star width columns and 2 star height rows

3355125
lisp	scheme
is scheme or lisp in general really a language that one learns only to never use

3355125
haskell	scheme	scheme	prolog
track two is the very high level language track - scheme prolog haskell perl python c# java and others that execute on a vm or interpreter lie in this area

3355126
width	margin
i d look at using css and putting a margin 0 auto on the with a maximum width container

3355131
google-chrome	firefox
it works on ie and google-chrome but not on firefox

3355135
hide	show
so i am using positioning to show hide the dialog

3355178
hide	show
with show grid button one can show the grid and with refresh button from the navigator with the sorting of any column or with the button hide grid one could hide the grid

3355206
hide	show
try to wrap the menu and submenu to a parent div element and just hide show the submenu when needed

3355229
pop-up	dialog
since your application is embedding a small window you can trigger a compact pop-up version of the authorization dialog with the display parameter

3355246
post	get
it seems only zend_http_client post and zend_http_client get are working

3355254
gridview	linqdatasource
i am using gridview control and a linqdatasource and its all working fine and i have added the functionlity of searchingbysubject and i added whereparameters and than binding my gridview see the code below but somehow its not returning any rows and i see i have number of rows based on what i am searching

3355266
vbscript	vba
is there a macro vba code or vbscript that i can write to edit the urls of all the hyperlinks in my word document

3355279
jar	manifest.mf
due to a design issue outside of my control the manifest.mf file populated by the maven archiver plugin inside of maven jar plugin is overwritten

3355306
integer	unsigned
the retain count is just an unsigned integer in the object that gets incremented by 1 when something claims ownership of it

3355317
google-chrome	firefox
i have seen a firebug extension in google-chrome but didn t test it i use firediff with firefox

3355318
vbscript	jscript
i am trying to get this class to register for com interop so that i can use in via unmanaged scripts like vbscript or jscript

3355342
width	height
when i double-tap near the edge of a page that exceeds the height or width of the browser window in safari under ios4 it zooms in or out and or scrolls up down right or left depending on the size of the page and the current viewport position

3355350
rsa	dsa
a normal way to get around the public-key expense is to encrypt a symmetric dsa key using rsa - that way your encryption of the actual data is fast and the only slow part is decrypting the shorter key

3355361
listboxitem	textbox
when user do mouse over a listboxitem change the text in the textbox and update some property for selected item or fire an event

3355446
width	height
if they don t already have a width height ... or their parents

3355449
ogre	irrlicht
if you want to see how a 3d engine is done take a look at ogre irrlicht or any other

3355489
children	parent
i understand about view hierarchies parent children and am using the gravity tags in the xml layout file but it doesnt seem to have any effect

3355639
int	boolean
you should also add a method to your adapter like setenabled int position boolean enabled

3355666
keyevent	keyrelease
void keyrelease keyevent

3355704
versioning	upgrade
i m trying to upgrade an application that s using spring 2.5.6 to the latest 3.0.3.release versioning and i m using the spring repository to find the latest versioning of the jars i need

3355733
cout	cin
i am used to c++ and was taught using iostream syntax cout cin new etc. so i m not used to older c code like printf sprintf malloc alloc etc. either

3355742
google-chrome	safari
when i user clicks an option i would want that option text to appear on the lower bottom of the select box...however safari and google-chrome automatically vertically aligns the text in the middle

3355742
google-chrome	safari
i have tried increasing line-height padding-top margin-top...but these do not work for safari google-chrome

3355742
google-chrome	safari
please help if this type of styling in impossible for safari google-chrome

3355750
put	get
i can t find any compelling reason why i should put in a request for my company to get me an upgrade from visual studio 2008 pro to visual studio 2010 anything

3355765
maven-assembly-plugin	maven-shade-plugin
and the maven-shade-plugin instead of the maven-assembly-plugin

3355824
lisp	scheme
is scheme or lisp in general really

3355828
lisp	scheme
lisp and scheme have supported before most other languages features that were often revolutionary for the time closures and first-order functions continuations hygienic macros and others

3355832
int	double
the table consists of a sorted 2d array 500-3000+ rows columns of simple int x double y tuples

3355849
int	double
ideally however if your only going to allow adding of int float double etc i would really just create overloaded version of the add method to handle those various cases

3355868
hash	salt
rather than directly storing the username and password in the cookie store the username and a hash of the password and a salt in the cookie then when you authenticate the cookie retrieve the password for the given username re-create the hash with the password and the same salt and compare them

3355868
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
creating the hash is as simple as storing the password and salt values together in a string converting the string to a byte array computing the hash of the byte array using md5 or whatever you prefer and converting the resulting hash to a string probably via base64 encoding

there s no x86_64 in that string and are you trying to differentiate between -arch powerpc and -arch i386

3356091
listview	gridview	gridview	detailsview
sounds like a gridview is what your after you want the ability to add edit delete and you might make use of detailsview from your rows in the gridview may or may not be useful to you but for adding new records you ll probably want it in coordination with the gridview the listview would be too simplistic for what your after i think

3356092
versioning	upgrade
supported versioning and edition upgrade paths are listed at versioning and edition upgrade

3356101
gridview	detailsview
i use a detailsview and gridview if i just want to display data that in straight columns and rows

inherited	properties
as you ve noted calling attribute.getattribute even if inherited is true on a properties does not return attributes decorated on the interface properties that your class has implemented

3356156
int	double
the way we handle this complexity in c# is we define addition operators on a smaller subset of types int uint long ulong decimal double float all enums all delegates string and all the nullable versions of those value types

3356299
pop-up	dialog
i have the following code which builds a jqueryui dialog pop-up

google-chrome	firefox
the td with the little content stay shrinked its content stay as is not expanded and this happens in case of ie only firefox and google-chrome are fine both of firefox and google-chrome do expand the smaller td content to fill 100 of that td s height my question is how to expand the content of the smaller td to fill 100 of its height

put	get
you could put all your find get queries in the models corresponding table class

3356383
innodb	myisam
if you re mostly do selects so the inserts updates do not happen too often to lock the table the difference will not be all that much even though in recent benchmarks innodb seems to be outperforming myisam

3356385
width	height
i account for the div s height and width when measuring the distances to the right and bottom edges as well

3356406
width	height
in in elements that are arranged vertically like a list you will almost always want wrap_content on the height and fill_parent on the width

if i need to do something like that i first get the code from my scm and then run a script to make changes like changing the build properties and than start the actual build process usually by kicking off maven or ant

3356705
setinterval	settimeout
does anybody know the memory usage and possible memory leaks with javascript functions settimeout and setinterval

3356712
int	double
you need to read an int or float or double etc or else the wrong formatter will be called

3356721
unsigned	short
iâ ve used unsigned int since thatâ s the most natural although unsigned short would of course also work

3356747
firefox	safari
works beautifully on firefox safari and ie8

3356750
powerpc	i386
for example if you built a python 2.6 on os x 10.6 with the 4-way universal option powerpc ppc64 i386 x86_64 get_platform should report macosx-10.6-universal

3356763

all requests will need to have the oauth_consumerkey oauth_token oauth_version oauth_nonce oauth_timestamp oauth_signature_method and oauth_signature added either to the querystring for http get form fields for http post or to an authorization header

3357028
inherited	properties
if a dependency properties doesn t have a local value it will obtain its value either through value inherited or through coercion depending on how the properties has been implemented

3357028
inherited	properties
but as long as the properties s getting its value through value inherited instead of value coercion - you can accomplish fundamentally the same thing by binding the properties to the properties it s inheriting from on the appropriate ancestor

3357029
client-side	server-side
you can use node.js to run javascript code server-side for the protected stuff and interact with it from client-side javascript

3357046

this is what i use in one of my apps to show hide a little options view

3357115
lisp	scheme	implements	extends
looking for ways to improve the performance of my genetic program i concluded that i need almost all the additional functionality that comes with a functional language and i believe scheme or to a lesser extends lisp are the best solutions for it unless i want to implements features like cond if comparisson operators etc myself extends the existing implementation

3357115
lisp	scheme
my question to the forum is if there is any efficient way to call scheme or lisp from a .net application passing data back and front in some array form

3357160
cpython	ironpython
i should add that what i wrote is true for cpython but not necessarily for jython ironpython

3357318
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in google-chrome but in firefox all the non-american characters are shown as a strange mark

3357322
jar	manifest.mf
i don t really get the point - that s not a manifest.mf anymore - but if you move the contents to say src main resources src home something.txt src home something.txt will end up in the jar

3357340
google-chrome	safari
similarly is actually 0 - i imagine you d get a similar result using google-chrome or safari or a web browser on any other computer

3357360
width	height
the view had an explict width and height which constrained the view when placed in the cell

3357411
draggable	droppable
while you can accomplish what you want with the event.drag drop script it is also easily done using jquery ui - draggable droppable

3357411
draggable	droppable
this creates a big droppable area but it will only accept the draggable id of drag1

3357440
mouse	keyboard
as an aside when you work on a system like this you naturally become very very proficient with the keyboard and all that it means to use keyboard shortcuts in windows because you will likely not have a convenient way or place to put a mouse

3357441
keydown	keyup
so the problem is this works when the user is selecting from the menu with the mouse and when tabbing out of the field keyup keydown to choose then tab out works but keyup keydown to choose itme then enter and nothing happens

3357450
post	get
anyway i ll post a few bits and pieces from my oledb solution that will hopefully get you started

daemons	systemd
i have written a daemons in linux for doing dhcp for an embedded systemd

3357614
int	chars
i would have expected the type of a | b to be an unsigned chars as both operands are unsigned chars but the compilers say that the result is an int and the call to foo is ambiguous

3357616
namedtuple	dictionary
if you re really never defining any class methods a dictionary or a namedtuple make far more sense in my opinion

3357643
put	get
put your perl code in a script which makes it much easier to get the regex right without wondering about escaping quotes and such

3357644
daemons	systemd
you will want to write and debug your daemons in a full featured environment first then install it on the embedded systemd at the end when you are sure it works properly

3357651
width	height
crayon_boxes have width height crayons.

3357667
hide	show
basically what i did was to hide the adview and show it only when the bannerviewdidloadad is called if the view isn t being show already

3357676
folder	directory
this is probably most definetely because i don t know where to put the cake_1_3 folder installation currently my directory tree for localhost in htdocs looks as follows

3357676
post	get	folder	directory
this means that when i navigate to localhost i get nothing and when i navigate to localhost post i get nothing just the directory listing for the folder post which shows i have the directory cake_1_3

3357676
post	get
is there any way i can just navigate to localhost post and i ll get the index function of the postscontroller running

3357684
int	chars	unsigned	short
unsigned chars short int or can be converted to an

3357686

the category s methods are added to that particular class so the myothercategory implementation will belong to your subclassing and it will be looked up before going on to the superclass during message dispatch

3357719
jruby	mri
alternatively you might consider making these java library facilities available to your mri rails app as an internal web service which could be rails or sinatra or similar built on jruby

update as described in providing screens resource compatibility for android 1.5 i m using android sdk r6 and have put my mdpi resources in the drawable directory

3357847
hide	show
you simply can t hide show elements like this cross-browser you need to either have a backup hidden and copy only the elements you want each time or just disable the elements you don t want to be selectable this will however leave them visible

3357851
dictionary	map
the other answers do what you asked but i wanted to add a small measure of flexibility and protection. i would use a dictionary to map the line names to the class objects so you re not letting the text file instantiate anything it wants

3357877
cart	oscommerce
having used oscommerce zen cart and more recently prestashop i would say prestashop is probably one of the easier solutions for building a relatively simple attractive looking site

3357877
cart	oscommerce
unless you are an experienced designer developer then i d stay clear of oscommerce and go for zen cart or presta

3357877
cart	oscommerce
zen cart is in a way a simpler version of oscommerce

3357878

rss	feed
what i m trying to do is take an rss feel url and using linq be able to write a query that will let me sort the subject line of the feed or sort the author line of the feed or even do where clauses that will let me filter by keywords for example

3357884
rss	feed
i know i can read the rss feed parse each element put them into some sort of class object collection and linq off that but i was wondering if microsoft provided a simpler way to do this in the .net framework

3357911
uilabel	uibutton
so i have a custom class that is inherited from uiview in it it contains a uiimageview uilabel and uibutton

3357911
move	drag
from there if i drag i want the view and the selection rectangle to move with it

3357911
uilabel	uibutton
do i offset the object so what when i add in the uiimageview uilabel and uibutton that are part of it i have a 4px buffer around the edges

3357911
uiview	subviews
do i just create a new uiview that is 4px larger than the selected object and and make the selected view a subviews of it

3357923
oncreate	ondestroy
i got rid of the anrs when my service started and stopped by putting the oncreate and ondestroy methods of my service in their own threads which is probably how it should have been from the beginning

3357925
google-chrome	safari
this is true in google-chrome and safari

3357952
versioning	upgrade
yahoo is forcing an upgrade to their current versioning of yahoo web analytics tracking code from versioning 4 to versioning 5

3357983
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
you may have to explicitly thread the processes to make firefox run them in parallel firefox hasn t had a recent release so their support for parallel may be weaker than the more recently updated google-chrome and safari

3357989
outputstream	inputstream
then you can write commands to the outputstream provided by its getoutputstream method - i presume you re already getting the output by reading its inputstream

rss	feed
look for a discoverable rss or atom feed which should be present on a blog or serially-updated news site

3358055
x86	mips
some of the x86-specific stuff won t be relevant - in particular the step which translates x86 to a low-level intermediate representation is probably not necessary for mips mips is essentially just one basic operation per opcode already - but otherwise much of the content looks like it should be very useful

3358065
free	malloc
brk is the system call used on linux to implement malloc and free

3358072
free	malloc
on linux malloc and free are not system calls

3358072
free	malloc
malloc free obtains memory from the kernel by extending and shrinking if it can the data segment using the brk system calls as well as obtaining anonymous memory with mmap - and malloc manages memory within those regions

3358082
gif	png
but with this gate hack you could display an ugly dithered gif shadow for ie 6 instead of the nicer png shadow

3358092
inherited	properties
other method in my mind is inherited from httprequest and add a method like fix which would set properties of class where http request is waiting maybe querydata

3358613
oncreate	ondestroy
i had a location listener in ondestroy an because it was not initialized because of skipping oncreate it returned nullpointer

3358638
r5rs	r6rs
racket is ultimately based on r5rs and not r6rs and not a strict superset of either

3358638
r5rs	r6rs
most implementations offer extensions but are otherwise backwards compatible of course the compiler that comes with racket can also run in r5rs or r6rs mode

3358638
scheme	racket
valid r5 6rs scheme that runs in racket mode may either be rejected cause runtime errors or behave differently than it should

3358638
r5rs	r6rs
what racket calls letrec is called in r6rs and doesn t exist in r5rs what r5rs and r6rs call letrec doesn t exist in racket

3358638
r5rs	r6rs
and as equivalent r5rs does not but r6rs does

ubuntu	linux
edit i didn t specify but this needs to work on windows linux ubuntu at least and mac os x all for both x86 and x64

3358926

i suppose you could change the inheritance of zend_view_helper_placeholder_container or zend_view_helper_placeholder_container_abstract to supply your own implementation of arrayobject ksort

3358940
spaces	delimiter
white spaces is not permitted between the markup declaration open delimiter

3359141
lxml	beautifulsoup
so any html libraries like lxml beautifulsoup and others are all not gonna work

3359155
width	height
i am looking into the limitations of this process and have noticed you can only set bitmapdata pizel width and height to a certain amount and this might be flexible with what you set the jpegencoder quality to 1-100

3359194
int	chars
if the array is of type chars instead of int it will likely call memset

3359215
int	chars
you might be able to do what you want using an external c function 18.3 although glancing at the atomic tags section i m not sure you ll be able to differentiate chars and int

3359266
move	drag
i know that when a drag drop operation is completed upon receiving a mouseup or esc key event it returns an enum that indicates what happened move copy none etc. my question is this is there a way to send back status information to the form control that initiated the drag event while it is going on

3359329

can t delete parent if it has children

3359481

just wanted to throw out there that i have noticed this sort of behavior typically for me the apps are supposed to stay in portrait but they show landscape for about 2 seconds on multiple applications on my sprint htc hero including the default home application and many of the default included apps contacts etc

3359641
stdout	stderr
note that on windows you cannot set close_fds to true and also redirect the standard handles by setting stdin stdout or stderr

3359647
int	boolean
since you have a requirement of storing and reading various properties of different types like boolean int etc

3359685
post	get
i still am stuck and that is why creating a new post to get some guidance

3359709
int	boolean	keyevent	onkeydown
public boolean onkeydown int keycode keyevent event

3359738
setinterval	settimeout
alternatively to an onload event you can load images or do polling via a settimeout or setinterval call

3359786
hide	show
the strangest thing is that after returning from a call to startactivity the state gets restored and everything displays fine until i hide and show the gallery again

3359799
feedparser	beautifulsoup
now that you have beautifulsoup for urls you can use feedparser for the feeds

3359814
setinterval	settimeout
polling should be done using setinterval or settimeout rather than a loop

3359825
post	get
search engines don t make post requests and rarely do get requests based on forms so it is completely irrelevant

3359842
eigen	ublas	eigen	lapack
going from matlab to eigen should be relatively straightforward which i can t say about ublas or lapack

3359863
implements	extends
you need to implements a sessionlifetimemanager that extends lifetimemanager

3359884
gson	jackson
you can of course already exclude serialization of parent link already using most json processing packages jackson gson and flex-json at least support it but the real trick is in how to deserialize it back re-create parent link not just handle serialization side

3359885

put	get
the aim is to get accurate reliable estimates - not to put pressure on people

3360234
rss	feed
i am facing problems while parsing rss feed from different sites

3360247
hash	salt
if you think you need 256 hash for every password use one byte of salt

3360247
hash	salt
if you want 4bn hash for every password use 4 bytes of salt

3360252
int	double
double and float can be divided by int zero without an exception at both compilation and run time

3360253
hash	salt
a salt is just applying some mutation to your raw password before applying a hash or encryption i guess so that a rainbow table attack is more difficult

3360295

there are ways to improve the serializable deserialization network times but it sounds like you are simply storing too much data or inappropriate data in the cache at the moment

3360607
getter	setter
write or synthesize a setter and getter method

3360607
getter	setter
therefore i am just writing the setter and getter

3360607
accessor	properties
that gives you a pointer and a properties the latter of which is equivalent to the accessor methods to the memory indicated by the pointer

3360821
inherited	subclassing
perhaps the class should be decomposed in other classes or subclassing if in your case inherited is more valuable than composition so every class has a well defined responsibility in the system

3360831
ireport	subreports
i m working with ireport 3.5.0 and i m using a subreports inside my main report

3360831
ireport	subreports
i don t want to give the absolute path for the subreports expression but for example if i just give bpsubreport.jasper as the subreports expression because sub and main are in the same directory then ireport can find bpsubreport.jasper and compile the main report into bpreport.jasper but my java gwt application can t

3360850
int	chars
it looks like your chars enum let s call it charenum from now on charenum is being used like a bit field where each enum has an int value with just one bit set

i have the following snippet calling a perl script which writes to stderr and stdout

3360958
stdout	stderr
i ve been following the recomended procedures such as auto flushing the stdout and stderr in the perl script and using streamgobbler threads

3360968
width	height
other question if there is no width or height to the specified what is the best way to solve the issue

3360968
width	height
download all the images and get the corresponding attributes of width and height then add them back to the string

3360968
width	height
the correct tag is the one that closes with and have the valid width height

3360968
width	height
i really need to have width and height in the output because it will be used as the input to other parser

3360983

ubuntu	linux
how can i do to get the same result on linux ubuntu when i run the command adb -e logcat in a terminal to get it colored

3361012

nsstring	nsxmlparser
void parser nsxmlparser parser foundcharacters nsstring string

3361056
margin	height

3361175
put	get
so unless you put the driver jar into the bootclasspath or find a way to modify how jrunscript and ant set the system classloader of the script environment the only way to get this to work seems to be to skip drivermanager entirely

3361194
getter	setter
in general the reason why you get unable to bind to property foo on a class is because you are either missing a getter or setter for foo

3361233
jar	war
ideally they would be able to add a jar war to the webapp directory which contains new domain controller and service classes new views and other content

3361307
ubuntu	linux
- this is done on linux 64bit ubuntu

3361353
integer	unsigned
note that -count returns an unsigned integer so you should use u to format its value

loops	if-statement
i have myself faced even worse problem recently - i took over code where main class was about 6000 lines long with very long methods nested loops and if-statement etc

3361366
width	height
you could use jquery s width and height functions

3361382
put	get
it s good practise to never put these in so that you don t get whitespace at the end of your while and then you can t use header and get this classic headers already sent error

3361389
width	height
border 0 width 300px height 300px or url

so i searched the web to find if c++ is still used in writing nowadays applications and to my surprise firefox google-chrome notepad++ and many other gui applications on sourceforge.net are written in c++ in contradiction with my instructor s advice

3361477
superclass	subclassing
afaik the only close thing is using icriteria s expression.sql where you query the superclass but inject subclassing specific fragments with pure sql

3361477
superclass	subclassing
the other way would be using an isqlquery which at least allows the select part to be domain specific and using .addentity so you can still select your managed superclass and the where part contains subclassing specific fragments

3361482
websphere	ibm
there are also many ibm materials about websphere mq

3361496
accessor	properties
does not make use of your synthesized properties accessor

javassist	cglib
then - you can make a proxy using cglib or javassist around the object and whenever a method is invoked report the invocation

3361503
justmock	typemock
although this doesn t help in terms of design patterns if you want to increase testing now you could always use something like typemock isolator or telerik justmock which allow you to mock out static classes while you convert your code away from the current design

3361517
awt	swing
there are some native to java gui libraries awt swing but they are slow and don t provide interface native to platform it runs on

3361520
post	put
to ensure that it s not looking for a put post request etc

3361525
caliburn	prism
if you are interested in finding out more you should take a look at the mvvm pattern and either or both of the prism caliburn frameworks

3361545
postgresql	mysql
keep it all in ram for normal operation and use an orm to persist to a database periodically probably postgresql or mysql

3361557
accessor	properties
an event is a bit similar to properties in properties you have a backing field and get set accessor

3361580
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
since many of the classes are subclassing i m looking for a solution that also lets me somehow inherited configuration logic from the superclass

3361600

3361661
profiling	debugging
if you only need this for debugging dev purposes and not in the final system you can use eclipse profiling

3361679

that way you simply replace any xml sax parser used with tagsoup and the xpath 2.0 or xslt 2.0 or xquery 1.0 implementation works as usual

3361723

did you declare jstl core taglib as follows

3361734
rtf	odf
is there any java library that allows to export latex document to other formats pdf rtf odf ..

3361812

3361833
folder	directory
hi to retrieve files from ftp server i got another very powerful library which i like to share with all of you.the name of that library is edtftpj.jar which is open source and we can easily upload and download files we can list files and folder from particular directory of remote server.i found it very powerful

oncreate	setcontentview
execute this in your oncreate just before setcontentview

3362113
nhibernate	queryover
sadly i am using the spatial extensions for nhibernate which haven t been upgraded to support queryover or linq yet

vbscript jscript documentation chm format

3362223
post	get
if you want to check for either post or get method you can use the global variable

3362259
hash	salt
this allows the authentication logic to be abstracted away and not handled in code for example if you want to change to using hash salt etc

3362277
int	double
based on comments i should add that you might need to do some extra work to get this to compile since v is an array of double while bit_generator returns int

3362316
hide	show
you should probably append the overlay and container just once when initialized then just show hide append content when the user activates the modal

3362333
width	height
you have to use adobe media encoder to compress the video as flv or mp4 it should make your video below 2 mb based on your dimension of video pls mention your video dimension width and height of the video

i ve tried this in both google-chrome and firefox 4.0 beta

3362334
google-chrome	firefox
if i go into the js console in either firefox or google-chrome and i do the following

3362379
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
of course this works a treat in firefox and safari and opera

3362428
children	parent
we have parent and need children

3362428
children	parent
if we re to do wide operations such as numpy is designed for we d best make them count - and thus the only operation we care about is building a list of children per parent

3362440
pascal	delphi
i think that the best tool is morfik ide very close to delphi ans use pascal object

3362455

without those google-chrome and firefox were not making successful requests.

3362477
put	get
you get a brand new site-package where you can put your plugins with the relevant project modules

3362506
superclass	subclassing
also it would be worth considering an agreement_type attribute or something similar in your superclass table for cases in which you may want to perform agreement type analysis without incurring the hit of a join to the subclassing table s

3362527
google-chrome	firefox
this function works well for firefox but not for ie or google-chrome when the html is broken

3362576
hide	show
this will override your stylesheet css and would show until jquery did a hide which seems to be the symptoms you re experiencing

3362622
post	get
then you want to use httpurlconnection to do get and post requests to your struts application on the server

3362636
int	chars
that said here s my guess - you are doing all the summing in floating-point variables but getting the original numbers as int chars right

3362636
int	double
then you can expect the conversion from int to double to take some time and if so you will see your pauses happening in those instructions a good part of the time

3362641
umask	chmod
the file is created with mode mode as described in chmod 2 and modified by the process umask value see umask 2

3362693
google-chrome	firefox
i ran it on google-chrome ie and firefox

3362693
google-chrome	firefox
at this nothing different happens in firefox and google-chrome but in ie it breaks again into the debugger this time with this line highlighted in yellow and it reports that the identifier jquery is not defined

3362703
width	height
remember the is for loading the image before finding its width and height

3362705
post	get
categories won t be set because the ienumerable is populated only in your get and not your post which is fair enough as you aren t posting the whole list

because i know that current cactus release is based on junit 3.8

3362910
width	height
in android a view is assigned width and height only when its rendering is complete

3362910
width	height
solution to your problem could be that you set some min height of list item so that you have atleast something to work with instead of hard coding height and width

3362915
imperative	declarative
are there any studies on whether functional declarative or imperative programming is easier to learn as a first language

3362980
stdout	stderr
how about replacing the make command with a make function that swaps the stdout and stderr streams

3363010
multiplying	multiplication
this is because once you have the decomposed matrices you can optimize the multiplication algorithm heavily no sense multiplying rows and columns for the zero elements

3363042
soappy	suds
in the end i settled on using suds for python web clients after experimenting with it and soappy and zsi

width	height
to do that give it a fixed height or width or use the proprietary zoom

3363301
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the other thing to remember is that it s almost impossible to achieve pixel parity across ie6 7 8 firefox safari google-chrome opera so if some things don t look quite right in a browser that s nearly ten years old you don t always need to worry about it

3363403
post	get
if i do just json i get 500 internal server error if i do a post i get 403 forbidden error

3363452
profiling	instrumentation
if so then you may have a leak in which case the best approach would be to profiling your app using instrumentation to see if your code is leaking

3363468
packets	multicast
iirc pan just forms a point-to-point link to the pan peer and thus if the peer is an access-point rather than just another end-node it it it that will handle multicast the packets

symfony	lithium	cakephp	yii	cakephp	lithium	lithium	yii
in your case i can advice you to use frameworks like symfony cakephp lithium zend framework yii or whatever

3363630
children	parent
this is because the z-order only applies when the parent panel repaints all its children

3363658
stdout	stderr
one idea i had was that the job was blocking on stdout or stderr so i redirected both to null

3363659
post	get
when i post the same with ie7 8 i get the values as an array array 0 11_31_2 but in firefox i get it as 11_31_2

for example if you have a 32-bit double d whose bit pattern happens to be 01101010 00111100 01101010 01000001 and you write then i will be an int whose bit pattern 01101010 00111100 01101010 01000001 even though that will represent a wildly different numeric value as an int than it did as a double

unless there s something like a versioning number in the file that s been changed when you upgrade your delphi versioning i suppose the only thing you can do is scan for 00 bytes in the character data and then have it read in either a ansichar or a widechar versioning of the record based on whether it finds it

3365583
put	get
this way if you put multiple widgets on a page you won t get conflicts unless you need to access the methods from elsewhere in the page but in that case you should be registering the widget with some widget framework anyway

3366841
int	chars
all you re really doing is summing the value of each chars in charbuffer into newstr because a chars is really just an 8-bit int and then you return that int as a pointer through an implicit cast so it is now being treated as a memory address

3366987
inline	inlining
i m not intimately familiar with vc++ but it may have a compiler-specific method of forcing or prohibiting the inlining of a function however the standard c++ inline keyword will not be it

3366987
inline	inlining
you should not worry about explicitly forcing or prohibiting inlining of a function unless you have a very specific need to do so as a result of profiling your program s execution and finding that a bottleneck could be solved by forcing an inline that the compiler has for some reason not done

3367003
ant	maven
i understood that you are migrating from ant to maven but you are imo not on the right path bending maven to make it fit in your existing project structure workflow is just not the recommended approach

3367018
getter	setter
in general inline getter setter functions and other one liners

3367034

measuring the pixels on-screen indicates that of the two google-chrome appears to be reporting the correct value while firefox is off by 2 or 3 pixels each time

3367405
margin	height
i have stripped all css styling that may have potentially been interfering with the height value all padding borders margin etc yet i still get inconsistent results

i have tried in beans class creating getter and setter that return get string by parsing the value to dojo friendly format yyyy-mm-dd

3367660
getter	setter
if it is possible to have getter and setter for java date object to get return date and not string as i am doing now it would be perfect

3367677

uiview	subviews
i have a uiview which has several buttons added to it as subviews

3367785
mouseleave	mouseenter
now it will be mouseenter mouseleave which just seems silly since they re non-bubbling events

3367795
int	chars
as i see it a unicode string can be conceived of as an array of int number each representing a single codepoint and the code above is basically operating on arrays of chars s already so my guess is that i should 1 extend it to handle c arrays of int

post	get
i have a cakephp application where i am trying to get a count of how many of each type of post a user has

3367833
post	put
3 maintain new columns in the user s table to track these numbers when the post are created put that would involve writing to the user account whenever a new post is made

3367845
nhibernate	llblgenpro
by the way the llblgenpro designer not only supports entity framework v4 and v1 but nhibernate linq to sql and their own llblgenpro runtime

3367858
width	height
x and y are height and width in inches

3367865
ant	maven

i solved this by using an itemscontrol and within the itemtemplate i placed the textblock and combobox controls

3367917
int	chars
chars varying - int

3367943
width	margin
you may still need to mess around with giving the div a right margin the width of the image

3367962
padding	overlapping
it will put the image to the far right of your and the right padding on the will keep the image from overlapping the text

3367978
profiling	debugging
interesting question but i doubt that this is possible - at least not without some major hacking using debugging or profiling apis

3367989
rss	feed
i know that google chrome shows some kind of raw data for rss feed though its not exactly pure xml

3367995
mouseover	mouseout
unless there s some specific reason why you want to append and remove on each mouseover mouseout event i guess i d do like derrick suggested except that i d have jquery handle the events for you

3368029
accessor	properties
in order to satisfy your invariant you will need to add a precondition to the properties s set accessor

3368033
int	chars
use ord to convert chars to their int code point

3368035
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval both execute timed js statements in relation to when they were loaded not at a specific time each day so they don t seem like a clean solution

3368077
background-color	transparency
background-color transparency did make paragraph transparency but made the image border black

3368080
inherited	properties
if it s a matter of easing the tests you could use a mocking framework like moq to avoid having to implement those properties on each class that inherited from the interface

3368082
outputstream	inputstream
if you use an inputstream to read use an outputstream to write a bufferedoutputstream-wrapped fileoutputstream

3368085
vim	notepad++
to start using vi or vim as opposed to my current tool of choice notepad++

3368097
ant	cruisecontrol
whether you use cruisecontrol or not you re going to have to write the scripts be they ant or shell scripts that are then called by cruisecontrol

3368100
memcpy	malloc
if you malloc a chunk of memory memcpy the memory from baseaddress to your own memory and use that to create the image the warning vanishes

3368114
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
support for html5 forms is quite lacking at the moment mostly it s just google-chrome safari webkit and opera that supports most of them but it doesn t hurt adding them they re backwards compatible

3368168
division	modulo
edit 2 stored range to intermediate variable thanks adrian used stdin instead of cli params thanks for the clarification jon eliminated array in favor of direct output fixed bug where an ending angle of 360 wouldn t display a line removed some un-needed parentheses used division for rounding instead of .round used modulo instead of conditional add

3368256
jobs	cron
cron jobs can be set to run every 10 minutes the url i gave shows how to do that with python and you can queue more tasks if the amount of work you need to perform on a certain occasion exceeds the 30-seconds limit that gae supports

3368256
jobs	cron
if you decide that gae has limitations you can t stand or would cost you too much for billed use of resources over the free quotas any hosting provider supporting a unix-like cron jobs scheduler should be acceptable

3368259
jobs	cron
you are lucky since google appengine provides cron jobs both for python and java

3368274
versioning	upgrade
just be aware that your code is likely to be break w versioning upgrade

3368294
shadowing	named
you are shadowing the check1 and check2 arrays because the do block variables have the same named as them

3368308
width	height
this can be done if you can detect the height width of the content in iframe then you can use colorbox.resize function to resize the colorbox again

3368322
jruby	mri
first i should mention that ruby on rails is simply ruby code and the same code can run in the jruby environment on the jvm or the mri written in c runtime

3368362
sudo	passwd
it uses air s own applicationupdater framework the one that doesn t require a ui - all goes well until the package gets downloaded and needs to be installed - at that point the air installer prompts for sudo passwd and won t proceed without some user interaction

3368377
put	get
but didn t get any clue on how i could put it in a block in my template

3368401
client-side	server-side
from this the lunascript compiler produces a functioning web 2.0 application -- the client-side javascript the server-side sql and everything in between -- complete with real-time bidirectional data synchronization

3368416
post	get
one possible solution would be to loop through all the models as explained in this post is there a way to get a collection of all the models in your rails app

3368430
width	height
i have successfully resize iframe s height and width when it is loaded

3368483

3368578
keydown	keyup
this means focus keydown keypress keyup and blur

3368623
exponent	modulo
worked out on irc documenting it here for the rest of the world it s completely undocumented but crypt rsa key does have methods called n e and d that correspond to the modulo the public exponent and the private exponent

3368640
expression-blend	silverlight
also can someone recommend a good book that covers how to create wpf and or silverlight applications using expression-blend 4 and visual studio 2010 together

3368690
folder	directory
the -i should point to the directory containing the openssl folder

3368701
move	drag
so that user can move any record to any position by entering the position number in the text field regardless of drag and drop

3368728
int	chars
instead of chars constants enums or int should be probably used.

3368760
ssl	https
recently i added ssl to my server and now i need to check for this and assign either http or https as the protocol

3368823
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this only happens on firefox i got no probs on safari google-chrome ie

3368855
width	height	width	font-size
width and height for the same string of characters of same font-size

3368859
prepare	pdostatement
however you should be using prepare statements mysqli_stmt or pdostatement

3368874
versioning	upgrade
according to the documentation if the package name and signing certificate do not match those of the existing versioning market will consider it a new application and will not offer it to users as an update. this would allow me to publish a new versioning of the application without the user being able to accidentally upgrade and break the application

3368882
udp	tcp
based on you re post i assume you re using tcp ip since you re referring to streaming but a socket can be used for udp connectionless protocol as well and others

3369023

actionscript	mxml
we want to read this data from the jsp in a mxml through actionscript

3369328
disk	ram
it looks like the biggest increase in speed will come from running the test database in a ram disk based on this post here on performance tuning tips for drupal 7 testing on qa.drupal.org

3369328
disk	ram
also there some instructions here for creating a ram disk on os x although this is for moving your entire stock of mysql databases into a ram disk instead of just a single database

3369328
disk	ram
i ve been able to cut 30-50 from the test times by switching to a ram disk

3369328
disk	ram
create a ram disk

3369328
disk	ram
then i took the following steps i made sure the previous mysqld was no longer running and then started the mysql daemon making sure we tell it to use ram disk as our data directory rather than the default location

3369328
disk	ram
next was to get this data into the local testing setup on the ram disk

3369328
disk	ram
creating the symlink - this because the mysql command by default looks for tmp mysql.sock and symlinking that to our short term ram disk was simpler than constantly changing php.ini files

3369361
sorting	filtering
so far all sorting and filtering information is lost when navigating back to list.aspx

3369396

this is a bit hacky though and you should aim to use get for the idempotent requests and post for mutation requests

3369582
nsstring	nsdata
get json as a nsstring from nsdata response

3369593
google-chrome	firefox
how to detect escape key press in ie firefox and google-chrome

3369598

the hash and salt you ll need to set on your own you can refer to the ecma specs and implementation notes for those details but this is a really good tutorial to just jump right in

3369606
keydown	keyup
check for keycode which keyup || keydown

3369624
keydown	keyup
it seems keydown and keyup work even though keypress may not

3369654
notepad	scite
at the moment i just use scite which for those who haven t come across it is basically notepad that colours your code in

3369688
vb6	vba
it s been a while since i ve had to work with vba vb6 but i believe including the parens causes itm to be passed by value instead of by reference

3369693
hide	show
i show ul it show my submenu like floowing code i have problem with hiding ul while i move mouse over ul into menu it hide and i cound not use of mouseout event correctly

3369695
width	margin
specifically when in quirks mode ie includes padding within the area defined by width while the w3c box model does not - both padding and margin are added onto the width

3369702
oncreate	onnewintent
problem is after authenticating it is calling again oncreate of twittershare class instead calling onnewintent method why is that

3369743
google-chrome	safari
keycode is now in the process of being deprecated and most modern browsers offer the key property now although you ll still need a fallback for decent browser support for now at time of writing the current releases of google-chrome and safari don t support it

3369807
actualheight	actualwidth
you can use binding to actualwidth and actualheight of your biggest textblock

3369851
loops	while-loop
also your while-loop is wrong - you should not normally use the eof function as a loops control - use

3369855
nsstream	nsoutputstream
cocoa provides three classes to represent streams and facilitate their use in your programs nsstream nsinputstream and nsoutputstream

3369861

width	height
these panels do not have a width or height set which i might not be able to fix

3369911
width	height	children	parent
i tried this in code behind but the scaling did not work correctly since i was not able to understand how if width and height propagation from children to parent really works

3369916
gridview	sqldatasource
at the moment the options that come to my mind are composing a dataset by hand in the codebehind and binding the gridview to that instead of the sqldatasource or creating a stored procedure to return the table already dereferenced

3369935
ant	maven
when you run ant with maven you can t call individual targets anyway you are binding an ant run to a maven phase

3369935
ant	maven
a lot of what you are doing in your ant task is default maven behavior

3369944
button	checkbox
you can multiselect users via checkbox and press the remove button to delete them from the system

3369944
button	checkbox
should we remove the user selections made in the checkbox when the user hits the cancel button or leave the selections as it is

3369990
width	height
you should bind grid s width and height to one value

3369998
width	height
at present i am hard coding the width and height of the controls to fill as they don t stretch

3370038
gridview	sqldatasource
at the moment the options that come to my mind are composing a dataset by hand in the codebehind and binding the gridview to that instead of the sqldatasource or creating a stored procedure to return the table already dereferenced

3370073
int	double
double int float are primitive types they are not objects

3370073
int	double
but double and int are classes from which you can make objects and then you call call their methods such as as integer.tostring

3370131
put	get
of course you d want to put some error handling in there but you get the idea

3370157
accessor	properties
as both call setseparatorcolor i would guess they are both calling the accessor for the properties

3370240
serializable	deserialization
what you mean is serializable and not deserialization

3370240
public	protected
by the way you can serialize fields and properties regardless of accessibility private protected internal protected internal or public

globalization	localization
i have no prior experience in implementing globalization localization in either web forms or asp.net mvc

3370264
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
this will display correctly in ie google-chrome opera and safari

free	malloc
i would suggest to wrap the argumentcount maxargumentcount and arguments in a separate class which can handle the malloc new and free delete as well

3370288
tiff	png	appkit	nsimage
in the case with appkit nsimage i really find it hard to manipulate per pixel data of the images and saving to different file formats such as png not just tiff

3370356
ostringstream	std
another option would be to use std string or even std ostringstream

3370397
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
loops through element of an arrays in more effective with a standard for-loop instead of for in loops

3370448
qstring	qurl
actually qstring is a good idea because qurl accepts it in the constructor

3370454
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

if you need to keep this data structure links to parent child i suggest you get assemble the structure from outside of couchdb get the parent document get its children get their children etc

3370550
webkit	gecko
if you need to do some automatic stuff w out user interference you can just use underlying engine of the browser like gecko or webkit w out loading browser itself

3370550
google-chrome	firefox
for firefox you would need to inject some browser-side code into google-chrome either as extension or plugin

3370551
put	get
i m struggling to get mocks working for a change and was wondering where people generally put their mock classes

3370584
appkit	nsimage
unlike appkit s nsimage which is designed generally in order to handle any kind of image the cgimage classes are specifically designed for raster images

3370603
hide	show
the .siblings .fadeout is just a guess that hide the previous answer so only one at a time show if you want to show any number at once just remove that portion

3370700
pull	push
the other peer informs you whenever it wants about the pieces it has so it s push instead of pull

3370701
next	except
similarly easy but often better for things like characters is to project all forward facing polygons to just their x and y coordinates and similarly for the back facing polygons except that you offset them so the two sets are next to each other

3370769
mouse	keyboard
are there any specific user interface guidelines for targeting the kids keyboard usage in a laptop or a standalone keyboard ability to control a mouse ability to navigate the user interface and its controls size of buttons page navigation

3370801
width	margin
alternatively if you want to use it as a block element you should set the following properties on the label display block width xxpx where xx than 350px and margin 0px auto which means have equal distance from the sides thus centered

3370823
int	chars
all basic types - chars short int long - are already positioned in memory or inside of struct on their natural alignment the address of a variable or struct s field is divisible by the size of the variable

3370823
int	chars
after the a sizeof chars -sizeof int bytes would be added to make sure that the b s address is aligned on sizeof b .

3370826
profiling	debugging
i have defined the profiling to the same as on my phone for debugging -ing

3370834
google-chrome	firefox

getter	setter
this solution is not perfect as in beans class i am still using getter and setter to use string for my date object and parse the value inside these methods

3371154
actionscript	mxml
if it is an actionscript class or mxml component make sure you are using that class somehow in your code

3371155
post	get
if you don t want optimize you site for caching of http get data for jqgrids you can either use http post or don t use parameter

3371169
typedef	struct
one drawback of the first declaration is that when you use any ide the automatic jump to declaration often directs you to the typedef struct _something someting

3371193
typedef	struct
some people like to put all their typedef in one header file so they can typedef the struct a pointer to the struct etc

3371212
tablelayout	margins
basically you just have to add a margins of 5 or 10px on the right in your tablelayout

3371235
typedef	typename
from typename synonym creation which is what typedef does and retains

3371258
post	get
you can make the ajax file require a get or post variable

3371306
typedef	struct
there s one clear advantage of separating the typedef and the struct declaration and that advantage is clear if you separate both in different files

3371351
typedef	struct
if you separate the two things typedef from the struct declaration you will be able if needed to have opaque pointers

3371426
post	get
hope that helps to get you started - any questions please post a comment

3371467
config	ini
appsettings config file ini file nini embeddable database sqlite berkelydb etc.. whatever method you like it depends on your application size performance consideration and design

3371502
mouseout	mouseleave
the main difference is that mouseleave doesn t fire when entering a child where as mouseout does

3371505
equals	tostring
however selecteditem returns object for me so i only have options like tostring equals etc

3371544
inherited	properties
a good reference to all the extra properties that arrays inherited is the mozilla developer center article on array

3371593
folder	directory
i need to create a folder in the root directory of sharepoint 2007

3371596
put	get
but instead of trying to get around it i would put my effort into either shortening the request lengths to reduce lock contention or making cookieless requests for those requests that don t need the session at all.

3371638
rsa	dsa
rsa key generation is quite fast on a basic pc you can easily generate a dozen rsa keys per second and with discrete-log dsa diffie-hellman el-gamal or elliptic-curve based cryptosystems it is even considerably faster ten thousands new ec key pairs per second with a pc

3371640
hide	show
the widget s hide show methods should work

3371671
uiview	subviews
after creating the uiview with or without a uiviewcontroller you can add the subviews to the original view by typing

3371672
public	protected
obviously this is protected rather than public but its still a method accessible from outside of the class that has nothing to do with the class itself

3371692
portrait	landscape
and it works fine but if i change it to portrait instead of landscape then it crashes with the following error.

3371706
children	parent
also note that the simple tree example no more than two children per parent might not be very realistic and when many children exist for a single parent the display will become difficult to construct and not pleasing to the eye

3371723
integer	unsigned
array indices are strings all object properties are that is the canonical decimal representation of an unsigned integer in the range 0..2 32-2 0 to 4294967294

3371723
integer	unsigned
the limit is one below the maximal value of a 32-bit unsigned value because the length field value is then always an unsigned 32-bit integer value

3371764
min	max
you can either use the new html5 attributes for time input step min max or use an options object

3371764
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
have manually tested in ie 6 8 firefox google-chrome and opera latest stable on linux for the latter ones

3371784
ubuntu	linux
i m an ubuntu linux user and i use win xp only for my work purposes

3371859
put	get
you need to submit the form as a get request in order to put the params in the actual url but as i say any form submit will achieve this by default as that s the way get form submits work

3371935
children	parent
the above expression selects every input element with which is the 7th child of its parent -- and aparently the parent of input elements in the document that is not shown don t have so many input children

3371957
vmware	virtualbox
i regularly develop and test using development environments running under vmware workstation and virtualbox

3372000

i would like to write a query where i find children nodes of type b that do not have a parent of type c

3372003
keydown	keyup
the default behaviour is that no keypress keyup or keydown events are fired when a password input has focus

3372033
maven	pom.xml
specify the correct version of your jre in the maven compiler plugin by default your pom.xml file will inherit the compiler-plugin from the maven super pom.xml which targets the 1.3 jre

3372034
for-loop	loops
i would leave for-loop - you can omit some part of this loops and simulate other loops

3372048
disk	ram
i know that you are using php but some web application frameworks for other languages such as happstack for haskell use an internal ram based data storage serialized on the disk

3372096

i ve pieced together bits and i ve got it working in google-chrome and firefox but not ie

3372105
doc	rtf

3372107
int	chars
type of chars literal changed from int to chars compare sizeof a in c and c++

3372117
gesturedetector	motionevent
instead you should consider passing the motionevent to the gesturedetector first and processing the event yourself only if the gesturedetector does not with something like this

3372120
getter	setter
the best you can do is to use a lambda expression to form a for a getter or an for a setter

3372130
ant	maven
i have started playing with maven2 and i m attempting to port one of my projects from ant to maven

3372130
ant	maven
is there a way i can do it purely in maven had a look at maven exec plugin but is a bit confusing or do i have to call ant from maven to achieve this

3372216
jobs	cron
in general you would use any kind of scheduling cron scheduled jobs in the ms sql world etc. when the task you want is one or both of

3372298
int	double
therefore result type of is int is double is etc

3372319
accessor	properties
my question is is it possible to copy body of get accessor that has references to other properties in same class and if possible how to do it

3372348
textarea	textbox
it s as easy as adding a few textbox and a textarea a button to send the request to the server using a requestbuilder with the correct post parameters and display a message on success failure

3372373
put	get
one way to get other sid s with the same cid is to put the above query into a subquery

3372435
rspec	machinist
as well as rspec shoula machinist faker and the rest make ruby a real consideration if this is where you interest lies

3372546
versioning	upgrade
now when we upgrade a client s software we now have to and run all scripts that were written since the the versioning the client has running

3372574
google-chrome	firefox
this method works great in firefox but not at all in ie or google-chrome not sure about other browsers

3372599
gcov	lcov
since you re using lcov you should be able to convert the gcov .gcda files into lcov files and merge them with lcov --add-tracefile

3372646
int	chars
here s another one which is perhaps a little more high-minded in not doing the hacky chars int cast

3372659
width	height
i need to find the width and height of all rectangles in the field

3372719
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
then objectoutputstream can be used to write them to harddisk and objectinputstream to read them from harddisk

3372725
udp	tcp
you have two problems you don t understand how accept works in tcp and you need to read the incoming data in udp

3372738
strstr	substr
if you actually need the substr back rather than a position strstr is a good way to go

3372825
range	min	range	max	min	max
is there a compact built-in way to generate a range of floats from min to max with a given step

3372860
passenger	thin
the stack which caused this problem is ruby 1.8.7 merb 1.0.12 apache load balancing to a thin cluster on production passenger on the demo server and working with unproxied thin on development

3372959
width	height
largest hypotenuse others width or height

3372982
maven	pom.xml
to mavenize simply means to write a pom.xml and possibly move code around so that it builds in maven

3372982
ant	maven
chances are the vast majority of your ant or similar file is boilerplate which was the idea behind maven in the first place

3372987
squash	merge	squash	branch
how is it possible that when trying to squash fixup a linear branch i still have to do manual merge

3373005
getter	setter
rest of this class is getter and setter

3373028
put	get
and using a c to get x and put it in dictionary t

3373060
gentoo	linux
when i was running gentoo linux i once found a bug in some open source unicode handling code that checked an uninitialized variable against -1 in a while loop

3373094
hid	keyboard
i ve compiled the kernel to support usb hid and keyboard devices

3373116
equals	gethashcode
note that you will need to correctly implement equals and gethashcode in the state class

3373116
equals	gethashcode
if you just want the ids you don t need to implement equals gethashcode

3373125
equals	gethashcode
when implementing the iequalitycomparer know that distinct does validate both the results from equals are equivalent and the results from gethashcode are equivalent

3373135
hudson	phpundercontrol
i ve used both phpundercontrol and hudson to automate php builds .

3373144
put	get
if so you can put them in there and get hudson to pull them from there.

3373170
iprincipal	iidentity
asp.net mvc - set custom iidentity or iprincipal

3373191
range	median
possibly at stages through the computation you could discard the top n and bottom n values as long as you are sure that the median is not in that top or bottom range

3373196
folder	directory
i believe you would have to make the beta folder into a virtual directory so that it gets its own application

3373240
draggable	droppable
this generates a pretty little square which uses jquery draggable droppable function

3373249
stdout	stderr
i would recommend proc_open which allows you to set up pipes for stdin stdout and stderr

3373256
min	max
the x and y axes are perfect but the colormap spreads between the min and max of v

3373256
range	min	range	max	min	max
to set the range of the axes but this only takes arguments for the min and max of x and y not the colormap

3373308
getter	setter
2 the datatype of the db column bigint and the datatype of alertid long and the datatype of the getter setter systemobjectrecordid variable long match

3373318
wtforms	werkzeug
there s also wtforms which is a fairly minimal forms library that integrates well with werkzeug in my experience

3373334
for-loop	loops
i generally prefer a for-loop over a while loops when you re trying to do something a particular number of times

3373352
portrait	landscape
now after launching when the anotherviewcontroller view is displayed its initial dimensions are always same of the last orientation portrait landscape view in interface builder i saved that view xib with irrespective of the current device orientation

3373369
put	get	portrait	landscape
to get a layout with a landscape portrait easily create a layout-land folder in your projectname res the sam hierarchy level with layout folder and put your xml with landscape design into the layout-land folder

3373371
collabnet	svn
this is svn 1.6.11 running the collabnet solaris binaries

3373435
implements	extends
if someone tries to extends the class by overriding dispose boolean and you haven t implements it that will fail

3373437
disk	ram
ram disk based systems can load the initial values directly to the final ram addresses

3373463
put	get
when you put an app in app world it normally takes between 1 and 2 weeks to get an answer but it can vary quite a lot and go up to one month or so depending on how effecient rim testing teams

3373489
getter	setter
should i use getter and setter in c++ or is it better to access class data directly

3373512
getter	setter
in general getter setter are better

3373544
inherited	properties
i want to utilise entity framework to create a content entity that pulls in the common properties so i can inherited the content entity in the article and blog entity

3373557
getter	setter
if there s no logic in getter setter except for returning assigning a value from to a public field there s no significant difference between usage of getter setter and accessing the field directly

3373559
getter	setter
the xmlaccesstype annotation takes care of telling jaxb to look at the setter and getter and not the field itself

3373562
getter	setter
the usual rationale for getter and setter is you can change it from being a simple wrapper around a private field to a rather complex computation without breaking any code using the class

3373562
getter	setter
if you re sure the getter setter will never be more than that or it will never be used that much feel free to use a pulic field i don t mind

3373590

3373636
post	put
i learn about http and need some examples of http put method structure something like this one for http post method

3373654
superclass	subclassing
however because an instance of a subclassing contains its own superclass they are still there

3373657
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome firefox safari restart the browser and still reliably get this error on the same requests so i don t think its cookie related

3373657
post	get	post	put	put	get
in any case i can issue get post put requests no problem with the same cookie

3373679
put	get
it must have an address and if i put these objects into an array i must be able to increment a pointer in order to get the next object so every object must have a unique address and take up at least 1 byte

3373690
client-side	server-side
cookies are a client-side storage while sessions are server-side

3373690
google-chrome	firefox
in a classical session system where you assign a random id on session start a registered user can have many simultaneous session instances in different computers or even in a single computer one in firefox and three more in google-chrome incognito mode windows

3373749
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the thing to watch out for is browser adoption of html5 websocket - currently in google-chrome and safari and coming soon in firefox and opera

3373755
post	get
i was hoping to get some ideas as how i can get a number of post that have been posted on our blog but within a certain date range

3373756
width	height
do some primitive math to approximate rect s width and height

3373756
min	max
to do this we compare values average vertical segment length and max y - min y

3373756
min	max
min x max y

3373756
min	max
max x min y

3373785
put	get
the javascript can get values from a property so put the value into the session state before postback

3373798
uiviewcontroller	catransition
having some basic issues with managing the total memory from adding and removeing a uiviewcontroller - but only when i add an animation to it using catransition

3373804
folder	directory
if on the other hand you want to make the project inside your eclipse workspace directory then there is a problem which is that if you just copy the sample code inside your workspace folder and do new- android project and create project from existing source for me at least it fails with the error invalid project description c users usernamme blah blah projectname overlaps the location of another project projectname

3373804
folder	directory
in this layout the android projects java projects and other projects directory are conceptually my workspaces but in reality in each case it is the nested workspace folder which is the actual eclipse workspace

3373804
folder	directory
this enables me to keep my projects contained within their respective pseudo-workspaces while not being inside their actual eclipse workspace folder which neatly gets around the problem of not being able to easily create android projects if the project directory is inside the eclipse workspace directory

3373816
fseek	fread
i am about to implement a custom vfs virtual file system for a netburner embedded device non windows using fopen fread fwrite fseek and fclose

3373830
put	get
you might want to consider the code safe while it is in memory but put in other protection to detect when and if it does get stolen

3373834
pop-up	dialog
when i try to run the installed application as a different user than the user that ran the installer the installer tries to run again it s already installed at this point and pop-up some error dialog and the application won t run

3373839
google-chrome	safari
the problem also affects other browsers but less so in the fast ones safari and google-chrome

3373839
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox still has a multi-second lag and google-chrome and safari have a very short lag not quite as short as ie but still very short

3373865
opera	firefox
i was wondering how can i add images to links with css that is compatible across firefox ie and opera browsers

3373896
put	get
i put a try catch around the get set and now everything works well

3373908
rss	feed
in an application like this there are often many loops looping through different rss feed different rss items rss tags and so on

3373909
post	get
curl has the ability to send post and get data to the server via many different option settings

3373910
implements	extends
being classes that implcitly extends enum they can even implements interfaces

3373912
switching	screens
i want to call my datamanager after initialising the loading screens and then call a method to switching scenes

3373948
folder	directory
on my first glance through a handy macbook s library directory i saw preferences and application support folder

3373965
free	malloc
memory leak made simple whenever you allocate memory with malloc new and don t deallocate it later with free delete after finishing using that memory.

3373985
min	max
standard sql requires that columns in the select clause that are not wrapped in aggregate functions count min max etc need to be defined in the group by

3374047
for-loop	arrays
i have a list of strings that i add to an arrays then attempt to set those values in a for-loop using data that i read in

3374071
distance	mercator
my limited understanding of mercator is that it preserves horizontal distance but not vertical

3374101
put	get
media needs to update the entire state value so rather than get ting and put ting just use the modify function

3374102
folder	directory
indicates current directory so referencing . folder test.js is the same as just folder test.js

3374132
getter	setter
i thought of having just a nsmutabledictionary per model object to store all of the ivar s but that abstracts the setter and getter and may introduce a big memory footprint for so many dictionaries

3374132
ivar	subclassing
as i understand it dynamically adding ivar s at runtime to an object model is considered a bad thing because of the pointer referencing for any subclassing that may be dependent upon the model the subclassing pointer doesn t get offset unless a complete recompile is done

3374172
rtp	sip
using sip rtp cos mark 5

3374172
rtp	sip
using sip rtp cos mark 5

3374172

3374172
ubuntu	centos
i m working on ubuntu and most tutorials are on centos so there s not much to solve my problem

3374320
filtering	grouping
so as the user i filtering the list of these 10 000 items based on whatever hit select all and then click grouping

3374374
codeigniter	cakephp
you might consider starting by using one of the many different mvc frameworks out there such as codeigniter or cakephp

3374388
min	max
you can use default jrockit jre for this or and change the heap size for min and max as 1024m

3374388
min	max
max heap as 1024m and min heap size as 1024 m

3374395
put	get
you ll probably have to double your backslashes in the path names however since iirc python uses backslash as an escape character so to get one backslash in the final string you need to put in two

3374408
outputstream	inputstream
you should end up with an inputstream with the file contents which you in turn can write to any outputstream to your taste

3374427
inherited	subclassing	metaclass	subclassing
metaclass are inherited so subclassing gets base â s metaclass

3374427
super	self
when super ... .__init__ is replaced with base.__init__ self the closure disappears #5

3374486
hide	show
if you want a simple client-side solution your question is tagged jquery so i suspect this is on the radar you could put your sub-menus in tags and then use the jquery hover function to show and hide the sub-menu when the appropriate parent item is hovered

3374501
union	distinct
especially if you use union all there should not be a performance hit as union would have to go through the result to only keep unique records actually doing something like distinct or group by

3374504
min	max
even though min max heap defined jvm would occupy max heap from system memory while starting

3374515
width	height
edit but if you want the div height to remain the same don t have the width 33 for the centertext div and keep the progresssize css the way i have mentioned

3374527
hex	binary
as a first step i d try dumping out your incoming binary string byte-wise preferrably in hex to some medium where you can read it and compare the bytes you see with the bytes you re expecting from the input data

3374560
haskell	scheme
it acts like scheme s letrec if you happen to know that meaning that it s a cross between let and letfn you can bind a set of names to mutually recursive values without the need for those values to be functions lazy sequences are ok too as long as it is possible to evaluate the head of each item without referring to the others that s haskell -- or perhaps type-theoretic -- parlance

3374653
hide	show
adds the show and hide text appropriately and lets you specify the tabular inline names in a list beforehand

3374665
punctuation	words
i want it to specifically not match html entities #anchors in urls hashtags that start in the middle of a words and any trailing punctuation after a hashtag

3374766
hash	md5	hash	salt	des	sha	salt	md5
it s quite common to salt a password then hash it using des md5 sha or newer hash

3374766
crypt	hash
php s crypt works this way although the exact algorithm it uses to hash the password may be different between versions of php.

3374766
crypt	salt
php now includes its own hashing library instead of relying on the os library which is really really important if you re using windows as crypt function on windows only supported des with 2-byte salt prior to this

3374766
hash	salt
passing the encrypted password as the second argument will usually get php to detect the salt and algorithm used to originally hash the password namely because everything other than des start with where # is a number

3374804
charindex	substr
see substr charindex patindex

3374813
width	height
pdf myscatterplot.pdf height 6 width 6

3374824
put	get
depending on what you want to do i would get rid of the or put it to the end of each variable name which should result in a number of arrays whose first element contains the desired value

3374870
nspredicate	nsmutableset
take the results of your nspredicate and put them into an nsset or its mutable child nsmutableset

3374898
width	height
getting height and width of body or window of web page

3374998
filesystems	fat
the filesystems used by dos and windows up to win98 if i am not mistaken is fat

3375059
gridview	repeater
such as eval and bind most often found in data controls like gridview repeater etc.

3375084
post	put
based on the additional information you put in the comments to the post i would recommend a modified approach

3375114
folder	directory
i installed xampp on my windows side and changed the apache root directory to z www the location of my mamp webroot which is a shared folder between mac and windows

3375128
getter	setter
property tells objective-c to generate the getter and setter for this member variable when it is synthesize d in the implementation class

3375157
post	get
post the code of the other functions involved so i can get a better idea of what is going on

3375202
rtsp	rtmp
wowza can re-transmit an rtsp stream as rtmp

3375202
rtsp	rtmp
the same video can be transmitted as either rtsp or rtmp and it s just a matter of different transmission protocols

3375207
width	height
if you want the svg to fill the entire width height of the screen try this in the html document

3375207
width	height
if you wanted to fill a smaller region of the document then try removing the width and height attributes on the referenced svg root element and make sure that there is a viewbox attribute

3375266
put	get
the fastest way to get your data supported by amazon but not yet azure is to ship them a usb disk even a usb stick have them put the data in the disk and ship it back to you

3375276
codeigniter	kohana
since they are concerned about a bloated framework i suggest that instead they investigate using a lightweight php framework such as codeigniter and kohana

3375337
ant	maven
i did see some stuff about xmldiff and maven ant integration but it s kind of bare

3375356
versioning	upgrade
struts 2.1 is a major upgrade from the previous 2.0.x versioning

3375372
submit	submission
when submission data once changed submit only the rows which were changed

3375472
strdup	malloc	memcpy	strdup	memcpy	malloc
alternatively you can copy the string using the typical c techniques for example using malloc + memcpy strdup or similar but it sounds like you might want a refresher in strings pointers and memory allocation in c before you get to that

3375492
scheme	racket
racket formerly plt scheme where some interesting research is going on in contracts and testing

3375492
scheme	racket
racket is a research language but it is an extension of scheme which is pretty widely used for a niche language

3375525
verilog	vhdl
fpgas are programed with hardware description languages like verilog and vhdl

3375574
children	parent
i need to have the antrun task execute after all the children - but i can t associate it with package phase since parent gets packaged before children and i need ant to run afterwards

3375574
children	parent
and have that run package phase on all children and then run antrun run on parent

3375576
min	max
instead of min you could use max as well

3375612
postgresql	mysql
for example for most things that you would do with mysql or postgresql but having predefined columns really holds you back

3375630
folder	directory
there s a folder in the series 40 sdk directory that apparently caches the midlets it runs and keeps older versions of the same midlet there too

3375665
children	parent
i need to have the antrun task execute after all the children - but i can t associate it with package phase since parent gets packaged before children and i need ant to run afterwards

3375667
aim	instant
talk or ytalk ntalk etalk would let the other person reply but these days instant messaging goes via a centrally managed identity aim jabber skype etc. rather than on a machine-to-machine basis

3375669
implements	extends
what class should i extends or implements

3375706
width	height
does anyone know the safest width and height for the body when viewing any web page on the ipad

3375752
google-chrome	firefox
works with firefox google-chrome

3375783
config	ini
the problem is not related to the ini config or your realm definition

3375794
width	height
your best bet is to make the width and height the same as the lower resolution of the ipad since you don t know which way it s oriented

3375799
button	checkbox
i have a case where i would like treeview to be able to show radio button on multiple root nodes and checkbox on their children

3375826
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is there seems to be a slight gap between the list items in firefox but in google-chrome there is no gap

3375826
google-chrome	firefox
if i change the css line-height value it corrects in firefox but then breaks google-chrome

3375826
google-chrome	firefox
any ideas on what i need to do as i think i am doing something wrong to ensure that between each list item there is no gap in both firefox and google-chrome

3375828
post	get
i get back a forbidden response when i try to get or post a private url

3375860
iprincipal	iidentity
it is possible by defining your own iidentity and possibly iprincipal too and constructing this when creating the iprincipal for the http request

3375874
int	chars
to convert the chars 7 into an int form

3375912
folder	directory
this way i can just add sqlservercelibrary as needed to my solutions and the dlls will be copied into the correct directory in the bin folder

3375938
jobs	cron
i have 2 other mission-critical cron jobs that run rake tasks that look identical and run fine not sure what s different about this one

3375940
post	get
can anyone provide an example of how i could use get and post apache 4.1 httpclient

3375961
setinterval	settimeout
you can more or less abuse settimeout setinterval and their derivatives like delay to simulate sleep but you re usually better off just adapting to the setinterval timeout way of doing things.

3375961
setinterval	settimeout
and in the browser that s setinterval and settimeout

3375966
setinterval	settimeout
any sleep function will most likely need to utilize settimeout or possibly setinterval

3375982
vsto	add-in
i am working on a powerpoint 2007 vsto add-in and i am running in a small issue

3376013
folder	directory
my directory structure please ignore other folder

3376032
folder	directory
i suspect your real problem is when an access database is opened a separate temporary locking file that manages the users collisions and record locks is created and keep in mind that this temporary locking file is created in the same directory as where the shared data is in this case your back end shared data folder

3376032
readonly	temporary
what this means is when the first user who opens the database can t create that temporary separate locking file then for the most part additional users coming into the database will also not be able to make modifications and will also be in readonly mode

3376066
folder	directory
as a summary you re going to make a cpanel backup minus the home directory generally the largest folder restore that backup and then rsync the home directory over to the server

3376083
versioning	upgrade
to test the app for the situation where an iphone os 3.1 has been upgrade to ios4 i run this versioning on device iphone and versioning 4.0 in iphone simulator

3376083
backgrounding	multitasking
due to application multitasking in ios4 my app does not terminate when i press the home button instead as expected it goes in the backgrounding and pressing the app icon it comes back to foreground

3376085
jar	war
have you tried putting the required jar in web-inf lib of the war app-inf lib of the ear or the lib directory of the ear file

3376114
integer	unsigned
when i found out that classes inheriting the error class cannot extend fw_error_types enum i had to go with a generic enum and was forced to have geterror return an unsigned integer

3376118
hash	salt
insert into salt email username firstname lastname activationcode values request.querystring payer_email request.querystring payer_email request.querystring first_name request.querystring last_name request.querystring hash

3376151
width	height
so because there has to be a custom maximizing state i want to get the height and width of the screen without the taskbar

3376198
x86	64bit
i found x86 in that manifest file which is not 64bit afaict so i did more research

3376256
daemon	cron
in your position i d consider writing a daemon instead of relying on cron

3376256
daemons	systemd
your daemons could use memory_get_usage and call out out free uptime and friends to throttle the number of workers to match systemd conditions

3376256
daemon	cron
but if it s acceptably slow cron could cycle the daemon every so often.

3376265
inherited	subclassing
if you need to create a new type of error you can inherited from the base error class or a more specific subclassing

3376328
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
if you want to manipulate with javascript getelementbyid on #compv-navbar and getelementsbytagname img using that as a context

3376335
ubuntu	linux
alternatively there is launchpad which has been around longer and is backed by canonical the company behind ubuntu linux

3376393
web-applications	web-inf
for web-applications load from web-inf classes or web-inf lib in the context of the web application but not from other web-applications which are isolated

3376427
stdout	stderr
related to the consuming of stderr and stdout here s a little convenience class which i use frequently

3376434
springboard	backgrounding
it will load from springboard every time correctly even if it is running in the backgrounding

3376472
rss	feed
2 or you could provide rss feed from your cms and retrieve the rss feed via http request and parse it

3376472
rss	feed
here s also an article how to parse rss xml feed from a website

3376474
apache	nginx
some frameworks require you to tweak apache lighty nginx etc to make it a framework extension

superclass	subclassing
all fields in the superclass also exist on the subclassing so having an explicit relation is unnecessary

3376517
ant	maven
if you are someone who prefers to keep your hands off the build script files after you initially set it up and it looks like you are given you were using netbeans built in projects which generate an ant build.xml behind the scenes then you should just try maven and see what happens

3376528
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
you show how to create an nsbitmapimagerep not an nsimage

3376528
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
there is an nsimage method to convert to tiff data and there is an nsbitmapimagerep method to convert to data in several formats

3376571
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
having an nsbitmapimagerep as jwwalker pointed out that code doesn t create an nsimage instance you can ask the image rep for a cgimage version of itself and then create a cgimagedestination to write that image to a file

backgrounding	multitasking
with multitasking in ios4 the home button puts the app into backgrounding and when it comes back into foreground i want the view controller to refresh and hence viewwillappear to be called

3376697
google-chrome	firefox
one thing i noticed though is that you have invalid markup and due to this the dom tree within firefox is inconsistent with google-chrome

3376728
google-chrome	firefox
i traced it both in google-chrome and firefox firebug and what happens is very strange

3376738
int	chars
in c main is defined as int main int argc chars argv and the return from main is the return from the program

sorting	grouping
certainly i can achieve this with some kind of custom grouping class and by sorting and iterating

3376830
post	get
post the question on the sahi forums and you should get an answer quickly

3376845

hide	show
in the delegate of the navigation controller when a controller is being show that implements that method the delegate hide or show the navigation controller accordingly

3376849
hide	show
since i animate the hide or show i check the current state and do nothing if no change is needed

3376849
hide	show
if the controller being show is the root controller hide the navigation bar otherwise show it if it is hidden

3376944
cakephp	kohana
i have always likened cakephp to php and kohana to python

3376944
codeigniter	cakephp
i ditched cakephp four years ago for codeigniter

3376944
codeigniter	kohana
then i choose to go with kohana when it was created from codeigniter because kohana takes the best parts of codeigniter and fixes the bad parts

3376978
getter	setter
hiding state behind getter and setter gives you more flexibility to change the internal representation of the class state without breaking other classes that uses the state

3376978
getter	setter
getter and setter allow the class to do things when the state is accessed or mutated

3376978
getter	setter
getter and setter can be synchronized

3376978
getter	setter
getter and setter if implemented according to the java bean rules enable all sorts of object wiring frameworks

3376978
getter	setter
and the downsides of getter and setter are minimal

3376978
getter	setter
any half-decent java ide can generate a getter setter pair for an attribute in a couple of keystrokes

3376978
getter	setter
and if you let your ide generate your getter and setter they won t be buggy either

3376978
getter	setter
while getter and setter make your source code files bigger you normally don t need to pay any attention to them when you are reading the code

3376978
getter	setter
at runtime simple getter and setter will be inlined so that the performance is indistinguishable from directly reading or writing a public attribute

3376999
getter	setter
getter and setter are good for encapsulation

3376999
getter	setter
in general you do not want to blindly provide getter and setter for all fields that do nothing more than return the value or set the value

3376999
getter	setter
you should think about what part of the state of the class you want to expose to the outside and you control that by implementing the appropriate getter and setter

3376999
getter	setter
it s often a good idea to make classes immutable - in that case you wouldn t be providing setter at all just getter

3377067
put	get
most importantly put the url in quotes and set the get url field to expression

3377073
src	attr

then in the success callback for your ajax call hide the spinner and show the content

3377232
vim	emacs
a veteran emacs user over 10 years and recent vim convert gotta love the extremely powerful command system and short key bindings i soon found that either the file navigation cucumber editing or refactoring support was quite lacking in those

3377257
nexus	artifactory
but in the maven land if you can t host up a corporate repository for your project nexus archiva artifactory then the file-based repository is imo the best approach

listview	gridview
if you decide to use wpf you can use a listview with scrolling options enabled with a gridview on top of it

3377391
postgresql	mysql
if you need good bulk insert performance and low cost then you should look at postgresql or mysql

i could get all of the moderations for that user and then use map to get all of the post that the user moderated and then query the post database as pseudocode but i m worried that might be slow

3377483
post	get
try to use that in an implementation and if you get stuck post some more specific questions here

3377539

gmail	hotmail
so what happens if you send a file from a gmail account to a hotmail account does it get attached

3377702
rss	feed
another option if you don t mind it being a gmail-specific solution note that gmail also provides an rss feed to your mailbox which you can then access with normal xml processing apis

3377790
opera	safari
do you know any replacement function that does the same thing and also works in other browsers like ie opera safari

3377804
nfa	dfa
if your regexp engine exposes runtime exponential behavior for x+x+ +y then it is broken because a dfa or nfa can recognize this pattern in linear time

3377813
getter	setter
in the long term ecmascript 5 specifies a different form of getter and setter that will eventually make its way into all browsers

3377813
getter	setter
here is an example of ecmascript 5 getter and setter

3377813
google-chrome	safari
it currently works in ie 9 google-chrome 5 safari 5 see here for a compatibility table

3377878
pop-up	dialog
a dialog pop-up that asks you which to choose will look like the reflector one but will have to be a custom one

3377948

pull	push
what is appropriate technology to push and pull data sockets http

3378062
post	get
the workaround for this problem is to get uploadify to get or post the session id to the script however i m finding this very unreliable

3378076
width	height
but setting a width or a height will override them so put any value you want

3378124

3378201
put	get
what i need to do via ajax is to send a request to page b from page a to get the day of the week from the server and put it in a variable for further testing on page a

3378244
pull	push
using push you need to do very little on the server while the clients will only pull a small amount of data everytime

3378251
width	height
if you don t want the page to stretch then i suggest change the height and width properties of the

3378261
installation	upgrade
if you have a sharepoint enterprise cal key you can upgrade your installation and then everything will work

3378293
quicksort	heapsort
there is no reason why the constant c should be the same for quicksort and heapsort

3378293
quicksort	heapsort
quicksort has always been somewhat faster than heapsort in practice but the difference has become larger recently since as mentioned before locality of memory access has become so important to execution speed

3378320
opera	firefox
the following code implements this and works in firefox opera and chromium

3378337
inherited	properties
surely the way to do this if you don t want to alter the original class would be to inherited from the original class and then add your properties to the derived class

3378339
google-chrome	firefox
this occurs in firefox and google-chrome

3378421
getter	setter
in that class i have getter and setter one for name and the gender

boost	allocator
to provide efficient allocator i d like to use boost make_shared inside the create function however the compiler complains that my class constructor is protected inside boost make_shared

3378529
wordpress	joomla
if you are talking about keeping login persists within a browser session a cookie way is preferred and is in used by many sites around the world including drupal wordpress and joomla

3378609
width	height
this will constrain the height of all children of the stackpanel to the desired height of the first one or width if the panel is oriented vertically

3378612
jboss	glassfish
another point to keep in mind is jboss glassfish which implement the full java ee stack use more memory and may have longer startup times than say tomcat

3378620
i2c	spi
spi i2c and uarts for various peripherals

3378621
boost	allocator
i think that the boost manual could have explained how the allocator is used more explicitly

3378685
hide	show
you can hide the menu on a init and show it on the onload callback

3378686
postgresql	mysql
because then you can make more complex logic than the database provides and it is also database independent i can move from mysql to postgresql and vice versa and it won t be if you are putting these things in the database

3378712
uiview	subviews
since uiview s implementation does nothing and i presume the same for uicontrol you get total creative freedom to make your uiview subclass subviews be positioned wherever you want them

3378718
ubuntu	linux
recently i ve migrated to arch linux after 4 years being loyal to ubuntu

3378718
ubuntu	debian
i m not willing to do another distro-shuffle and switch back to ubuntu while debian is just too stable for my taste.

3378718
ubuntu	debian
of course you can always install packages within r with install.packages but there are dozens of debian ubuntu r packages and excuse me for saying this but it s painstaking job to track them down

3378718
ubuntu	debian
and how can i port debian ubuntu packages to arch i m

3378718
ubuntu	debian
it would be nice if arch -ers could have out-of-the-box support for r like debian ubuntu suse and fedora users

3378738
google-chrome	firefox
with the brower google-chrome firefox we can get the normal effect get we want but with the ie7 the effect is different the checkbox image is disappear why

3378738

my problem is how can i get the effect with ie7 as the same as with google-chrome firefox

3378749
min	max
min heap 512m and max heap 1024m

3378781
post	get
in the prg scenario i would have my post action that would then either redirect back to my get action if there is a validation error or redirect to my success get action otherwise

3378883
free	malloc
eventually your program will segfault at one of following free or malloc involving the corrupted memory areas

3378887
nsuserdefaults	cfpreferences
if you drop down to cfpreferences you could use different preference files for different users but you d lose the convenience of using nsuserdefaults and nsuserdefaultscontroller

3378894
ubuntu	linux	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
now i ve tried it on the latest ubuntu firefox 3.6.7 opera 10.60 internal and the latest linux google-chrome beta from google 5.0.375.99 beta

3378894
opera	google-chrome
opera i do not know about but i often hear about it keeping pace with google-chrome

3378894
put	get
now does anyone have any pointers to get the put method working

3378894
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
currently google-chrome is what i want to work and i expect firefox to work in the upcoming release i don t know i just hear them pushing html5 a lot and i have no idea about opera

3378910
postgresql	mysql
i have several years experience with mysql and a few postgresql and oracle

3378927
postgresql	mysql
because then you can make more complex logic than the database provides and it is also database independent i can move from mysql to postgresql and vice versa and it won t be if you are putting these things in the database

subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
there is a php port of the jama standard matrix class for java over on phpmath which provides a suite of methods for martix addition subtraction multiplication division transform etc

3378953
visualvm	jprofiler
some examples from the java world are visualvm and jprofiler

3378976
subtract	add
to generate a darker or lighter vairant a simple possibility is just to add or subtract a fixed number to all three componenents capping it at 0 and 255 0xff

3379042
required	placeholder
another approach would be to use plistbuddy to edit the contents of the plist although it ll required the script to know what entries to set to what values rather than just replacing a placeholder

3379044
ocp	principles
your major problem is that you don t want to change the class itself because this requirement is only for 1 project build i think you are considering solid priniciples one of these principles is ocp open-closed principles that is

3379051
nfa	dfa
it is well-known how one gets from an nfa for a regular language to a minimal dfa

3379084
post	get
the get and post methods formed but when i reference self.person

3379170
fink	macports
fink is essentially apt-get from linux while macports is essentially ports from bsd

3379176
document.write	getelementbyid
rather than using document.write you might want to instead use getelementbyid and then put your html in the innerhtml property of the element that you want the text to be in

3379218
boost	allocator
if you look at n2351 at the end of the allocator proposal they note that boost has implemented the feature and link to an example that was made to demonstrate its use

3379219
rss	feed
if you configure your rss feed to require some kind of authentication you can do user-based metrics instead of ip-based metrics

3379241
width	height
you need to set the width and height attribute of the

3379242
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
but you might want a dedicated reverse proxy in front of node.js something like apache nginx lighttpd etc

3379245
getter	setter
project bean i ve removed all the plain getter and setter methods

3379245
getter	setter
tracker bean again with simple getter and setter removed for readability

3379249
floor	sqrt
isqrt n is floor sqrt n

3379250
calloc	malloc
you also seem to have a memory leak -- read_dict calls readfile which allocates a buffer with calloc -- why not malloc

3379268
width	height
in order to do that i tried to create anew image from my array with the qimage constructor - qimage const uchar data int width int height format format

3379271
client-side	server-side
javascript is by far the most useful of dynamic languages for real-world practical work - not only is it irreplaceable for client-side work on the user s browser but node.js is rapidly making it very interesting for server-side work too

3379271
perl	tcl	erlang	scheme
there is really no syntax used by most of the dynamic languages given these huge syntax differences which grow if you throw into the mix scheme erlang perl php tcl ... so that part of your specs is moot

3379271
erlang	scheme
at the other extreme if you re not necessarily looking for immediately useful knowledge but for mind-broadening scheme or erlang might suit you best but the syntax in each case is quite different from most other languages be warned

3379273
ienumerator	idisposable
however when you enumerate over it you first retrieve an ienumerator by calling the ienumerable.getenumerator method and typically the underlying object you get back does implement idisposable

3379273
ienumerator	idisposable
as the comments indicate ienumerator does not inherit from idisposable even though many typical implementations does whereas the generic does inherit idisposable

3379282
nonetype	iterable
when i try and sort my dictionary i get an error nonetype object is not iterable

3379388
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
android eclipse emulator problem runs wvga hdpi as a mdpi screens

3379442
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i do all my subview setup in viewwillappear not viewdidappear so i dont understand why it isn t initialised in time

3379442
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i also notice after debugging that viewwillappear is called before the viewdidload method

3379449
firefox	safari
yes doug neiner s hack solved my flicker problem in firefox and ie6 but created another issue in safari so i have changed it to

3379478
getattr	setattr
i d say python is a very good beginners language but it takes a little time to become really pythonic roughly translatable as being proficient with python s characteristics using features like generators list comprehensions getattr and setattr etc fluently

3379486
int	chars
alternatively you could split the resulting hexadecimal hash into pieces of 2 chars and convert them to int individually but i d expect that to be much slower

3379493
hash	md5
an md5 or sha1 hash in php returns a hexadecimal number so all you need to do is convert bases

3379507
googletest	cxxtest
if the googletest framework doesn t fit your needs you have another great alternative called cxxtest

3379523
button	checkbox
all is clear the 2nd grid filled appropriately but when a button out of the custom control click event fired the grid disappear second and what is important is how to save state of the checkbox while after postback i must create the field and bind the grid

3379547
width	height
which causes control edges to slightly bleed to adjacent pixels due to width height and dpi pixels not aligning exactly

3379554
int	chars
i know chars int numeric but i don t know what is used for percentage

3379582
hide	show
you can shorten it further by using .hover but since you re just positioning and hiding showing just do a hide show no reason to re-position

3379593
swt	styledtext
i have a simple question really swt documentation says that if you re using styledtext you either implements its api or you implement linestylelistener

3379616
min	max
i have made a max function in which i am calling the min function

3379627
button	checkbox
if you wanted to you could use click handlers to send variables to a function to build the query on the fly using say checkbox and a button or link to getscript

3379644
ienumerable	ilist
i agree with dbones on using ienumerable ilist instead of arrays - you ll end up writing .toarray many times over -

3379658
google-chrome	firefox
i don t care about cross browser compatibility as long as it works in current firefox and google-chrome

3379660
int	double
in my application i ve created the tlist type list intended to store int or double

3379666
folder	directory
i ve read the stack overflow article about obstructed folder files and that folder is now not listed in the repository but it s still showing up with a warning icon when i do a cleanup tortoisesvn reports that it s not a working directory

3379666
folder	directory
when i try to cleanup it s parent folder i get an error that cleanup failed because data is not a working directory

3379720
ant	maven
i am new with maven i have a task to change building of an ear from ant build to maven build

3379720
jar	war
thanks a lot for posting i read the given links how i understood from there the war file and the ejb jar should be deployed to artifactory company repository so that its could be added as dependency in pom file from ear

3379729
icollection	iqueryable
it has similarities to your construction just because a collection supports crud as well the approach i tries means that you can have code that isn t necessarily aware of dealing with a repository as it can be programmed against the icollection or iqueryable interface.

3379769
int	double
using int double or decimal you ll not be able to store the value with the comma

3379773
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome make a request to the actual page itself

3379773
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox 3 and earlier versions behave the same as safari and google-chrome but version 3.5 addressed this issue bug 444931 and no longer sends a request

3379793
quicksort	heapsort
introsort goes a step further though -- to limit the worst case complexity if it sees that quicksort isn t working well too much recursion so it could have o n 2 complexity it ll switch to a heapsort which guarantees o n log 2 n complexity and limits stack usage as well

3379793
quicksort	heapsort
therefore even if the quicksort it uses is sloppily written the switch to heapsort will limit stack usage anyway

3379795
int	chars
now as far as i understand the algorithm see my original post for the full code and as the code for the initialization of m2 clearly shows these arrays are meant to hold int numbers not chars so one would think the correct allocations should look like

3379803
hide	show
i m trying to find a good way to make a tap show hide my menus in the same way as ibooks

3379803
hide	show
in order to allow the touches to go through but then of course both things happen and i can t cancel the menu show hide

3379818
int	chars
despite the misleading name chars types in c language are ordinary integral types just like short int long and such

3379818
int	chars
so if in your application it is important to save as much memory as possible it might make sense to use chars instead of int

3379818
int	chars
on some hardware platforms it might turn out that int types work faster than chars types so the selection of the specific type becomes a speed-vs-memory trade-off but once again in many cases when the range of chars is naturally sufficient it might make more sense to use chars instead of int

3379848
hide	show
if that doesn t do the trick you can always conditionally show hide placeholders from within the nested gv itemdatabound event when e.item.listitemtype is header

3379854
int	chars
in c chars is an int type -- you don t need an ord to get its int value

3379868
integer	unsigned
you should save as an unsigned integer in your database and format on display but still on server-side if this is what you mean by backend.

3379870
width	height
the solution that finally worked for me was to set the inner imageview to have a fixed height and width larger than the largest image add a lot of padding and then set android scrollx and android scrolly in the xml to get the images placed where i needed them

3379880
opera	safari
noted differences in opera mobile early safari neither displaying source like my example above

3379885
min	max
note that rand also accepts min and max arguments in the form of rand min max

3379904
jlist	jfilechooser
specifically i am writing an image viewer program that uses a jfilechooser to select images and on the left side a jlist that shows the contents of the director

3379906
getter	setter
i just don t understand how to use a getter and a setter on a non-static

3379927
udp	tcp
i ve deliberately omitted the transport to use tcp udp whatever

3379932
awt	swing
your form is awt based not swing based so i m afraid my advice on using swingutilities would probably not have helped you even if you had implemented it correctly

3379946
quicksort	mergesort
update here s an example for what i mean a bug in libc from 2000 where quicksort would start thrashing virtual memory because the quicksort implementation would switch internally to mergesort because it though there is enough memory to hold a temporary array

3379981
put	get
i put those into the mysql_connect line but get the same error

3380000
put	get
since most data-storage mechanisms in-ram in a database etc. get a lot slower as you put more data in them you should ensure you re only timing your http access and not looking at overall crawler throughput including storage

3380017
post	get
after doing some more searching i finally stumbled upon a post here on so which asks the same question here android get real path by uri.getpath

3380025
ubuntu	debian
port from arch no idea as debian and ubuntu work for me

3380043
fadein	fadeout
if you want a fadein fadeout effect on each update try this

3380062
memcached	apc
nothing is shared unless you ve gone out of your way to do so like caching things in apc memcached

3380070
superclass	subclassing
destructor so delete calls the children destructors or a protected non-virtual destructor which prevents the superclass from being delete d as a superclass it must be delete d as a subclassing thus calling the appropriate destructor

3380084
super	implements
in each of the functions you implements did you also call super

3380118
int	chars
considering that chars is 1 byte int is 2 bytes and long is 4 bytes

3380121
nsstring	nsdata
i m not sure about the nsstring version of writetourl atomically but the nsdata version says that it only works with file urls so i wouldn t be shocked if the nsstring version was the same

3380131
folder	directory
this folder seems like completely the wrong place for my project files why don t i have them in my own directory

3380151
getter	setter
for example you can check for null values during the getter or setter

3380160
post	get
when checking that variables passed via get and post are correct i might have something like this

3380160
post	get
how would you check get and post variables in your php script

3380166
int	chars
with no padding and assuming sizeof int sizeof chars sizeof long 4 the size of the outer struct will be 13

3380172
pull	push
anyway there are only two methods that i know of called pull and push

3380209
accessor	properties
i m trying to figure out how to use introspection to identify properties on row-objects that are column accessor

3380223
onclick	onfocus	jssh	xpi
i built jssh for ff 4.0b1 and packaged as an xpi and installed it to my browser when running javascript that checks tags for a certain phrase in the onclick or onfocus events i am getting an ns_error that says component not available has anyone seen this happen as of yet

3380227
gif	png
the best way i could think not very cute one is to convert the gif to png jpeg and then turn it to gif again p

3380236
rss	feed
looks like there is an rss feed of latest songs

3380236
rss	feed
another thing to be conscious of when you write a program that downloads a site or rss feed is how often your scraping script runs

3380236
put	get
if you have it run constantly so that you ll get the new data the second it becomes available you ll put a lot of load on the site and there s a good chance they ll block you

3380246
gif	png
using phps gd functions and outputting a png instead of a gif

3380252
width	height
so i want to have an image resized to 30 of its original height width

3380252
width	height
pretend you don t know its height or width how would you go about it using only css html

3380261
simplecursoradapter	listactivity
before displaying the listactivity i perform a database query and then hook that data up to the list using a simplecursoradapter

3380287
range	max
this is much better than computing the max each time you add a revision as it avoid a range scan of revisions

3380289
google-chrome	firefox
users are complaining about my site saying that they sign in form is not allowing the firefox and google-chrome browsers to remember password

3380292
post	get
i want to be able to post something to the first table which has only two cells city and city_id via php and then get redirected to the second table where someone can post detail about places of the city houses squares ect city_id is the foreign key here whith an one-to-many relationship

3380309
geany	notepad++
geany is a great lightweight editor -- like notepad++ for linux only better

3380323
width	height
if i give layout_height as fill_parent the view appears very small 35 of width and height

3380340
comparator	comparable
if the items you have itself already implements comparable and its default ordering order is already what you want then you basically don t need to supply a comparator

3380385
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
please be sure to test your image alignment in firefox safari google-chrome or opera 9 or 10

3380398
put	get
so the basic algorithm is to keep everything in the hashmaps and then to search for differences just get an array of keys and search through to see if that key is contained in the other list and if it isn t put it into a storing the value there

3380408
addition	multiplication
in the php part you can use the bitwise operator but you ll first have to convert the string into an array of integers and then do an inner product with the one-time pad xor taking the role of multiplication and concatenation taking the role of addition

3380435
profiler	perf
i don t care about perf for my usages and you shouldn t either unless you have a good reason to and you find out via your profiler that this code is the bottleneck

3380456
gif	png
i m working on a project in php that needs to render dynamically-created svg images to png or gif if not png format

3380458
opera	firefox
the following jquery code works in ie firefox opera

3380458
google-chrome	safari
however in google-chrome safari the text is selected--very briefly--but then the mouseup event is fired and the text is deselected

3380496
width	height
but from the looks of it it appears all you need is an algorithm to determine the width height and angle of the foot print well probably the darkness instead and then just have an animation on a path geometry to move it

3380508
try-catch	exception-handling
also it is interesting why am i getting exception-handling when i call createifnotcreated for existing database commented try-catch block in appenddb

3380608
versioning	upgrade
note i did get into few issues so i upgrade my versioning to sql server professional

3380659
hash	md5
you just need to append all pairs then append your private key and finally compute the md5 hash of the resulting string

3380661
put	get
as other answers have suggested it may be better to put this helper method into an external class - that way you can get your code under test to deal with edge cases and you also get some reuse

3380673
innodb	myisam
switching from myisam to innodb fixed this

3380679
flac	ogg
it might be a bit more than you re looking for but it is more capable than nssound and supports formats flac musepack ogg vorbis that core audio doesn t handle natively

3380699
children	parent
it would take a huge different when i am searching for a parent window or page that x name was set in it if the elementname searches up meaning starting from near current element up the tree levels children then it s better to use the ancestortype since it won t search the siblings just the ancestors

3380720
post	get
read the record in the post table and use a table hint with rowlock xlockx to get an exclusive lock

3380737
inherited	properties
or you can use mapedsuperclass to map all of your inherited properties whitout using any hibernate jpa inherited strategy

3380754
min	max
it also uses min and max to ensure that

3380786
bazaar	cvs	bazaar	git	bazaar	svn	cvs	svn
lack of narrow clone capability prohibits an svn cvs like workflow in bazaar hg git so i m hoping they ll be motivated to find some way to do this

3380786
cvs	svn
even svn without real branching tagging support seemed like a step backwards from cvs imo

3380817
implements	extends
in joda i saw that instant class extends abstractinstant and implements readable which is already implements in abstractinstant

3380824
post	get
points will be displayed below the users post count once i get this working

3380846
ant	maven
outside eclipse i use maven ant or the command prompt to invoke the weavers before running the application code

3380905
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if you need to see default or current style properties for any element you can use firefox with firebug or google-chrome safari opera developer tools

3380944
qsort	strcmp
i believe you can use qsort in combination with strcmp to accomplish the first part

3380949
for-loop	arrays
i know i could run another for-loop with a new arrays and transfer them manually but a one step solution would be awesome

3380952
folder	directory
if you just drag in images into the xcode project tree if you copy them the images will be copied to the root of the project directory instead of the images or other folder you might have set up

3380965
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
however when checking to see if my code was working properly across other major browsers google-chrome opera and safari i found that none of my custom javascript seemed to work

3380988
mouseout	mouseenter
also if you re doing mouseenter and mouseout you might as well just use the hover event that does both of those

3380993
scheme	prolog	ocaml	prolog	ocaml	scheme
more recently i learned functional languages like ocaml scheme and even logic languages like prolog

3380993
scheme	prolog
for example scheme s use of call cc simplifies backtracking a tool required to answer several problems and prolog s logic specification although inefficient due to its brute-force nature can drastically simplify and even automatically solve certain problems that are difficult to wrap one s brain around

3380993
scheme	prolog	lisp	prolog	lisp	scheme
in this case why are the contestants that use less common languages like scheme lisp prolog and even python significantly less successful than contestants that use c c++ and java

3380993
scheme	prolog	lisp	prolog	lisp	scheme
it even makes me question my admiration for said paradigms worrying that i cannot be successful as a lisp scheme prolog programmer in a programming competition

3381080
ftell	fread
here is the updated code with fread and ftell

3381091
ada	pascal
also you can notice that most algorithmic books feature psedudocode in style of pascal or ada and very very rarely - lisp

3381130
haskell	scheme
undergrad students these days may start with scheme haskell python etc. but high-schoolers often self-taught less often. in fact many of the eastern european participants still use pascal and are more amazing with it than the rest of us will ever be with any language

3381131
profiling	debugging
i use jprofiler for profiling and eclipse s debugger for debugging

3381133
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
rather than implement the cors version of xmlhttprequest the ie team have gone with there own propriety object named xdomainrequest

3381133
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
the usage of xdomainrequest has been simplified from xmlhttprequest by having more events thrown with onload perhaps being the most important

3381163
mouse	keyboard
with keyboard and mouse combination

3381167
public	protected
for more information how public private protected work in ruby read this dcarrera ruby 0.3 chp_04 features.html

3381180
free	realloc
if realloc fails it returns null but doesn t free the original memory

3381180
fseek	ftell
also fseek followed by ftell may not give a meaningful result for binary files

3381180
realloc	malloc
you shouldn t cast the return value of malloc or realloc in c since a is implicitly converted to any other object pointer type in c

3381181
backgrounding	multitasking
xmpp will allow your iphone app to receive data even when in the backgrounding using the new multitasking features listening for a socket and i m pretty sure you should find ready to use servers for lamp or at least open source implementations

3381181
backgrounding	multitasking
note that the ios4 multitasking api doesn t support polling in the backgrounding so your only other option should be push notifications

3381187
versioning	upgrade
i go by this theory old versioning use older versioning of frameworks and older jvms newer versioning use upgrade frameworks and jvms

3381187
versioning	upgrade
if your running anything before that then your obviously not upgrading the jvm because of stupid policies scared of the unkown and therefor aren t going to upgrade to newer versioning of software

3381188
interpolation	splines
may i suggest cubic splines interpolation

3381196
quicksort	mergesort
if you look at the arrays.sort methods all the sorts on primitives use quicksort and the sorts on use mergesort

3381200
mouseover	mouseout
it fires the mouseover and mouseout events every time the cursor moves over the various contents of the messages

3381207
backgrounding	multitasking
there s more information about ios 4 multitasking available in apple s guide to what s new in ios 4 and the ios 4 application programming guide s backgrounding tasks section

3381293
post	get
i run it on everything sent via post or get and my goal is to prevent any kind of mysql injections or whatever hackers do

3381307
innodb	myisam
i need both myisam tables and innodb tables in my database i am using hbm2ddl to create them

3381307
innodb	myisam
can i create both myisam and innodb tables in the same database using hibenrate hbm2ddl

3381322
int	boolean
however in some situations the current value cannot be provided as an int so this class also provides a boolean isinteger to allow api users to know when intvalue can be safely invoked

3381351
width	height
the result is quite bad as i said the thing returns the image with the right width and height but it s empty so i guess i don t mess the thing up with the threading bit

3381360
teamcity	luntbuild
teamcity luntbuild - depends on team which use this tools

3381390
g++	gcc
i try to use the gcc instrument functions with g++ compiler of mingw but i

3381417
vmware	virtualbox
setting up a virtual machine in vmware or virtualbox using ubuntu with postgresql takes just a few minutes

3381481
google-chrome	safari
i always want to know how the resource inspection work in webkit safari google-chrome s webinspector work

3381520
actionscript	haxe
the changes you need to be aware of are blatant advertisement for haxe follows - float in haxe is number in actionscript 3 for example and haxe uses type inference which makes it possible to omit variable types at will letting haxe figure it out itself when you add two int s what do you get

3381523
post	get
i.e i want to get the values using post in the php page

3381554
mongodb	bson
it s not the native output of mongodb the native format is bson

3381590
webclient	httpwebrequest
i m using .net httpwebrequest or webclient class

3381729
onclick	onmousedown
the default methods of onclick onmousedown etc

3381735
google-chrome	firefox
also a good way to debug javascript is to open up google-chrome s console or in firefox use firebugs console and when you perform the action it will usually inform you of a problem or lack thereof

3381741
haskell	ocaml
i want to learn ocaml or haskell and i want to do it by writing a simple game

3381741
haskell	ocaml
is there a place where i can get a working sdl for haskell or ocaml on windows without fighting with a dozen versions of compilers

3381775
width	height
if we simply increase the width and height of an image the width and height will grow in the viewport but what we really want to do is constrain the width and height to what it is on page load and have the image become larger within those bounds

3381845
itemscontrol	gridsplitter
a scrollviewer with a grid with several gridsplitter and a itemscontrol

3381860
folder	directory
so now when i deploy the application the web.xml for tomcat which is in my specified folder owerwrites the web.xml present in web-inf folder in the deployment directory

3381907
put	get
if you add a target called static library you will get the equivalent of an assembly just put all the sources in the target and decide what headers should be published and what should be hidden to the user of your library

3381913
ant	buildr
it s mostly wrapper code around the ant task using antwrap the buildr java integration and inserting it into the project lifecycle

3381997
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
do any other repository systems git svn bazaar mercurial etc. have an option like this

3382053
hash	md5
then the server calculate the hash sha1 md5 or some other from the information send from the client and sign the respond with the server s private key or servers certificate

3382059
dictionary	map
if you store your matrix as a coordinate map any language which has a concurrent dictionary implementation available should do the job for you

3382069
width	margin
right is liquid so no width but to prevent #left from overlapping you give #right a margin of the width of #left - margin 0 0 0 200px

3382072
background-image	background-color
all you have to do is replace the second divs background-color property with the background-image property and nest that div inside your existing div

3382113
post	get
either user get and escape whatcontent or use post and pass whatcontent as the data parameter

3382196
hide	show
i am using zend_navigation i want to show the nav item in the breadcrumbs but hide it in my menu how can i do that

3382222
post	get
so instead of returning clonex1 likes your post i get undefined

3382231
post	get
i ll post a note on microsoft connect if others can verify that they too get this problem and of course i hope that either jon mads or eric will take a look at it as well

3382231
post	get
i ll post a description below of how to make the projects if you rather want to get your hands dirty

3382231
invalidprogramexception	badimageformatexception
this in turn leads to odd problems at runtime everything from the result of the method call being considered optimized away the original question or a crash with either badimageformatexception or invalidprogramexception or one of the similar exceptions

3382231
invalidprogramexception	badimageformatexception
i ve seen both invalidprogramexception and badimageformatexception depending on what the cast ended up as

3382316
width	height
now i want to convert it to the proper rect swap x y width and height so i do

3382320
gif	ico	gif	png	png	ico
ico files are mainly image files if you change a jpeg or gif png into ico extension it works fine so if you keep image type cheking it will do the job

3382363
width	height
an alternative might be reduce the width so that the height is always 100px

3382391
width	height
yes browsers can resize images based on width and height attributes however you have no control over the quality of the resized image

3382393
screens	tablet
how about on a standard touch screens laptop tablet or the like i don t have one so i can t test but i would imagine that support is included because as far as i know that table interface just replaces mouse control so as far as the browser is concerned the end-user is really just using a mouse

3382423
int	chars
a chars or short type takes 8 bits and an int can take up to 64 bits

3382423
addition	multiplication
one option if other operations like addition multiplication are not important is to allocate enough memory to store each bcd digit plus one bcd terminator

3382423
addition	multiplication
storing this way will make other operations like addition and multiplication trickier though

3382432
stdout	stderr
can i configure bash on linux to write a copy of all stdout and stderr to a regular file without having to specify the redirection for each command

3382440
hide	show
i have a div and when you click on it used toggle and show and hide a list div underneath the button

3382477
post	get
read the post the basic questions get asked over and over again

3382480
width	height
i encountered a site that had bought stock photos and embedded the 2mpx original images in their web page with width and height directives of 150px thumbnail size

3382498
webclient	webrequest
and then i want to download some sub page html using webrequest or webclient

3382498
webclient	webrequest
how to transfer webbrowser authentication information to webrequest or webclient

3382512
drools	jess	jrules	jess
have you thought about using a rules engine such as drools jess or jrules

3382562
lxml	beautifulsoup
look up beautifulsoup or lxml

3382616
webclient	webrequest
if you can retrieve the necessary cookies from the webbrowser control after they are set by the site you are logging into you should be able to use those same cookies with webrequest webclient

3382622
post	get
post and get are class constants and requestmethod is a class variable

3382622
post	get
i have updated the method to specifically check for get and to throw an exception when the request method is not get or post

3382655
public	protected
protected means this is public for my derived classes private for anyone else

3382692
disk	ram
store your oracle database on a san based filesystem you can give it enough ram say 3gb that the whole database is in ram and so disk seek access never stores your application down

3382692
disk	ram
if you can t afford a san mount a ram disk and install your database on there then use db level replication like logshipping to provide failover

3382699
hebrew	thai
hebrew and leelawadee for thai and

3382716
backtracking	greedy
in theory there should be no cases where a choice between greedy and non-greedy causes a re to match in one case and fail in another -- it should only affects what gets matched and as you mention performance not whether the match succeeds at all since res are supposed to backtracking for the purpose

3382769
division	multiplication	division	modulo	multiplication	modulo
no expensive multiplication division or modulo operators

3382808
hash	md5
i just want to be sure what hash algorithm was used on these strings i m not sure if it s md5

3382812
folder	directory
i want the images folder to be a folder in the same directory as my script file wherever it may be stored

3382827
hash	salt
any hash function worth its salt will spread the hash values evenly throughout the entire output space so if you have just a bunch of outputs there s no way to tell hash functions apart

3382877
hash	md5
it fits md5 hash form length-wise but it could be just as well sha1 hash stored in char 32 field

3382879
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
have a look at datainputstream dataoutputstream objectinputstream and objectoutputstream

3382901
outputstream	inputstream
sockets neither deal with nor with but with inputstream and outputstream which are used to read and write bytes

3382917
sorting	filtering
filtering and sorting during search

3382925
for-loop	arrays
from my understanding sizzle returns an arrays of objects domelements i am trying to walk that arrays of objects in a for-loop but i am getting errors

3382929
postgresql	mysql
it works with all major pdo -supported database engines mysql sqlite sql server sybase oracle postgresql etc

3382945
client-side	server-side
doens t have anything to do with caching either server-side or client-side

3383143
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
when using an nsoutlineview nstableview with bindings and an nstreecontroller nsarraycontroller the view s columns get bindings assigned to not the individual cells for obvious reasons

3383145
int	boolean
com.google.android.googlelogin.googleloginservicehelper.getaccount activity activity int requestcode boolean requiregoogle

3383169
tinyint	boolean
for legacy issues i need to map the boolean to a tinyint not to a bit

3383180
google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine in firefox but for some reason the page i want to get is not loading in google-chrome v 5.0

3383209
wan	lan
eddiec is right if the computers are located inside the same sub-network lan or if the computers ip is their interface to the internet wan public ip

3383215
hide	show
i am trying to avoid redundant show hide effects if possible since not every instance of this sliding pane have such requirements

3383245
vim	kate
kate has vim mode

3383254
hide	show
i will probably use some jquery for collpsing a decade block that show or hide the ten years inside it ten little boxes when clicking those boxes users will be taken first to the detailed year page and then to the detailed event page in case thhey cklick on one of the events

3383271
listview	gridview
i have tried using a listview gridview but it seems to use too much space when there are only a few items below each category

3383300
postgresql	mysql
this question is for both mysql and postgresql

3383311
rss	feed
your rss feed only contains seven items

3383311
rss	feed
browsers will not trim rss feed

3383311
rss	feed
you need to find a bigger rss feed

3383314
children	parent
i have a typical one to many relationship between the parent and children

3383314
children	parent
i am wondering if i have parent that know about their children is it

3383323
super	self
return super caradmin self .get_form request obj none kwargs

3383330
many-to-many	one-to-many
if the relationship is truly one-to-many and not many-to-many then you would leave parent_id on the child table as the foreign key and drop the parent_has_children table altogether

3383336
children	parent
if the relationship is 1 parent to many children the same child can only belong to exactly one parent then the standard modelling approach is to reference the parent table from the child table via one of the parent s key columns usually the parent s primary key pk

3383336
children	parent
re how do parent know about their children

3383400
hide	show
cookie value show hide

3383404
explode	implode
fetch the whole string from memcached explode the values into an array remove the element you want to remove implode the new array and store it back into memcached

3383437
int	double
this result is not surprising in the first d you passed a double where an int was expected

3383438
int	double
both printf statements are invalid because you re using a format specifier expecting a int but you re only giving it a float double

3383473
post	get
i am supposed to send a post request like that to the web server and get a string returned to me

3383508
pop-up	dialog
if by jumping window you mean the modal dialog that pop-up this can be achieved by using the jquery ui dialog plugin

safari and i assume firefox exposes it or you can extract it from the page source

3383537
int	double
an int is a 32-bit value and a double is a 64-bit value

3383543
decoder	encoder
the reason this wasn t working for me was because of an issue elsewhere in my code where i stupidly neglected to implement the message response encoder decoder

3383551
getter	setter
hibernate does use reflection and in some cases the object s id might be a private member with private setter getter because it is of no use in the java domain

3383552

you can either create a large size image 2000px width height and set it as a background with background-position 50 50

3383581
hide	show
i need a way to show in one view and hide in one view

3383606
hash	md5
file_attribute_directory check is much faster than a check based upon the md5 of the file which requires opening and performing the actual hash of the file

3383643
post	put
as we re not allowed to put any serious development into the legacy site it s also in old school asp a language i don t care to learn. i can t do a proper single sign-on solution so i proposed the following on login the legacy site performs an ajax post to the login controller of the new beta site logging the user in there it then simply proceeds with the login on the legacy site as normal

3383643
hash	salt
the other idea i had was to pass a salt hash of the user s details across with their username when they try to access the 2nd site

3383644
profiling	debugging
debugging and profiling come to mind immediately -- they need to be able to get a more complete view of the internals of objects

3383645
rss	feed
one of the things i do is follow the rss feed of r questions on so

3383656
mbunit	nunit

3383664
put	get
if you just want to get all string literals out of your c# code to put them into your resource file i suggest not to parse your c# code but the il code generated by the c# compiler that ist much

3383665
freebsd	linux
would a very small simple command line program programmed in standards compliant c99 and statically compiled on freebsd work if executed on linux

3383680
freebsd	linux
however freebsd has a good linux compatibility layer where you can run linux binaries that are compiled against the linux syscall interface on freebsd

3383680
freebsd	linux
see chapter 10 linux binary compatibility of the freebsd handbook for more information

3383702
free	malloc
also this snippet by itself does not free the malloc d memory although i m assuming this is done elsewhere

3383720
rtp	rtsp
in red5 we are adapting an rtp rtsp library written using mina

3383725
post	get
since the post request in a post redirect get prg pattern returns a redirect 303 see other status code on success is it at all possible to inform the client of the specific flavour of success they are to enjoy eg

3383725
post	get
might it be appropriate for example to make the redirected get respond with the proper response code headers that would be expected from the post response

3383739
free	malloc
malloc and free are like nsobject alloc and nsobject release in objective-c

3383739

3383895
ostringstream	std
for rounding to render to gui use std ostringstream

3383949

consider using the element and rather than adding new ones hide show them to ensure functionality in non-js browsers

3383979
gtk	gdk
appears in gtk and gdk crashes

3384203
for-loop	arrays
does java have a built-function to allow me to linearly search for an element in an arrays or do i have to just use a for-loop

3384208
int	double
the general pattern for dynamically allocating a 2d array of type t where t can be int double etc. is

3384233
getter	setter
if your object literal has a value property it cannot have getter or setter and vice versa

3384233
getter	setter
your object literal cannot have more than one getter or setter with the same name

3384235
getter	setter
javascript getter and setter

3384239
getter	setter
javascript does in fact support getter and setter now

3384239
getter	setter
john s article does a good job at mentioning several different ways of defining getter setter on javascript objects but doesn t do a good job at describing when each method is applicable

3384239
getter	setter
getter and setter with javascript

3384294

you add a library that allows you to generate rss feed

3384413
mouse	keyboard
we first notice that simple functions like find usages return bogus results or nothing then it slows down considerably and finally the mouse stops working while the keyboard becomes extremely slow

3384486
multiplying	subtract
one possibility for a compact timestamp for replay purposes... set the time as a floating point number of seconds since the epoch with time.time multiplying by 50 since you said you re repeating this 50 times a second the resulting unit one fiftieth of a second is sometimes called a jiffy truncate to int subtract from the similar int count of jiffies since the epoch that you measured at the start of your program and struct.pack the result into an unsigned int with the number of bytes you need to represent the intended duration -- for example with 2 bytes for this timestamp you could represent runs of about 1200 seconds 20 minutes but if you plan longer runs you d need 4 bytes 3 bytes is just too unwieldy imho

3384522
getter	setter
for this simple example you could alternately use an atomicinteger rather than synchronizing the setter getter

3384531
hide	show
and in general what is the best way to show and hide dom elements

3384546
free	malloc
i would propose you use only c++ stuff here and not mix in c malloc free

3384604

3384804
goto	break
the goto statement along with break and continue in some languages also lets you structure programs to behave like overlapped scopes

3384814
hash	md5
the first one i am certain i can achieve but the second project is going to be pretty difficult i believe as unlike most hash calculators out there i do not only need to check individual files for sha md5 crc-32 crc-16 but i also need to check compact flash through a usb-connected sandisk cf reader and eeproms through a com or usb connection as well

3384850

otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater than or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand the operand with signed integer type shall be converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

3384918
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the type of the operand with signed integer type can represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type the operand with unsigned integer type shall be converted to the type of the operand with signed integer type

3384918
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands shall be converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type

3384919
integer	unsigned

syntax which he she is clearly familiar with printing to stderr instead of stdout

3384935
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome ie and firefox are good citizens but safari is cruising along just fine with ignoring the following asp.net code

3384950
for-loop	loops
even better get rid of flag altogether and replace the while loops with a for-loop

the entire concept of template inheritance in django is implements through the extends tag

3385098
implements	extends
more accurately it s implements through the extendsnode class of the django.template.loader_tags module which is created when the extends tag is parsed

3385098
versioning	upgrade
it will work for a day or a week or even months at a time but sooner or later you or the programmer that comes after you will upgrade from django 1.2 to a later versioning and then it will break

stdout is the file into which the kernel writes its output and the process requesting it accesses the information from and stderr is the file into which all the exceptions are entered

3385217
strsplit	substr
but if you ve already read the text into a string it would probably be easier use matcher.find or strsplit or even indexof and substr

it would be more correct to say that stdin stdout and stderr are i o streams rather

3385295
prepare	execute
when you have a business process that requires multiple selects updates and deletes to be execute against a variety of tables stored procedures are often better than a bunch of prepare statements execute one after the other

3385297
post	get
because get and post do not have the same semantic value

3385297
post	get
get requests should be generally safe to perform at any time without compromising the system while post requests should be used when doing something important like accepting a monetary transaction or in a less dramatic way post a comment or something like that

3385297
post	get
source w3c http 1.1 method definitions read 9.1.1 safe methods 9.3 get and 9.5 post

3385622
maven	pom.xml
we have been using maven with osgi we declare the bundle dependencies in its pom.xml and you don t have to worry about them anymore

3385623
int	chars
a good rule of thumb is to choose the variable type according to its semantics chars is for ascii chars int for int and so on ... rather than to its size except to align your structures

3385623
int	chars
on a 32bits architecture the size of a processor registry is 32bits so using accessing a chars 8 bits takes two operations while accessing an int is only one

3385644
int	chars
in simple case int vs unsigned chars gives the same code for me

3385657

folder	directory
i am having iis anonymous authentication set for website on server.however i want to use active directory group to validate user credentials.here is the setting in web.config for folder security

3385687
int	chars
the case of int versus unsigned chars is more complex

3385687
int	chars
an int will be at least as large as a chars or the chars obviously couldn t be the smallest addressable unit of memory and it must be able to hold any value from -32 767 to +32 767

3385687
int	chars
this may or may not correspond to any actual machine. the chars will be 8 bits and the int likely 16

3385687
int	chars
operations on int are likely expensive so a chars might be faster

3385687
int	chars
although chars types especially unsigned chars can be used as tiny int doing so is sometimes more trouble than it s worth

3385687
int	chars
the compiler will have to emit extra code to convert between chars and int making the executable larger and unexpected sign extension can be troublesome

3385693
temp	tmp
it looks in these variables tmp temp userprofile

3385736
sorting	filtering
it s currently only possible to expose filtering to users not the sorting

silverlight is the technology which is used for rich internet client-side application on top of asp.net server-side application like flash

3385944
hash	md5
my second thought was to md5 the email address put the hash into username and that would make it always unique and technically identical to the email field as well

3385944
hash	md5
my third thought was to chop the last two characters off the end of the md5 hash making it 30 and then using it as i had planned to use it with the full hash

3386028

3386110
width	height
try using height 600 and width 600 to set the width and height manually

3386110

3386221
versioning	upgrade
upgrading to a newer versioning of python will be the best solution but if for some reason you can t upgrade you could update the code to use the and-or trick

3386233
stdout	stderr
i would expect ignoring that stdout and stderr are printed in my contrived example - but first line should exit with 0 which i would expect ruby would interperate as false and display exit failure sure so the logic is wrong the ternary needs to be flipped - but the second line should exit with the opposite status and it doesn t

3386260
getter	setter
because you can transparently from client code s perspective change the implementation of the setter getter wheras you cannot do the same if you expose the underlying property directly as it would not be binary compatible.

3386265
post	get
when you pass the object to jquery.ajax or the get post wrappers it will be serialized into get or post variables not sent as json so your object would be converted into something like this

3386279

how can i know that the activity has finished laying out all the views and is ready to give me the correct height and width measurements

3386483
post	get
a common example of command query separation on the web is post redirect get

3386483
post	get
for ajax and a partial view this might not be the best strategy since the problems that post redirect get solves aren t really relevant and the redirect can be tricky

3386718
put	get
as you can see i ve tried too synchronise the code which is outside the ui thread with the ui thread by wrapping it in the syncexec method but i still get the exception when the table item is selected which leads me to believe i have put the syncexec part in the wrong place

3386724
stateless	stateful
pop or imap work through http wouldn t make much sense stateful vs stateless but my understanding is that socks would allow me to do what i want

3386768
hide	show
their reasoning is that the user is often going to be entering data in a modal form so they are trying to be helpful and keep the keyboard visible where ordinarily various transitions within the modal view can cause the keyboard to show hide repeatedly

3386770
post	put
now based on my previous post it is my understanding that any object that uses idisposable needs to be put in a using and sqldatareader inherits from idisposable so i need to put it

postgresql	mysql
if you are not firmly oposed to doing some coding - getting linq to mysql oracle and postgresql and modifying it would probably save you a lot of work as well

3387350
getter	setter
make a myclass property with getter setter and return that so on referesh it will be maintained and ha use also null check as mentioned in question

3387357
try-catch	exception-handling
closing of connection statement and resultset should each happen in its own try-catch block because closing can throw an exception-handling

pop-up	dialog
on my site the login form is opened in pop-up modal dialog

3387423
maven	cargo
functional testing with maven cargo and selenium

3387477
min	max
what you are doing currently is subtracting max from min while the numbers are still of type int - which necessarily overflows

3387477
min	max
a signed int is fundamentally incapable of representing the difference between its min and max

3387489
children	parent
in css the overflow hidden is set on parent containers in order to allow it to expand with the height of their floating children

3387520
public	protected
r is either protected or package private that is neither public nor protected nor private and is declared by a class in the same runtime package as d

3387537
vsto	add-in
has anybody any experience in using wix or wix# and vsto add-in

3387557
int	chars
it returns 8 as i understand because sizeof chars is 1 byte and this struct contains int types first it convers it to chars using chars pointers and returns sizeof chars

3387590
nhibernate	queryover
you can still query your objects with linq hql criteria or queryover and you are still goin to use nhibernate

3387604
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this behaviour i checked on all browsers like firefox msie7 8 opera safari google-chrome

3387621

is there is any way to get the width and height of a resizable div while resizing i try the following code but it resulted as undefined in alert box

3387655
ceil	floor
python s math module contain handy functions like floor ceil

3387687
client-side	server-side
i pass an javascript object from client-side to server-side function with ajaxpro

3387715
int	double
any int with absolute value less than or equal to 2 24 can be exactly represented in the single precision format and any int with absolute value less than or equal to 2 53 can be exactly represented in the double precision format

3387835
int	chars
in c a chars is a type of int and it s most typically one byte wide

3387835
int	chars
in other languages a chars is a completely different thing from an int as it should be and has to be explicitly encoded to turn it into a byte

3387835
serializable	deserialization
the things you want to google for are serializable and deserialization

3387876
int	double
note that this works on double so if you want a float or an int you will need to cast

3387927
inherited	subclassing
perhaps you could pull out common behaviour between your error classes into a single base class called error and then inherited from this to produce more concise or project-specific subclassing

3387993
equals	gethashcode
i had a few problems with how i implemented gethashcode and equals for the isnmpdatasource implementations but formalizing a definition of equality pretty much fixed all those problems

3387998
width	height
with iframes you may run into scrollbar issues if the content is loaded from an external site and the width and height is not known in advance

3387998
width	height
the very hacky solution to reporting the width and height from a remote site being loaded in an iframe was simply not worth the trouble

3388039
ubuntu	linux
i m looking for a way to profile my openmpi program in c i m using openmpi 1.3 with linux ubuntu 9.10 and my programs are run under a intel duo t1600

3388065
capitalize	uppercase
as a third alternative you could also define and match against the uppercase version though i would advise against this unless you have a good reason for creating a capitalize requestlist

3388082
factors	mean
with that number of records having too tight fill factors means that every new insert or even update can trigger rather massive rearrangement and that depending on the usage that can also mean escalating deadlocks

3388144
ubuntu	linux
i used it under windows in a linux vm running under the free vmware player running ubuntu keeping the files on a virtual netwok share that was physically on the host

3388145
rss	feed
if you really need to hide a website under development block search engines in dashboard settings privacy and use something like wordpress â º absolute privacy â wordpress plugins to disable rss feed and redirect to a static page you choose

3388183
vtune	gprof
have a look at gprof and at intel s vtune

3388199
int	double
if you need to use nsnumber you could just cast the double to int and then use the int to create your nsnumber

3388204
unsigned	short
in order to make it unsigned i have to choose bigger data type short and apply and operator with value 0x00ff

3388271
google-chrome	firefox
i want to show tooltip for individual li element for that i am using title attributes but it is working only in ie not n firefox and google-chrome what attribute should i use for these two browser

3388319
expression-blend	silverlight
i am a bit confused about the difference between silverlight and expression-blend

3388319
expression-blend	silverlight
meaning you can use silverlight without having to use expression-blend there is much demand for silverlight developers but i from what i know silverlight is pretty easy to grasp

3388321
unsigned	short
edit the and operator makes it unsigned since the sign bit is the first bit of the short and you copy the 8 bits holding the value of the byte to the last 8 bits of the short

3388332
width	height
you should then be able to specify width and height exactly and uniformly across all browsers

3388363
rss	feed
the problem lies in building my rss feed

3388372
put	get
i could manually add a virtual folder not application because i would need to access some sharepoint site s data to my sharepoint site in iis and manually edit site s web.config file to register my http module and add my custom configuration section as well either putting my dlls into gac or put them in the _app_bin so i don t have problems with cas but i don t think that s a good thing to do because this web application may get deployed in an environment where this shouldn t couldn t be possible

3388394
pascal	delphi
if your source code compiles on delphi 7 it will work as well with free pascal so

3388418
google-chrome	firefox
i did a simple test in both firefox and google-chrome and the title attribute on li is rendering as a tool tip for me

3388440
switching	screens
maybe this wasn t clear but with the template select box on the edit page screens you select one template in your current theme you can t just switching to another theme here

3388443
lapply	tapply
besides sapply there are also lapply tapply by aggregate and more in the base

3388446
min	max
if you were thinking of solving this is linq i do not believe it is possible unless you also had a list of all dates between the min and max date

3388474
switching	airplane
but when i switching the airplane mode to on the airplane mode checkbox

3388486
getter	setter
getter setter events add remove

3388486
getter	setter
i m not sure how well this measure works when dealing with a java bean which could well have a large number of getter and setter each dealing with a single property

3388493
range	max
then instead of using max make a method isinrange m m that checks whether a sub tree contains only elements in the range m m+1 ... m

3388566
versioning	upgrade
i ve just upgrade up to the latest versioning of activecollab 2.3.1 but i m having difficultly getting the svn integration working

3388647
hide	show	client-side	server-side
as to how to show only specific areas you can either do this server-side hide those panels that you don t want to see or client-side with jquery show only those divs that have class x

3388667
profiling	benchmarking
if you have other similar type code segments you could always profiling or put some timers around the code and run a benchmarking type test to see for yourself

3388691
public	protected
as i understand rnd is protected public field property in your base class so having it static will create random generator on first accessing of your person type

3388705
opera	firefox
this happens in firefox and opera most recent versions of both

3388796
implements	extends
public class testdao extends jpadaosupport implements itestdao

3388825
unsigned	short
now if you ve provided the actual code there is no difference between uint16 and uint32 since you ve defined them both as unsigned short

3388856
maven	pom.xml
how can i make maven do resource filtering on the file which is not specified as a resource but is in a config folder on the same level as the root pom.xml

3388901
width	height
the window is a specific width and height so the name of the car wraps to two lines and pushes everything down

3388964
ubuntu	opensuse
what os should i install opensuse ubuntu

implements	extends
all of clojure s persistent data structures implements interfaces which extends clojure.lang.persistentcollection

3389011
portrait	landscape
i m a web designer by nature accustomed to changing resolutions and font sizes but i m unsure how to design for the android platform without knowledge of screen sizes especially when the screen rotates from portrait mode to landscape

3389080
ubuntu	linux
you should use linux ubuntu will work fine and it has good documentation

3389080
folder	directory
that will put all the code in a folder in whatever directory you were working in follow whatever instructions you find in the readme in that folder

3389110
post	get
when i go to the page help all.pdf it generates a 0 byte pdf which i can save ok and i get the error message from the top of this post when i try to open it

3389123
mouse	keyboard
assuming that only keyboard and not mouse input is captured you could type the password out of order moving the cursor with the mouse

3389126
width	height
definitely avoid doing this if the bitmap s width x height x 4 45 mb give or take

3389203
width	height
in javascript you can get the height and width of the viewport and this will give you an idea of how big the user s window is

3389228
children	parent
basically i m trying to implement a design where each item has a parent that will be of one specific type and children that will be of a different type

3389228
children	parent
then itemb would have a parent of itema type and children all of itemc type

3389228
children	parent
itemc would have parent of itemb and children of itemd type

3389228
children	parent
i thought it would be neater to do this using generics to avoid unnecessary casts since i know what type the parent and children will be for each of my inherited classes

3389287
division	modulo
the modulo will give you the remainder of doing int division on a number

3389289
client-side	server-side
client-side event fires before server-side

3389320
mongoid	mongomapper
are mongomapper documents embedded docs so i could use mongoid for

3389339
children	parent
alternatively you could use the abstract class and a marker type system.void would be ideal but i don t think it would compile for the end cases and check for it from the parent children properties and throw an exception

3389353
google-chrome	firefox
i found a workaround using in the browser instead of appears to work in all three of internet explorer firefox and google-chrome

3389360
folder	dir
had the same issue in my case the cause was that the web.config file was missing in the virtual dir folder

3389367
children	parent
if i understand you right you are saying that itema never has a parent and itemd never has any children right

3389367
children	parent
to be honest i would probably just declare the separate classes with their own parent children properties of the right type

3389367
children	parent
the only thing you are repeating here is the parent and children property field

3389367
children	parent
unless of course that functionality needs access to the parent children â but then youâ re back to square one even in your solution.

3389411
128bit	64bit
anyone who konws when the library have no codec match download item for example my item encode by .aac 128bit and the library not support or at most .aac 64bit what happen would the player be

3389449
gif	png
simply set the terminal to gif or png or whatever then you get the images

3389458
public	protected
they re different than normal variables as they don t have the in front of them and can t have any visibility modifiers public protected private before them

3389518
boost	stl
boost qt the stl .

3389519
post	get
and all the get and post values are magically cleaned or removed so i don t need to worry about someone elses sql-injectable plugin

3389539
width	height
even when customizing the div where the image is injected the width and height of the div are overridden and set to 300x57

3389590
typedef	struct
i prefer to use typedef for the struct

3389634
subclass	abstract-class
make outboxmanager an abstract-class and provide a subclass per vendor

3389659
subtract	add
doubling a digit is trivial and if the result is greater than 10 you just subtract 10 and add a carry to the next digit

3389665
nsstring	nsdata
the value parameter can be only property list objects nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary

3389690
folder	directory
the source directory has two folder in it media and source

3389751
apache	nginx
alternatively there might be a way of getting nginx to restart itself on code change - it s certainly possible with apache and mod_wsgi

3389780
google-chrome	firefox
works in firefox and google-chrome iron

3389908
ienumerable	iqueryable
iqueryable implements ienumerable so when you call asenumerable you are changing the extension-methods being called from there on ie from the iqueryable -methods to the ienumerable -methods ie changing from linq to sql to linq to objects in this particular case

3389909
installation	upgrade
obviously if this is your only customer then you either need to accommodate their needs or convince them of the need to upgrade their .net installation

3389912
ienumerable	iqueryable
the problem is that an iqueryable what the statement is before the asenumerable call is also an ienumerable so that call is in effect a nop

3389935
put	get
probably not the most efficient answer but you could do a query before this one to get the number of entries in the table and then put that in the showposts numposts part of the query you have here

3389938
tabcontrol	tabitem
i m using the tabcontrol class in wpf and i ve noticed that the content of each tabitem has a default margin of 4 pixels on all sides

3389951
int	chars
you could split the strings by the space chars convert both parts to int and then use linq

3390025
hide	show
basically - at the beginning of the tellafriend function i ve looped through all of the elements of the table row tr with the class dn and used hide to hide it - then if there are still any missing values - they will show up again

3390046
public	protected
for each hash you would get all public members possibly protected ones too

3390066
disk	ram
additionally wikipedia says you can use the ram disk to access but again gives no reference to the implementation

3390067
jar	war
i include this jar along the gwt-servlet.jar in the web-inf lib of the war

these buffers are really just big 2d arrays each the width x height of your screen

3390096
wordpress	joomla
some of the most popular content management systems like drupal joomla and wordpress are built with php

3390105
hash	salt
once i ve generated a salt and hash the password using bcrypt etc would it be best to store the results as a string or as a byte array in the database

3390108
filtering	grouping
these are all essentially fairly similar - they are all displayed on users activity streams on the grouping pages that they are posted to on the user profiles of users who posted them and filtering in similar ways - show me everything that happened in the last 7 days for grouping x with the tag y

3390115
idictionary	ilist
the keyedcollection class is a hybrid between a collection based on the ilist generic interface and a collection based on the idictionary generic interface

3390200
hash	salt
if you use varchar either make sure the bytes are either valid characters or force the bytes to ascii before you save the hash and salt

3390214
profiling	benchmarking
as ever i d go for the clearest code until you have benchmarking profiling data to indicate that this really is a bottleneck

3390259
expander	grid
i would like to combine the two middle grid into an expander and see how that looks but just wrapping them into an expander is not possible since it can only have one child

3390262
mp3	ogg
i ve got a bunch of audio files let s say ogg or mp3 with metadata

3390274
width	margin
find out what the lowest resolution your customers use is and shave 50 or so pixels off that for scroll bars and a little margin and use that for your width

3390282
mp3	ogg
you take an existing mp3 or ogg client look at what library it uses and then write a binding for said library to r using the existing client as guide for that side -- and something like rcpp as a guide on the other side to show you how to connect c c++ libraries to r

3390384
fadein	fadeout
why not use jquery s built-in functions fadein and fadeout

3390446
rss	feed
i m working on making a modification to a site built with asp c# and one of the tasks was to add in the display of 2 rss feed - one from the site s internal blog and the other from the site s twitter account

3390484
hash	md5
the problem is that the same code on the same file gives different md5 hash results in each environment

3390484
hash	md5
it is the same code on each end and i am using python 2.6.5 for both windows linux environments when i run this on the same file in different environments i get md5 hash that do not match

3390547
google-chrome	firefox
i can t find a good way of doing this with firefox or google-chrome

3390553
boost	stl
templates and stl boost

3390581
folder	directory
turns out that you can put any jar file into the ext folder c program files java jdk1.6.0_21 jre lib ext and c program files java jre6 lib ext and java will automatically considered it part of the classpath check it out ext directory java glossary

3390621
codeigniter	cakephp
two of the most popular frameworks that i m aware of are codeigniter and cakephp

3390705
hash	md5
most md5 sha1 libraries return hash base64 encoded in which case varchar would suffice

3390763
midi	osc
if html5 is an option you could try to generate osc events using websockets and convert them to midi signals using a server proxy

3390773
children	parent
you can do a depth-first search over the tree without needing to cache the minimum and maximum values for each subtree in a single pass but you have to be careful as comparing the values between and parent and its children is not enough

3390816
versioning	upgrade
you should upgrade if possible or find a versioning of the massivecoupon package that is compatible with python 2.4

3390826
filesystems	hfs
the resource fork is implemented in all of the filesystems used for system drives on the macintosh mfs hfs and hfs plus

3390826
filesystems	ntfs
the ntfs filesystems provides applications the ability to create alternate data streams of information

3390849
hash	md5
a token would be fine i would use an md5 or sha1 hash for it

3390863
post	get
you could also redirect them to a special site where they have to click a button spezified in the mail to verify their identidy or let them enter a pin from the mail so you can be sure not to send all critical data per get but per post important in a public place

3390913
getter	setter
here s my class hierarchy lombok generated constructors getter setter ommitted for brevity

3390967
mvp	presenter
i can t help but look at this problem and think that a mvp presenter per view not screen is a more elegant solution

3391004
mouseleave	mouseenter
in parts of our program we slide it out based on a mouseenter event and slide it back in on a mouseleave event however we are currently using a 3rd party library s treeview for this which i have been tasked with replacing

3391004
mouseleave	mouseenter
the scrollbar does not fire mouseenter or mouseleave for the control and that makes using mouseenter mouseleave for sliding out the control unusable since the user can not use the scrollbar

3391004
mouseleave	mouseenter
in the previous question i was given the advice to use spy++ and attempt to attach to wndproc to handle mouseenter mouseleave for the scrollbar

3391011
opera	firefox
both statements are true for firefox 3.6.7 and opera 10.60

3391024
pull	push
just replace git pull with git svn rebase and git push with git svn dcommit and you can actually keep 90 of your git workflow and still be talking to an svn server

3391034
equals	gethashcode
the benefit of doing that is that you can use the struct as the key to a dictionary the equals and gethashcode methods should already work adequately

3391049
put	get
as such what i really want to do is make a call to the database get data back and put the data in the appropriate locations in my existing rails friendly mysql database

3391062
client-side	server-side
i just don t get this javascript based serialization server-side when javascript runs in the browser and is client-side

3391063
hide	show
if the user touches the button which moves along with the user scroll i am planning to show or hide the nav and tab bar

3391087
width	height
i maintain a small perl library that extracts width height from images for people who want that functionality without using a larger more generalized library

3391180
width	height
but there might be a default width and height

3391180
width	height
i think that the width in pixels of the metafile is the 5th cardinal of the file and the height in pixels the 6th cardinal

3391202
yslow	pagespeed
3 hour expiry might not be enough time for the yslow pagespeed stuff and they might complain about it

3391209
put	get
and for some reason it just refuses to simply put that base64 back into the byte ...there must be some other way to get it to work.

3391214
backgrounding	multitasking
however after killing the process from multitasking running in the backgrounding the app tries to resume from the point where it left and it freezes which means i cant start the app anymore

3391269
hash	salt
if an attacker is able to obtain the hash and salt from the database using sql injection or an insecure backup then he has to find the plain text by brute forcing it

3391269
hash	salt
john the ripper is commonly used to break salt password hash

3391277
public	protected
remember - public protected and private are controls on default visibility nothing more

3391293
metaclass	subclassing
if the answer involves metaclass note that class a is itself a subclassing of another class -- django.db.models.model -- with a pretty elaborate metaclass.

3391342
awt	swing
it is able to run java code under the clr including some awt swing support

3391356
chown	chmod
if you have a script or a command you could put it in bin and set the appropiate owner and permisions using chmod and chown

3391362
rss	feed
i want to write a shell script to get an image from an rss feed

3391373
width	height
exactly as he said i had to bind my top level container layout width and height to scene.width and scene.height

3391379
width	height
yeah i know it suppose to get that automatically if no height and width defined in the container where you re placing a user control

3391384
nsstring	nsdata
on the objective-c side a combination of nsdata and nsstring

3391385
width	height
setting a font size for a text so that it fits a static width height div best or splitting text with images and tables to screens yet still i think your case is not worth messing with javascript

3391386
children	parent
if i load the entire table with fetch join on the parent and children a single select loads all the records and i can happily traverse the tree

3391386
children	parent
i m just trying to figure out a way to support a simple nested item s list where i can retrieve any parent node and its children with a single select

3391394
width	height
i know it can be done by overriding onsizechanged and manually modifying the new height width but that causes flicker since it is resized once before the event is called to a size not matching the aspect ratio and then resized again to the correct aspect ratio

3391403
width	height
just don t set the width and height properties

3391403
width	height
it will then take on whatever width and height its child requires

3391406
post	put
i put the stuff i learnt in a blog post which hopefully you will find useful

3391412
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu the apt-file command will tell you what package you can install to get a particular file

3391412
ubuntu	debian
if you re going to compile a c or c++ program on debian or ubuntu start by installing the build-essential package

3391413
width	height
also the code does not determine where it is the best width or height to use for splitting the matrix into subranges for x or y coordinates according to the matrix size

3391413
width	height
it just uses the same static subrange sizes of 16 for both coordinates but it could be conveniently any other small power of 2 but a non power of 2 would slow down the int indexof int int and int offsetof int int internal methods independantly for both coordinates and up to the maximum width or height of the matrix.ideally the compact method should be able to determine the best fitting sizes

3391413
int	double
but this code shows how you assign non-zero values and reallocate the data array for additional non-zero subranges and then how you can optimize with compact after assignments have been performed using the setat int i int j double value method the storage of this data when there are duplicate subranges that may be unified within the data and reindexed at the same position in the subrangepositions array

3391413
int	double
the improvement is visible in the double getat int int method

3391413
multiplying	subtract
however if get access is very fast and set is quite fast compact may be very slow if there are lots of common subranges to compress for example when subtract a large non-sparse randomly-filled matrix with itself or multiplying it by zero it will be simpler and much faster in that case to reset the trie by instanciating a new one and dropping the old one

3391413
factors	matrix
tries can avoid all collisions and can then warranty to save linear o n time to o 1 time in the worst cases where n is the number of possible collisions which in case of sparse matrix may be up to the number of non-default-value cells in the matrix up to the total number of size of the matrix times a factors proportional to the hashing filling factors for a non-sparse full matrix

3391416
button	checkbox
note i dont want the click function because i use another button to tick or untick 20 checkbox at the same time for example

3391427
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve also been able to disable page caching in ie and firefox but cannot do so in safari and google-chrome

youtube	vimeo
thing is when i researched the vimeo and youtube html5 players i couldn t detect how they were handling analytics â so i m wondering if they have a better implementation

3391641
width	height
to keep proportions the same you need to multiply both the width and the height by the same scaling factor

3391641

in the code below i ve added two additional constraints the resulting thumbnail width or height will always be 1 and the scaling factor will will always be 1 so that the thumbnail isn t larger than the original

3391891
width	height
i am now setting the cropper s width s and height vars to defined values that fit my website structure

3391951
implements	extends
maybe this was somehow more efficient to implements or maybe they were thinking that as the calendar class is supposed to be extensible to any calendar so if you wanted to create say mayancalendar extends calendar that you could then define new constants for katun and baktun and so forth and it would work with the existing set and get functions

3391986
apache	nginx
i have nginx as a reverse proxy for apache using mod_wsgi to run django

3391986
apache	nginx
what causes this nginx apache django

3391986
apache	nginx
edit 2 the problem is definitely either with nginx or the interaction between nginx and apache

3392286
comparator	icomparer
check out the two parameter overload of binarysearch which takes an icomparer as the second parameter - you then need to create a small class that inherits from icomparer that will compare the names of two of your track objects and pass an instance of this comparator into the binarysearch

3392294
put	get
you do not necessarily lose flexibility as you can present automatically created information at the template level for example a picture named like the year or the decade to be put in the page or link human generated one to a given page with views for example you could have nodes of type year description that you tag with the same taxonomy you use for events so that when you filter with the taxonomy term 1945 you will get a list of nodes events and one node year description in your result and the template views will take care of using different node types in different way

3392324

3392545
post	get
the problem is that i have not been able to find a way to get the comments for a specific post if i have only the post url and the blogid

3392545
post	get
the postid cannot be reliably scraped from the html as far as i can tell and it seems like the postid is required to get the comments for a single post

3392545
post	get
also the get most recent post for a blogid api call is only helpful if the post is one of the most recent 10 or 15 so if it is a slightly older post i probably cannot use that option

3392572
post	get
i have tried capturing the ajax requests thinking that i could get the raw request once and just have to change like a pagenum post parameter or something to load in a new page but it turns out they do some funky stuff with asp that has some very long hex string post parameters that change on each request

3392771
post	get
which action does the form use get or post

3392771

width	margin
set a margin and remove the float width on #content like so

3393056
post	get

3393128
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
also not sure if this is an option but your app as an oob app will not be restricted to security checks in clientaccesspolicy.xml or crossdomain.xml

3393128

calloc is faster than malloc + memset because calloc knows that the mmap d pages are pre-zeroed and memset forces the allocation of physical ram

3393489
put	get	put	preflight
but in my case i use basic authentication which is trickier because i need to put the credentials into the xmlhttprequest directly and that produces preflight requests in firefox replacing get by options and my grails application doesn t deal with it

3393499
post	get
you should be checking the http response status code sent by the server to determine whether to send a get or repeat the post

i was wondering if in the width and height attributes i could specify width and height as percentages

3396510
width	height
width 50 and height 50 sets the width and height attributes to half of the parent element s width and height if i m not mistaken

3396510
width	height
also setting just width or height should set the width or height to the percentage of the parent element if you re using percents

3396513
width	height
just make sure you take off any height width 50 attributes first

3396515
hash	md5
the database is mysql with md5 hash passwords

3396516
width	height
given the lack of information regarding the original image size specifying percentages for the width and height would result in highly erratic results

3396526
put	get
i tried to put them in a role but get an error that +attr notation is not supported in roles

3396553
hash	md5
with md5 hash passwords

3396604
children	parent
the dataobjects are organized in a tree-structure so each has a parent and children

3396604
children	parent
how can i validate if a chosen name is unique under the children of a dataobjects parent

3396693
hash	md5
if the md5 are unsalted then you will likely be able to read the weak or only moderately strong user passwords in plaintext by entering the hash into a online rainbow table for example

3396733

range	max
now pick a random number r in the range 0 to max end

3396805
keydown	keyup	keydown	mousedown	keydown	mouseup	keyup	mousedown	keyup	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
keypress keyup and keydown are analagous to respectively click mouseup and mousedown

3396811
serializable	deserialization
you can use the xmlserializer class and markup your class properties with attributes to control the serializable and deserialization of the objects

3396849
uitableview	uisearchbar
i ve got a uisearchbar on my uitableview and a method -finishsearching which looks like this

3397029
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a newer versioning of gcc

it would appear that this link works between separate firefox windows and even between firefox and google-chrome

3397157
integer	unsigned
i have a raw image where each pixel corresponds to a 16 bits unsigned integer

3397188
versioning	upgrade	tex-live	xelatex

3397222
bash	tcsh
however i am not really familiar with the tcsh and i have my own set-up in bash so right now i have the following lines at the end of my .cshrc file

3397243
typedef	struct
if you can make the call and are still getting an error you might need to do a typedef and or struct and declare populate the rsa object before using it

3397322
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
and you ll see what the different modes do - try it with a variety of input images png with alpha png without alpha bmp gif and jpeg

m n is used to denote a many-to-many relationship m objects on the other side related to n on the other while 1 n refers to a one-to-many relationship 1 object on the other side related to n on the other

3397416
mouseover	mouseout
basically instead of the current abrupt background image transition i would like it to fade in smoothly on mouseover and mouseout

3397461
client-side	server-side
this data can be stored in the database and pulled out using the server side language of your choice or it could be automatically generated based on directory structure using server-side or client-side scripts or you could manually code them into each of your pages

3397475
serializable	deserialization
but when i change my jpa implementation to hibernate i get serializable deserialization exception on gwt layer when i pass entity beans but it is okay on eclipselink jpa

3397489
onclick	onsubmit	submit	submission
if it s as part of the onclick event for a submit button or the onsubmit event for a form the usual cause is that you ve forgotten to prevent the form from submission normally - so the page refreshes and the ajax call is lost

3397506
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the topbar is part of the uinavigationcontroller not the uitabbarcontroller you can hide it by putting the following in your viewwillappear method

3397546
put	get
currently i get the datarepresentation from the pdfpage put it into an nsimage then get the tiffrepresentation of the nsimage put it into a cgimagesource and then get the cgimage out of the source

3397546
put	get
however when i try to put the pdf data directly into the cgimagesource even though that appears to work when i get the cgimage out it is always null

3397548
bazaar	cvs	bazaar	git
you can get eclipse plugins for virtually any vcs you like whether that s git or bazaar subversion or cvs

i have an application just a test which uses mef and prism

3397634
mef	prism
so in a mef prism app where would you define this instance which can be used by all modules

3397662
children	parent
now i want to handle the dragdrop event of both controls in the parent and not let the children handle it themselves

3397665
onresize	onload
i am thinking on using the scrollto function of jquery and call it onload and onresize

3397668
jquery	jqmodal
for display the modal i used jquery and jqmodal plug-in

3397681
addition	multiplication
for example instead of doing a costly multiplication operation you can perform the same calculation using only addition and bit-shifts which is a huge time-saver

3397705
subtract	add	mktime	strtotime
never use math like 60 60 24 7 to add subtract days because of daylight time saving use strtotime or mktime instead

3397738
children	parent
one type puts a seed in the middle and creates other spheres in a tree like structure - in this case the connecting lines between parent and their children should be drawn

3397772
shutil	copytree
look at shutil in the python docs specifically the copytree command

3397799
width	height
you need to set width and height in style attribute of v shape element to 0px

3397801
division	multiplication
there is one special thing about the shift operators - you can use them for a fast division multiplication with powers of 2

3397808
tinyint	varchar
forget about choosing between int and varchar i would say you should also think whether you should have int or tinyint these consideration makes a lot of difference

3397817
inherited	subclassing
a subclassing is a full class that extends a parent or more than one but in my experience multiple inherited should be avoided if it can be

3397839
x86	64bit
on 32 bit windows 7 you should get c program files on 64bit c program files x86

3397845
post	get
i think you ll have to make your own custom query to get the post by year

3397851

3398063
rtp	sip
it offers high-level api so you don t have to deal with sip or rtp by yourself

3398089
post	get
finally if you can manage to reproduce this consistently and send us a sample post it on the activereports support forum and one of us will help you get it resolved

3398098
cos	atan2
for some reason for var i in math console.log i doesn t show the expected tan cos atan2 e pi in javascript

3398126
stdout	stderr
this outputs the line count on stderr and the sorted output on stdout

3398133
rss	feed
so how i think it works is that each supplier provides an rss feed which the comparison website connects to

3398133
rss	feed
each product has its own unique code provided by the manufacturer and this is supplied in a standard tag in the rss feed

3398133
rss	feed
for example book publishers may provide rss feed containing the blurb on the back of each book the isbn publishers name authors title obviously rrp genre fact fiction and some other useful information all in tags such as isbn isbn here isbn

3398133
rss	feed
comparison websites which sell books may filter these books by genre author etc and display them how they want using an xsl stylesheet the rss feed being provided in xml

3398186
post	get
if you give the attribute method get in your form tag the request will not be a post but a get

3398278
firefox	safari
i m trying to use an banner rotator which works on firefox safari and ie8

3398279
rss	feed
the reason the store sites don t provide the rss feed is because they hate comparison sites

3398310
wordpress	joomla
i have found that many applications available online wordpress joomla and many other are very poorly organized in this field poorer than what i do in any case

3398327
websphere	ibm

and show your dialog as the flash reloads when you hide unhide it and goofs

3398378
google-chrome	firefox
now i need to use the command inserthtml which works perfect in google-chrome and firefox but of course it doesn t work in internet explorer

3398389
google-chrome	safari
far as i know the only browsers that currently support these functions are google-chrome and safari

3398390
google-chrome	firefox
i had some trouble getting facebook connect to work with the new javascript sdk authentication methods - it worked fine in google-chrome and firefox but not ie8.0

3398391
udp	tcp
if you want to run your own protocol you will need to create a new socket with tcp or udp on a specific port

3398393
bash	tcsh
even if that is possible in the background without getting a prompt it would still break any tcsh commands which would then be attempted to execute under bash

3398403
free	malloc
so the kind of memory leak that we donâ t have is in the old world you used to malloc some memory and then forget to do a free or add ref and forget to do a release or whatever the pair is

3398424
strlen	memmove
now to your code - the line memmove result - 1 result strlen result + 1

3398430
post	get
i believe the problem is that you re using the post shortcut method while specifying get variables appended to the url

3398445
post	get
as mentioned in zeeshanhirani s blog post this only works if and only if you have change-enabled proxies which will get created if all of your properties are declared virtual

3398461
qabstractitemmodel	qabstractlistmodel
do i even have to use qabstractitemmodel or does qabstractlistmodel work the exact same way

3398488
min	max
select count from gaevent a where speed min and speed max

3398494
httprequest	httpresponse
the problem i wind up with is some implementations of this interface may not be using an httprequest or httpresponse so it may be passing in an httpresponse or something totally different to that getresponsedata method such as a webclient object somehow...so since i don t know how it s going to be implemented i want this to be generic somehow

3398518
subtract	add
just add 1 5 of the next element and subtract 1 5 of the first element in the current window at every step

3398550
division	modulo
i think that what you might want to use is the modulo which will give you the rest of the division

3398568
for-loop	loops
my problem is that by wrapping it all up in a for-loop like this in between the pdf and dev.off functions is that the for-loop doesn t seem to wait for ggplot to do its thing and blazes through its loops very quickly and outputs an invalid pdf

3398575
inherited	properties
...which would accept webresponse fileresponse ftpresponse and httpresponse and any other types which inherited from webresponse as valid parameters--and would let you access the properties methods of webresponse to manipulate the response

3398595
qstring	qbytearray
i think you re losing data when converting from qstring to qbytearray

3398597
children	parent
the specified parent record and all its single-level children

3398624
parent-child	one-to-many
hi i m trying to map a one-to-many parent-child relationship in nhibernate using xml mapping

3398624
children	parent
easy enough if the parent class instances store the collection of children in a list but i want to use a dictionary

3398625
oncreate	onstart
i want to get the size of a view that is in my activity but i am not able to get that information in any of the activity lifecycle callbacks oncreate onstart onresume

3398625
put	get
at what point are views drawn and is there a callback i can put my code so i can get the size of the view

3398651
width	height
the outline is not actually a part of the box it does not count in any way towards the width or height of a box

3398703
width	height
maybe you got confused between size and width height attributes btw i got confused at first when you said field

3398703
int	chars
in that case its value refers to the int number of chars

3398703
width	height
now in case of the dimension attributes width and height

3398719
free	malloc
since i want to create request structs in different places once using literals on the client side and once using chars that i read from a socket on the server side i was wondering if there is a function to make sure that i don t try to free the literals while still allowing me to free the message i have created using a malloc

3398731
jasmine	qunit
i ve been doing my unit testing with jquery qunit but i recently started using jasmine and i recommend it 200

3398751
width	height
using padding to pad-out the correct height and width gives mixed results in different browsers

3398764
setinterval	settimeout
instead return a status to your ajax request that the file doesn t exist yet and then have it wait using setinterval or settimeout and try again after so many seconds

3398774
opera	firefox
in opera it is 1 in firefox 2 in ie some large number

3398785
width	height
you can specify width height on absolutely positioned elements so the css would look something like this

3398793
calloc	malloc
note that it is not only string literals that would cause the problem any pointer to data not dynamically allocated on the heap by malloc or calloc would fail so simply detecting if a char points to a string literal in c even if it could be done portably would not help

3398795
put	get
the same providers give their sms service for free when used from their website maybe because they get to put ads there

3398827
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
presently i validate on upload for 100kb and bmp gif jpg and png

3398839
hibernate	gilead
using gilead formerly known as hibernate4gwt for hibernate integration

3398839
hibernate	gilead
second while the two first integration strategies will work with any jpa provider hibernate is the only jpa implementation currently supported by gilead but openjpa and eclipselink supports is planned

3398860
filtering	grouping
it sounds like you may need to use views arguments to filtering your results if you are pulling different grouping based on a single view

3398887
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem	qlistwidget	qgraphicsscene	qlistwidget	qgraphicsitem
i need to drag from a qlistwidget or something similar and drop on a qgraphicsscene and create a subclass of qgraphicsitem at the drop location

3398890
yslow	pagespeed
you can use tools like yslow and pagespeed both are firefox extensions to get a feel on how fast performance wise for your site

3398890
yslow	pagespeed
there are other things you can do to increase front-end performance other than reducing amount of data both yslow and pagespeed will tell you those

3398919
cos	sin
also sin two_pi cos two_pi will not neccessarily return precise 0.0 and 1.0 values

3398932
gdal	ogr
look into gdal ogr bindings

3398966
folder	directory
then i looked inside my home folder and found the following directory

3398981
folder	directory
user can create documents and folder they don t have to be real folder directory

3398998
width	height
if i have a table element i can make the content scrollable with some javascript fun including accouting for the scroll bar using the width by making the thead fixed height and the tbody fixed height then setting scrolling to auto on the tbody

3398998
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox but in google-chrome the heights on the thead tbody are ignored and the whole table grows vs scrolling as intended

3399006
getter	setter
either make _kind public and remove getter and setter or use binary serialization

3399019
calloc	malloc
i cannot catch how to use calloc instead of malloc

3399060
filtering	grouping
the sorter will reorder products into different grouping based on filtering and selecting

3399105
width	height
you should not rely on size width height attributes but instead focus on semantics when doing the markup

3399108
serializable	deserialization
i was able to get valid serializable and deserialization with project designed like so

3399135
oncreate	onstart
it should work in oncreate onstart and onresume after you ve instantiated your layouts

3399154
stdout	stderr
you re indeed ignoring the stdout and stderr streams of the process returned by runtime#exec

3399212
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade the quartz versioning from 1.5.3 which is on the jboss to the currently latest 1.8.3

3399224
firefox	safari
the below code works like a charm in firefox and safari but fails in ie

3399229
children	parent
if i guessed the markup wrong then you can adjust it using the parent find children and siblings functions in jquery

3399290
sfdoctrineguard	sfguard
if you re using sfguard or sfdoctrineguard

3399368
punctuation	words
the problem i am facing now is that when punctuation is at the end of a words it can sometimes be wrapped to the next line

3399370
put	get
put the database id in the session and get the rest from the database

3399383
bash	zsh
several shells bash ksh zsh already have means for tcp access

3399414
put	get
you should also call suprocess.process in the main thread to get the sub-process started and be able to obtain its .pid to put in the list and pass the resulting process object to the babysitter thread which waits for it and when it s done reports and removes it from the list

3399430
lisp	scheme
this is a comprehensive account of the semantics and the implementation of the whole lisp family of languages namely lisp scheme and related dialects

rescale images to fit in a given width or height keeping or not the

3399456
gif	png
images in the gif jpeg and png

3399480
free	malloc
if you re just trying to make sure that malloc ed memory is free you can call

3399491
width	height
you can use safari.application.openbrowserwindow to open a window but i haven t been able to find the documentation to specify a url or height width of the window

3399509
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql support offset that is usually used with a limit clause

3399562
width	height
create a simplepanel with height 0px and the width you want then assign it a style that say its border are black and have a size of 2px

3399584
client-side	server-side
you could use cookies client-side or session variables server-side or you could write to a file for longer-term storage

3399587
facebook	fbconnect
in groupon they are using fbconnect to access their facebook application based on the login success they are allowing me to access their deals

3399587
facebook	fbconnect
i had used fbconnect package to post some message to user s wall using my own facebook application api

3399596
setinterval	settimeout
the return value of setinterval and settimeout are just integers used internally to reference the timeouts so storing an integer with .data isn t a problem

3399649
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t in firefox google-chrome and i don t think it should in ie

3399716
width	height
for example you can bind the width and height of an hbox container to the scene height and width so that whenever scene resizes the hbox container resizes as well

3399768
inherited	subclassing
inherited implies a specific kind of relationship between classes and subclassing

3399768
inherited	properties
you can build view model base classes and inherited from them but you can t really meaningfully do that with views because views are built through composition and not by implementing properties and methods

3399768
textblock	itemscontrol
in the view i have have a datatemplate that lays out the hyperlink and textblock inside a dockpanel and the datatemplate for the view model contains an itemscontrol that s bound to the commandlinks collection in my view model

3399789
aggregate-functions	sum
aggregate-functions such as sum work against the set of data defined by the group by clause

3399816
multiplying	add
the sum peratiorn first multiplying the columns than add

3399824
qobject	qlist
otherwise you could perhaps create a mix of qobject and qlist that can emit signals to notify xmodel of changes but i think the first approach is better

3399834
maya	3dsmax
or photoshop 3dsmax maya zbrush

3399851
mousemove	mouseup
what handler s would i override -- click mouseup mousemove etc -- and on which dom elements

3399888
ant	maven
use something like ant or maven

3399907
mef	prism
take a look at mef and prism if you are looking for good wpf application design

3399936
implements	extends
one last thing i d like to try to avoid implements a new control that extends treeview

3399978
post	get
get loads and when i save post prompts for login which continually loops

3400004
put	get
the get and subsequent possible put are wrapped in a transaction to ensure atomicity

3400086
folder	directory
i am running using code blocks on windows also strange but the permissions of the output directory are all changed after the crash and the folder files are all set to read only

3400117
minimum	max
you can add password salt minimum max pass length complexity options pass attempts etc

3400198
google-chrome	firefox
and this in other browsers tested firefox google-chrome

3400227
printf	strlen
a string is just an array of char s so all you need to do is loop from 0 to strlen str -1 and use printf or something similar to format each character as decimal hexadecimal

3400232
google-chrome	firefox
the iphone does not have any problem rendering it nor do regular browsers ie8 google-chrome firefox etc

3400252
ocp	principles
using an enum for the parameter violates the ocp principles

3400254
stopwatch	dispatchertimer
my debug code simply prints out the value of the stopwatch object every time the dispatchertimer ticks

3400261
twitter	bit.ly	twitter	myspace
so i m extending a social media class that i have that works with twitter tumblr posterous and bit.ly already to work with myspace

3400275
dictionary	map
this particular dictionary doesn t work too well but the general idea is to map out the pattern formed by the letters

3400292
stdout	stderr
i ve tried the suggestions here redirecting stdout and stderr to files adding a vfprint option adding an -xcheck jni option but to no avail

3400321
children	parent
that will return all children of the root s parent

3400325
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome and firefox

3400369
hide	show
depending on what i click true or false this will cause my table to show or hide accordingly

3400420
multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication	addition	multiplication
and there are two obvious ways to convert one to another first is to convert it into integer first and get the result not interesting way second is to implement own multiplication and addition in base-3 and compute the result multiplying digit values to respective power of two straightforward and heavy

3400434
mouseleave	mouseenter
however you can create one by updating a flag at mouseenter and mouseleave -- which is where brian driscoll s suggestion of .hover comes in

3400435
implements	extends
by to extends spainpersonname from personname do you mean make spainpersonname implements or inherit from personname

3400455
width	height
actually if you ve already organized everything into layouts then you might be able to just bind the top level layout container s width and height to the scene.width and scene.height

3400455
width	height
i don t think top level layout controls are managed by anything so you may be safe just setting width and height of the layout control directly

3400455
width	height
if that doesn t work then you might have success binding the layoutinfo width and height

3400466
firefox	safari
local testing showed no problems ie firefox safari all ok

3400466
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
once i move to a hosted test ie firefox and safari all display as intended but google-chrome offsets all the buttons right about 8-10 pixels

cpu	affinity	cpu	processors	affinity	processors
generally you have to change the cpu affinity because a process can migrate between processors cpu affinity linux journal 2003

3400490
affinity	processors
to specify processors affinity for a thread use the setthreadaffinitymask function

3400490
affinity	processors
you can possibly check if the issue mentioned in msdn is the reason for your problem by specifying a processors affinity for your process by calling your executable using the start command

3400518
cpu	affinity
now if you want to force an application on a specific core you can manually set the cpu affinity

the second problem was to actually move all the static methods from a superclass to subclassing this is a cludgy form of inherited after all

3401063
glassfish	weblogic
the byte code manipulation originally was done dynamically when classes loaded but i ran into some class loading problems in glassfish and weblogic and decided to implement static bytecode manipulation

3401080
superclass	subclassing
but can t you declare each of the types to be a subclassing of another type and have that superclass type as the declared type of your object

3401108
put	get
and if the 1px-wide empty cell on the right is a problem i can always put another one on the left to get it symmetrical and less visually annoying but as a matter of fact with a 0-border-spacing on the table and a 0-padding on each cell the 1px-wide empty cell is actually not visible...

3401121
pull	push
it doesn t really make sense to pull them out of the class escape them then push them back in

3401151
atof	strtod
atof strtod might be the fastest way to deal with it if the string is already in the memory

3401151
disk	ram
modern operating systems usually get in the way especially if the file is larger than ram you will end up swapping code since the system will treat your already stored on disk data as swappable

3402182
disk	ram
on rackspace the only way to add disk space dynamically is by also doubling ram and monthly cost which isn t necessary

3402236

by default the layout is configured for the landscape orientation so in the case that the app starts in portrait mode i need to take extra action to configure the views properly for display in portrait

3402401
portrait	landscape
the problem here is that it always returns portrait even if the app is starting in landscape

3402405
min	max
using this you could then do what you want min max random alternate min and max or whatever

3402415
int	chars
most of these answers explain what n does which is to print nothing and to write the number of chars printed thus far to an int variable but so far no one has really given an example of what use it has

3402490
trie	tree
if auto-completion is needed when a partial word has been entered a prefix tree trie may be used

3402500
pull	push
there s a pretty fundamental difference push vs pull

3402558
post	get
if the exception is not being caught by your catch blocks you should make sure you have a top-level exception handler around your startup code and also application.dispatcherunhandledexception then once you ve caught the exception post back with a stack trace and i m sure you ll get an answer quickly

3402575
xslt	xquery
if so you can use the collection function in xslt or xquery to point to a directory that contains the xml files

3402575
xslt	xquery
using either the xslt or xquery below

opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
whenever i setup firefox or google-chrome or opera to use the proxy on localhost 8000 there are no connections made to the proxy and i can no longer connect to any page though that is probably because it isn t connection to the proxy

3402905
setinterval	settimeout
i find passing strings to settimeout and setinterval just leads to problems

3402942
setinterval	settimeout
so always use a function reference withing settimeout setinterval

3402949
setinterval	settimeout
also use settimeout instead of setinterval so you can get rid of the global variable

3402952
primefaces	richfaces
which one is better to use if i have choice between richfaces and primefaces

3403131
post	get
i post via ajax and get a return value which i then want to insert into an input text field - note there are many similar forms on the page hence the use of .parent

3403162
equals	gethashcode
but assuming it s linq to objects you just need to override the equals and gethashcode methods in the types involved

3403165
onchange	onblur
otherwise the code you posted should update the contents of b though obviously you d need to do this in response to an onchange or onblur event on the input field

3403202
subtraction	addition
from binary to ternary would be slightly more complicated as ternary addition and probably subtraction would be required working on that

3403240
prepare	execute
rather than create a new sql statement in each call of the loop try and prepare the sql statement outside of the loop and execute that prepare statement with parameters inside the loop

3403244

integer	unsigned
one very basic optimization while leaving the table structure as a whole untouched would be to convert the mask field to an unsigned integer data type thereby saving many calls to conv

3403550
yslow	pagespeed
next would be to use firebug pagespeed yslow available as firefox extensions to find out optimizations in you resulting html css and javascript

3403594
int	chars
each code page maps a member of an abstract chars set onto an int to represent its position in the set

3403652

primefaces	richfaces
richfaces is more developed and tested generally since primefaces came out later than rf

3403758
nhibernate	queryover
nhibernate 3 out later this year will have full linq support as well as another type-safe api called queryover

3403811
int	double
possibly the simplest way is to accept a float double cast it to an int then test to see if the conversion modified the value

3403870
cvs	svn
and if it possible to check out from cvs to svn it would be even better

3403882
subtraction	addition
maybe some hexadecimal addition subtraction

3403889

3403928
button	checkbox
you can create text fields checkbox button etc

3403936
range	minimum
at minimum just to hold 2 billion 4-byte integers would be 8 gb unless you can make some simplifying assumptions about the possible range of the values you currently list as 1 and 2 - if they will fit within a byte or a short then you can use smaller int variables which will be worth the trouble for a data set of this size

3403973
dictionary	map
and a small dictionary map for replacing some of the elements in the above array

3404020
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml.html	beautifulsoup
for scraping try to use a library that can handle such html tag soup like lxml which has a html parser as well as a dedicated html package in lxml.html or beautifulsoup you will also find that these libraries also contain other stuff that makes scraping working with html easier aside from being able to handle ill-formed documents getting information out of forms making hyperlinks absolute using css selectors...

3404064
hide	show
but how can i hide after is show

i can see stuff like font-family list-style-type or text-indent but there s no margin or padding as far as i can see and definitively there s no float at all

3404301
super	abstract
the only alternative i can imagine is to pass the results of otherwise abstract methods to the super constructor in subclasses

3404304
fast-forward	merge
alternatively they can try git rebase --pull which would fast-forward if there weren t any changes in their repository or rebase their branch on top of re-written commits we want to avoid merge as it would keep pre-rewrite comits forever

the trick to manipulating and comparing dates and times in php is to store date time values in an integer variable and to use the mktime date and strtotime functions

3404369
superclass	subclassing
the superclass constructor runs before the subclassing constructor so the overriding method in the subclassing will be invoked before the subclassing constructor has run

3404382
put	get
i have a script that creates a list of numbers and i want to remove all numbers from the list that are not whole numbers i.e have anything other than zero after the decimal point however python creates lists where even whole numbers get .0 put on the end and as a result i cant tell them apart from numbers with anything else

3404785
listview	gridview
i have a nested gridview that is placed inside a listview

3404869
for-loop	loops
is the for-loop or the foreach loops the only option

junit	testng
i know this might be a strange argument but if i were you i d scan through some job adds and see which framework does the industry in your area country favour for example i m going for junit because of that i mean sure i could learn testng it might turn out to be better but what good would it do to me if all the employers require junit knowledge

3419393
accessor	properties
the object inside the nsmutablearray is kvc compliant for the properties nodename since i ve implemented the proper accessor

3419410
width	height
if you replace them by their src attribute without specifying width height elsewhere best would be css or having them readily available then the hovered box img element will collapse into a smaller or no box until the image has been loaded far enough for the browser to know the correct dimensions of the image to resize the box which may affect other elements being adjusted to the image

3419467
for-loop	arrays
are you modifying mipawidth between when the arrays is instantiated and when you begin the for-loop

the construct sends make s stdout to fd 3 and make s stderr to stdout

3419628
stdout	stderr
grep then reads from the previous command s stdout removes the offending line and sends its stdout to stderr

3419635
drive	createfile

3419781
subtract	add
in the array this would be 0 - 6 so you would need to add or subtract 2 to get to the value of the index you want

3419783
free	malloc
is the memory being allocated with malloc in a library that you are not recompiling and then free in freshly compiled code

3419783

pick your battles but i d ask for the person to clarify the naming convention seeing that they ve suggested using the same convention for one-to-many and many-to-many relationships

3419898
for-loop	arrays
also you should probably use a for-loop to iterate through the arrays

3419909

i understand that i can change what interface orientations are supported but if i want the landscape view to be entirely different or somewhat different than the portrait view how do i code for it

3420048
short	base
short version - you can t really avoid rounding and other representation errors when you re trying to represent base 10 numbers in base 2 ie using a float or a double to represent a decimal number

3420115
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
i don t want to define the myobject properties separately on each subclassing since then i lose the advantage of inherited

3420123
portrait	landscape
i understand that you can choose what orientations to support but if i want my landscape orientation to be somewhat different from my portrait how do i code for it

3420160
inherited	properties
you should know that the hasownproperty method checks only if the properties physically exist on the object own properties but we have also inherited properties for that case we can use the in operator for example

3420160
inherited	properties
as you can see obj inherited from test.prototype and the a properties is not an own properties but it is available through the prototype chain

instead you declare constructors in the subclassing and have them chain to the appropriate constructors in the immediate superclass via an explicit super ... call .

3420239
super	implements
but i can recommend the tool autohotkey autohotkey.com which makes implements these tasks super simple

3420250
configobj	configparser
which is better for creating a settings file for python programs the built-in module configparser or the independent project configobj

3420290
quicksort	mergesort
with a nice sorting algorithm like quicksort or mergesort you ll be able to select time slices

3420325
configobj	configparser
though i have to admit the code samples in the configobj documentation make configparser look really sucksy in comparision

3420326

you would put the java code directory structure on the machine and run it through ant or maven and then would end up with class files or jar ear war or whatever you are developing to

3420531
bash	zsh
in your shell run the following script or it s zsh equivalent i whipped this up in bash before i saw the zsh tag

3420674
haskell	sml
some language like f# sml and haskell have much much more powerful type inference removing the need for all those ugly type declarations although explicitly annotating allowed types or set of types can make intent more clear while preserving static typing

3420708
children	parent
there are also nested children of the same effect if then boolean so their parent if then boolean isn t set to true until the very end

3420740
charindex	substr

despite some minor issues here and there it is cool to see your code running on linux unix windows and macosx bsd unix using the same jars

3420892
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
databinding magic happens due to inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged

3420912
treemap	linkedhashmap
these may be applied to a treemap as ordering extends comparator or a linkedhashmap after some sorting

3420912
comparator	comparable
to alleviate this you could add your key to the comparator like so presuming that your keys and values are comparable

3420912
comparator	comparable
note that this will still not work if your keys compare to 0 but this should be sufficient for most comparable items as hashcode equals and comparator are often in sync...

3420920
firefox	safari
this is the latest version of java with firefox and safari

3420934
pygtk	pygobject	pygtk	gio	pygobject	gio

basically i have a 400x400px canvas and i d like to be able to zoom in with mousedown 2x and go back with mouseup

3421007
dictionary	map
besides being easier to maintain it ll do a hash lookup or binary search depending on the sort of dictionary map you use

3421008
actionscript	mxml
flex on the other hand is compiled from mxml actionscript source files using the mxmlc compiler into the binary swf which is stored at the server it is static as opposed to the dynamic html pages generated by php etc

3421103
g++	gcc
i use gcc g++ at the moment but i can switch to vc++ since gcc s inline asm gives me headaches anyway

3421107
innodb	myisam
mysql can use a number of different database engines the two main ones being myisam and innodb

3421107
innodb	myisam
innodb has always had full transactional capability whereas myisam has always been very high speed

3421107
innodb	myisam
you ll need to either transition to using myisam tables or change mysql s configuration to enable innodb tables making sure your version of mysql has support for it

3421113
hide	show
there is a simple link to navigate to the next section which triggers a div show hide

width	height
the first parameter to drawimage is the image element or canvas element to draw the next 4 are the x y width and height to sample from the source and the last 4 parameters are the x y width and height of the region to draw in the canvas

3421218
width	height
you would just need to pick the width and height for the source sample based on the zoom level and the x and y based on where the mouse is clicked minus half the calculated width and height but you will need to ensure the rectangle isn t out of bounds

3421280
gridview	objectdatasource
i use objectdatasource and bind ienumerable person to my devexpress gridview

3421482
folder	directory
given a folder i want to make sure that all the files on that directory are deleted

3421555
int	chars	unsigned	short
some error reporting and you have a lot of flexibility for what type to store signed unsigned versions of chars short int long long long size_t ptrdiff_t intmax_t

3421555
int	chars
you can use d n to store the index of the first chars after the int that s read in another variable and thereby check to see if the entire string was converted or if there s junk afterwards

3421555
octal	hex
you can choose any number base from 2 to 36 or specify 0 as the base to auto-interpret leading 0x and 0 as hex and octal respectively

3421555
int	chars
since these functions take a pointer to pointer argument you also get a pointer to the first chars following the converted int for free so you can tell if the entire string was an int or parse subsequent data in the string if needed

3421565
coldspring	model-glue
i have model-glue coldspring running in my wwwroot under my project

3421666

3421809
hash	md5
in c++ how to get md5 hash of a file

3421817
spaces	delimiter
i have string with number on ints seperated by spaces delimiter

3421840
children	parent
when you implement it you have to pass the children of the deleted node to the parent of the node

3421840
children	parent
if you use arrays to store the information you will have an extremely hard time deleting items that have both parent and children and updating the lft and rgt valuse would be very hard

3421842
put	get
you may want to put the code that you want to anyway get executed irrespective of what happens in your try or catch block

3421885
addition	multiplication
i suppose that by elementary matrices you mean only those which do the elementary operations of row swapping row multiplication and row addition

3421885
multiplying	transpose
note that the t2 matrices appear in reverse order transpose because they must multiplying together to form u1 t

3421901
try-catch	exception-handling
generally speaking possible exception-handling are usually handled with a try-catch block

3421904
vim	emacs
both emacs and vim are a lot more powerful than they look at first glance

3421918
maven	pom.xml
are the paremeters you pass to maven then not available by default no matter where you reference them in the pom.xml

3421986

3421990
jlist	jtable
the dogs are displayed in a jlist when the user selects a dog its properties is shown in jtextfileds and its puppies are shown in a jtable

3421990
getter	setter
the dogs puppies are maintained in a collection in the dog class with getter and setter

3421990
jlist	jtable
when i add a puppie to the dog selected in the jlist it is not reflected in the jtable immediately

3421990
jlist	jtable
the jtable is bound to the jlist and not the dogs list with selectedelement.puppies as binding expression

3422056
width	margin
i had the same problem the div sidebar floating left was hidden by the main content div that had a 200px left margin and inherited the width from the parent div i used a pre-made theme for a wordpress installation

3422056
width	margin
you have two way to solve this 1 you call the hidden div first or 2 you delete the main content margin and give it a precise width and most important you assign it float right

3422059
submit	submission
the page i am writing at the moment is for submission assignments where the student selects an assignment from a drop-down menu and then uploads the assignment and submit

3422059
submit	submission
on submit all the information about the submission goes into a mysql table and the file is moved to a permanent location on the file system

3422096
spaces	delimiter
tags can have a string with multiple tags in it delimiter by spaces

3422097
swt	swing
eclipse and idea are using different ui toolkits swt vs swing so it would be hard to make it look the same

3422107
put	get
get the sysadmin to put you in the same user group as apache or ideally create a new group called something like developers and add the apache user and yourself to it

3422107
chown	chmod
otherwise you could try using php s chmod or chown functions immediately after the file upload

3422129
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie firefox and google-chrome

3422181
ubuntu	debian	rubygems	rvm
if you use and debian ubuntu is a debian take a look at rvm because debian cripples rubygems

3422181
vim	emacs	vim	gedit	vim	textmate	emacs	textmate	emacs	gedit	textmate	gedit
we ve got emacs vim textmate gedit here

3422189
firefox	safari
this thing is working in normal browsers like safari firefox i.e etc.

3422239
put	get
why don t you put a list of products on you website and make it somehow small or move it out of sight so google follows the links but your customers don t get distracted

3422248
firefox	safari
on microsoft platform the function works fine but it fails when i switch to non-microsoft platform such as firefox or safari

3422342
super	self
26 super invoices self .save args kwargs

3422342
super	self
48 super services self .save args kwargs

3422354
ubuntu	debian
this code works on debian under python 2.5 but doesn t on ubuntu under python 2.6

3422364
ubuntu	linux
mac os for most but any linux distro will do ubuntu fedora etc

3422364
vim	emacs
emacs vim is ok too

3422364
postgresql	mysql
sqlite for local development while mysql or postgresql for production

3422364
postgresql	mysql
my advice sqlite is easy to learn while give a try with mysql or postgresql you might not know when your clients going to ask you to develop on them

3422364
apache	nginx
but for production i prefer modrails.com where you can choose between apache nginx

3422425
mouseup	mousedown
i ve created a small example here that uses drawimage and scale to zoom in on mousedown and out on mouseup

3422427
put	get
why don t you put a list of products on you website and make it somehow small or move it out of sight so google follows the links but your customers don t get distracted

3422436
getter	setter
modern ides such as eclipse can automatically generate getter and setter for you so this way troubles can be avoided

3422459
apache	nginx
have you done your testing from the exact same url-location on the apache site and the nginx site

3422476
folder	directory
actually i have tried it by storing lod details in log folder in my directory which was working fine

3422574
getter	setter
the simplest example is java s getter and setter as mentioned by sjoerd

3422574
getter	setter
both getter and setter follow a well-defined pattern a getter returns a class member and a setter sets a class member s value

3422574
getter	setter
if you want a getter or setter to behave in a slightly different way you may add some parameters to your template

3422599
firefox	safari
firefox wasn t working for a while and recently started to work but the problem seems to be remaining in safari

3422599
google-chrome	safari
this seems a little odd because i d have expected safari and google-chrome to behave in the same way

3422630
versioning	upgrade
we used this approach not to upgrade from a previous versioning of wix but to get away from a commercial tool that didn t meet our requirements any longer

3422635
maven	pom.xml
i resolved this by removing the spring security dependencies from my pom.xml i only have spring-security-taglibs and spring-security-config which pull in everything else i need saved the pom.xml let maven do it s stuff and then added them back in again let maven get the dependencies again and restarted the server in eclipse

3422658
switching	screens
you can do the same or switching to original login navigation screens by flipping tab bar

3422687
post	get
to the target system it handles both get and post

3422687
post	get
allthough that is tricky since the post request could contain get

3422734
integer	unsigned
it s only true for processors where an unsigned integer is held in 16 bits

3422792
unsigned	short
if you add two unsigned shorts together and put the answer into a short the total can never be more than 65535 because a short can t denote that large a value

3422837
onfocus	onblur
for most events but especially for onblur and onfocus since you can t cancel the default action of them anyway

3422889
hide	show
it should hide the irrelevant set of form elements and show the relevant set

3422897
for-loop	loops
wat i want is tat each time for-loop completes 1 loops it should wait or sleep for 100millisec so tat it can give a fadding effect..

3422909
setinterval	clearinterval
you can also call setinterval which will keep calling the function until you call clearinterval

3422915
uiview	subviews
i have a uitableview which is a subviews of a uiview then that uiview is a subviews of a uiscrollview

3422933
portrait	landscape
so you will have only one uiviewcontroller for both portrait and landscape mode

3422944
portrait	landscape
also make sure to create and connect outlets for portrait and landscape views in your nib

3422949
opera	firefox
i have tried .childre .remove but this is adding loads of whitespace in firefox and opera

3422951
int	chars
it is throwing error as chars to number conversion error but i am passing int the

3422983
division	modulo
note that is the modulo which computes remainder after division and is the integer division operator

3422998
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
that is why you have different behaviors for different browsers each browser interprets the css files as they want and that s why you have to tune up your css files for ie firefox google-chrome opera etc.

3422998
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the best way to make your css files work in almost all the browsers apart from ie6 is writing the css file using the w3c standards firefox google-chrome opera and ie9 are supposed to be w3ccompliant

3423035
folder	directory
to make things even clearer create a subdirectory with all files and more subdirs and optionally an index.html in the root directory so the user only has to copy one folder plus one index.html

3423158
folder	directory
put your images in a spearate folder not in your virtual directory for the application

3423231
vb.net	vb6
there isn t an event like that in vb6 although vb.net has mouseleave

3423250
post	put
all i know is that it occurs when editing or creating an item so either post or put requests but the problem is it is not on one specific area of the application it simply eventually happend from time to time all over our forms

3423266
integer	unsigned
i asking because integer unsigned save 2 space vs integer

3423278
ienumerable	iqueryable
here res is an ienumerable or iqueryable of an anonymous type and i is of that anonymous type

3423320
post	get
if you have any other solution please post so that we can get a better solution

3423337
stdout	stderr
the only current limitation is that it is not able to differentiate between stderr and stdout meaning that it will merge both of them

3423357
udp	tcp
i am using tcp for communicating with an arduino just open a socket and wait for a connection using an ethernet shield while watching reading about various other project that use some sort of network interface for communication they all seem to use udp instead of tcp for communication

3423368
division	subtraction
because the division operator has higher precedence than subtraction

3423407
folder	dir
the line dir a d b gives you an output of multiple lines giving you all the parallel folder because i go up a level using pushd ..

3423432
qiodevice	qfile	qiodevice	qdatastream	qfile	qdatastream
try to open the qfile with | qiodevice append then qfile seek then create the qdatastream on the qfile object

3423446
int	chars
i know that there is crc32 but it only provides an 32-bit int in php and this 32-bit int are at least 10 chars long so a huge range of int number is unused

3423455
quicksort	mergesort
the internal sorting algorithm is most probably quicksort or mergesort

width	height
when running the file 1641x3121 through the script which creates one thumbnail with a max width or height of 150 and another of 400 we get a perfect thumbnail 78x150 and a small view image sized properly but which is cut off and stretched 211 x 400

3423510
hash	md5
i could create an md5 hash for the zip file on the server when creating the .zip file and then compare it with the md5 of my local .zip file but is there a simpler way

3423511
post	put
i use that in my .net projects as post compilation event to put the last revision in the assemblyinfo of the application adding it to the app version number

3423517
nunit	mstest
mstest - fair enough this is not nunit but it does generate tests and should be considered

3423555
folder	dir
and i need to copy content from all of them into one folder keeping the structure of content copying all files into one dir using flatten isn t a solution

3423577
hash	md5
you can log in using ssh and make a md5 hash for the file remotely and a md5 hash for the current local file

3423589
int	chars
and fiddle with the value of delta until you get the desired results or redesign the column so that you can use int or chars types

3423599
int	chars
your compilation error is caused because columnname returns a string and the only indexer string defines is an int indexer that returns the chars at the specified position

3423614
width	height
furthermore any event type can be passed in and the following jquery methods can be called val css html text data width height or offset

3423631
iprincipal	iidentity
when talking about authentication and authorization you should create your own implementation of iprincipal and iidentity which are then set within the thread thread.currentthread

3423631
iprincipal	iidentity
the iprincipal goes on the thread and it holds onto your iidentity

3423635
width	height
other special properties are mapped this way val css html text data width height and offset are treated special here

3423654
metaclass	subclassing
and if you don t want to modify the existing metaclass you can subclassing it

3423659
subscript	superscript
it works fine in all the case but in some case like superscript or subscript its not working

3423771
min	max
you can use min or avg instead of max it shoulnd t matter because there s only one value for each parameter per item_id

3423776
width	height
i ve found that you can arbitrarily place subplots by creating them with the axes function that takes a list of top left width height but this would make the code a little messy and arbitrary

3423792
put	get
if you get error error no 1242 subquery returns more than one row try to put any before your subquery

3423834
move	drag
this circle can be move around on the canvas by some drag drop stuff i did in code behind so its position is not fixed

3423834
width	height
i have bound the slider s value to an ellipse s height and width

3423837
pdfsharp	itextsharp
itextsharp and pdfsharp

3423839
firefox	safari
some browsers are more amenable to the idea than others ie will generally allow it but firefox has to be configured by the user to allow it and safari will basically never honor a focus request

3423860
uwsgi	cherokee
i have successfully deployed a django app with uwsgi + cherokee

3423860
uwsgi	cherokee
i cannot find any guide or step-by-step specific for uwsgi + cherokee

3423888
width	height
you can bind your canvas.left and canvas.top to your height and width via a valueconverter

3423888
width	height
store the old values for width and height or the old slider value

3423888
width	height
add dx to width and height property

3423889
pop-up	dialog
one of the functions in the test tool is to close dialog pop-up from the tested application

3423895
ant	maven
ivy is not a drop in replacement for maven it s a dependency manager for ant

3423903
width	height
the problem is that you are using the slider to adjust the width and height

3423903
width	height
width and height are not calculated around rendertransformorigin

3423913
margin	height
the left margin will ensure it clears the menu and that any content beyond the height of the menu is indented accordingly

3423921
put	get
if you use a single connection handle all get and put activity from multiple threads is synchronized through the connection handle

3423921
put	get
if you use many connection handles the get and put activity can occur in parallel

3423985
width	height
by mode here i mean video width height and fps frame per second

3424013
short	base
in short achieving the desired construction control flow is easy to do without adding the the ability to call base constructors in arbitrary locations and there s no compelling benefit to adding the feature

3424075
ubuntu	linux	textmate	gedit
personally i use textmate when i m at home on osx and gedit and redcar when i m at work on ubuntu linux

3424108
ant	maven
so no we don t have a better way but i have a fuzzy vision for how things could be better if we switched from ant to maven

3424119
javadb	hsqldb	hypersql	hsqldb
some good java databases that offer in memory support are apache derby javadb but it is really oracle s flavor of apache derby again hypersql better known as hsqldb and h2 database engine

3424172
uitableview	uisearchbar
i have a very basic uitableview with an attached uisearchbar and here s the flow of what happens

3424172
uitableview	uisearchbar
uitableview is empty user taps uisearchbar and brings up keyboard

3424194
webchromeclient	webviewclient
i think the problem with your code is that you enable javascript on the default internal webviewclient and or webchromeclient then you replace those with new ones that now have new properties

3424250
post	get
any suggestions on how to resolve this so i respond to the post data as well as get

3424272
nunit	mspec
your best only option it to use a standalone test runner such as nunit mspec etc.

3424273
width	height
i m just setting it s width and height to the browsers size so everything but the scale is the same

3424273
width	height
the next numbers are width and height

3424273
width	height
the numbers are width height scalex and scaley

3424282
min	max
aggregation queries group by having sum avg max min

3424324
udp	tcp
a udp stack is considerably simpler than a tcp stack

3424324
udp	tcp
you can easily write a udp stack from scratch on your own tcp is a bit harder doable but harder

3424324
udp	tcp
tcp has built in retries and other things so you dont lose reliability with udp directly it is what you do with it that could compare

3424324
udp	tcp
udp is significantly faster than tcp and is why it is or was used for video and various things back in the day

3424324
arp	udp
you can do things like only implement arp and udp and nothing else although ping is useful but somehow painful and you can cut corners on arp rarp depending on what you need to do with this thing

3424324
udp	tcp
there are times when it is useful embedded desktop or server though i still ask that question every time and have to justify the use of tcp over udp otherwise i wont use it

3424353
int	double
how would foreach behave in this instance the collection has a string an int and a double

3424376

right now to parse a large amount of text i use charindex to get the index of the char then i substr the text to remove up to that first index

3424596
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
even though nswindowcontroller has -windowwillload and -windowdidload methods for you to override the nsviewcontroller class introduced in mac os 10.5 does not have corresponding -viewwillload and -viewdidload methods

3424603
width	height
so when the user has the device in landscape the page width increases and the page height decreases

3424625
jobs	cron
currently it s using some hacks to trickle his massive email sendouts using cron jobs and queuing with the database to avoid going over the limit mediatemple set

3424635
uiview	uiwindow
you need to subclass the uiview that contains the uiwebview or the uiwindow and then relay the touch event

3424657
width	height
by default they are set to stay the same width and height and stay the same distance from top left corner of the parent view

3424676
rss	feed
i have a requirement to grab images from an rss feed and display these images in much the same way as browsing your picture library and i really dont know where to start first

3424701
switching	screens
i have a wonderfully working view that i have finished and now i d like to be able to switching the view to a brand new blank white screens to display

3424725
put	get
in linux if i put a command in a script that contains an alias i see that it doesn t get expanded

3424726
charindex	substr
you need to combine substr charindex strpos to do this but it not fast operations

3424761
post	get
for example the logger the request information a currently authenticated user get post parameters etc

3424763
stdout	stderr
you might want to consider something like ipc run3 too to allow you to gather the output from stdout and stderr to use as you see fit

3424798
autocomplete	autosuggest
however this construct is limited to one autosuggest word it autocomplete only the first word

3424798
autocomplete	autosuggest
is it possible to implement a google like autosuggest with multiple words terms so i can autocomplete multiple words

3424800
width	margin
specifically how can i induce the width to expand such that its outer width including margin fills up the container

3424839
backgrounding	multitasking
some weeks ago when apple released the sdk4 i made some changes to my app to support multitasking it plays audio in the backgrounding

3424854
for-loop	loops
it s small point not worth much debate but i would consider swapping the foreach loops for a plain for-loop

3424894
ubuntu	linux
with ubuntu linux

3424895
pop-up	dialog
it pop-up a dialog box with the error

3424923
sorting	filtering
to gain some of these benefits try adding meta-data to your model object by adding attributes from the system.componentmodel.dataannotations namespace. try using collectionviewsource to implement filtering sorting and naviation of your collection

3424941
width	height
then set li width height and then add overflow hidden

3424955
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome 5.0.375.125 and safari 5 underneath that same bold text where the images should be there are just two outlined squares and nothing else

3424955
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome 5.0.375.125 and safari 5 by pointing these two browsers to the url which can easily be done by adding the pound symbol # or by clicking the youtube icon in the follow us on social networking tray the images will be sized the way i would like them to be upon first visit

3425016
subtract	addition
in others yet you ll want to keep in addition to the date some indication about the fact i m saying feb 28 but i really would want feb 30 if it existed so that adding or subtract another month to that can set things right again and the latter obviously requires a custom class holding a data plus s thing else

3425050
uuid	uniqueidentifier
do you know if is possibile to get the uuid the result of uidevice currentdevice uniqueidentifier using a web app

3425062
hide	show
and i ve made a form to test it checking unchecking checkboxes to show hide some visibletabpage controls i ve added http.. csharp.pastebin.com mkgjgx2g

3425062
hide	show
certain number of clicks on checkboxes in a random sequence the application starts to allocate more and more memory and use some considerable amount of cpu to show hide tabpage controls

3425066
int	boolean
the reason that the bool conversion is preferred is because std string while part of the standard library is not a built-in type like int pointers and boolean

3425094
titlebar	window
i want to detect that it has happened so that in my windowstyle.none window with custom chrome i can implement the proper behavior for double clicking the titlebar

when the object is first constructed it s essentially positioned at 0 0 with it s expected width height as such

3425351
width	height
i have a large component say width 4000px height 200px and would like to be able to see it entirely even on a small screen

3425366
subclass	accessor
the main reason why is because a subclass might override your accessor and do something different

3425366
subclass	accessor
the subclass s accessor might assume a fully initialised object that all the code in the subclass s init method has run

3425366
subclass	accessor
similarly the subclass s accessor may depend on the subclass s dealloc method not having run

3425434
getdate	dateadd
specifically he lists dateadd ms -3 dateadd wk datediff wk 0 getdate + 1 0 as a way to get this weekend

3425435
post	get
what browsers will do with field names and values that contain non-ascii characters is the same for get and both types of post form it encodes them using the encoding the page containing the form used

3425441
firefox	safari
i have only tested this in safari firefox and ie latest versions of each in spring 2010 but it worked in all of them

3425445
submit	submission
the full story is i want to disable the submit button on a form s submission to prevent multiple submission

3425475
persistent	transient
i would also need to make sure all objects are always evicted so my generic update methods wouldn t need to differentiate between persistent and transient objects - or am i completely wrong

3425575
erd	diagram
make sure you know the culture what is a table what is a row what is a column what is a tuple what are keys foreign primary candidate alternate super what are triggers what are the normal forms what is an erd diagram what is relational theory

3425650
listview	gridview
later on i replaced the listview with gridview using search replace but only the inflated one worked from that point on

3425656
google-chrome	firefox
tested browsers firefox 3.5 google-chrome ie8 with and without compatibility mode

3425723
min	max	minimum	max
also you can add a function like min or max to select the person with the maximum or minimum age

3425736
binutils	bfd
i actually trying to compile an application that uses bfd library a part of binutils using mingw

3425748
rar	zip
for packers that include the filename rar zip tar you could of course just make the filename really long -

3425766
maven	pom.xml
i d like to add this dependency into the maven pom.xml file so the other developers on my team don t have to individually each apply this to their systems

3425816
inherited	subclassing
multiple inherited meand that you have 3 classes a is subclassing of b and c but neither b is subclassing of c nor c is subclassing of b

3425816
inherited	subclassing
normal inherited does allow chaining like a is subclassing of b which is subclassing of c

3425851
folder	directory
if you really don t want to put the settings file in the trunk folder then you do have one other option replace the settings file in the stylecop install directory

3425855
int	chars
and also because by convention variables called c are chars but here it s an int

3425944
coalesce	isnull
in addition you should consider using coalesce instead of isnull since coalesce is the iso standard

3425999
postgresql	mysql
i am an experienced programmer 16 years with a strong background in web development using python postgresql php mysql

3426017
post	get
get or post requests or use a data section in a post request to send for example an xml-formatted document that describes the action to be taken

3426021
post	get
in each case the magic butterflies represent a scalable cloud communications infrastructure that handles all the complicated telephony stuff required to send receive calls and text messages so that you don t have to worry about anything beyond get post and xml the stuff you re used to working with every day as a web developer

3426075
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this appears fine in firefox ie8 google-chrome safari and opera - but not in ie7 and ie6

3426076
width	height
draw the object boundaries as relatively positioned divs with height and width set

3426076
gif	png
another way to reduce the need to render on the fly - render once all tracking frames for each object as the polygon on a transparent background png or gif

3426085
serializable	deserialization
this is cache-friendly and memory efficient but i m concerned about the cost of serializable deserialization on every access

3426096
mouseover	mouseenter
i think it d be wise to try mouseenter in place of mouseover

3426107
htmlspecialchars	domdocument
by either escaping those characters with htmlspecialchars or perhaps more appropriately using a library for building xml documents such as domdocument or xmlwriter

3426110
coldfusion	railo
also worth mentioning that railo an alternative cfml engine to adobe coldfusion allows you to use the symbols in tag-based code if there is no ambiguity with closing tag the condition is wrapped in parentheses

3426118
versioning	upgrade
at this point i d recommend just waiting a few more weeks presumably until the next versioning comes out and upgrade

3426146
hex	binary
you could translate the number to hex and print off the hex representation in binary

3426269
spaces	delimiter
one was pulled from a database and the other was made using spaces delimiter user input and then explode

3426269
spaces	delimiter
this was the output of the user submitted values spaces delimiter and using phps explode function

3426373
hide	show
how to hide or show line from php designer

3426408

processors	hyperthreading
this is caused by hyperthreading in your i7 processors

3426435
hebrew	cjk
cjk chinese japanese korean arabic hebrew etc

3426439
profiling	debugging
you need to do what jamie keeling said and run it through a profiling or even just debugging it and see if you get stuck in some big loops

3426484
disk	ram
if using double means you have to cache to disk vs pure ram your difference will be huge

3426496
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter
you should use mouseenter and mouseleave insted of mouseover because mouseover is triggered every time the pointer moves into the child element and mouseenter only when the pointer moves into the bound element

3426498
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i develop using google-chrome firefox and safari

it works fine in firefox google-chrome

3426552
postgresql	mysql
windows and mysql oracle postgresql

3426559
getter	setter
in general you need a lot more than atomic getter setter for most kinds of thread synchronization

3426559
getter	setter
the setter gains a synchronized block and the getter assuming a retain property gains a synchronized block a retain and an autorelease

3426559
getter	setter
edit and yes the autorelease has to be in the getter not the setter

3426579
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it s a pure javascript-implementation of firebug that runs directly in any browser at least in all major ones ie6+ firefox opera safari and google-chrome

3426646
int	chars
and why would you malloc sizeof int 3 when you re allocating for a 3 chars s

3426673
folder	directory
i have a project with many different directory and within almost all these seperate directory is a folder named test is there a way to set the svn ignore to make svn ignore every folder named test in the whole project

3426702
charindex	substr
use substr and charindex as suggested in your duplicate other post

3426743
free	malloc
one good reason to do it is so that you have matching malloc s free s

3426743
free	malloc
if code gets moved around a programmer will naturally look for the matching free to go with the malloc

3426773
free	malloc
keep it simple for every malloc there must be a corresponding free

3426782
for-loop	loops
i understand that str ceases to exist once loops terminates but i also thought that the scope of i was confined to the for-loop as well

3426873
inherited	subclassing
i ve found the discriminator feature but it seems to only apply when you have subclassing in an inherited hierarchy

3426879
for-loop	loops
this is legal in c++ - the outer i is hidden - but it s illegal in c# regardless of whether the inner scope is a for-loop a while loops or whatever

3426903

i want to get the href src width height of all images on a page

3426984
public	protected
i ve also tried making the field protected and public clean rebuild solution restarting vs targeting x86 and .net 4.0 specifically on every project in the solution and other non-sensical measures to get rid of this exception but to no avail

3427030
children	parent
how can i retrieve all the children from the parent array using linq or something else

3427141
width	height
you can add width height and display inline-block too if you want to adjust the logo box size

3427250
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
this should work well in latest versions of all the modern browsers such as google-chrome safari and opera

3427261
firefox	safari
for firefox 3.5 or safari webkit 3.1 check out -moz-transform and -webkit-transform

3427290
codeigniter	cakephp
you re usually going to see urls like these when the host in which the server is running does not support .htaccess but the programmer still wanted to have pretty urls - i know for a fact that cakephp has their urls look this way in this situation as does codeigniter

3427300
width	height
html doesn t normally specify the width or height of an image unless it s been specified in the tag itself

3427300
width	height
the other solution which could prove to be a bit of a pain is to check the rendered width height of the image on the server side and provide that in the img width height attributes

3427336
int	chars
are int and chars actually stored efficiently inside the vector or via a reference pointer

3427336
int	chars
but what about int chars

3427338
hide	show
you can show and hide several elements from this class including gridlines formulas and outlines

3427340
google-chrome	firefox
in my experiments ie and firefox would let me go 2 back to the parent iframe to access functions but google-chrome gave me a security violation

3427359
onclick	onfocus
as you can see onfocus or onclick it is supposed to animate the expansion of the textarea from it s initial height 20px to it s expanded height 60px

3427359
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari the textarea loses focus so the user is unable to type in the box

3427373
hide	show
to use the status bar activity indicator you can show and hide it like this

3427434
superclass	subclassing
option b has the drawback that if you add a new property to your superclass you need to add a new column to each and every subclassing s table

3427492
google-chrome	firefox
from my tests line-height 14px to match the firefox height and line-height 13px to match the google-chrome height

3427503
getter	setter
i would use a getter setter on the objective-c class and pass it to the function as context info

3427527
tcplistener	tcpclient
sending a message to that program is simple enough with tcplistener and tcpclient

3427548
getter	setter
so if you had public property project as icalculatedpath without declared getter and setter this is called an automatic property which i believe was introduced in vb.net 4.0 vb.net will automatically generate _projection

3427567
pop-up	dialog
it pop-up a dialog box with the error

3427619
hide	show
my situation is that i want to hide and show the controls when tapping anywhere on the pagecontent thats not a button and have the controls show much like the iphone video player

3427698
fast-forward	merge
if one of sides didn t do any work since last branching point since merge base the situation is either fast-forward the branch you are on is simply updated to the tip of the branch you are merging or up-to-date there is nothing new to merge and the branch you are on stays unchanged

3427719
squash	branch
github_master â we squash commits from the release branch into single â œ release â commits on this branch as well as tagging releases

3427719
squash	merge
this will merge all the changes from a specific ref squash them into a single set of changes and leave the changes staged

3427736
subclass	accessor
subclass your delegate so that it includes an accessor that tells you when it s editing

asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
long term i think the html.actionlink which you see in the asp.net-mvc futures library is the way to fly

3427977
post	get
i assume i need to use get or post but i don t understand how to use those to send anything except text entered by the user

3428000
min	max
note that in cases where the values don t start at 1m or in case there s large gaps between the min and the max you will get a lot of zeros in-between the counts

3428009
ienumerable	ilist
which also does convert it from ienumerable to ilist not just evaluate it.

3428036
stdout	stderr
posix only specifies 0 1 and 2 shell ensures that whatever is started gets the file descriptors and libc in application s context also expects them to be the stdin stdout stderr

3428050
implements	extends
the technical problem that all enums implicitly extends java.lang.enum thus they can t extends another class only implements additional interfaces is no accident

3428050
implements	extends
update so you need to have distinct sets of bands for different types of stars - this can be implements using distinct enums extends a common interface

3428144
maven	m2e
up until now i ve been using wicket s web based quickstart but i just realised that m2e allows me to create maven projects from archetypes within eclipse

you could define a common superclass interface with subclassing for both normal characters and character classes groups

3428353
put	get
or perhaps easier just uses a object and wrap that with a class that has the intelligence to put get the correct types

3428369
outputstream	inputstream
closing this socket will also close the socket s inputstream and outputstream

3428405
folder	directory
simply put the protected directory above your document root that is store it next to the folder where your php scripts are store typically htdocs httpdocs or sometimes just www

3428405
folder	directory
the idea here is that php can access any folder on the server but apache won t let the user navigate above the root directory

3428433
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
one example of this is to act as if you are using a case-sensitive langauge even if you re using a case-insensitive one

3428446
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
you could simplify this code a lot by making capturecurrentframeimage return an nsbitmapimagerep instead of an nsimage since you never actually use an nsimage for anything here

3428478

3428480
google-chrome	safari
does safari and google-chrome require special handling

3428480
hide	show
is there any reliable way to hide show columns across browsers just by changing the css class on

3428542
folder	directory
similarly the folder that holds your compiled zlib library should go into the linker s list of search directory

libpcap	wireshark
i am trying to save the output of this file in libpcap format and although the file does get saved and the right data is written into it wireshark is unable to open it

3428554
width	height
if the sortable elements has its width border etc the intersection-calculation could be a little off since width and height don t return the correct values in this case

3428636
stateless	stateful
as a rule though this indicates you are treating the web as stateful rather than stateless

3428656
int	double
instances to convert into the json type are provided for double int etc but not for rational -- though there is actually no good reason for this as the instance is trivial

3428669

3428685
ant	maven
we re optimizing our maven configuration from previously using ant and i ve just read the maven by example book from sonatype

3428692
accessor	properties
my suggestion is to simply store the mkcoordinateregion s struct values latitude longitude latitudedelta and longitudedelta as separate properties and then on your model class provide a custom accessor that assembles these into a mkcoordinateregion object

3428697
dependency-injection	singleton
also most dependency-injection schemes have some way to mark a class as a singleton

3428734

3428757
allocator	stl
stl collections store elements by value allocator and releasing space for it

3428768
yacc	bison
it s generally used by automated code generation tools like yacc or bison to set the line number to the value of the line in the actual source file rather than the c source file

3428768
yacc	bison
trust me unless you want to get deeply involved in the internals of lexical and semantic analysis or you want a brain haemorrhage you don t want to go through the code generated by yacc bison may generate nicer code i don t know but nor do i really care since i write the higher level code

3428768
yacc	bison
we may be bent and twisted but we re not usually malevolent - that line was put there by yacc or bison itself to do you a favour

3428854
yacc	bison
of course in this case you are looking at a file that was written by a tool probably named yacc or bison that is used to create parsers from a description of their grammar

3428854
yacc	bison
the documentation for yacc bison or whatever the tool is will likely also be helpful

3428869
free	malloc
it is my understanding that in general malloc 0 will allocate the memory which should still be free later

3428955
svcutil.exe	basichttpbinding
i have a .net wcf service hosted with basichttpbinding -- i m successfully calling this service from another .net application i ve used the visual studio svcutil.exe to generate the proxy class via add service reference

boost	allocator
you can find more information in the boost pointer containers library documentation which explains the clonable and clone allocator concepts

3428970
inherited	subclassing
if you weren t instantiating object1 directly but some subclassing thereof i d remind you that any class intended to be inherited from must have a virtual destructor so that the correct subclassing s destructor can be invoked in cases analogous to this one -- but if your sample code is indeed representative of your actual code this cannot be your current problem -- must be something else maybe in the destructor code you re not showing us or some heap-corruption in the code you re not showing within that function or the ones it calls..

sequence	permutation
you can construct a collection of sequence where each sequence is a permutation of your loop variables i j k .

3429147
sequence	permutation
you pass a sequence 1 2 1 2 ... 1 2 of any length where each inner 1 2 sequence replaces one of your loop variables and you get back a sequence of all permutation of the values

why is it that you can run jython and ironpython without the need for a gil but python cpython requires a gil

3429167
getter	setter
they are -- or at least were at some point -- big on keeping the language as clean as possible. their approach was instead the java bean specs which specified a naming convention for getter and setter

3429167
getter	setter
ides that know the spec can more-or-less fudge the view of the getter and setter as a single property for design purposes

3429190
put	get
oh and if you have any influence on the xml format try to get ppl to always put that value intoa value tag even if it s just one

3429212
int	double
for a second i thought this may have been because i changed the numbers themselves to int types but i made them double again and it was still kind of screwy

3429217
width	height
maybe later add left top height width enabled visible etc bu tfor not th econtrol name an its value are enough text value lines checked

3429223
width	height
it s easy to resize images so that they all have the same height while maintaining the aspect ratio but how did they fit them all on a row such that every row has the same width

3429253
getter	setter
you might want to have a look at project lombok which is a kind of extension to java using annotations to make it possible to write more concise code it can for example automatically generate getter and setter for fields

3429258
int	double
you should also stick with using double and not int

3429352

i have a nsmutablearray of some instances of a custom class it has a nsstring cgpoint and a uilabel

3429459
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
illegalargumentexception or nullpointerexception for a null parameter

i wonder if c c++ can actually do this sort of replacement of bit patterns of length that do not fit into a chars 1 byte variable or even int 4 bytes

3429497
tabcontrol	tabitem
upper part of tabcontrol consists of tabitem controls

3429520
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome already support it or the latest versions anyway

i have already a dictionary map old and new link for changing

3429747
hide	show
how do i show a propertygrid instead of a context menu so when the user clicks somewhere else it will hide like a context menu

3429760
vim	textmate
commandt for vim is very much the comparable feature as in textmate

3429783
int	chars
is reading an int value from the input stream and is not processing the newline chars then when you come back to point where you get the name at which point a new line is still in the reader s buffer and gets consumed by the stringgetter returning an empty value for name

3429810
writetofile	nsdata
now i can save the audio data using writetofile atomically nsdata method but the audio won t play

3429830
visualvm	jprofiler
jprofiler visualvm etc

3429878
put	get
i thought that was the point of the parameters passed to the datetimefields or are they just defaults and since i ve set editable false they don t get displayed on the form hence don t get submitted in the request and therefore don t get put into the form

3429900
getter	setter
that way you can clearly name your fields and getter and setter making your code easier to read and extend

3429909
awt	swing	swt	swing
options i see are awt swing and swt

3429914
georss	kml
the most common standards are kml georss gml

3429920
setinterval	settimeout
also setinterval is preferable over settimeout in your case to avoid stacking up your calls in the long run therefore you should not rely on settimeout nor setinterval for a 1 second interval but you should have a variable to calculate the exact time span between each calls

3429922
rss	feed
but why don t you take the rss feed from

3429922
rss	feed
i use that one for fetching twitter rss feed

3429967
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
possibly you need to forget about the hash and just loops over the arrays with a for-loop that increments by 2 each time round

3430016
hash	md5
suppose you have a md5 hash encoded in base64

3430016
hash	md5
base64 md5 hash can shrink down to 6 22 132 bits which

3430057
awt	swing
awt is obsolete though some of its classes and design form the underpinnings of the swing api

3430057
swt	swing
here is my take on the differentiators between creating applications in swing and swt

3430073
public	protected
classes in standard c++ cannot be public or private or protected inside outside a namespace

3430084
perforce	svn
isn t there a way like in svn perforce to tell when pulling that i want my local modified file merged with that from server if automatic merging is possible if not to merge the conflict

3430087
post	get
is there any way we can avoid having to read in and discard all of the post content so that users get immediate feedback

3430100
hash	md5
if you re using the md5 sha or hashlib modules for example you don t need to encode it as anything in the first place - just call .digest instead of .hexdigest on the hash object

3430119
post	put
instead of sending your files with a form multidata over http post you can send your files with a little bit of javascript with the http put method to your server

3430124
int	chars
ruby doen t have any primitives like int chars etc in java so every value anything that can sit on the right of an assignment statement is an object

3430147
rtsp	sdp
i am working on a project in which i need to stream an sdp file from rtsp server

3430159
bitarray	bitset
it seems this is called a bitarray in c# in java it is bitset

3430215
rational-numbers	integer
store your rational-numbers as a division of two integer numbers and in most situations you ll be able to store numbers without any precision loss

3430218
inherited	properties
so in all while c# shares a c c++ inherited with java it also has an inherited that java does not share which made properties seem like a good idea to c# s creators but not to java s

3430218
getter	setter
if a property was both fully public and had no additional functionality in getter or setter which is the case with automatic properties i d rather just have a public field encapsulation is no argument here as fully exposing it publicly by-passes that anyway but the differences between fields and properties works against that

3430249
int	chars
the tag bits determine how the value bits are to be interpreted as a pointer and to what or as a direct constant such as an int or chars

3430249
int	chars
a plain vector is an array of such objects so there is no indirection in a vector of int or chars

3430258
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome ie firefox - all ok but safari nope it just wont fire

3430296
client-side	server-side
but you state preferably with sql ce i think you always have ce client-side but that it is not yet supported for the server-side

3430484
int	boolean	int	double
first we avoid using objects by using java primitive types boolean byte int double and long to represent our data for processing

3430519
retaincount	dealloc
i have an view based application and when i checked if the dealloc method was workin i saw that doesnt...debug and debug then using retaincount i discover that my viewcontroller retaincount gets crazy on the program start...its easy to reproduce..

3430524
getter	setter
you only need to add generate getter and setter yourself

3430582
post	get
that will create a url link a get not a post and the acceptverbs httpverbs.post would have forced no match

3430622
google-chrome	firefox
if you look in firefox or google-chrome you can see that it creates a subtle effect

3430638
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
now this all works just fine from firefox or safari and other uses of relative urls work fine in google-chrome iframe src urls images scripts css etc but google-chrome just won t pay attention to those .load requests at all

3430638
firefox	safari
and safari or firefox to the same file urls always do what i expect and load the content.

3430669
post	get
for example if i want to search for conti i get thsi url type post

3430695
daemons	launchd

3430758
mouse	keyboard
machine dependent means fundamentally dependent on the hardware that comprises the computer - ram can be accessed via the cpu+ram bus so isn t necessarily part of this - however video cards external storage mouse keyboard etc

3430787
int	chars
adding int to main puts it at 36 chars

3430837
inline	inlining
the main use for the inline keyword is not to request inlining but to indicate that the function may be #included in multiple translation units without causing multiple definition errors

3430845
post	get
it is not trivially possible no the easiest way would actually be to write your own template context processor that checks for example if something like is set then sets dictionary values based on some other get or post data

3430845
super	self
return super mymodelmanager self .get_query_set .filter preview false

3430848
int	chars
suppose we ve got two int and chars variables

3430848
int	chars
assuming we re discussing a platform in which length of an int variable is longer than or equal to three bytes i want to access third byte of this int and put it in the chars variable with that said i d write it like this

3430855
put	get
putting a particular sequence of bits through an x86 processor will get you completely different results than if you put the same set of bits through say an arm processor

3430860
inline	inlining
of course it won t inline calls when they re done through an explicit pointer to the function that is stashed away at some points and used at others or when the function s address is passed as a parameter to some other function - but that might affect the inlining of specific calls not necessarily other calls to the same function that are done differently

3430885
button	checkbox
think of a ui with a couple radio button checkbox text boxes and sliders to control the parameters

3430958
serializable	deserialization
i m not sure why i didn t look into this sooner but it occurred to me that there must be something available in .net that gives you class serializable deserialization for free and of course that comes in the form of the xmlserializer class

3430958
serializable	deserialization
i m thinking that in my particular case i either suck it up and allow the members to get overwritten bad or i go back to my original way of doing things which is to just write all of the serializable deserialization code myself

3430966
prepare	execute
create a prepare statement from each row and execute

nsmenuitem	nsmatrix
now the nsmenuitem not an nsmatrix

3431351
onresume	onpause
we call it with onpause in the activity s onpause function and onresume in the activity s onresume function

3431678
margin	border-color
for instance margin and padding are the shorthands of their -top -right -bottom and -left components and border is the shorthand for border-width border-color and border-style which are all shorthands for their properties

3431702
width	margin
put your content in a container div that s set to a specific width and them set the left and right margins to auto margin 0px auto 0px auto the margin values refer to top right bottom and left in that order same for padding in css in the css

cos	sin
i have defined a class in c++ which holds an array of scalars of type t for which i want to define operators like sin cos etc

3431713
width	height
if it is important to maintain an exact row height the easiest way to achieve dynamic vertical centering in webkit is to use a wrapper div with properties like this keeping the height on li and the width on #wrapper as you mentioned before

inherited	properties
the real difference is that they effect inherited properties differently

3431764

maybe you can use the rotating caliper algorithm for that maybe after splitting your concave polygon in a number of convex polygons

3431893
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
you can apply filters to images in some browsers firefox allows you to apply svg filters to html content from css but google-chrome safari and opera you ll need to wrap your content in svg to apply filters to them here s an example that works in opera

ubuntu	linux
windows only was the worse but i prefer it with a virtual machine loaded with a ubuntu server 10.04 it helps you in deployment also as the most servers have linux i have samba - access to the ubuntu files through windows explorer and it is working like a charm

3436182
ubuntu	linux
mac os x is also a good choice but it isn t as good as ubuntu for me i am used to windows graphical environment and the commands in the command line sometimes is a little different mac osx is unix it isn t linux and it doesn t use x windows so it is a little tricky to feel comfortable you have to learn a lot more to get the productivity you already have with windows

3436182
vim	emacs	vim	textmate	emacs	textmate
also textmate needs time to get used to it so better invest in a better solution like vim or emacs

3436326
ubuntu	linux
sure under os x you have many nice tools available like textmate but there are many others in ubuntu linux available too

3436326
textmate	gedit
gedit can replace textmate quite well when using the right plugins and for big projects i would always prefer netbeans for rails and java

3436372
addition	multiplication
even if addition is faster than multiplication i think that you will lose more because of the branching

3436372
addition	multiplication
in any case if addition is faster than multiplication a better solution might be to use a table and index by it

3436393
jobs	cron
the problem is that if there s 700 jobs in the job_queue each run of cron does only some of them so i need to run cron several times

3436393
jobs	cron
how could i keep calling cron in a loop until there are no more jobs left in the job_queue

3436393
jobs	cron
i m aware of drush cron but this also does only some of the jobs each run so needs to be run again manually

so the thought experiement was to determine what would happen if i wrote a version of inherited that inserted stub functions onto the subclassing that delegated back to the prototype for you

3436515
inherited	subclassing
all the work that was done in the inherited method to map base class methods to the subclassing appears to have been lost

3436515
inherited	subclassing
the big mystery for me here is the disappearance of the methods that i added to subclassing during the execution of inherited

3436542

3436720
hide	show
however i was wondering if there is a way of getting which continue button was pressed that is of which form so to just have a piece of code that basically checks and hide the current form and show up the next one without requiring id s or such

3436731
jsf	tapestry
as part of improving refactoring the codebase - we would like to upgrade to a more modern mvc framework so as to eliminate the need for action form classes and to use annotation-based configuration when possible etc but keep the overall classic-mvc style not currently interested in making the leap to jsf tapestry gwt flex play etc

3436735
children	parent
but if you re using jquery the parent method lets you trivially-easily find an object s parent so in that case i d recommend just making the continue buttons immediate children of their respective forms

3437297
width	height
i ve got all the maths and ratio stuff worked out it s just a matter of extracting the height and width from the and then replacing those with the new dimensions

3437416
subtract	add
when you add or subtract 1 from a pointer you ask it to point to the next or previous object of that type in memory

code using these operators should be modified to use std min and std max instead

3437433
min	max
there s a std min and std max in c++ but afaik there s no equivalent in the c standard library

3437435
min	max	minimum	max
earlier iterations of g++ not the c compiler used these operators for giving you the minimum or maximum values but they ve long been deprecated in favour of std min and std max

getter	setter
i used to create each action class which is dealing with same beans and of course there are same codes variables and their getter and setter duplicated in each action class

3438466
int	double	int	chars
the second implementation uses one thread to read the file at the byte level one thread to decode the chars from bytebuffer to charbuffer and multiple threads to parse the fields i mean parsing delimitted text fields into double int dates...

3438492
int	chars
f is a string and the query is expecting an smallint-value because i guess that chars is mapped to some int values

3438566
qiodevice	phonon
given that the question is specifically about using qiodevice however and that you mentioned that reading from a wav file was just your intitial approach i ll assume that you actually need a streaming api one which allows the client to control the buffering rather than handing over this control to a higher-level abstraction such as phonon

3438566
qiodevice	qfile
it is a good choice if the qiodevice being used is one which is provided by qt qfile qabstractsocket etc

3438579

3438689
nsmutablestring	nsstring
on that note when a property s value is an object of a class with a mutable variant as nsstring has nsmutablestring you should declare the property as copying its value property copy or property nonatomic copy in order that you do not take co-ownership of someone else s mutable object

3438711
stdout	stderr
exec only places the output to stdout in the output array however various imagemagick tools also output messages to stderr

3438711
stdout	stderr
you can redirect messages from stderr to stdout and hence also get them in output array by appending this at the end of your command

3438711
stdout	stderr
alternatively if you want to be able to differentiate where the messages were originally output you can use proc_open that allows you to specify separate pipes for stdout and stderr and capture output from them separately

3438718
folder	directory
you can not directly create folder in root directory of a web-server by programming

3438718

3439021
children	parent
i have tested for one parent to many children and the children primary key is set to a generated childrenid

3439021
children	parent
but somehow i cannot do it using composite key my guess is that as parentname in children is a primary key but will only be filled after parentname in parent has been filled well sth like that

3439021
children	parent
another question is that if the above problem is solved can i use this to retrieve the whole parent obj with the children list

set an onclick onmouseover event handler

3439094

this works great in portrait however when the iphone is rotated to landscape mode the page is not resized accordingly instead appearing zoomed in

3439432
getter	setter
for instance ruby objects don t have public attributes only getter and setter

3439432
getter	setter
but you can automatically create multiple getter setter with a single line like attr_accessor attr1 attr2 attr3 .

3439502
strsplit	read.table
if you can t get read.table to work you can always fall back on readlines and extract the file contents manually using for example strsplit

3439532
width	height
how can i check the width and height of the selected image file please

3439538
post	get
there is some information here on how to get that working and see other post on that blog

3439627

i d go for the bug mainly because if you put the keydown and keyup events in there it shows that that they are fired only once each of them but the textboxchanged event is fired twice

3439686
put	get
for the borders and corners how would i put the images together and make it dynamic and get bigger when i put more content in it

3439714

3439800
unsigned	short
i know it is possible to assign an unsigned char to an unsigned short but i would like to have more control how the bits are actually assigned to the unsigned short

3439800
unsigned	short
so i can specify where the 8 bits from the unsigned char should be placed in the bigger 16 bit unsigned short variable

3439800
unsigned	short
it will and should always return an unsigned short since it will sometimes calculate an 16 bit crc

3439845
x86	64bit
check if the module is compatible with an x86 32-bit or x64 64bit version of regsvr32.exe

3439880
mouseup	mousedown
edit another aspect of the problem is that the non-scrolling actually triggers js-eventhandler click mousedown mouseup inside my webview which leads to surprising app behavior

3439883
width	height
in theory if you use that bytearray as the source for an image tag you ll be able to get the height and width that way once you add that image to a container

3439956
put	get
i want to know if there s a way to get all the value that s checked and put them in a collection so i can send it to my controller

3440033
lisp	smalltalk	interpreted-language	smalltalk	interpreted-language	compiled-language
2 you have to distinguish between true compiled-language classic c++ interpreted-language classic lisp vm based languages smalltalk pascal and the newer breed of hybrids that present a vm up to the user but can recompile on the fly on the host machine using peephole optimization c# java - an interpreted-language will always be slower than a native compiled-language - native compiled-language do not have execution engines all others have one form or another of an execution engine

there is no such thing as a compiled-language or interpreted-language

3440315

in c++ it is no longer required to use the typedef on struct nodes

3440315
typedef	struct
if you typedef it then there is no need to use struct anymore

3440317
textarea	textbox
you are setting the textmode to multiline in the string you are passing to parsecontrol you will always get a textarea that s how the textbox control works

3440333
getter	setter
you could continue to use the generic superclass but this would require moving the field to the entities where they would have types defined then have abstract internal getter setter for those fields that return object that the generic methods would call casting to the generic type

3440352
post	get

this may also be needed in 2.6 or later perhaps for the purpose of making your own registrations to add types you care about that haven t already be registered onto numbers.numbers -- if you want to exclude some types that claim they re numbers but you just can t handle that takes even more care as abcs have no unregister method for example you could make your own abc weirdnum and register there all such weird-for-you types then first check for isinstance thereof to bail out before you proceed to checking for isinstance of the normal numbers.number to continue successfully

element.style only contains style properties that are defined in the element s style attribute and not style properties inherited from blocks or external css files

3442550
inherited	properties
value inherited the properties s value depends on the value in its parent ancestor object

can t you change your program.cs so that it runs the main form and in the launch of the main form it creates and show a login form and then hide itself waiting for the login to happen to show itself

3443091
hide	show
you could put classes on the s you want to hide and then use toggle to show and hide them

3443119
free	malloc
c s malloc and free and c++ s new and delete do very different things

3443119
free	malloc
but initially i would keep the malloc and free calls and just abstract them with c++ unless there is a very good reason to do otherwise

3443162
public	protected
use a public constructor and a protected constructor in the base class the public one to create a base class object that then also creates your member variable with new and the protected one to be called from derived class constructors

3443162
inherited	properties
anyhow propably something is wrong with your class design inherited means a is a association so usually all properties member variables of your base class are also part of the derived classes

there is no garbage collection in c if you call malloc somewhere you better make sure that you call free somewhere else

3443290
versioning	upgrade
on a versioning upgrade of the page i need to prompt the user regardless

3443309
post	get
i ve actually been through this same problem on the windows mobile platform and the only thing that worked was to extend the webbrowser control using c++ to capture the post get vars before the request is sent

3443309
post	get
so although it is not possible to get the post get vars used for your basic auth on a standard webbrowser control it would be possible if you use an extended control such as the sample i linked - in fact many extended webbrowser controls are created because of problems very similar to yours

3443313

i ve done this because i get http 500 errors when i do a post and try to parse my parameters via data request.data

3443482
width	height
a mutable square is not a mutable rectangle because mutable rectangles should provide the ability to set the width to 2 and the height to 3

3443482
width	height
neither is a mutable rectangle a mutable square since mutable squares should have the property that if you change the width the height changes

3443482
width	height
so mutable rectangles whose width and height happen to be equal aren t the same thing as mutable squares at all

3443554
public	protected
in the interests of data-hiding and oo-design though it should almost never be public or protected which is just a fancy way of saying anyone can mess up my data

for me a for-loop always implies a simple iterative loops using a counter

width	height
a square has just one property width which is also its height

3443960
width	height
a rectangle has both a width and a height

3443960
width	height
now you could implement your rectangle as a separate class that has a height and width but then you d have two classes with a width - square and rectangle

3443961

you could then hide all of the original report and instead show an http link back to the same report but with the parameters bar the error causing one in the link

3444210
put	get
get object key and put object key object value method calls the above movetofront method

3444217
pascal	delphi
i am busy climbing the learning curve for opengl using delphi pascal

3444258
nyromodal	qtip
this will re-apply the nyromodal to all the links on the page thus covering the dynamically generated content from qtip

3444271
background-repeat	background-position
also background-repeat is supposed to be defined before background-position although most browsers will understand the values in whichever order they are given

3444337
cpu	processors
as cache is a cpu concept and is meaningless for c language and c language has targets processors that have no cache unlikely today but quite common in old days definitely no

3444349
getter	setter
i am trying to understand when and why to use getter and setter

3444352
ssl	https
i know that the broken machine is indeed proxying traffic through fiddler as i see the fiddler ssl cert when i go to https sites

3444389
getter	setter
your getter setter should be your public interface to your class

3444394
cos	sin
x y cx cy +r cos t sin t

3444412
post	get
i m trying to get the post-id my post

3444431
getter	setter
the reasoning behind getter setter is to protect the class from being broken when a user alters a field in an invalid way and they allow you to change the implementation of your class while leaving the publicly exposed properties unchanged

3444436
configobj	configparser
which is better for creating a settings file for python programs the built-in module configparser or the independent project configobj or using the yaml data serialization format

3444436
configobj	configparser
i have heard that configobj is easier to use than configparser even though it is not a built-in library

3444451
pop-up	dialog
http auth means the user gets a pop-up dialog window asking for a username and password it s less usual than the self-rolled version

3444461
getter	setter
if other classes will need to view something in your class you ll need to expose a getter but not a setter

3444461
getter	setter
no getter unless necessary no setter unless necessary and setter should perform any small logic necessary to verify input before accepting it if appropriate

3444461
getter	setter
that said avoid the other trap putting lots of code in getter setter

3444471
portrait	landscape
in the xib i have two uiview a landscapeview for landscape and a portraitview for portrait

3444471
switching	screens
then mycontroller switching between these views depending on the screens orientation by setting its view property

3444481
allocator	stl
note though that i d still store the items in the stl container by value -- unless your object is huge overhead of heap allocator is going to mean you re using more storage and are less efficient than you would be if you just stored the item by value

3444495
getter	setter
like others mentioned use getter setter when you want the object members to be available to other objects

3444499
x509	pkcs#1
in the case of public keys the obvious choices are as a pkcs#1 rsapublickey asn.1 structure der-encoded or as an x509 subjectpublickeyinfo asn.1 structure der-encoded

3444507
ssl	https
the only problem is when i create and apply the proxy it works just fine over http but when i pass it a https ssl url it gives me the following errors

3444527
rss	feed
if it helps try to preload data fetch rss feed and all that at the start and when you ve got most of the important bits that don t require refreshes loads frequently display the app

3444544
post	get
i have a relatively simple example of an mvc page that is using jquery to make a post to get some json data and then just show a success failure message when it is done

3444579
hash	md5
the password should be scrambled usually done using the md5 hash algorithm and stored in the database in the same way

3444596
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this sets the referrer to b.com on opera safari and google-chrome but not ie or firefox

3444632
inherited	subclassing
and i think that you should also read about the various inherited strategies to represent inherited at the database level single table per class hierarchy table per concrete class joined subclassing supported by jpa as they don t provide the same level of support for polymorphic queries

3444632
inherited	properties
inherited properties from superclasses

3444645
folder	directory
i am hoping to loop through folder in a directory and repeat this procedure

3444666
configobj	configparser
configparser has a really bad api configobj is supposed to be good but i have never used it for ini files i usually implement my own parser

3444683
apache	nginx
after some extra digging i found a setting in the production.rb file config.serve_static_assets which was set to false and since i m not running apache or nginx the static files where not served

3444753
javadb	hsqldb
if you don t want a full-featured database use something like hsqldb or javadb

3444764
portrait	landscape
i am doing this to overcome the landscape-only camera limitation present in android 2.1 and below by having the activity be in landscape but placing my camera overlay into this framelayout overlay to cause it to appear as if it was portrait this is how layar does it to accomplish this i m adapting jeff sharkey s code to rotate views

3444764
portrait	landscape
so on my g1 instead of a 320x480 portrait view over a 480x320 camera view in landscape i get a 320x320 box in the middle showing my portrait view with the sides chopped off

3444804
web.py	cherrypy
can i use node.js web.py cherrypy etc

3444809
ilist	iqueryable
you can do it yes but it won t have the desired effect since assuming dc is a linq to sql data context an iqueryable is not a collection of data it is a stored query which will execute later you will need to store an ilist or similar you could still return it as an iqueryable if desired though that could be confusing to others

3444828
x86	64bit
using a 32-bit client on a 64bit os can be tricky and it is safer to not install it in the program files x86 folder

3444886
portrait	landscape
when the app starts it has proper orientation landscape but when i change my view it becomes portrait and becomes again landscape only after rotating device 270 degree not 90 lol

3444902
range	minimum
this extends to the integer types too - the c standard integral types have minimum range eg

3444902
int	chars
signed chars is -127 to 127 short and int are both -32 767 to 32 767 long is -2 147 483 647 to 2 147 483 647 and long long is -9 223 372 036 854 775 807 to 9 223 372 036 854 775 807

3444904
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
everything works great in google-chrome firefox and safari

3444906
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
in this case view controllers that have views which are managed by a tab bar controller are sent the viewwillappear viewdidappear viewwilldisappear and viewdiddisappear

3444917
explode	implode
implode is the opposite of explode

3444919
web.py	cherrypy
can i use node.js web.py cherrypy etc

3444919
apache	nginx
a front-end apache or nginx or similar accepts the initial web request

3444919
apache	nginx
the results are fed back into apache or nginx via mod_wsgi to the user s browser

3444919
django	web.py
just have lots of httpd nginx front-ends that spawn django or web.py or whatever which all share a common database

3444948
versioning	upgrade
if you lock your users into your current api on every release you re providing motivation for them to not upgrade to your latest versioning - this is the opposite of the intended motivation as this increases your support requirements you have to support more older versioning and keeps users from using your latest and greatest features

3444957
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
you can just use the usual fileoutputstream and fileinputstream classes to respectively write to and read from the disk

3444957
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
change your pdf generator to write to fileoutputstream and change your file servlet to read from fileinputstream

3444965
for-loop	arrays
this doesn t work it would require a 1d arrays according to the error i get i don t know why datasource gridview would be limited like this i have read up on some very ugly solutions to it but really all i need is to just write a nested for-loop to output n columns and n rows to the asp.net page

3444976
width	height
a good way to do this is to create a vector that operates in x y dimensions x being the width of your image and y being the height with the value for each dimension applying to the x y pixel value

3444980
portrait	landscape
there are two landscape modes and two portrait modes

3444980
portrait	landscape
for instance if you flip to one of the portrait modes let s say with home button on the bottom from landscape left you are going to get a 270 degree rotation

3444990
concave	convex
if it s concave you ll have to be very careful to not let your fill lines cross over the border or do some pre-processing and subdivide the original poly into two or more convex ones

3445015
integer	unsigned
there is a property ipaddress.address but it s obsolete i don t know why since if you don t need sorting or control over the ip classes the best way is to store it as unsigned integer that has a max value of 0xffffffff which equals to 255.255.255.255 in decimal representation

3445023
nsstring	nsdata	writetofile	nsdata
you will not likely be customizing writetofile since the way you assemble xml data will probably be with nsstring or nsdata on an iphone which already have the i o methods you need

3445044
pull	push
i can commit pull push etc

3445077
jquery	simplemodal
simplemodal and every other jquery modal i know off will reverse display none when they show the modal...they re actually expecting this

3445087
gif	png
again i am unsure how transparency data is stored for certain image types gif png etc but this will be extractable and would serve as an effective simplified cut out to compare with your data sets transparency

3445087
trie	tree
comparing trie tree should be reasonably easy and could possible provide effective results

3445099
post	get
by the way it looks like your request is idempotent so consider using get instead of post

3445186
hide	show
if your requirement is to first hide it and show based on some user action i would use jquery to do the hiding

3445203
boost	stl
otherwise you ll either 1 want to use stl containers of smart pointers like boost shared_ptr which is legal for stl containers or 2 manage the lifetime of the pointed-to objects some other way

3445205
stdout	stderr
capturing stdout stderr exit_status etc

3445290
textview	imageview
conceptually i want the rest of the screen to be a vertically oriented content region for displaying either the text textview of the url and get text was clicked or the image imageview in the case where it was an image and get image was clicked

3445331
mouseover	mouseout
i have some code that adds mouseover events and mouseout events to all a tags on a page

3445374
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i am trying to figure out how to use a uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller and uitableview together

3445403
textview	imageview
since you want the textview and imageview to be on top of each other you might look at using a framelayout instead of the linearlayout

3445431
int	boolean
it is noted that there are answers on how to do this with a string or int value but i can t find a boolean example

3445437
versioning	upgrade
i m writing an app which uses the foreign key constraints which support was only just brought in for on versioning 2.2 and my phone is 2.1 is there any way to upgrade the versioning of sqlite3 on the htc desire or any other android phone when your application installs

3445449
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i personally use google-chrome not for testing but i m expecting the webapp to be used across safari ie7 ie8 and firefox

3445474
mouseout	mouseenter
once the dim class is removed on mouseenter this no longer responds to a mouseout event

3445486
int	chars
internally factor s are int with an attribute level chars vector see and which is clean

3445518
button	checkbox
however when i tried swapping the checkbox with radio button the radio button do fill in upon clicking

3445558
hide	show
if this is the case then you could add mywidget to that same parent view and so long as it is last in the subviews array it will show up on top as you show hide the other two views

3445577
rss	feed
rss feed are typically managed on the server and consumed by the client

3445600
maven	pom.xml
if you make maven work in online mode it will always try to update or download missed plugins or pom.xml which is not necessary

3445603
width	height
would cause problems with the interaction i ve let them all display one after eachother in a column and used a div of set height and width with overflow hidden to obscure the rest of the cards instead

3445608
slideup	slidedown
i m attempting to animate it either using animate or slideup slidedown

3445694
button	checkbox
when i choose the checkbox then click the print button all the information of a particular applicant will be printed.take note that each document was printed on a new page

3445696
gradle	ivy
someone on the gradle list suggested using an ivy packager resolver

3445697
post	get
as i think function addtocard will post get to server using ajax

3445701
put	get
it would be easiest i think to put that into the dom and get it from there then remove it from the dom again

3445709
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but ie 8 does not support preflighted or credentialed requests while firefox 3.5+ safari 4+ and google-chrome all support such requests

3445736
pull	push
because your tfs builds will push to a drop location made available people pull rather than you pushing new releases

3445736
versioning	upgrade
when consuming applications have the need or bandwidth to upgrade to your newer versioning of the internal assemblies they pull

3445815
profiling	debugging
also if you re looking for something a little more portable try blackbird.js one of the coolest little debugging tools i ve seen though nowhere near as frilly as firebugs it will work in any browser and provide your log messages and profiling with a visible place on the screen

3445821
post	get
i need the username password to be scrambled at the client-side before sending it over via http get post

3445854
draggable	droppable
draggable will revert unless it encounters with a droppable element

3445854
draggable	droppable
to make draggable disappears onmouseup i ve created a dummy droppable to accept the drop

3445855
fadein	fadeout
i m trying to write some js replicating jquery s fadein and fadeout functions

3445884
setinterval	settimeout
what you should do is re-engineer it so that instead of creating many settimeouts at once which is inefficient you instead tell your settimeout callback function to set the next timeout or you could use setinterval and do the incrementing if your values inside that callback function

3445886
opera	firefox
it looks like the async property has been discovered to have an effect on dynamically-appended scripts at least in firefox and potentially opera though it doesn t yet support the property

3445886
opera	firefox
firefox and eventually opera will need the async property to be set to ensure that this always happens

3445891
snmp	mib
if your organization adds or updates a new mib file use the mibcc.exe tool to compile the mib file so that the snmp management api mgmtapi.dll can use the mib objects in the new or updated mib file

3445925
inherited	subclassing
if you absolutely have to create a subclassing that inherited from uitableview and override the touch-related methods in the implementation

3445945
int	chars
you can make a simple function which would xor each chars value with some int and make a hex encoded string

3445964
superclass	subclassing
put another way not all of the capabilities of the superclass are used in the subclassing in this case

3445992
rss	feed
if you look at the checkins rss feed you ll see that david miller has been doing a lot of good work to add functionality

3446041
ggplot2	lattice
how to make this kind of plot with lattice or ggplot2

3446064
mouse	keyboard
personally i had an issue always having to reach for a normal mouse looked at various option eyetracking voice touchscreen and ended up changing the keyboard to a ibm trackpoint end result being my hands never leave the keyboard and my typing speed and accuracy improved due to not having to reposition my right hand

3446067
width	height
this can be wrong defined size for swf object width and height which results in showing part of the swf s background

3446078
post	get
you can use get or post

3446082
hide	show
it will show one picture and hide 4 others and when you mouse off a link it will go back to a default picture

3446102
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a tabcontrol where every tabitem is a view generated for a viewmodel using a datatemplate similar to this

3446111
firefox	safari
however in safari as well as firefox under certain conditions there seem to be some sort of rendering artifacts that prevent this from looking as intended

3446143
put	get
you shouldn t need to care about what s inside the black box just so long as you know what you need to put in and what you ll get out of it

3446151
pop-up	dialog
how have other folks done rich pop-up dialog on the phone

3446176
hide	show
i use jquery in my page to hide buttons which i dont want to show unless needed

3446182
int	chars
int spawn funcptr func void arg 0 int grp_id 1 const chars threadname

3446201
portrait	landscape
but if i change the screen orientation from portrait to landscape and back again a few times i always get an outofmemory exception

3446201
onresume	onpause
in onpause i call mbitmap.recycle and then on onresume i call the above code again to create the bitmap and set the imageview

3446201
onresume	onpause
changing the code i had the call to getlastnonconfigurationinstance in oncreate and removed all code in onpause and onresume

3446205
perl	tcl
did you start with tcl and go to perl

3446210
macports	homebrew
unfortunately the is very normal with macports and is the reason that people many have switched to homebrew

3446234
postgresql	mysql
take for example what happened to us recently one of our devs used mysql and was using a special mysql-only like syntax which didn t work on our postgresql production database

3446256
formview	detailsview
how about a formview or detailsview possibly a datagrid and definitely some validators

3446257
printf	strcpy
so i tried converting the integer to a string using printf and then using strcpy to copy that string into one of the elements of the array of strings that has to be passed through execve

3446272
puts	gets
the reason works is because you set the pointer to point to a string that already exists the compiler generally puts that 123 into pre-initialised memory and it just gets loaded

3446273
listview	gridview
usually you don t need a custom control to make a specialized view for a listbox listview or gridview

3446283
button	checkbox
i need to first disable the order button when the windows loads and enable it after selecting check some items checkbox and vice versa

3446286
put	get
to get around this use you can put the left brace before or after the dollar sign

3446308
post	get
how can i compare a group of tags to another post s tags in my database to get related post

3446308
post	get
so say you wanted to get truly related items based on tags from a post and then show them from the most related to the least related

3446311
button	checkbox
bind a command to the button and implement the canexecute method to check the status of the checkbox and either enable or disable the button and use the execute method to invoke the functionality that you want on the button

3446316
children	parent
jquery has the has selector so it s possible to identify a parent by the children it contains updated per afrowave s comment ref

3446391
nsstring	nsdata
when i try to convert a nsstring object into a nsdata object i use the following code

3446432
jobs	cron
it s a lot easier to validate a simple find script than to validate every one of your cron jobs

3446434
g++	gcc
just the gcc compiler suite it includes g++ which is an open source compiler

3446541
unix	bsd
mac os x is one flavor of bsd unix

3446548
internationalization	localization
form label is view-specific it will deal with localization or internationalization it would be better to just put it on the view not in the presentation-model

3446596
children	parent
its slightly offbeat as when you talk of parent we assume you would be considering its children at some point

3446637
folder	directory
in order to make things work on our build server i also created a library folder inside the winforms app s project directory with the cr x runtime files i need as well as a library folder inside the web app s project directory with the cr xi runtime files

3446656
spaces	delimiter
why is my strtok breaking up my strings after spaces when i specified my delimiter as

3446726
pop-up	dialog
a dialog with registered components pop-up

3446739
jhat	jprofiler
i have used jprofiler for profiling our application.but it hasn t been of much help.then i used jhat.using jhat you cannot see the heap in real time.you have to take a heap dump and then analyse it

3446745
fast-forward	merge
if you haven t made any commit on master that means the git merge mybranch was a fast-forward one master head simply move to mybranch head

3446831
width	height
this div element let s call it a container has a fixed width and dynamic height no constraints

3446841
integer	radix
try to use the radix parseint dobnum 10 to parse your integer in base 10

3446919
put	get
attribute and get the same file name - minus the .cs and put that in the element

3446924
nsmutablestring	nsstring
because of the nature of class clusters string objects arenâ t actual instances of the nsstring or nsmutablestring classes but of one of their private subclasses

3446955
qplaintextedit	qtextedit
now i d like to receive the output from the script on an qtextedit more specific qplaintextedit

3446960
width	height
i m initializing the uiscrollview with the same bounds as the viewcontroller s view bounds and set the auto resize mask to flexible height width so it will still occupy all the screen

3446960
portrait	landscape
this works well when the view controller is pushed in portrait mode the orientation changes works great but if i push it in landscape mode the scroll view isn t occupying all the height but rather it looks like it scaled weird

3446960
portrait	landscape
now if i remove the autosize mask the scroll view is in fact covering the whole view when entering both in portrait and in landscape mode but then the autoresizing doesn t work

3447007
nsstring	nsdata
after that i grab the .text value from the uitextview convert it from nsstring to nsdata then upload the nsdata object to a http server with a php upload script

3447015
getter	setter
change the logic so that the action that would result in a change of the boolean does actually update the boolean field and the getter setter is really just a getter setter and does not compute anything

3447049
int	double
double roundtosignificantfigure double num int precision

3447055
folder	directory
all the files are generated but the images and js folder is missing in the doc directory

3447065
subtract	add
a cash sale would immediatly subtract the sale from stockonhand and add it to soldstock for an order you would leave stockonhand alone and merely add the sale to reservedstock when the stock is finally invoiced you subtract the sale from stockonhand and reserved stock and add it to soldstock

3447109
google-chrome	firefox
the example above works well in firefox google-chrome etc

3447128
inline	inlining
one exception to this is that it may well affect inlining - so if you have a method which is being called in a tight loop you may find it doesn t get inline if it has try catch blocks

3447144
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql you can use limit 1 as above

3447348
google-chrome	firefox
this only happens in ie8 not the firefox 3.6 or google-chrome 5

3447357
nhibernate	automapper
in reality what happens is that automapper tries to map as many relationships as possible causing nhibernate to lazy load all the child entities i m seeing select n+1 happening all the time

3447363
apache	nginx
another solution but a little more complicated use a http proxy server apache nginx etc. that will serve directly static resources css images html pages and forward to tomcat only dynamic resources jsp and .do actions for example

3447472
hide	show
every time i click on a button i want to show the proper items and hide the others

3447563
getter	setter
a general rule of mine is to put only getter setter in headers

3447581
put	get
another is that if the vector is popped or otherwise shortened in the meantime then at best we get to the point where i just put a comment in the code above at worse it errors as they pop again after we obtain newsize and then accessing retval becomes invalid

3447589
post	get
the action method works file for get requests but i m still struggling with forwarding the incoming post request

3447593
switching	screens
you need to load a screens on didfinishlaunch that screens is generally called splash screens do the animation in it and at the end switching to your first screens

3447735
int	chars
i need to convert decimal number stored in an int to a array of bytes aka stored in a unsigned chars array

3447785
entity-relationship	diagram
i think that what you are really doing is relational modeling even though you are using entity-relationship diagram

3447832
queue	fifo
fifo queue for each appdomain in the

3447832
queue	fifo
fifo queue for â œnativeâ work items

3447845
greenhopper	sprint
i too have been plagued by the same problem and have found the feature request in jira greenhopper to add a new field for sprint to allow tracking of sprint and release version information independently

3447947
nsurl	nsdata
you should check if there s another class method in your file that blocks the ui for example nsdata s + nsdata datawithcontentsofurl nsurl url

3447968
keydown	mousedown
so you might also want to listen to mousedown and keydown events if you want your ui to provide a consistent behavior

3448028
integer	unsigned
the first one would be like std is_integral or boost is_integral but usable with user defined types for example a class wrapping an int say int_wrapper true if the type behaves like an integer and whose representation is like standard integral types if t is unsigned but the definition of an integral type is very rigid in that it consists of a list of these types

3448030
min	max
thx for replying i need the column can be dragged to resize so i cannot set the max and min size

3448043
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome you have to choose between having a context menu or having mousewheel scroll capabilities

3448125
width	height
scale the x y values to lie between 0 1 divide x by width y by height

3448125
width	height
scale the x y values by the width height of the smaller grid - xsmaller ysmaller

3448148
min	max
also set min and max width of column same as set with setpreferredwidth

3448157
folder	directory
these 6 steps create a script in a folder called bin in your home directory

3448183
folder	directory
for absolute paths to work add the root source folder to the include directory list relative to the project s file location

3448200
getter	setter

calloc	malloc
c difference between malloc and calloc

3449064
calloc	malloc
calloc is initializing the memory before you use it but malloc does not

3449064
memset	malloc
with malloc if you want to guarantee the same effect you d have to call something like memset to reset the memory

3449066
daemons	systemd
my python daemons runs fine in the foreground of my ubuntu systemd using this command in the terminal

3449073
calloc	malloc
malloc is faster since calloc initializes the allocated memory to contain all zeros

3449087
memset	calloc
you could use calloc in situations where you are just going to do a memset of 0 to the memory anyway

3449132
accessor	properties
provide a single properties accessor

3449155
onmousedown	onmouseup
then use onmousedown and onmouseup to determine the duration of the click

3449169
calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
calloc ... is basically malloc + memset if you want to 0 initialise the memory

3449169
calloc	malloc
calloc itself is slower than malloc because you have to spend some time to clear the contents of allocated memory

3449169
free	malloc
so if you just need to allocate some memory and then copy some stuff there you are free to use malloc

3449255

the two most common outputs are intel 32-bit x86 and amd64 64bit x64

3449628
windows	wow64	x86	64bit
now in reality i believe that the above program will always return intel 32-bit x86 because all delphi applications are 32-bit and so they are emulated under a 64bit windows using wow64 -- there is no 64bit release of the delphi compiler and ide

3453646
accessor	properties
this indexer or paramterful properties as jeffrey richter calls them needs to have it s set accessor implemented as shown above in the code snippet

3453646

another thing about this code you ve passed the constant 10 as the width and height of your off-screen bitmap as well as using it for the width and height params to the bitblt that does the copy

3454025

i d start out creating a uitableview and layering a frame around it and trying to mimic uipickerview

3454700

3454848
elementtree	beautifulsoup
however alternatives many people prefer to build xml files include writing them from the dom using to stick with something in the standard library elementtree or a third-party package but zero trouble to install and very popular beautifulsoup by all means stick with its 3.0.x release unless you re using python 3

post	get
you could use a server side language to check for a post or get variable and if it exists include the table in the html

3457047
sum	floor
floor 3 + 0.5 is not a very good example because 3 0.5 and their sum are all exactly representable in any real-world floating point format

3457081
int	chars
aside from using int rather than unsigned chars for the type and thereby wasting 768 bytes i consider this a very good idea implementation

3457097

3457180
disk	ram
hard disk speed is a large factor when initially loading the project but for every compilation run after that a machine with sufficient ram doesn t need to touch the hard disk at all - all your source files will be cached by the os

3457180
disk	ram
moving the obj directory to a ram disk can be more efficient without having to buy new hardware if i o really is a problem - but it usually isn t

pop-up	dialog
i m develop a download manager function which the dialog will pop-up when the the item was finished download

3457412

client-side	server-side
it sounds like you aren t url-encoding the json at the client-side so the server-side is treating as a path delimiter

3457731
int	double	int	chars
however due to promotions chars and short are promoted to int float is promoted to double and to the fact that c expects an int no casts are nessary in the following printf call

3457903
mousemove	mousedown
this is not ideal though - if the mouse button is pressed when the mouse is hovering over another control on the form then it doesn t appear in the mousemove event that the button is pressed as hans pointed out the other control captures the mousedown

3457903
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
if that s a problem then combining the hit test in mousemove while separately tracking mousedown and mouseup on the form should work

hi i am using jquery to expand collapse my links.for this i am using show hide functions from jquery

3459217

3459508
getter	setter
when you make a property the flex will read the getter whenever its setter is called ie when the property is updated

if you want to increase the area by 20 multiplied by 1.20 multiply both the width and height by the square root of 1.20

3460020
getter	setter
basically it was a map instead of a pojo having a number of getter and setter

another way to do it would be to set the region of interested on the bigger image using the width height of the smaller cvsetimageroi will do that and then perform the blend with cvaddweighted

3460370
stdout	stderr
the problem is errors are written to stderr instead of stdout

3460534
google-chrome	firefox
are you using two seperate browsers say firefox and google-chrome

tstringgrid	tdbgrid
mxexport can export a tdataset tstringgrid and tdbgrid to differents file formats including rtf and ms word

3460704
getter	setter
public properties don t need getter setter methods but it makes you slightly more prone to errors

3460704
accessor	properties
using accessor also let you enforce validation on data whereas setting public properties directly can allow any data to be set

3460704
getter	setter
if you take advantage of php s magic functions you can write a dynamic getter setter method for access to private protected properties

3460897
ready	each
as i see it in the case of 1 although each master acts as a branch everyone is expected to merge between each other s work with a mostly linear flow whereas in 2 everyone is expected to merge a common master into their branch and push changes from their branch into a common master when they are ready

you can then combine two unsigned 16 bit integers into a 32 bit integer very easily

3461141
integer	unsigned
alternatively you can just convert each code unit into a 32 bit unsigned integer to start with and shift and combine in the same way

express	node.js
2 blog rolling with mongodb express and node.js

3461169

hide	show
put them each in a div and hide show those divs as appropriate

3461199
getter	setter
i believe i understand what java beans are java class es which contain a no-arg constructor are serializable and expose their fields with getter and setter

3461199
getter	setter
but most curious is the requirement to have fields all accessible via getter and setter

3461199
getter	setter
if it s an issue with doing more than simply setting the value couldn t the reflection use a getter setter over a field if the method exists

3461201
firefox	safari
the above works perfectly in firefox and safari giving a me a rounded fieldset with desired border shape size color and the correct background color

3461219
getter	setter
getter setter are frowned upon in most scripting languages

3461219
getter	setter
the use case for getter setter are elaborate filtering and validation schemes

3461219
getter	setter
unless you come up with a concrete attribute it doesn t make sense to prepare hollow setter getter seldomly transform the values anyway

3461263

it has filtering which i think are equivalent to xcode s grouping

3461326
folder	directory
they re sort of like folder within the project used to group files together but not actual directory on the file system

3461326
folder	directory
when you create a new project it will be given a new directory in the solution folder unless you provide it a path

3461326
filtering	grouping
and then you have filtering within the projects which are just used for grouping and have no effect on your files location in the file system

3461329
gif	ico	gif	png	png	ico
which successfully removes the x-powered-by header for css png jpg gif ico .aspx .htm .html shtml and js files

3461430
width	margin
the applied width is 50 of the parent container + border + padding + margin so this will behave differently at different widths but this kind of works

3461445
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i am experiencing no issues at all in safari ie google-chrome or firefox on my computer the menu is on top of the video as it should be but on the iphone and ipad - the flash content gets replaced with a big clickable youtube button that opens the youtube embed inside the youtube app and that big button is above the menu

hence just running through the chars in the absolute path of the uri for the image everything after the host from the first onwards adding them their int value to each other and then do use the modulo of that part of the hostname

3461507
hash	hmac
you must be sure to use a cryptographically secure hash algorithm with hmac i d suggest sha-224 or better and you must remember that although you can authenticate without revealing the key password this way your data still has to be transmitted in cleartext so this can t be used as a substitute to ssl for things like credit card transactions etc

3461511
folder	directory
i have a java project in eclipse that mirrors a directory structure on my hard drive and every time i open eclipse i have to manually open all of the folder to see the source files inside them

which is the same behaviour as stderr stdout redirection as on linux

3461603
jboss	glassfish	jboss	geronimo	glassfish	geronimo
originally persistance was something that required the use of an application server such as glassfish jboss geronimo etc. but afaik you can do use it in desktop apps with no server component

3461603
stateless	stateful
you use stateful session beans when you want the server to remember details about each client you will use stateless beans when you don t need to remember client specific details

3461624
for-loop	loops
changing the final part of the for-loop to i++ means it will perform one iteration each loops and stop once the twentieth iteration finished

3461635
int	chars
chars and signed chars are actually two distinct types unlike int and signed int which refer to the same signed int type

try-catch-finally	sqlexception
i m java beginner but i thought that when using try-catch-finally i don t have to declare the exception using throws sqlexception

3461787
getter	setter
even the more generic of the implementations abstractmbeaninfoassembler assumes getter and setter to get the jmx attribute values

3461881
for-loop	loops
so i figured i would loops down from 999 to 100 in a nested for-loop and do a test for the palindrome and then break out of the loops when i found the first one which should be the largest one

3461913
post	put
i m building wordpress e-commerce site using wp e-commerce plugin so i added facebook open graph protocol so now my site is connected to facebook and i can put facebook like button for the entire web site or for pages or for post but i want to add like button for all of the products of my sites i tried many plugins but none of them works for me

i m trying to take a 32bit int save each byte in an array of chars then reconstitute the int

3462489
mouseup	mousedown
i m not sure exactly what you re trying to accomplish but if you want an action to be repeated at set time intervals after the mousedown you could set a recurring nstimer in the mousedown method that gets cancelled as soon as there is a mousedragged or mouseup event

pull	push
push work to be done onto a queue object and have the thread pull it off and do it

3462775
serializable	deserialization
we have been using binaryserialization with our c# app but the size and complexity of the classes which need to be serializable results in sloooooow deserialization and large files

3462792
client-side	server-side
if you re controlling the iframe entirely client-side and never need to make server-side requests with that iframe it s proably easier to style a div to appear like an iframe look into the overflow property where you ll have far simpler and more direct control to the dom contents of that div

i would like to be able to add another jmenuitem - about - to the far right-hand side of the jmenubar

3463053
getter	setter
creating a getter setter method for each function is not plausible imho

3463072
google-chrome	safari
as an added note the versions of websockets that currently are implemented in google-chrome and safari are two different drafts and work on the current draft is still under very heavy development so i don t even believe it is realistic to say that websockets support is functional at the moment

3463072
firefox	safari
the currently shipping version of safari has a broken implementation it doesn t send the right header firefox 4 has just deprecated websockets so it won t ship enabled and ie9 isn t looking good either

3463083
sum	datepart
i m using them because i think it s easier to understand the individual components than one big select where you refer to datepart mm o.orderdate and sum od.quantity everywhere

3463103

3463230
opera	firefox
however i tried to launch the applet with opera instead of firefox and it appears that opera doesn t let my applet use its php session and as java or at least icedtea doesn t handle php sessions itself i can t make my applet work

3463270

in short when placing an custom extended class of nsview with an overload implementation of - void mouseup nsevent theevent the mouseup doesn t get called when its wrapped in nssplitview

3463303

3463423
mouse	keyboard
here is a project codeproject processing global mouse and keyboard hooks in c# to get you started

3463423
mouse	keyboard
you can do something like this once the keyboard and mouse haven t been used for x minutes

hide	show
very easy to use and gives the website the little extra if you add values to hide and show

3463492
versioning	upgrade
even better have no database at all and have your application be capable of deploying the database itself using a schema versioning upgrade set of scripts

3463500

the difference between the forms is that exit and return from main calls functions registered using atexit or on_exit before really terminating the process while _exit from or its synonymous _exit from terminates the process immediately

3463562
post	get
abort is mostly useful in debug mode with the purpose to immediately stop the program and get a stack trace for post mortem analysis

3463568
inherited	properties
essentially the most useful purpose of partial methods is for a code generation system to provide an api for extending the capability of its properties and methods without using inherited

3463577
inherited	subclassing
they might have an object.create method somehwere in the form of .clone or something but it s obscured from the tutorials and documentation in respect to object inherited and subclassing

3463620
versioning	upgrade
your ui_tabs css jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.css should be upgrade to the equivalent 1.8 versioning you can find a url to to this in the top of the css file assuming you haven t modified it afterwards that link will take you to themeroller with the same color image configuration so you can get the generated 1.8+ versioning

jsf	wicket
keep in mind scopetype.page makes sense when you have a server-side based component model framework such as jsf wicket and so on.

3463793
int	chars
c is int above since eof is a negative number and a plain chars may be unsigned

3463799

bash	zsh
to the best of my understanding your question coproc s available in zsh ksh and also bash v4+ might be similar to what you have in mind

you should have a serializable deserialization mechanism for class person first

3464065
equals	gethashcode
validationresult should have overriden equals and gethashcode

3464069
put	get
you have to grab it from the operationdescription objects when you re applying your custom behavior to insert your idispatchmessageinspector implementation and put it somewhere you inspector can get at

3464093
put	get
you get the idea just put the appropriate version in

3464116

post	get
to get ours working on the iphone side we set the post data in a nsstring as base64 encoded then sent it to our server as a http request

3464216

unfortunately this simple native app does not have any complex functionality multitasking backgrounding audio nor is there any way to add it

3464250
backgrounding	multitasking
so if you want multitasking or backgrounding audio you cannot enable full screen mode

3464278
processors	hyperthreading
what i am trying to do is find out if there is a way to determine the number of cores in the processors not including hyperthreading as a core

3464278
processors	hyperthreading
for example on a dual core hyperthreading processors system.environment.processorcount will return 4 because there are 2 physical cores both with hyperthreading

3464315
getter	setter
also note that java has no concept of proper properties either and typical good practice is to use getter setter and to not name your variables starting with upper-case letters

3464338
min	max
the most common solution to this is to determine a min max of both lat and long and then do a predicate based on those

3464338
instances	transient
for instances you could have a transient value called currentpoint and you could then kvo on the resulting array such as

3464361
operands	decrement
the operands of the preï x increment or decrement operator shall have qualiï ed or unqualiï ed real or pointer type and shall be a modiï able lvalue

hide	show
the button show or hide a panel containing the dynamic control list

3464481
bash	tcsh

3464709
post	get
get values have to come from the url somehow so if you want your inputs completely hidden you ll have to use post instead

3464734
int	chars	unsigned	short
the difference would be even more extreme if i wanted to keep each possible original numeric type separately signed chars short int long long long unsigned chars unsigned short ... rather than converting them up to the largest signed unsigned floating point type before storing them

3464764
folder	directory
you need to delete the folder of the specific plugin from the wp-content plugins directory and then upload the older version

3464776
xmltype	clob
but why store xml as clob rather than xmltype

3464788
typedef	struct

see here for some reasons click on the error correcting category on the right-hand side to get a lot more crc-related post

3464848
initializer	class-method
the class is not meant to be initializer directly though it s ok to do so by passing an open sqlite3 connection to a db with an appropriate sqlitedict table but through the two class-method create to make a new db or wipe out an existing one and open which seems to match the op s desires better than the alternative have __init__ take a db file path an an option string describing how to open it just like modules such as gdbm take -- r to open read-only c to create or wipe out w to open read-write -- easy to adjust of course

3464849

3465031
division	modulo
use of signed division modulo in general with negative numbers since c s version of it disagrees with the usual algebraic definition when a negative number is divided by a positive one and rarely gives the desired result

3465057
put	get
for example if you put the function definition inside a function you get a new copy of the function each time

3465098
integer	unsigned
i have a 64-bit unsigned integer with exactly 1 bit set

3465115
cos	sin
an example is if i have two menus sin x with slot 0 and cos x with slot 1 both click events pass 1 to settrackedline no matter if sin x was clicked or cos x was

3465149
width	height
the reason you can t change an empty object s width and height is that they are ultimately derived properties

3465149
width	height
along with the object s content scalex and scaley are what really determines the object s size - width and height are really just convenient ways to adjust the scale

getter	setter
is there a plugin that i can hide or fold setter and getter

3465406
getter	setter
i know there re some libraries can eliminate setter and getter by using annotations or aop techniques this is not allowed in my project

3465421
getter	setter
i d rather place the business methods above the setter and getter and place something like this between them

3465428
dictionary	map
to map a point to an object you would need to wrap the point in an nsvalue object and use that as the key in a dictionary

3465455
width	height
you should add inline getters for the width and height instead of public const member variables

3465467
getter	setter
- control folds getter setter main methods constructors other methods separately

3465553
for-loop	loops
if you still don t want to you can create a scrollview plus a header in a textview in your xml for instance and then in your java you use a for-loop or a while to loops on your database result and every time you have one set of data ready you create a new textview and add it to the scroolview

it returns an int because it needs to return eof which is not a chars

3465581
int	chars
to get around this many functions that give you back a chars will actually give you an int and use one of the int values which don t have an actual chars equivalent such as -1

3465608
getter	setter
you can extend the class and access instance variables throught method accessors getter setter if they are public

3465687
inherited	subclassing	public	protected
the core concept of inherited is that as a subclassing you get all of your parent class s public and protected members included in your subclassing for free

if you have too many getter and setter confusing you with business methods it sounds like it is time to refactor into two separate classes

3465778
inherited	properties
by default a winform app will inherited windows theme but you can explicitly change some ui properties like color font etc

3465808

3466524
apache	lighttpd
i have read in a site that another benefit of having lighttpd in front of apache is lower number of child processes

3466524
apache	lighttpd
lighttpd will handle keep-alive and client requests while child processes of apache gets to serve dynamic pages faster because of the very low latency communication between lighttpd and apache

3466524
apache	lighttpd
given that i already have a dedicated lighttpd server for my static contents img vid css js html etc. and another dedicated apache server for my dynamic pages php i would like to implement this technique if it really has some performance gain

3466524
apache	lighttpd
1 has anybody put a lighttpd in front of apache for the same purpose as explained above

3466524
apache	lighttpd
3 what about the overhead of lighttpd handling down the request to apache is it really worth it

3466573
apache	lighttpd
lighttpd is great for a static cdn coupled with apache for the database-interactive scripts

3466597

3467225
post	get
it s common behaviour for a client to pre-emptively send the authentication if it has already has a request from the same server rejected with a 401 with in the same session - i am unsure if asihttprequest does this but if it does one solution would be to make a get request to the server before you do the post

3467225
post	get
if the get is successfully authenticated then the cached credentials should be sent for the post and hence there won t be a 401 error

3467447
int	chars
it either returns eof or an int that is within the range of chars

3467447
int	chars
getchar returns an int because it can return any chars 256 choices + eof for a total of 257 choices which can t be represented in a chars

3467447

post	get	hide	show
the original idea for designing this is to have several tab links that show hide corresponding divs to have search functionality in a partial view reused in two divs and to update the search results using ajax so that an entire order can be created without multiple post to server only using some ajax calls to get data to limit load on server

3468424

now the button would create a new tabitem your custom-created one perhaps and add it to the observablecollection of tabs you have as the itemssource for your tabcontrol

3469953
fast-forward	merge
when there are no changes on trunk git does a fast-forward merge and simply sets the local master branch to the commit on your branch

3469953
fast-forward	merge
git-svn doesn t know how to commit fast-forward merge back to trunk in fact it thinks master now is pointing to the svn branch

3469957

3469975
min	max
i want to add vertical rectangles behind each plot that are horizontally positioned by the min and max starttimes of each fcycle where fphase dark

3469996
inject	interceptor
when you inject interceptor into a handlermapping bean those interceptor apply to every handler mapped by that handlermapping

3470037
memcpy	memmove
unless i m misunderstanding the question you should probably just use memcpy or memmove

3470045
getter	setter
in order to serialise an object into application settings each type involved in your case both parent and child must have a public default constructor and the properties that need serialising must have public getter and setter procedures

3470068
gridview	repeater
i have a gridview that displays all trips - within that gridview i have a repeater that displays the countries visited during that trip one to many

3470076
stdout	stderr

3470119
int	chars
why we need a in scanf for inputting int and why not for chars

3470160
google-chrome	firefox

3470168
width	height
i ve tried adding a width on #brz #slv and #gld and i ve tried adding a height to each

3470183
int	chars
which is true since a chars is basically an int

3470184
ready	each
then i can start immediately a thread for each function but the actual work of each function will start only when it s ready

3470233
google-chrome	firefox
you can play this all day long in firefox google-chrome etc

3470239
int	chars
your chars stream is also an int it stores the location in memory of a block of chars type either a single chars or the first chars in a continuous block

3470239
strlen	strcpy
because you are working with strings you could also make use of the strcpy function potentially paired with strlen

3470242
folder	directory
move them as well as the jar s in folder 2 1 to a single directory named lib

3470278
post	get
if you get stuck with this please post a question on our forums .we re happy to help you

3470294
min	max
...would generate the same sql - it s certainly more readable but linq may potentially execute the min max queries immediately as the value is being stored in a double - it s possible that by defining the type of minsize maxsize implicitly it would treat it as an iqueryable of double

3470300
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
anyway the problem is that this code functions fine in ie7 firefox google-chrome opera etc

3470453
google-chrome	safari
as i understand it both safari and google-chrome use webkit

3470453
google-chrome	safari
presumably webkit doesn t handle things like font and control rendering or google-chrome and safari on windows would look identical and yet they don t safari has that fuzzy text thing going on among other differences

3470512
postgresql	mysql
between is ansi standard and always inclusive - oracle sql server mysql postgresql sqlite will all return the same data assuming similar data type

3470513
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome do indeed look different but that s because they both have different implementations of webkit

3470513
google-chrome	safari
awesomiumdotnet provides its own implementation just as google-chrome and safari do of control rendering

3470518
vim	emacs
is there a standard option built into visual studio to act like the vim scrolloff option or the emacs scroll-margin option

3470560
nunit	mstest

3470564
sorting	grouping
try sorting by status value or grouping and return the min

3470571

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in some of the more up-to-date browsers that support html5 firefox google-chrome safari the multiple attribute will work

3470623
hash	salt
the reason is that an attacker could try all likely passwords dictionary words people s names etc. the standard solution to this problem is to concatenate the password with a random string called a salt before computing the hash you do someting like sha.digest salt+password .getbytes

3470623
hash	salt
the salt makes it impratical for the attacker to precompute all hash of likely passwords

3470623
hash	salt
usually the salt randomly generated when the user chooses his her password and it is stored next to the password hash in a user database but from what you show of your scheme there is no such thing

3470624
for-loop	arrays
when i go through the for-loop to look at each element of the arrays containing the images the uiviews overlap and show one photograph on top of the other i would like to know how to separate them into the next section of the paging scroll view

3470918
alertdialog	progressdialog
user clicks button progressdialog appears alertdialog appears user rotates the device

3470918
alertdialog	progressdialog
now this is where it goes bad - now the alertdialog is behind the progressdialog and the progressdialog is in front

3470918
alertdialog	progressdialog
there s no way to close the progressdialog since it closes when the user clicks ok in the alertdialog

3471034

you had a better chance with kohana 2.3.4 as it was derived from codeigniter and was similar

3471106
implements	sealed
this is reason enough to not use this particular convention in my book except in the vanishingly small number of cases where i create sealed classes that implements property-change notification

3471116
touchesmoved	touchescancelled
in touchesmoved withevent forward the touch to the relevant subview but if you detect a gesture forget the subview that owns the touch and instead call touchescancelled withevent

3471134
children	parent
but this only returns the first level of children i want the parent node and all downstream nodes

3471168
nsstring	nsdata
initwithdata expects to be passed an nsdata object therefore you should convert response to an nsdata which is currently an nsstring with something like

3471177
alertdialog	progressdialog
note that even if it does i d still advise just dismissing the progressdialog before showing the alertdialog since android doesn t specify the order the dialogs will be re-shown in on state restore

3471237
capitalize	uppercase
capitalize transforms every first letter of a word to uppercase but it does not transform the other letters to lowercase

3471260

3471273
puts	gets
i want to build a tracker application where the end user gets a js code which he puts on his website

3471297
post	get
if all that fails go to the fiddler group and post a question you ll normally get a pretty quick response from eric lawrence himself

3471301

int	double
public employee int e_no string e_name double e_sal

3471349
solaris	procfs
on the off-chance that you re running on solaris there s solaris procfs

3471472
gif	png
png gif etc

3471491
stdout	stderr
you re going to have to call to get it to show output again or alternatively have the task print to stderr instead of stdout

3471537
children	parent
the parent process can wait 2 for its children to terminate

3471537
stdout	stderr
now the shell has its stdin stdout and stderr connected to a terminal emulator inherited from login 1 process on the console or dynamically allocated by a network daemon like sshd or a window manager x

3471608
getter	setter
i am aware that in cases such as this one has to generate an cil for both getter and setter methods of a property by using an ilgenerator

3471621
hid	keyboard
also if the scanner uses bluetooth it might work on the bluetooth hid profile which would mean that your os would see it as a keyboard

3471627
put	get
if a person can only be a member of one group then get rid of the groupmembership table and just put a groupid on the people table

3471675
width	height
edit - current solution to keeping points inside a bounding box 0 0 width height

3471695
decoder	encoder
it will be encoded but you can use a utility like url decoder encoder to decoder it to a proper guid

3471738
inherited	properties
this basically makes any textelement control written by this presenter to inherited this properties

3471741
getter	setter
i use it since i m lazy and don t want the to spend half of my working life writing getter and setter

3471823
submit	submission
the normal behavior for a is to act as a submit button so my guess is that this is triggering a form submission to the current page

3471828
unsigned	short
there s unsigned char for 8 bits unsigned short for 16 bits and unsigned long for 32 bits plus signed variants

3471835
serializable	deserialization
what i think i want is for the process to have its dependency filled with a serializable proxy that points with a transient reference to the repository and upon deserialization can find the repository again

3471862
folder	directory
you can also point iis to the project directory in the visual studio projects folder

3471871
int	chars
unsigned chars is generally a better choice for a bool than an int particularly if you are going to have an array of 1000 of them

3471880
bufferedoutputstream	inputstream
i have a commandbutton that will invoke a function to download a file standard stuffs like inputstream bufferedoutputstream ... after download success at the end of the function i change some values of the current object and persist it into database

3471894
int	chars
basically itâ s a pretty big flattened table or viewâ most of the columns are int bit chars 3 or short varchar s

3471947
put	get
so when you put everything you learned above together you can get json code like this

3471962

inherited	properties
i am experiance the same exact problem i am trying to have the content presenter set the inherited dependence properties

3472100
allocator	stl
i m not exactly sure how to do exactly what you re asking but you can achieve your own allocator semantics in the stl by using a custom allocator

3472100
allocator	stl
i think i remember when i was looking at the hans-bohen gc for c++ that the library would replace new delete with a gc version but you still had to pass an allocator to the stl structures you wished to use

3472107
public	protected
imagine this is a public open source project you can allow check-out for anybody but only expect contributions through patches or bug reports also the copy is put on a public server and the main one is kept in a protected private network

width	height
i m laying out a tabbed ui on the side of a webpage and i ve done the whole thing using percentage values for height width of tables divs and trs

3472160
setinterval	settimeout
thing is settimeout and setinterval time is not reliable especially with alerts

3472160
setinterval	settimeout
furthermore settimeout and setinterval do not interrupt currently running code to guarantee perfect timing they will wait till the javascript thread has an opening and jump between code executions

3472254
getter	setter	mutators	setter	mutators	getter
this type of method is known as a setter or mutators as opposed to a getter or accessor

3472403
pop-up	dialog
opens up a pop-up dialog to open or save excel returned from struts 2 result

3472411
uiview	subviews
in my experience you re better off having a uiview as a root view and then a uiscrollview as the one and only screen-filling subviews of that view

3472411
uiview	subviews
design the uiview separately and drag drop it into place as a subviews of the scrollview in the document-window

3472430
virtualenv	setuptools
i ve just started working with setuptools and virtualenv

3472450

serializable	deserialization
is there a way of telling the serializable to populate the existing object on deserialization or am i going to have to create a custom serializable

3472496
actualheight	actualwidth
nevermind i finally managed to figure it out using a combination of layoutinformation.getlayoutslot although i probably could have used either actualwidth actualheight or rendersize and uielement.translatepoint

3472535
decoder	encoder
use this base64 encoder decoder which will wrap your file input stream and handle the decoding on the fly

3472583
put	get
you might be able to use that to get you from string to form then manipulate then put it back out to a string

3472586
required	placeholder
note that we required a reserved placeholder character in this case _ which you wouldn t want in your keywords

3472586
put	get
the trick is to get those out of the way when the reader is crunching on the vector string then put them back

3472593
range	min	range	max	min	max
first the app in question can use a really wide range of ram depending on what the user is doing so the conceptual min and max values are pretty far apart

3472619
emacs	aquamacs
personally i avoid aquamacs like the plague if it was a better mac style implementation of emacs ie

3472623
many-to-one	one-to-many
judging by your database design you actually have a one-to-many - many-to-one relationship structure going on not a one-to-one

3472625
powerpc	i386
for this and other reasons the current plan is to change the 32-bit 64-bit variant in future releases to only support 10.6 or higher and only include 32-bit i386 and 64-bit x86_64 support no powerpc

3472726
put	get
put this in a while loop and as soon as you get a charindex return of greater than zero exit the loop

3472775
stdout	stderr
off the top of my head stdin is 0 stdout is 1 and stderr is 2 but double check

3472779
google-chrome	firefox
maybe that s the root of the problem in firefox the handler sometimes returns true so the link is followed while on google-chrome it returns false and the post is executed but the link is not followed

3472837
post	get
from the above listed post this works very well to get any number of dates from a given start date

3472838
mousemove	mousedown
this means that you need to use the event from the mousedown and not the mousemove

3472908
children	parent
if you need an acl-only solution you have to create a parent aco to which all other acos you want to allow are children

another thing to try is to enumerate all the child windows and find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates don t forget to include the width and height of each child window

3473139

in google-chrome and firefox success2 is being held up until success1 completes -

3476545
google-chrome	firefox
any idea why there is the delay in firefox and google-chrome and what we might do to diagnose fix this

get post are not related at least not directly to php ajax jquery or similar

3477402
post	get
and there s much more to http protocol than just get and post

3477406
post	get
post and get are two http request methods

3477414
post	get
also if you are using post variables across navigation of pages the user will get a warning asking if they want to resubmit the post parameter

3477414
post	get
typically they look the same in an http request but you should just stick to post if you need to post something to a server and get if you need to get something from a server as that s the way they were intended

3477420
post	get
the only big difference between post get when using them with ajax is since get is url provided they are limited in ther length since url arent infinite in length

3477423
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	solaris	bsd
on modern unix bsd solaris linux macosx etc the ssh daemon comes pre-installed by default

3477456
post	get
a post unlike a get typically has relevant information in the body of the request

3477456
post	get
a get should not have a body so aside from cookies the only place to pass info is in the url. besides keeping the url relatively cleaner post also lets you send much more information as urls are limited in length for all practical purposes and lets you send just about any type of data file upload forms for example can t use get -- they have to use post plus a special content type encoding

3477520
post	get
get requests expose parameters to users post does as well but they are less visible

3477582
portrait	landscape
the answer is always that the device is in portrait orientation even if i clearly have it in landscape

3477620
width	margin
you might be able to use margin-right on both divs but fix the width of the parent and set overflow to hidden in order to chop off the extended margin - but i m not sure about compatibility on that kind of thing

3477637
folder	directory
now about your directory structure first question your majorclasses folder is inside application

3477637
folder	directory
within majorclasses folder you will now have to create a directory for each namespace

3477640
pop-up	dialog
this code works fine when using outlook meaning that it pop-up a new email dialog and returns the correct error code if user for example decides not to send the message by closing the message dialog

3477652
free	malloc
then when at any point program s malloc returns null you free the 5 megabytes and call malloc again which will succeed and let the program continue running

3477704
int	boolean
i m using a record composed of strings boolean int currencies and arrays of other records inside a method of a class

3477712
free	malloc
keep in mind that when you are getting null from malloc it means both physical and virtual memory have no more free space meaning your program is swapping all the time making it slow and the computer unresponsive

3477724
post	get
use post instead of get

3477733
equals	gethashcode
objects that implement equals and gethashcode correctly

3477791
versioning	upgrade
we did use httpclient 3.1 but run into problems due to the change in ntlm protocol with newer versioning of windows so we upgrade to the latest versioning

3477796
implements	extends
it s mostly used as a scripting tool in apps to extends or implements functionalities

3477800
superclass	subclassing
casting from a subclassing to its superclass is allowed

3477804
logmein	hamachi
the machines are vpn d together using logmein hamachi

3477853
hide	show
i have a tabbed layout that show hide sections when a tab is clicked

3477853
hide	show
tab click event this show hide sections based on tab clicks or if you append

3477896
gif	png
using a gif or png function will create an image containing the text a simple text string as expected

3477896
gif	png
gif and png functions work fine and as expected

3477900
google-chrome	firefox
it appears this code will request the file in google-chrome and ie but not in firefox

3477924
width	height
to start cgrect is a structure that has 4 parameters x origin y origin width height

3477924
uiview	uiwindow
the reason you could not find initwithframe in uiwindow docs is because it inherits the method from uiview

3477924
uiview	uiwindow
pointers if you are in xcode and right click on an api defined class uiview uiwindow cgrect etc you can go to find text in documentation and the apple docs for the class will pop right up in xcode

3477940
int	chars
foo never changes in size because it doesn t have a chars array or an int array

3477940
int	chars
rather it has a string object which in turn probably has a pointer to a chars array and a pointer to int

3477944
width	height
the width and height reported by the canvas seems to be scaled by the screen density

3477952
free	malloc
if you re writing c++ you should be using new and delete instead of malloc and free

3478021
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
we have some javascript code that resizes elements adjusts height width padding margin etc. based on the dimensions of a parent element specifically the height and width of the parent we use in the calculation

3478021
width	height
the parent div height and width is defined in a external css file and is used to include the stylesheet in the section of the page

3478021
width	height
however in safari 5 occasionally the resizing fails because the parent height width is incorrect which appears to be because the stylesheet has not loaded before the javascript

3478021
put	get
i can put the resizing code inside a settimeout and delay it by 1 second or so and get it to work reliably but this is not a releasable solution because it is too slow and still varies by machine

3478021
width	height
i m considering trying to place the height and width inline so it is rendered from the server but this requires significant app code change and tighter coupling to the ui and i d like to avoid inline style if possible

3478028
outputstream	inputstream
the streams in java - subclasses of inputstream and outputstream are perfect examples of the decorator pattern

3478139
updatepanel	scriptmanager
to execute the init everytime the updatepanel changes you need to register the script using scriptmanager

3478147
webrat	cucumber
adding in a then show me the page step in cucumber so the page that webrat sees opens in the browser showed the you are being redirected. response with a link to an example.org link

3478156
alertdialog	progressdialog
when the server responds the progressdialog is dismissed and an alertdialog is shown

3478166
put	get
when i put two new namedpipeserverstream in the same executable i get the same error.

3478174
put	get
use url.action to get the url and then you can put insert the hyperlinked image normally rather than trying to use html.actionlink

3478183
division	modulo
using modulo division i feel like people have forgot about this guy

3478191
cassini	iis
the default asp.net web server that launches from within visual studio cassini is a little buggy on my development machine so i like to publish to a local iis instance on my dev machine and look at the web application there

3478214
accessor	properties
note your current implementation leaves you no way to assign values to these properties so you probably want to add a private or protected set accessor to the class properties

3478267
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the idea is to click on a dropdownlistfor change which then invert twice a collection of checkbox by using the click function of them

3478279
getter	setter
i usually try to go for roy osherove s method and only test things with logic not straight getter setter or pass-throughs

3478304
getter	setter
for example you may consider that it s not useful to test setter and getter

3478364
width	height
whenever i want to animate height or width without setting a fixed value as when collapsing expanding a panel i manage to do it by animating minwidth minheight maxwidth and maxheight properties instead

3478365
post	get
it is a post request not get

3478386
nl2br	htmlspecialchars
i read that it was best to use strip_tags htmlspecialchars and nl2br

3478395
free	malloc
as memory may become fragmented due to malloc free it becomes difficult at best in many cases to prove that future calls to malloc will not fail

3478460
ant	myeclipse
when i run an ant build myeclipse happens for v6.0 and 7.5 formats my code

3478460
ant	myeclipse
as far as i could determine there is nothing called by the ant build to do the formatting so it myeclipse doing it

3478469
ssl	https
i have a problem of ssl exception when i upload data to a https server

3478478
google-chrome	firefox
however by my testing resetting a javascript created element i m using prototype in my example but it shouldn t make a difference works in firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 5 without needed an additional onreset handler but not in ie6

3478529
client-side	server-side
that form attribute states that gets or sets a boolean value indicating whether to force controls disabled on the client to submit their values. so i think you need to use the client-side disabled property not the server-side enabled property as in

3478570
free	malloc
if the cause of memory exhaustion is lack of physical resources on the machine due to other processes using too much memory those other processes could claim the 5mb after you free it if the malloc implementation returns the space to the system

3478570
free	malloc
as we ve seen in the first paragraph due to race conditions your malloc 5mb and free it approach does not work

3478660
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome

3478675
width	height
i m developing a c# .net custom control and i want to prevent the user while in design mode from resizing the height while allowing them to reize the width

3478676
google-chrome	safari
i am trying to do a bulk transaction using sqlite on google-chrome and safari

3478698
jtree	jtable
i ve set up my frame with a jtree on the left and a jtable on the right and used a borderlayout to accomplish this

3478698
jtree	jtable
however as soon as i put any data in my jtable it expands to cover nearly the whole frame and my jtree with it

3478708
equals	gethashcode
the disadvantages i see is that you need to know to override the gethashcode and equals method for every scenario

3478726
getter	setter
ensure that after calling the .dispose method that all function and property getter setter return an objectdisposedexception

3478753
put	get
so to get around this i put the into the handler for the form s shown event

3478789
width	height
for it to work you have to make sure that the width or height properties actually have a value this depends on your particular application so it s difficult to help you without having more info

3478801
post	get
i found the answer to my own question thanks to the help in this post is there a way to get error feedback on asynchronous wcf calls

3478815
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
events like manualresetevent or autoresetevent

3478832
width	margin
if you want to change more you can keep the margin by removing the width property from your label and the .masterstyle and then adding a float right style to the div

3478848
put	get
note because i don t know where you get your categories to test i put those inline in the stylesheet

3478869
post	get
i can see you are calling executing a get from a while you have given code of handling post in b

3478891
jobs	cron
in the cron jobs list i call the shell script

3478911
ssl	https
how can i enable ssl https only on some pages of my drupal website

3478974
websphere	ibm
how do i convert lookup a reason code of ibm websphere mqseries to its explanation for logging etc

3479032
int	boolean
this also means that wherever the compiler generates code to translate such a pointer to an int or a boolean it must be taking care to look for that special bit pattern

3479102
hash	md5
the md5 digest creates a cryptographic hash of the data supplied to it

3479102
hash	md5
what you need to do is take the encoding md5 hash then base64 encode you did on the original password and apply it to the newly supplied password

3479102
hash	md5
the point of cryptographic hash like md5 is to make that very difficult

3479102
hash	md5
on the other hand md5 is not considered a very secure hash anymore

3479102
hash	md5
you d be better off using sha1 or sha256 but remember you can t change the existing stored passwords from their md5 hash to another hash without the original password which you don t have you can t just convert your database of stored passwords

3479109
xlib	xcb
whatever you do use xcb and not xlib

3479111
hash	md5
the md5 hash algorithm is like all hash algorithms one-way

3479111
hash	md5
the only way to recover the original password is to try every possibility until you get the one whose md5 hash matches what you received

3479120
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
you can simplify the code by using simple vector subtraction addition instead of the multiplication with a translation matrix

3479141
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
once you ve got an inputstreamreader you could create a bufferedreader and read the contents line by line or just read buffer-by-buffer and append to a stringbuilder until the read call returns -1

3479213
mouse	keyboard
i d like to play with multitouch on the emulator but my machine doesn t have multi touch support it s just a standard mouse keyboard setup

3479241
versioning	upgrade
i guess i m wondering if i need to upgrade one versioning at a time 2.0 3.5 4.0 or if i can just directly from 1.1 to 4.0

3479255
put	get
because if you do put it in a shared_ptr and it falls out of scope the object will get freed when the class may still need it

3479283
primefaces	openfaces
as far now primefaces and openfaces are one of the few with full jsf 2.0 support

3479328
width	height
get the real width and height of an image with javascript

3479328
google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome

3479349
put	get
in the get you can put whatever data retrieval code you need

3479383
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in firefox google-chrome and safari the characters appear exactly as expected

3479396
onclick	onchange
try the onclick event rather than the onchange event

3479430
pecl	pear
as you re using maxmind s geoip service have you looked at their pure-php library on pear or the c implementation on pecl

3479432
firefox	safari
this works for firefox and others but not safari

3479449
retaincount	dealloc
this causes the runtime to not dealloc objects and instead complains if you send messages to objects with 0 retaincount

3479456
ironruby	ironpython
i ve read that with .net 4 it s easy to make your program scriptable via dynamic languages like ironruby and ironpython or even vb or c# which might be more confusing for a user

3479456
dynamic-languages	compiled-language
is that a dynamic-languages or a compiled-language and to allow my application to be scriptable via vb for applications would i have to support com ole

3479456
ironruby	ironpython
i think i m leaning towards supporting ironruby and ironpython since it seems simple to implement support for them but can those languages also be used to script windows or other applications in general and thus scripts for your application could have more features than what you laid out

3479496
free	malloc
also the design must of course take into account that free needs to make space available to malloc again somehow

3479507
super	extends
if you extract a strategy instead of extends a super class the problem is gone

3479535
onmouseover	onclick
i removed the onclick behavior in place of the toggle and the onmouseover is for an effect on a different image

3479548
memcached	apc
what many user do is store the bad words in the database or a file and read them into a cache such as memcached or apc and then look to see if they are in the cache first and if they are not read from file and then put them into the cache

3479570
free	malloc
simplistically malloc and free work like this

3479570
free	malloc
when there is no memory left on the free list for a desired allocation malloc calls brk or sbrk which are the system calls requesting more memory pages from the operating system

3479602
folder	directory
manually create a new virtual directory within iis that points to the folder you created

3479610
allocator	stl
it seems to shield my bundle plug-in from stl specializations implementations that inlined their allocator

3479662
spaces	delimiter
the usebackq makes the backticks delimit a command to execute instead of searching a literal string or file tokens sets the number of variables to place the parsed line in starting with i and delims sets the delimiter including the trailing spaces used to parse the line into those tokens

3479693
filtering	grouping
what i want to do is take a certain grouping of entries filtering by card and rec_date then determine how long the person has been working during the day and the length of each workspan how many breaks he she has taken and at the end of the week get the total number of hours worked

3479797
versioning	upgrade
instead to upgrade an existing package the right approach is to install a new versioning in a separate location say usr local and invoke the new versioning by an absolute path reference usr local bin ruby or manipulating the shell path environment variable if necessary

3479797
macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew	fink	macports
many people prefer to use one of the 3rd-party open source package distributors such as macports fink or homebrew each of which has its own package manager and installation locations

3479802
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
i want these 3 panels to always be completely visible i m planning to limit the expansion of the splitter so the form cannot expand beyond the screen is this possible or should i just create my own control and adjust the size of things using the mousedown mouseup and mousemove events

3479806
for-loop	arrays
add a condition to the for-loop to exclude any class type contains in the excludetypes arrays

3479820
consistency	acid
no guaranteed acid properties but so-called eventual consistency meaning that the stored data may not always be consistent across servers

3479850
sum	floor
this means that sum floor a d for a in interval_lengths must be larger than or equal to n + s where n is the number of points we want to add and s is the number of points already there

3479885
filesystems	hfs+
as it turns out and no surprise here android can t handle the hfs+ filesystems

3479887
matplotlib	scipy
note because of other problems i just installed a fresh copy of python26 matplotlib numpy scipy

3479913
hash	md5
if you re trying to compare the contents of the new password with the older passwords you can t use an md5 hash

3479913
hash	md5
as jherico noted md5 and all hash are one-way meaning that you can t get the original text

3479920
punctuation	words
basically i m breaking my words on any character in the punctuation p or separator z unicode character categories

3479940
punctuation	words
this solution might be overly simple in the way that it removes punctuation and parses words but should demonstrate the idea

3479965
hide	show
and the weird thing is if you don t use toggle or show hide position works perfectly

3479981
stdout	stderr
os.system does not let you parse stdout stderr

3480008
post	get
ok so one simple way of reducing the ability to hack your site would be to use post variables rather than get variables

3480025
margin	haslayout
my general-purpose fix for ie-6 padding margin issues was because we don t support it anymore to give the offending container element the ie-proprietary zoom property with a value of 100 to trigger haslayout

3480067
gridview	detailsview
basically let us assume i have a paged gridview with 10 items in it and something like a detailsview to edit those items

3480070
profiling	debugging
now you can start a debugging or profiling session using the zend studio browser toolbar or from the remote debugging or remote profiling buttons in studio

3480082
client-side	server-side
i d think that the order would be something like html css server-side client-side

3480100
vbscript	jscript
not sure about other scripting languages such as powershell or perl but in vbscript jscript there doesn t seem a way to do this

3480100
vbscript	jscript
first of all windows script host doesn t provide access to windows api so you can t intercept the wm_endsession and wm_queryendsession windows messages as suggested in the article you mentioned from vbscript jscript

3480180
mouseover	mouseout
perhaps if i can manually fire the mouseout event for the first column the reset will allow the mouseover event to fire properly

3480235
folder	directory
start the console windows xp run - type cmd and move to the platform-tools folder of sdk directory

3480245
explode	fgetcsv
fgetcsv explode regex

3480258
children	parent
one of the key notions in a parent child dimension is that though a father may have many children and grandchildren a child may only have one parent

3480281
for-loop	loops
i don t even know how to write a for-loop that would do what i need and i have the feeling that the r way would avoid for loops

3480284
passenger	unicorn
if you are looking at a new setup think about passenger or unicorn

3480324
ggplot2	lattice
in that cause lattice or ggplot2 will be very useful

3480341
powerpc	i386
i see right there with lipo that i386 and powerpc are both there but apparently it only likes i386

3480347
post	get
in snippets get and post parameters are part of the snippet lifecycle

3480368
width	height
i m playing around with a canvas inside of a viewbox and unforunately the only way to see the elements in the canvas i have to assign it a height and width

3480368
width	height
however the problem is that my height and width values come from my viewmodel via databinding

3480370
powerpc	i386
the output of lipo says that the size of the powerpc slice is just 246 bytes while the i386 x86_64 slices have 2 3 mega bytes each

3480371
stdout	stderr
after the cycle i want to close the stdout stderr window that the prints produced using python code

google-chrome	firefox
if you specify a strict dtd things work as you d expect in ie 8 firefox 3.6.4 and google-chrome 5

3480476
tcplistener	tcpclient
the server is made with the tcplistener class and the client is made with the tcpclient class

3480492
bitblt	gdi
bitblt is a gdi call not gdi+

3480554
stdout	stderr
this will certainly close stdout stderr at any rate

3480588
int	chars
is it possible to write a query where we get all those chars that could be parsed into int from any given string

3480662
google-chrome	firefox
it works on google-chrome and firefox on a mac - but then not firefox ie on pc

inherited	properties
when you write you are qualifying the dependency properties you want to set but it is still set on the contentpresenter and is not inherited by the combobox

3480975
post	get
when i get to the post i m not sure what to do

3480991
post	get
here is an example of how you could get all post tags for a user with one query

3480996
wordpress	joomla
wordpress drupal and joomla are all good choices for running a blog if you choose to use a dedicated hosting service hostclear etc. and they re all extremely well supported by their dedicated community

3480996
wordpress	joomla
and having tried both joomla and wordpress i found wordpress much easier to get started with

3480997
client-side	server-side
in regards to integrating your framework i work mostly with asp.net mvc and it would be interesting to see how it translate server-side validation logic into client-side constraints

3481004
spaces	delimiter
a name can only start with a letter character this includes underscore then the next characters can be letter characters ot numbers or the hyphen but the spaces is a delimiter and is not allowed as part of any name

3481024
sorting	filtering
if you are just displaying data in the grid and not supporing sorting and filtering it may be easy to just update the underlying table via javascript

3481032
folder	directory
as a rule it is best to limit the number of directory as google is supposed to add weight to pages that are higher level not nested in multiple folder

3481035
serializable	deserialization
you can implement the iserializable interface and provide a constructor which takes a serializationinfo and a streamingcontext object to gain a finegrain control of the serializable deserialization process

3481049
put	get
my filter needs to get the id of the object that i put in return redirect but unless i uncomment params.id fooinstance.id above my filter gets null for params.id i must be missing something dealing with scopes of the variable

3481092
int	double
the parse_ini_file function evaluates int values as php string even if they aren t enclosed in double quotes

3481104
int	double
i8lib implements double precision int arithmetic no more than 64 bits and might do you fine but i ve never used it

3481124
outputstream	inputstream
i found people talking about handelling outputstream inputstream and error stream if i

3481150
ironruby	ironpython
i ve read that with .net 4 it s easy to make your program scriptable via dynamic languages like ironruby and ironpython or even vb or c# which might be more confusing for a user

i ve tested both solutions locally with firefox 3.6 opera 10.6 and internet explorer 8

3481263
switching	screens
rather than print out an ordered list to the screens where the customer would see all this information how do i set up a switching to access certain indexs of the array and do something based on the text returned for the particular array index

3481313
postgresql	mysql
you said postgresql but this mysql tutorial covers the same basic concepts you ll want to keep in mind

3481343
int	chars
takes each chars from the input lines as an int

3481367
int	double
that wouldn t work on platforms where a double is less than 64 bits but it would work on many platforms without 64-bit int

3481444
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
referring to this apple forum thread uitabbarcontroller has multiple uiviewcontroller each of which has its own nib file assigned to it

hide	show
i can show or hide the plugin with this code

3481618
post	get
why would some one choose to use get vs post

3481618
post	get
i understand post is used for passwords and important info but i don t understand why you would use get instead of just post all the time

3481671
getter	setter
is it safe to say that if a class member does not need getter or setter functions then there s no point in making them properties and synthesizing them

3481672
width	height
in order for the images to load before the resize occurs so that the resize wouldn t find an incorrect width and height since it wouldn t have loaded yet instead of nesting it within the document ready function

3481682
hide	show
i ve tried to do a variety of things i ve seen here in stack overflow such as inotifyproperty a converter to hide the button which didn t show the button when i checked the check box and i ve tried to do things in the overridden_click fct such as findname - but have had no success

3481696
int	double
why exactly do they return double if it s always returning an int

3481699
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome on my macbook the video plays full screen in the background

google-chrome	firefox
while i thought that most browser compatibility issues were mostly browser based and not os based apparently the same site does not work in firefox and google-chrome on pc s

3481707
innodb	myisam
the amount of space you have to define indexes depends on the table engine - 1 000 for myisam and 767 for innodb

3481734
ceil	floor
an alternative explanation is that the .net math module uses code written in c in which floor and ceil return floating-point types

3481750
hide	show
i also can t find function for show hide a window. maybe i search through a wrong diretion...

3481801
getter	setter
to get around this i m checking both in the setter and the getter if the trasnform object passed is of type mytransform

3481801
implements	extends
implements ieventdispatcher since you can t directly extends eventdispatcher is what you want

3481812

3482035
keydown	keyup
how about binding to keyup instead of keydown keypress and insert the tab after native line break

3482053
post	get
i have it working with this code except that it toggles every post content lol because in the loop they all get the class you know what i mean

3482065
children	parent
the way i accomplished this was to first put my options into a multidimensional array where children are stored as an array of their parent s.

3482075
ssl	ntlm	kerberos	ntlm
one thing that is affected for sure by time difference is ntlm kerberos handshake as well as ssl all of which tolerate usually 30 minutes time drift between participants

3482078
realloc	malloc
if your requirements are simple you can just malloc and realloc a buffer

3482135
google-chrome	safari
every where its working fine but in safari and google-chrome the right image comes in next line and i am not able to understand why this is happening

3482178
128bit	64bit
however it is a large_integer 64bit not the full 128bit identifier

3482180

you should be able to for example add a uiimageview with your background image as a subview of your app s uiwindow underneath the uinavigationcontroller s view

3482227
hide	show
i have a delphi 2010 app which show hide the desktop icons under xp fine

3482266
stdout	stderr
if parent is capturing child s stdout and stderr as pipes is it still safe to read from them after child has terminated

3482275
folder	directory
for example a folder or directory is really little more than an analogy of the physical objects with the same names

3482315
implements	extends
for instance i know that there are decent implementations of parsers for the standard twitter syntax of mentions dms replies and so forth should what i am discussing extends that work or be implements entirely in parallel

3482389
cdr	cons
the primitives are atom quote eq car cdr cons cond lambda label apply

3482429
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar	portrait	landscape
if i use a uinavigationcontroller to display my uinavigationbar this bar is much slimmer in landscape mode than in portrait mode

3482429
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
everything fine so far as i want this behavior but i have one view which isn t handled by an uinavigationcontroller and so i just dragged and dropped a uinavigationbar from interface builder into the view but this one has always the same size and i can t see a way to tell the uinavigationbar that it should resize

3482434
min	max
when i logged threadpool parameters before invoking begininvoke it indicated that min threads 2 max threads 500 available threads 498

3482449
profiling	benchmarking
have a look at xdebug profiling to benchmarking the performance and more

3482492
folder	directory
install files that you plan to update to the programdata folder instead of the user defined directory and use this directory as an override folder

3482511
children	parent
instead of deleting all children of a parent node only the parent node has been removed

3482511
children	parent
i expected the childnodes to be removed automatically as well but when i changed the code to first delete children then the parent node the lagging vanished

3482538
mamp	wamp
to install wamp which stands for windows apache mysql php if you are running windows and lamp for linux or mamp for mac all of which are free softwares you can download wamp from the following link

background-repeat	background-position
lite-weight with background-repeat and background-position support

3482665
google-chrome	safari
apple provides some guidance on how to port convert a google-chrome extension to safari but the problem you re going to run into is that each browser has a different set of allowed functionality for extensions

3482665
google-chrome	safari
even with google-chrome to safari there are things you could do in google-chrome you can t do in safari and visa versa

3482683
next	except
the italicized part is what i m having trouble understanding because from my tests it looks like a java string can most certainly contain uffff and there doesn t seem to be any problem with it except obviously with the prescribed characteriterator traversal idiom that breaks because of a false positive next returns when it s not really done

3482698
int	chars
of course a java chars being just a 16-bit unsigned int doesn t really care about the value it holds as well

3482704
post	get
when i return a application models post i get

3482735
nl2br	htmlspecialchars
it should work okay to escape the string when storing it and applying nl2br possibly in combination with htmlspecialchars to prevent users from entering raw html when the data is output

3482737
move	drag
your most concurrent operations seem to be a user agent that will move a block and a timer that will drag it down to the floor

3482749
post	get
i do get a http 1.1 ok but the response text is the same page i posted to - the login page which suggests that my post did not actually succeed

3482749
post	get
do i first need to do a get parse the body extract these viewstate1--3 somefield and then reset it in the post body data bytes

3482756
cdr	cons
given x and l cons returns a new cons cell with x as the car of that cell and l as the cdr of that cell

3482762
cdr	cons
the two places in a cons cell are called car and cdr

3482762
cdr	cons
as you can see in such a structure the values are always in the car of a cons cell and the cdr points to the rest of the structure

3482762
cdr	cons
cons simply constructs another cons cell with x in the car and a reference to list in the cdr

3482774
children	parent
from what i can gather layout_gravity is the gravity of that view inside its parent and gravity is the gravity of the children inside that view

3482815
nhibernate	automapper
fluent nhibernate automapper

3482823
portrait	landscape
i am developing an application on ipad to read and annotate pdf s.my application is working fine in portrait landscape mode but when i rotates the device or simulator its giving me weired error wait_fences failed to receive reply 10004003 whenever i rotates either from landscape to portrait or from portrait to landscape

3482873
google-chrome	safari
this works fine apart from in google-chrome safari - any ideas how i can fix this

3482879
pull	push
there is libraries for push pull frp arrow based frp and probably other superior research too

3482879
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
many people seem to agree this is the more native way yet just about everyone seems to be using imperative binding libraries such as gtk2hs and wxhaskell

3482883
cdr	cons
mccarthy used seven operators to define the original lisp quote atom eq car cdr cons and cond

3482898
inherited	properties
you can give it a try here getting .style gets the properties defined on the element itself not those inherited from the rules it matches

3482907
free	malloc
you cannot for the same reason that malloc free doesn t help you to detect leaks

3482930
decltype	auto
my examples uses some c++0x features lambdas move semantics auto and decltype but it s not impossible to make it c++98 compatible

3482949
realloc	malloc	free	memcpy	free	malloc	free	realloc	memcpy	realloc	memcpy	malloc
what realloc does in c is likely to be just a malloc memcpy and free anyway although memory managers are allowed to do something clever if there is enough contiguous free memory available

3482998
profiling	instrumentation
you can maybe try in instrumentation to open your profiling in the simulator and choose as executable somewhere in user library application support iphone simulator for mobilesafari.app

3483020
rss	feed
you could try using joomla s rss feed

3483036
submit	submission
then you can force the submission of the form by actually calling the submit method from javascript

3483067
int	double
when the double is converted to an int it is truncated

3483071
sorting	filtering
i made some language mistake filtering sorting

3483091
int	double
for the first code sample the result is narrowed from a double to an int

3483091
int	double
the jls 5.1.3 describes how narrowing conversions for double to int are performed

3483139
cvs	svn
to each their own but i d avoid the office and openoffice tools like a skunk because they play so poorly with git svn cvs etc

3483156
int	double
at present when i m trying to use represent a phone number with int double longs i seem to store random numbers and not the numbers i meant to store

3483166
int	double
you definitely shouldn t use int too small float or double too much risk of data loss - see below

3483173
ubuntu	linux
i have just started looking at the latest version of ubuntu linux

3483187
jobs	cron
if it is running the most likely problem is that the environment under which cron runs your jobs is nowhere near the environment your shell gives you

3483218
fltk	motif
there s also fltk tk and even old motif is still kicking around

3483218
openssl	gnutls
if you re in the middle-layers somewhere a higher level than systems programming you ll typically be working with other libraries and toolkits apache postgresql hadoop libevent tomcat ruby on rails django expat gnutls openssl perl python ruby erlang etc

3483243
folder	directory
typically i had expect that folder 1 and folder 2 would be in the root directory

3483273
memmove	memset
and fill the rwbufferdata prior to writing by using memset and memmove

3483275
opera	firefox
opera will drop -moz- rules and firefox will drop -o- rules this is not a error

3483281
onstart	ondestroy
instead of hooking into keypress events and such perhaps working with the built-in events like onpause onstart ondestroy etc is more suited to your needs

3483295
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
if you want to do resizeable buffers the c way use malloc free realloc which are available in c++

3483302
min	max
sqlserver datetime columns have different min and max values than a datetime variable in the clr

3483315
django	web2py	web2py	tipfy
if you re familiar with django or web2py tipfy s routing is a huge step forward

3483338
union	distinct
we use union all since we re going to select distinct afterwards anyway and this way we have a single distinct operation rather than repeating it

3483396
hide	show
what i want to do is using jquery when a link is clicked the div of only that particular link should be show and the rest should hide

3483402
google-chrome	firefox
..and try loading in firefox and google-chrome

3483415
button	right-align
if you just want the button right-align you could use a dockpanel

3483462
int	chars
a chars 5 column uses 5 bytes of storage how many bytes does an int use

3483462
int	chars
does a unique index on an int column perform faster than a chars 5

3483462
int	chars
is select max on an int column faster than max on the col5 chars 5

3483473
int	chars
does a unique index on an int column perform faster than a chars 5

3483473
int	chars
is select max on a int column faster than max on the col5 chars 5

3483485
jprogressbar	jtabbedpane
if i really wanted to do something like that can i put a jprogressbar or it s equivalent in a jtabbedpane tab

3483492
cpython	ironpython
from what i ve read ironpython should work with cpython compatible libraries but out of the box it doesn t seem to work

3483493
getter	setter
you did not break encapsulation rules because the already indicates you want to expose the getter setter for name

3483496
rss	feed
the best way might be to use rss - wordpress â º simplepie plugin for wordpress â wordpress plugins or developer s guide - google ajax feed api - google code or magpie rss - php rss parser - with a custom post type url like this

3483509
onkeyup	onkeydown
if you want that to work for other clickmode values you could do something similar for onkeydown onkeyup onleftmousebuttondown and onleftmousebuttonup

3483529
hash	md5
the file hasn t changed i checked the md5 hash and they are same on both

3483543
apache	nginx
it was nginx being used as web server proxy before the request get passed to apache daemon

3483552
chown	chmod
first chown root usr bin prog_x and then set the setuid bit with chmod +s usr bin prog_x

3483573
int	chars
chars literals like a and p can be automatically converted to int using their ascii values

3483573
int	chars
if it does then assigning weights to a chars literal makes the code more readable than assigning to an int

3483576
int	chars
technically it would also be possible using a but there d be all sorts of integral conversions from chars to int and the program would just be confusing

3483604
bash	zsh
how to do the same in zsh as in bash

3483616
int	chars
so i understand that chars literals are turned into int

3483620
jprogressbar	jtabbedpane
enclose the jprogressbar in a jpanel and add that jpanel to the jtabbedpane

3483620
jlabel	jprogressbar
so you could basically simply replace new jlabel tab by a reference to your jprogressbar though this jprogressbar must not be added to the tab itself

3483649
portrait	landscape
withih willrotatetointerfaceorientation i am calling my mythod where i am setting the landscape and portrait rects for all my ui elements

3483693
passenger	unicorn
unicorn and passenger are way better tools than mongrel clusters

it uses the methods macarse mentions but wraps it in a useful post to your server which you can use to put into a database or send an email

3483771
sorting	filtering
sorting and advanced filtering omitted for brevity.

3483772
twitter	bit.ly	tinyurl	bit.ly
public resources have a tinyurl like url say abcd.org az3td part of the point of the very short tinyurl-link thing is so that people who want to cut paste twitter it don t have to use an additional layer of bit.ly or tinyurl

3483835
width	height
the issue with your code is that the anchor won t respond to height width because it is an inline element

3483843
hide	show
remember to add the rectangle first or play with zindex as i show below so that your code does not hide any controls

3483845
i2c	spi
if the solenoid is eitehr open or closed that sure sounds like a digital i o would do - in that case i d use a few pics again on i2c or spi to drive them via digital outputs

3483870
boost	allocator
the boost identity_matrix class for example has two template parameters the type and the allocator to be used so it could not be used to instantiate layer the allocator parameter has a default argument

3483882
client-side	server-side
server-side validation is a must because client-side validation does not ensure not-validated data will arrive in the server

3483929
width	height
it is good practice to always specify widths height in images regardless of browser - in the case of preloading it is acceptable to use width 1 height 1 at the preload stage since the html dimensions of the image don t affect the download itself

3483942
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

3484017
post	get
get images attached to a post

3484046
rss	feed
i m using java to parse the rss feed

3484094
lisp	scheme
why would anyone prefer scheme macros over common lisp macros and i genuinely want to know too i m not trying to be a troll

3484094
lisp	scheme
my experience as a lisp newb is that common lisp style macros are much easier to learn than scheme s macros

3484094
lisp	scheme
on the other hand though there obviously are people that are convinced that this is necessary otherwise there wouldn t be implementations of scheme macros in common lisp

3484121
lisp	scheme
clojure because it is based on the jvm has no concept of a memory image like some common lisp or scheme implementations

3484122
hex	binary
well the iphone id looks like a hex string so converting both to binary and xoring the bytes ought to do it

3484170
inherited	subclassing
you seem to be slightly confused about subclassing and inherited

3484179
google-chrome	firefox
i was able to successfully request .xap files using firefox and google-chrome

3484232
ironruby	ironpython
2 i ve heard some rumors that ironruby and ironpython are losing support from microsoft so they may be a poor long term solution

3484232
ironruby	ironpython
specifically besides letting me know whether you agree with my two points above i d like to know if ironruby and ironpython are much easier to use for a user not developer than powershell and if in your experience using the dlr is as easy as just passing an object to a powershell runspace

3484307
lisp	scheme
i suspect that the reason people write scheme style macro systems in common lisp is more for the pattern matching than for the hygiene

3484314
put	get
put it in your web.config or app.config and then system.web won t look to the underlying system to get its proxy config

3484379
stringbuilder	printwriter
just replace printwriter by new stringbuilder and then at end do response.getwriter .write builder.tostring

3484380
client-side	server-side
client-side checks are good for maximizing the user-experience and speeding up the feedback to the client that they need to fix something and to reduce the amount of problems encountered in the server-side checks

3484395
post	get
i m aware however that most times i ve used global variables like post or get there are quotes around the variable name -- my question is do i have to so in the sql statement above

3484422
stdout	stderr
if you re running on linux unix try not consuming stdout stderr

3484471
webstorm	aptana
before i used eclipse and aptana but seriously webstorm is quality

3484538
public	protected
having a coding standard something like prefix all private protected members with _ doesn t help because instance members can still refer to public members

3484558
post	get
what i m doing - i have an aspx page from which i originate a get and then a post to a https page with a view to login to it

3484558
post	get
i have spent quite a bit of time comparing my get and post construction to a browser get post using fiddler protocol analyzer and my requests are fine

3484558
post	get
when i run my page i can see the correct get and post but i get a 302 found object moved error

3484558
post	get
i then simulated the exact get post

3484558
post	get
my post and the browsers post are exactly the same except the 3 viewstate variables i fill it correctly from the get

3484558
post	get
- something fishy in the viewstate values which can only be because the browser sent it to me in the first place there is no corruption in my parsing the get viewstate variables and using it in post it s perfectly fine

3484587
integer	unsigned
since unsigned integer will roll into its max value when decremented from zero you can try the following provided n is less then that maximum value someone please correct me if this is ub

3484599
boost	stl
you could just use the stl s shared pointer std tr1 shared_ptr which for all intents and purposes is boost shared_ptr

3484610
many-to-many	one-to-many
for one-to-many and many-to-many relationship bblist right

3484636
int	double
if you store data in pure binary form the metadata is crucial to make any sense out of the data again are these numbers single or double precision or int and of what length what are the arrays dimensions etc etc and issues with archiving and retrieving paired data metadata pairs can and in practice do occasionally make perfectly good datasets unusable -- a real pity and waste

3484645
mouse	keyboard
since your sprite doesn t have a visible area it will not receive keyboard or mouse input

3484674
put	get
btw. does someone know any browser at all who would get confused if i would not put this stuff there

3484680
integer	unsigned
arithmetic on unsigned integer types is guaranteed to use modulo 2 n arithmetic where n is the number of value bits in the type and behaviour on overflow is well defined

3484680
integer	unsigned
-1 converted to an unsigned integer type of which size_t is one converts to 2 n - 1

3484682
subtract	add
add and subtract o from the line s end and start point to get 4 corner points

3484689
jflex	cup
i am using jflex and cup as my generators but i m a bit stuck with what a lexical error is

3484717
versioning	upgrade
in the end though we upgrade the compiler to the versioning that supports c++ tr1 and use std tr1 shared_ptr

3484757
cos	sin
a cos w x + b sin w x

3484813
retaincount	dealloc
i believe that when the object gets dealloc ed the retaincount isn t changed

3484815
rss	feed
is there a way hack or work-around to display rss feed on a page in a wordpress .com blog

3484815
rss	feed
i do not want to use the rss widget because i do not want the feed to be displayed on every page

3484847
width	height
replace width and height with some defaults for the viewbox

3484847
width	height
i used the values from the width and height attributes of the svg tag and it seemed to work

3484850
textview	listactivity
but in order to create a scrollable list i think i must use listactivity but i want to create an activity so the only scrollable part is the list and the textview and buttons are fixed

3484881
superclass	subclassing
eclipse 3.5 has no built in option for that particular case but i would anyway suggest that you have a separate constructor in the superclass which the subclassing invokes through super ... in its constructor

3484881
superclass	subclassing
if you for instance add a filed in the superclass you would need to remember to update the subclassing as well

3484891
lisp	scheme
because they use a different non-scheme language scheme macros are less powerful than common lisp macros in the almost-formal sense you can do arbitrary compile-time computation with them but it s hairy and convoluted

3484891
lisp	scheme
that s the best argument i ve seen for scheme macros over common lisp ones if you are building a complex language on top of scheme you are less likely to introduce subtle macro bugs if you stick with the standard macro system

3484943
int	chars
all default datatypes int chars bool etc are automatically managed for you and do not and cannot be released for all intents and purposes

3484954
128bit	64bit
this can easily be defeated even in 128bit md5 through use of rainbow tables much less the author s hacked together 64bit version

3484960
postgresql	mysql
i am not new to software developing but in the last years i was almost completely involved with web applications development most likely to php with mysql postgresql

3484961
free	malloc
alloc and release are objective-c idioms that largely replace c s malloc and free functions but all of them ultimately are asking the computer to set aside memory on the heap and all of that memory must ultimately be returned either through an autorelease pool a release message or a free call

3484966
mouseleave	mouseenter
overriding the mouseenter and mouseleave events didn t help

3485039
vbscript	vba

postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql or something else

3485121
apache	nginx
should it use apache or nginx

3485121
apache	nginx
nginx seems to be the preferred route here unless you need specific apache features

3485121
apache	nginx
if you re using passenger both apache and nginx are supported

3485121
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql or something else

maven	m2e
the eclipse builder uses simpler logic than maven so sometimes the things m2e does are just not enough

rss	feed
or maybe there s an rss feed which contains the url you re looking for

3485335

submission works properly 2 post and 1 get

3485499
hash	md5
unfortunately large free webspace providers are another thing to take into account the countless .blogspot.com domains if you download the alexa top 100.000 free csv file you can at least get a good overview of the most used of these that should get you for a certain percentage covered for these domains when comparing alexa rating with stumbleupon pageviews with delicious bookmarks alexa sometimes only takes the topdomain while delicious really md5 s every url so 1 alexa -- multiple delicious md5 hash

3485524
udp	tcp
if that doesn t work you can open a tcp or udp socket to the ports and see if anyone is listening

3485558
stdout	stderr
a likely cause is that installing the packages starts background processes that keep one or both of your pipes stdout stderr open

3485558
stdout	stderr
a proper daemon replaces its original stdin stdout stderr with dev null or a log file after it has finished initializing

3485580
stdout	stderr
my guess is that java doesn t think the script is over until the pipes it passed to it via stdin stdout stderr are closed by the sub-process

3485580
stdout	stderr
that is there are no more active reader processes on stdin no more active writer processes on stdout stderr

3485580
stdout	stderr
this problem generally arises when your script forks off background tasks like newly-installed services which inherit stdin stdout stderr

3485580
stdout	stderr
if on linux check proc fd for any new services and see if their stdin stdout stderr is the same pipe that your java process passes to your script

3485580
stdout	stderr
then it replaces stdout by opening var log another-log.log and replaces stderr by cloning stdout

3485580
pipe	file-descriptor
this means the the new file-descriptor 3 is open for writing on the pipe that was originally passed in as stdout

3485580
stdout	stderr	daemons	systemd
programs that expect to be systemd service daemons will often close file descriptors 0 stdin 1 stdout and 2 stderr but may not bother with any others

3485606

3486878
int	double
your compiler probably aligns int and pointers to multiples for 4 bytes and the double to multiples for 8 bytes

3486912
int	double
so just like the sizeof double and sizeof int the offsets at which structure members would be aligned is unspecified except that members that are declared later are at higher addresses

3486977
int	chars
chars are promoted to int but we want to be unsigned int

3487011
int	chars
the reason is that c2 is first promoted to int before doing the bitwise or which causes sign extension to take place assuming that chars is signed and can hold negative values

3487011
unsigned	short
while not strictly necessary you may cast c1 to unsigned char too for consistency if short is 2 bytes long it won t matter that c1 was sign extended beyond those 2 bytes

3487013
int	chars
to solve the problem cast the chars s to unsigned chars and then to int to prevent overflow or even the appearance of the possibility of overflow before shifting

i d further suggest that you consider publishing your build output to a repository manager like nexus artifactory or archiva

3487986
public	protected
when we know that in java all classes by default extends object class so why there are methods with public modifier where as protected would suffice the accessing of these methods from any class

lxml	beautifulsoup
if you have a bulk of files you want to do this to what you re probably going to want to do is write a script in a hll with a decent html parser i recommend python with lxml or beautifulsoup and then run it over your code

3488041
ubuntu	linux
i would prefer something for linux ubuntu

use a canvas with fixed width and height and put it inside a viewbox - this is a simple solution but when resizing the viewbox the whole content of canvas is resized too

3488109
implements	extends
is there a simple solution or should i implements my own panel or maybe extends one of the existing ones canvas

3488151
floating-point	integer
if your architecture has both integer and floating-point divide instructions the compiler will emit the right instruction for the case specified by the code

3488151
floating-point	integer
the language standard specifies the rules for type promotion and whether integer or floating-point division should be used in each possible situation

3488151
floating-point	integer
if you have only an integer divide instruction or only a floating-point divide instruction the compiler will inline some code or generate a call to a math support library to handle the division

uiview	subviews
my first thought is a uiscrollview to scale a uiview subviews and have the uiview subviews contain another subviews that does not resize vertically but only does horizontally when bounds change and disable vertical scrolling

3488220
uiview	subviews
maybe i could skip one of these uiview subviews and have only one do everything

3488283
inherited	subclassing
scott is writing in a c++ context of course but paul haahr gives exactly the same advice for java phrased as don t subclassing concrete classes -- and i generally second it for python though i do favor the gang-of-four s softer phrasing prefer composition over concrete class inherited but i understand that both scott and paul are often writing for an audience which needs very direct and strongly phrased advice almost phrased as commandments rather than advice not softer phrased one that they might too easily ignore in the name of their convenience

3488328

3488459
getter	setter
if you do have properties that are completely local to the view controller a common pattern is to write your own getter and setter rather than using synthesize and create the object in the getter if it doesn t exist

3488479
floating-point	integer
this results in the compiler assuming that the method takes an integer argument instead of a floating-point argument

3488479
floating-point	integer
thus the caller converts your 100.f value into the integer 100 which is then interpreted by the function as the encoding of the floating-point number you are observing

3488537
button	checkbox
besides the fading you may clear all inputs in that function by using input .val and input .removeattr checked for radio button and checkbox respectively if there are any that is

cos	sin
because arbitrary point on circumference with center cx cy and radius r has the following coordinate it directly follows from cos and sin geometric definitions - ratio between lengths of corresponding cathetus and hypotenuse

3488617
cos	sin
just look at what sin and cos actually mean in a circle

3488617
cos	sin
if you have a point on a circle which forms an angle alpha the cos alpha is the x-part of the point a sin alpha is the y part

i think you ll find the issue is the old box model problem basically ie uses a different model for where padding margins etc are in relation to the entity width height

3488770
implements	extends
urllib2 doesn t offer a way to do this so you d have to extends some of the classes it uses and implements rate limiting yourself

3488788
chown	sudo
sudo chown root root etc init.d lowvol.sh

i mean i have a save button too where when i click save and none of the checkbox are checked i would like it to validate but not validate where it throws an alert

3489766
skip-lists	tree

3491006
put	get
this can be done by creating test suites to put and get messages from the queue and having your proxy do the transformation

3491010
hash	md5
you can use a hash function like md5 or sha1

3491010
hash	md5
that s impossible since the message space is too large for your hash there are 2 1024 messages vs 2 128 possible hash if you are using md5 but these functions are meant to be collision resistant and hard to reverse

gwt is client-side approach -- all the code running at the client while zk server-side approach -- all the code running at the server but they have an option to write some of application code at client

3491287
onresume	onpause
you would instantiate in your activities oncreate and possibly open in onresume close on onpause

3491317

i need to convert a simplexml object to a domdocument to use it with domxpath

3491803
int	double	int	chars
double float int and chars do not need to be release cause they are not allocated dynamically except if you do something like this

3491945
printf	strstr
this practice is widely familiar from common c functions specified by posix and libc like fopen strstr or printf

3491953
getter	setter
in a code sample containing many getter and setter the following checkstyle notations exist

3491961
textview	imageview
my application containing one textview at top to display activity name and one button at bottom and in middle area of the screen camera preview should be viewed..when user click on that button snaps should be clicked and display it into imageview of another activity

3492026
google-chrome	safari
is there any way in javascript to stop throbber of doom in google-chrome safari browsers when using push technology ajax comet with iframe

3492064
int	chars
however after some googling i found out that even if a chars is always 8 bit long the underlying representation could actually be a 32 bit int

3492064
freebsd	linux
so my impression is that char is maybe not the best way of representing a string in a message that will be sent over a socket from freebsd to linux or input some other unixes if you want to ...

3492064
freebsd	linux
what is the best way of representing a character array string in c that will be sent over tcp ip in a nix linux freebsd etc. platform independent way

primefaces	richfaces	primefaces	icefaces	richfaces	icefaces
now you can either write your own components or use frameworks such as primefaces icefaces richfaces etc

3492157
hash	md5
one way to try would be to hash the value out using like sha1 md5 and use a session on the server side to store the same value and assert the hash match

3492187
getter	setter
i could probably achieve this behavior myself too as long as the first set goes through a method by dynamically defining getter setter

3492206
hash	md5
a typical way to avoid this is to use a one-way hash algorithm to store it in the database such as md5 or better sha1

3492207
cpu	processors
i ve installed intel vtune analyzer 9 to get call-graph and counter-monitor data from a win32 application on a windows 7 pc with amd turion x2 tl-58 processors but it gives an error saying the cpu architecture can t be identified properly data collection is not available

3492222
getter	setter
i feel if you write normal data bean which is having getter and setter then will be more better than this..

3492224

you can explictly use javascript function which limits the number of the characters entered with onkeyup and onkeydown events in your view and place the function in public javascript application.js

3492333
opencv	emgucv
i advise c# because of emgucv which is a cross platform .net wrapper to the intel opencv image processing library

3492374
range	max
so you check the range from 1 to max x and find the number

3492385
xpages	lotus

3492492
dictionary	map
it can be treated as an array list vector hash table an implementation of a map dictionary collection stack queue and probably more

3492543

3492575
public	protected
if the base class has a protected internal or public field property so does the derived class the internal has some odd cases

3492575
short	base
and a final note on inheritance you should avoid inheriting for functionality in short that is just because you need the same functionality in two unrelated classes you shouldn t create a base class to hold that functionality rather you should create a third class and inject and instance of that class or similar approaches and you should think a lot about liskov substitutional principle when designing the public interface of a class when it s not sealed

3492579

which isn t that difficult to do though is perhaps fragile as it assumes the navigation bar status bar etc will be the same height in both orientations and you d have to manually take account of the toolbar being different heights in portrait vs landscape - i just want to make sure i ve not missed a more straightforward or common way.

in your case you want to grab the result of the php script so you ll want to use jquery s ajax function using the method get or post

3495896
rss	feed
then we just fetched and parsed the rss feed of the fb page and the twitter search results extracting what was new on a short interval.

3495896
rss	feed
cffeed was a little error-prone and wonky just doing a cfhttp get of the rss feed and then processing the cfhttp.filecontent struct item as xml worked fine

assume myobject is a class with one field called listfield that has a getter and setter

3496400
post	get
you can feed that into a formula like the one you post to get an angle of rotation

3496442
free	malloc
why doesn t it use just the underlying system technics like malloc and free

3496442
free	malloc
i would be much interested in a llvm based jit-compiler for java which just uses malloc free for memory handling

3496449
union	distinct
union does a implicit distinct so same values are displayed only once

3496467
union	distinct
use union all union would return distinct rows

3496502
free	malloc
java does use malloc and free or at least the implementations of the jvm may

make sure to assign your grid.row within your image or control but do not sign the controls height width properties

3496539
free	malloc
your main question asking why java doesn t use malloc and free comes down to a matter of target market

3496593
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	idictionary	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection	idictionary	ilist	idictionary	icollection
i understand that any collection here i am talking about regular non-generic should have implemented icollection ienumerable and ilist incase of regular object collection or idictionary in case of dictionaries

3496593
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
ilist is derived from icollection and ienumerable

3496593

ironruby	ironpython
it s certainly very easy to host powershell -- assuming that it s pre-installed on your target pcs-- so it s a very viable option but i think that in general it s just as easy to do it with ironruby or ironpython

3496609
ironruby	ironpython
also the work to host powershell only gets you powershell -- whereas you can leverage the same work to get ironpython and ironruby working

3496645
min	max	addition	multiplication
i m not sure if this actually answers your question but my understanding of the text you quoted simply says that the mandel function is just another function like multiplication min max addition etc that can appear in your genetic program

3496663
versioning	upgrade
idea appears to be the leader of the two although i had to upgrade to the eap versioning of the ide when i switched to 2.8

3496672
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
that will mean your mycollectionclass implements ilist icollection and ienumerable

3496672
ienumerator	icollection	ilist	icollection	ilist	ienumerator
arraylist are implementing ilist icollection and ienumerator

3496691

3496774
kde	gnome
i am trying to detect whether i am running on a gnome or kde desktop environment

3496774
kde	gnome
i know i can check via a ps -aux and grepping either gnome or kde but that s not good 1 what if i am on a gnome desktop but i have the kde libs loaded

3496779
width	height
this means it would be the height of the original image+vertical displacement and its width would be width of original 2-horizontal displacement

3496797
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have the javascript correctly grabbing the current value and everything works correctly in firefox safari google-chrome and opera

java must not use malloc free for object creation since its memory handling is much different due to garbage collection gc

3496835
post	get
most solutions i ve looked at have a pay with paypal button so i assume a form post is necessary to go to the paypal site but ideally we d want to get there via a 302 redirect

google-chrome	firefox
on ie firefox and google-chrome i could open a new client but trying to hit the same url again would instead return a jnlp file

3496897
ready	each
in short the idea of these tools is not to skip phases but to avoid the cost of the initialization of the jvm of the maven engine of plugins etc at each build by caching them in a ready to re use environment

3496999
kde	gnome
gnome libraries don t necessarily mean that someone s running the whole gnome desktop environment but then gnome and kde aren t window managers

3497043
pull	push
so basically i am trying to code the simplest example that can push and pull with both twitter and facebook and eventually not just status updates but all kinds of content from facebook as well

3497043
pull	push
so i would create some kind of base architecture and then hook in my social network accounts to be able to push and pull with my system

3497054
dlsym	dlopen
if you actually wanted to implement something that would dynamically link to different toolkits you could try something with dlopen dlsym but that would be insane

3497058
mouseout	mouseup
i think you need to define a mouseout for movieshow that does the same thing as mouseup

3497063
width	height
if you select the field go to the layout palette palettes menu - layout shift + f9 and select the expand to fit box next to the width and or height it will expand when more text is entered

hash	md5
the trouble with a pure sha x or md5 password hash is that by-design these algorithms are very fast this makes it very sensitive to brute force attacks

3499909
hash	salt
of course if you don t salt your hash there are tons of rainbow tables that make cracking all the passwords in your db trivial

3499935
min	max
miny and maxy are the precalculated limit values in order to compute them i calculated the height of all the cells in the table for max and the height of the visible content view for min
