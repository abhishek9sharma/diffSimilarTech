i did manage to get the checkboxes to show and hide but i lost my code

4700419
flot	highcharts
i know that alot of these features can probably be put into things such as flot or highcharts but these things were next to free for me to use in timeline so i m weighing the cost benefit of whether it is easier to fix a memory leak or roll out 3 - 4 features on some library that doesn t have it

4700429
rss	feed
you could make use of wordpress rss feed to show the blog posts of site a on site b

4700438

i would like to use a technique called css sprites where you have a single image and you take advantage of width height and background-position in css to display only parts of the image which combines a lot of smaller images

4700740
prepare	execute
execute runs a prepare statement which allows you to bind parameters to avoid the need to escape or quote the parameters

4700740

4700779
post	get
as an additional requirement they want to capture peoples facebook user id and get permission to post back to a users wall at the same time.

4700846
width	height
think about your names - the parameters for getpixelcolor aren t really a width and height are they

4700877
hex	binary
of course sorting that much data would required a custom sort routine that you wrote since it is binary coverting to hex would double the size of your data but would allow you to use standard routines

4700990

i don t know mips assembly but i m quite good at x86 if this can help.

4701171
int	boolean
if you want to execute something when it s done i think you need to give it some kind of value like and int or a boolean

4701184
udp	tcp
you can use udp as well but if you are dealing with firewalls it is probably going to be simpler with tcp

4701197
implements	extends
you can extends the fileinputformat class and implements the recordreader interface or if you re using the newer api extends the recordreader abstract class to define how you split your data

4701261
getter	setter
if i was using a concurrent hashmap and i had methods which set and got values as im using a concurrent hashmap would i need to make the getter and setter synchronized

4701419
width	height
you need to set the height and width of your tv view either directly or by using layout params and then after you ve done this you need to call setcontentview again but since the layout your adding it to is a child of the root layout you may need to get a reference to the root layout then add the tv view to the appropriate child layout and then setcontentview root layout

4701594
post	get
if you are telling your plugin to send session id via regular get post parameter it has to be enabled on the server

4701645
children	parent
the only hitch is you need to sequence the tables so that parent are created before children

4701668
a-star	dijkstra
dijkstra is a special case of a-star algorithm so a is also too much for this problem

4701672
button	checkbox
you can use two different tables - one with a single form for the checkbox radiobuttons and save button and the second one with the delete button and hidden field

rss	feed
there are ready to use classes for building rss feed like this one found on phpclasses.org but it is just as easy to read up on the rss spec and generate the xml yourself with xmlwriter which is based on libxml and included in php5

4702553
google-chrome	safari
have you inspected the actual value you get back on safari and google-chrome

4702553
google-chrome	safari
note that both safari and google-chrome have built-in dev tools you may need to enable them in options that will let you step through that code and inspect values easily in a debugger

4702553
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
now my specific example of the href value above expecting the anchor only and getting the whole thing isn t it according to this quick test but the fundamental point holds look at the value you re getting and step through the code on both say firefox using firebug and on google-chrome or safari using dev tools

4703247
typedef	struct
it declares the same two structure types as before but now the typedef declares an alias for struct c which is name1 and the extern line states that another translation unit tu defines a variable called name2 of the type struct p

4703247
typedef	struct
it is also afaik syntactically valid in c++ - but it is even more pointless there than in c since with no typedef introduces the type c as well as struct c

4703247
typedef	struct
the correct fix might be to remove the storage class typedef or it might be to introduce a name as an alias for struct c

4703259
nsmutablestring	nsstring
if you are too specific then your code becomes inflexible accepting only specific implementations which are not strictly necessary ie demanding a nsmutablestring when you could really work with any nsstring

nsmutablestring	nsstring
when sent to an instance of nsmutablestring a subclass of nsstring however the message returns an instance of nsmutablestring not nsstring

it isn t a problem as every unsigned 32 bit integer can be accurately represented as a 64 bit floating point number

4703810
free	malloc
the malloc library will also have a list or lists of free blocks so it can often meet a request without asking the os for more memory

4703810
free	malloc
determining how many different block sizes to handle deciding whether to attempt to combine adjacent free blocks and so forth are the choices the malloc library implementor has to make

4703810
free	malloc
another alternative is to use malloc for initial allocations but maintain your own cache of free objects

4703838
free	malloc
malloc spends most of its time managing the virtual memory space that has already been allocated and only occasionally requests more memory from the os obviously this depends on the size of the items you allocate and how often you free

4703838
free	malloc
while this sometimes occurs particularly for larger memory blocks it is generally the case that free d memory remains allocated to the process and can then be re-used by later malloc s

4703838
free	malloc
if you know more about your pattern of memory allocation and release you can optimise malloc and free for your usage patterns or provide a more extensive interface

4703855
windows	wow64
if you are trying to do this from a 32-bit program you might need to use c windows sysnative or temporarily turn off wow64 file system redirection

4707231
folder	directory
i agree that hard-linking folder directory can cause problems if not careful but they have a very definite advantage - time machine is a perfect example

4707231
filesystems	hfs+
the filesystems must be journaled hfs+

4707231
folder	directory
one really important issue is that the folder you create the link to is really moved to a super-magical super-hidden folder called .hfs+ private directory data 000d dir_xxx where xxx is the inode number of the source_folder - remember the format of the command is

4707231
folder	directory
i noticed that you couldn t do a ls -la command any longer without getting funny errors for all the folder directory that were in the original source_folder but you could do a ls command and all looked well

4707231
filesystems	hfs+
it s a very interesting piece of software and will tell you lots of details about hfs+ filesystems

4707231
folder	directory
if you try to do a simple ls -lr command it will fail and give you ls xxx no such file or directory error messages for all lower level folder

4707231
folder	directory
if you use a finder window to traverse the directory tree of the remote volume the folder that are in the folder that had or has a hard link to it will simply disappear without any error when you first click on the folder name

4707231
filesystems	hfs+
these problems don t appear to occur except for the error message if you use nfs to mount the remote client and assuming you had a nfs server on the system that has the volume as a local hfs+ filesystems

4707246
children	parent
indeed it is the parent control s responsibility to call measure on its children during its own measure pass

4707246
children	parent
thus the parent can figure out how much space is available for its children and it can pass that in when measuring

4707251
redeclaration	ivar
as a note the redeclaration of the ivar s type in the property statement can also be useful if you want to declare the property as the immutable type of the ivar s for instance

it worked fine on my old 17 and 20 displays now i ve noticed on my new 27 lcd it s inaccurate so i have to change the 4th line to be more accurate isn t toolkit.getdefaulttoolkit .getscreenresolution supposed to get the accurate dpi why it s not correct for my app to work on other machines with different display sizes and dpis how to automatically adjust the 1.15 i have manually put in

4707789
portrait	landscape
not all designs in fact i d wager none without targeted style sheets can cope with the vastly different sizes of screen out there today from portrait orientated screens at public libraries to ultra fine artworking macs with giant landscape screens and tiny little laptops - the latter two often used by executives that have no understanding of how the zoom features in a browser work and also often have terrible eye sight and little patience

4707789
switching	screens
if you re really looking to be super flexible the you could use javascript or browserhawk or equivalent to measure the screens sizes and switching out style sheets for those that are really not going to work with your layout

4707867

what does the istream getline method return

4708349
istream	getline
the istream returned from getline is converted to bool by implicit conversion to check success of operation

screens	mdpi
we define mdpi to be the base density so 10dp on an mdpi screens will result in exactly 10 pixels

4708370
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
on an hdpi screens it will result in 15 pixels because hdpi is 1.5 mdpi

4708719
portrait	landscape
if you don t want to do the work of re-laying-out your interface from portrait to landscape or vice versa you can at least support the 180-degree rotation of whatever orientation you do want to use landscape-right if it s set up for landscape-left or portrait-upside-down if it s set up for portrait

stdout	stderr
if you say then you are redirecting stderr to wherever stdout is currently redirected to

4708817
stdout	stderr
if stdout is going to the console then stderr is too

4708817
stdout	stderr
if stdout is going to a file then stderr is as well

4708817
stdout	stderr
if you follow this up by then redirecting stdout stderr still points to what stdout used to point to

4708817
stdout	stderr
this redirects stdout to log and then redirects stderr to wherever stdout is now being redirected which is log

4708817
stdout	stderr
end result both stdout and stderr are redirected to log

4708817
stdout	stderr
this redirects stderr to wherever stdout is currently being redirected which is typically the console

4708817
stdout	stderr
remember that stderr does not follow stdout so it continues to redirect to the console

4708817
stdout	stderr
end result stdout is redirected to the log file and stderr is still sent to the console

it s basically equivalent to java s advanced for-loop for-each only with the convenience of dynamic typing and an implicit loops variable it

4709090
httphandler	httpmodule
i think that the best way to think about these is that httpmodule is a filter that adds or subtracts something from the request object when an event occurs and the httphandler is a processor that actually serves the request

4709787
gif	png
so we remapped jpg png and gif files to become a handler

4709787

4716053
ant	maven
once you ve done that you can remove all the jars from your source repository since ant with ivy will download the required ones from the internet based maven repository system

4716062
width	height
but if you don t want the layout manager messing up with the size of the components i would suggest you use either the setmaximumsize int width int height or set the layout to null and use setbounds int x int y int width int height method to size your component

4716067
post	get
i think you should either do what daniel recommends or if you must do it this way post your model get the validation back show your fine print and then post the form again to a different action to save

4716075
swt	swing
if you have swing or swt experience you would be easily familiar with gwt

4716076
inherited	subclassing
even though the value is there it is not inherited by the subclassing

4716076
inherited	subclassing
the attribute count is hidden and not inherited by the subclassing at all

4716111
boost	stl
if you don t want to use c++0x you could use boost instead but that s not in the stl

4716113
entity-relationship	diagram
the example shows a reasonable entity-relationship diagram but generally speaking in a one-to-many relation one doesn t need an auxiliary table

4716115
google-chrome	firefox
i guess technically i could get the blur and focus of the window object but if there was something more closely tied to the browser ie firefox google-chrome etc. that would be even better

4716120
hide	show
i have a table with some css to hide show columns

4716120
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in firefox google-chrome and ie8

4716127
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
now when you come to functional programming the private field of superclass is not inherited in a meaningful way for the subclassing

4716127
superclass	subclassing
for the subclassing a private field of superclass is same as a private field of any other class

4716127
inherited	subclassing
a subclassing does not inherited the private members of its parent class

4716127
public	protected	superclass	subclassing
however if the superclass has public or protected methods for accessing its private fields these can also be used by the subclassing

4716140
inherited	subclassing
since the subclassing can t access or modify the private fields then in other words they are not inherited

4716140
inherited	subclassing
so the subclassing does not inherited private fields but an object that is an instance of the subclassing certainly does contain the private fields

4716198
uiview	subviews
however when i try and add someview a custom uiview which has uibuttons on it as a subviews of window the buttons don t receive any of the touches

4716250
put	get
if i put the pattern between # i get the empty string result

4716271
inherited	properties
there is no such thing as extension properties and you can t inherited the class and use the same class name unless you use a different namespace which is probably not what you re after

4716273
superclass	subclassing
early initializers are part of the constructor of a subclassing that is intended to run before its superclass

4716284
width	height
i ve set background-image on a couple of span elements but they aren t showing up i think because my height and width settings are being ignored

4716306
google-chrome	firefox
and adding an new var for scrollleft this way the code behave the same on google-chrome firefox and internet explorer

4716314
int	boolean
json only serializes simple data types such as int float numbers boolean strings lists tuples and dictionaries

4716335
superclass	subclassing
obviously as digitalross explains an object of a subclassing must contain its superclass s private fields

4716335
inherited	subclassing
or public are inherited by subclassing

4716335
superclass	subclassing
objects of subclassing contain private fields of their superclass

4716335
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing itself has no notion of private fields of its superclass

4716337
boost	stl
is there anything like that in the stl or boost or is there an even better solution i am not aware of

4716366
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome tested

4716369
sorting	grouping
it is sorting the results of the grouping instead of grouping the results of the ordering

4716409
for-loop	arrays
you can use a for-loop to iterate through the items in the arrays checking the value each time

4716420
doc	rtf
we are using textcontrol it supports rtf pdf doc docx an it s very easy to integrate

4716514
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie or safari

4716518
tabs	tabpanel
the problem is that the tabpanel which is used internally by the tabcontrol to lay out the tabs does not seem to support what you want

4716518
tabs	tabpanel
the simple dockpanel doesn t work as smooth as the tabpanel -- the tabs jump a bit when switching between them but this might get you started

4716566
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in all other browsers firefox opera safari google-chrome the gradient and the background-image is displayed

4716607
inherited	properties
tip define the graph label end of your dot file otherwise subgraphs will inherited those properties

4716623
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
my favorite way to read a small file is to use a bufferedreader and a stringbuilder

4716639
hide	show
then you can use something to show hide the full body of the news in a div in example

4716644
oncreate	findviewbyid
you could simply call findviewbyid in your onresume method to get a reference to it in that method or you could change ib to an instance variable so that it is accessible in methods other than oncreate

4716663
pop-up	dialog
when a user clicks on the browse button which is part of the control the control displays a file select pop-up dialog box

4716670
int	chars
there s another subtle problem there though you re casting an int to a chars value

4716670
int	chars
the max size of an int is much larger than a chars so your cast may truncate the value

4716677
google-chrome	firefox
i ve had it fail in ie 7 8 firefox 3.6.3 and google-chrome

4716677
google-chrome	firefox
i ve also had it succeed in ie6 7 8 firefox 3.6.3 3.4.2 3.1 and google-chrome

4716717
aggregate-functions	sum
group the results into subsets based on the group by clause collapsing the results to a single row for each such subset and computing the values of any aggregate-functions -- sum max avg etc

4716731
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the page loads and then a couple seconds later the div for the results loads as well

4716810
macvim	textmate
i m switching from textmate to macvim

4716873
post	get	post	put	put	get
decorate your actions with get post put and delete attributes

4716884
inherited	properties
i thought that i can use my own class inherited from typeconverter and catch the moment of converting value somecontext to color the backcolor properties

4716895
google-chrome	safari
you should be able to use a webkit browser safari or google-chrome resized to the approximate dimensions of the iphone to test the layout of your application

4716907
persistent	transient	instances	transient
transient instances persistent

4716926
width	height
i think your span s need to have display inline-block an ordinary span will always have its natural width and height

4716931
google-chrome	firefox
since google-chrome or firefox can handle this well but my client insist on using ie8 to test could any one suggest a workaround please

4716936
width	height
solved it - you can t set height and width on span because it is an inline element

4717028
post	get	post	put	put	get
someone sends a rest request get put post delete in the form of var1 var2 var3.var4

4717052
int	boolean
on every other test i have done int 1 is converted to boolean true and 0 to false

4717090
int	double
depending on the type of your variable one of abs int labs long llabs long long imaxabs intmax_t fabsf float fabs double or fabsl long double

4717090
floating-point	integer
if you re using c++ or objective-c++ you can bring in the header and use std abs which is templated for all the standard integer and floating-point types

4717105
put	get
the client size changes when you set the formborderstyle but it does not seem to get put into the clientrectangle property right away

4717117
width	height
however if i switch to then it seems i get bigger problems because you can t set a height and width on a span reliably

4717118
children	parent
the storable files are then read in by the parent and the total data from each of the children are analyzed before proceeding onto a repeat of the previous fork or else the parent stops

4717118
children	parent
is the sigint passed to all children that is the parent the parent s children and the external program called by the children

4717118
children	parent
but the children or perhaps the parent program carry on

4717118
children	parent
after some more debugging based on the behavior of my program it appears that indeed sigint is being passed from the parent to all children and from all children to all of their children the external program

4717118
children	parent
although i had my children check the exit status of what was called in system i was assuming that a ctrl-c would kill everything from the parent down rather than lead to the creation of more rounds of processing which is what was happening

4717118
children	parent
the signal handler would then send sigterm to each of the children which i presume would also send a sigterm to the children s children and then cause the parent to exit gracefully

4717123
for-loop	loops
you are defining a for-loop which iterates over 450 values but you are returning in the first iteration of loops which leaves the function body and therefore stops the execution of the for-loop

4717135
google-chrome	safari
unnoticable difference on google-chrome and safari

4717174
children	parent
if you kill the parent process the children and external programs running will still run until they terminate one way or another

4717174
children	parent
that way once the parent gets the sigint it will kill all of it s children

4717174
children	parent
based on your update it seems that the parent indeed kills it s children and then instead of terminating itself it goes back to doing something else think of it as a reset instead of a complete shutdown start combination

4717189
width	height
if you give generally give a span the property display block it ll then behave like a div i.e you can set width and height

4717196
jboss	glassfish
you have to go with a javaee 6 server jboss 6 glassfish 3 etc

4717327
macvim	textmate
i moved from textmate to macvim

4717350
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in firefox google-chrome and safari it works just fine

4717355

then run a cron job that kills pending jobs that have been running for a certain amount of time or try to reprocess them

4717400
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it s working fine in webkit google-chrome safari but the -moz-background-size property is not working at all in firefox

4717408
children	parent
by default when you fork a child it will be in the same process group as the parent so by default the parent top level program invoked from the command line all its children children s children etc as well as any external programs invoked by any of these which are all just children will all be in that same process group so will all receive the sigint signal

4717427
post	get
see scottgu s post post to get you started

4717446
erd	diagram
basically i did the implementation first and then from that i used tools to reverse engineer class diagram erd etc.

4717467
ssl	https
if i sign the applet and download it via https by the server if then i make a web service call would it be possible to reuse the existing ssl session or will the https would have to be reestablished

4717467
ssl	https
i think that the https ssl handshake would have to be reestablished since the initial connection was made by browser

4717485
width	height
namely left top width and height

4717486
subtract	add
what it does is if its precisely on the edge subtract 1 so it doesn t add that tile

4717561
apache	nginx
when server apache or nginx logging http request into the log file append entry at the end is it slow or fast

google-chrome	firefox
these are lovely for firefox google-chrome and the rest.

4717681

save the file under the folder underneath fms s applications directory

4717708
width	height
it has display inline property which makes the element ignore your width height values even if they are marked

4717734
put	get
the issue is of course that if you put the release after the return statement you get a potential leak of an object error associated with dateformatter var declaration

4717781
opera	firefox
update i m using opera firefox for testing now and the problem hasn t come up since

4717846
ant	maven
ant can be run from maven but the challenge here is seamless integration feeding all the classpath and sourcepath elements from maven to ant automatically which is why i did not use maven s facilities for this purpose

4717856
put	get
i put my alert box in the didfinishlaunchingwithoptions method it executes when a flag becomes true so i no longer get the error as all the elements are displayed by that point

4717878
width	height
note that this also requires explicitly setting the width and height of the anchor in your css to match your icon size

4717883
google-chrome	firefox
my new code is working in firefox and google-chrome

4717891
gesturedetector	motionevent
since you re using a gesturedetector the thing to do is implement simplegesturedetector.onlongpress motionevent e for handling long clicks

awt	swing
java strings are unicode but not all java components support full unicode strings especially awt components and lightweight swing components

4717930
bufferedreader	stringtokenizer
as your data is relatively simple bufferedreader and stringtokenizer should do the trick

4717985
versioning	upgrade
if this versioning is equals to the resource versioning from core_resources table upgrade script will not execute

4717985
versioning	upgrade
and the versioning should match the name of your upgrade script

4718004
int	boolean
given two events with int start and end times e1 s1 e1 e2 s2 e2 implement a quick boolean check to see if the events overlap

4718060

i have considered using mousemove to capture the x and y position of the mouse but it would appear that once the mouseleave the iframe i m out of luck

4718086
installation	upgrade
another way to fix would be to upgrade the django installation

4718102
opera	firefox
so far it tested ok in firefox opera and ie 8

the url router is also very nice and borrows a lot of concepts from merb and ruby-on-rails

4718411
cvs	svn
here are some experience reports on using it in converting old svn and cvs repositories

4718412
int	boolean
in vb the int 1 is int 1 not boolean true

4718435
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i have a website which works well with any zoom on firefox google-chrome opera safari.

4718437
versioning	upgrade
we had some luck with indy sockets before but since mono upgrade to the .net 3.5 framework we ve had no luck finding or building a versioning of indy that works in that environment

4718475
post	get
you should use an external program like wget or curl which both can send either get or post requests

4718479
submit	submission
the ajax form submit binding is put on document.ready of the loaded content ergo the ajax form submission binding may be binding prior to and thus firing before the validation calls that the parse method may bind to the submit event.

get max and min available position using

4718796
subobject	instances
this is multiple inheritance - base class subobject are at different offsets withing the child instances thus different addresses

4718806
accessor	properties
because it conflicts with the -description method in nsobject recall that core data dynamically generates properties accessor and mutators â a properties named â descriptionâ would require creating an accessor method called -description

4718806
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
note that a property name cannot be the same as any no-parameter method name of nsobject or nsmanagedobject

4718850
put	get
you should also be aware that if your sites contains link to other external sites you dont control using get will put that data in the refeerer header on the external sites when they press the links on your site

4718876
post	put
there are three different types of post but similar enough that i could put them under one table

4718929
multiplying	addition
only using addition but cheating with multiplying by a negative.

i am trying to understand what traits are for example expressions like typedef typename traits_type off_type off_type in the gnu implementation of fstream

4719409
width	height
i ve tried using the resize method with the contentssize argument this will resize the widget s height to fit the text contents however the width stays the same

4719411
division	multiplication
but still i m having a lot of troubles my guess it has something to do with multiplication division this time

4719425
glfw	sdl
there are alternative libraries for input handling which i would think the sdl has and possibly glfw but it may be a stretch to go adding those to a project for mouse handling

4719492
children	parent
if you are using perlâ s version of system or pipe open or backticks then the parent â the one calling system rather than the one called by it â will ignore any sigint and sigquit while the children are running

4719506
vbo	vao
a good starting tutorial that has been more straight-forward regarding a quick and simple vao vbo and render is located at swiftless.com

4719542
inherited	properties
you do need to use relativesource but using self and then use the placementtarget to swap visual trees to the textbox from which you can get its datacontext which should have been inherited from the datagridcell and finally be able to reach your menu properties

my initial suggestion would be to specify both width and height and see if that works

4719696
children	parent
a eclipselink load all the children of that parent

4719705
post	get
i came across another stackoverflow post regarding get vs post and it made me think

4719705
post	get
my understanding is post should be used for one time modification for data and get is for retrieving regards viewing an item or permalink

4719710
google-chrome	firefox
when i open the index page in google-chrome and firefox there is no error

4719717
versioning	upgrade
upgrade those tools when there is a reason to do so not just because there is a new versioning of them

4719777
submit	submission
when the user hits submit i will take that text and create an image using php but before submission i would like to know where the line-breaks or rather word-wraps occur

4719794
for-loop	loops
this results from a limitation in the compiler which you can work around by replacing the for-loop with a while loops

4719817

the other browsers firefox google-chrome safari ie9 haven t posed much of a problem

4719833
boost	allocator
the down side is that you ll have to manage the allocator of the large objects yourself but something like boost s shared_ptr can help or the standard version if you have 0x support -- not auto_ptr though

4719838
versioning	upgrade
stick with whatever versioning of eclipse your required plugins support until those plugins upgrade their support

4719847

if attributes are not used all properties with public getter and setter are serialized

4724662
hide	show
but since a number of events are common to all of my statemachines init show hide finish and a few more i want to be able to either reference an event the way i used to or enter one of the above event names without having to declare the event in every file

4724667
textview	imageview
you can write a generic view in xml file that contains the imageview and the textview later in your loop method you can inflate the view with imageview and textview as childs and setting their contents

4724667
textview	imageview
then you can do something like this inflate the generic view from the xml file and set the textview and imageview context.

4724673
width	height
the behaviour of a listbox when its width or height is set to auto is to not produce any scrollbars as it will attempt to endlessly grow within its container

other newer browsers like firefox opera ie7+ google-chrome and safari will try to display the image using the alpha-channel

4724782
oncreate	onnewintent
the closest you will be able to come is to use a distinctive intent in the getactivity pendingintent a custom action string use setflags intent.flag_activity_clear_top|intent.flag_activity_single_top on the intent to try to bring an existing instance of your activity forward then check for your special intent in both oncreate and onnewintent of your activity and do whatever special thing you want done

postgresql	mysql	postgresql	informix	interbase	firebird	informix	interbase	informix	firebird
any relational database you could access with jdbc mysql postgresql oracle sqlserver db2 informix interbase firebird ingress you name it

4724870
min	max
it s easy to define a procedure like that using the built-in scheme procedures square max and min but we haven t encountered these procedures at that point in the book yet so i d define them as well

4724870
minimum	max
the sum-of-highest-squares procedure works by adding the square of the maximum of x and y the max of those two is eliminated from being the lowest of the three and the square of the maximum of the remaining two the minimum of x and y which will be whichever value was left over from the first step and z

4724879
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox etc

4724882
queue	fifo
you could implement a fifo queue in a database by attaching sequence numbers to each record and reading them in order

4724882
postgresql	mysql
pick one of the free ones like mysql or postgresql play with it and learn what they do

4724889
ilist	icollection
have a look at the members on offer to you by a class like list and you ll see what i mean in addition to not having to worry as much about array capacity and index out of bounds exceptions list and other icollection ilist classes give you methods like add remove clear insert find etc that are infinitely helpful

4724919
opera	firefox
none opera 9.26 + firefox 3.6 + ie9

it seems to work fine in firefox 3.6 but the div isn t showing up in google-chrome 10 and ie8

4724927
typedef	typename
if you want to declare a typedef with a dependent type then you do need to use the typename keyword

4724927
typedef	typename
btw typename is required even without the typedef

4724948
for-loop	arrays
if you have an arrays with numeric indexes use a for-loop instead of a foreach

4724991
width	height
my experience on mobile browsers is that setting both height and width will cause problems when the phone is rotated

4724998
google-chrome	safari
now this works in google-chrome maybe safari and you say now that it works in ie8 as far as getting the file chooser up

4725032
disk	ram
similarly if some memory page wasn t used for a long time the os may swap off the page from physical ram to disk

4725035
ubuntu	debian
php and mysql versions are identical with ubuntu 10.10 on my side and debian squeeze server-side

4725051
gridview	radgrid
so the situation is when you have a gridview or a control based on it like the radgrid and you want to keep track of a data table while you are adding editing reordering and deleting rows

4725056
google-chrome	firefox
if this is true how do web browsers such as ie firefox and google-chrome work out how to decode the stream when you use the view source functionality

4725066
portrait	landscape
i have a homescreen widget that displays in both landscape and portrait

4725068
opera	firefox
which works on firefox and opera

4725068
google-chrome	safari
fails on google-chrome ie8 and safari

4725100
post	get
note that your browser doesn t give direct access to this list of access points to the client ie javascript or the dom so you can t post it to php to get the location using this method via the server

4725102
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
all works on google-chrome firefox ie7 opera safari

4725118
stdout	stderr
i need to launch a 3rd party program inside a thread wait to get the results both from stdout stderr with c++

4725123
hide	show
the form that got me thinking about this had a good bit of logic built in to show and hide fields based on the user s responses and seems like it would have been less efficient to use mvc and jquery

4725146
for-loop	loops
secondly you d be as well using a for-loop rather than a for each loops here which will take away your manual count variable

4725172
portrait	landscape
is it possible to define a style for portrait orientation and another for landscape so when the device is rotated the change is automatic or it has to be done programmatically

4725179
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
previously this has been possible with the use of inotifypropertychanged inotifycollectionchanged and an open source library called clinq

4725461
matlab	simulink
matlab simulink central blog a lot of examples and useful information regularly updated

4725465
maven	pom.xml
if you use maven make sure to use bundledir in your pom.xml so that the libs are place in the right place

4725490
client-side	server-side
jaxer also makes client server communication really convenient with its runat server-proxy where you can directly call server-side function from within your client-side script and jaxer takes care of all the xml http request stuff

4725500
nsoperation	nsinvocationoperation
i think itâ s safe to assume that nsinvocationoperation and probally all nsoperation subclasses in appleâ s frameworks create their own autorelease pools just like the concurrency programming guide suggests for custom nsoperation subclasses

4725517
int	chars
it means that in this case boxing unboxing occurs only when object is of type int byte chars etc

4725568
google-chrome	firefox
ie is often a bit more picky about javascript errors than firefox or google-chrome and at the same time it is less helpful with its error reporting

4725627
sudo	passwd
when you run sudo it will ask for your os x passwd

4725634
keydown	keyup
one obvious way seemed to be to invoke the respective keydown keyup and keypress methods of the edit control like so

4725660
distance	polygons
how do i decide the distance of a polygons

4725665
spaces	linefeed
you might try putting the arguments in the same line rather than using the as a linefeed escape character and perhaps remove the quotes around the paths since no spaces exist in the paths

4725669
mouse	keyboard
these qwidget will not be rendered locally because there is no display but i need to access painting operations to create screenshot of them for example and i need to intercept mouse and keyboard operations

4725669
mouse	keyboard

4725780
google-chrome	firefox
this all works fine in firefox google-chrome and ie with google-chrome frame

4725794
hide	show	oncreate	ondestroy	onresume	onpause
i think you want to look at the status bar notifications article then hide show your application appropriately on oncreate onpause onresume ondestroy i m not sure of what your rules are

4725795
post	get
you have no greater security provided because the variables are sent over http post than you have with variables sent over http get

4725795
post	get
many browsers do not support http methods other than post get

4725795
post	get
browsers tend to store history it s recommended by rfc2616 9.1.1 to not use get to perform an action but to think that post provides security is flatly wrong

4725807
dumpsys	adb
how to interpret values from adb shell dumpsys meminfo what is the meaning of each value size alloc free pss priv dirty shared dirty what kind of data is it stored there

4725868
accurev	svn
quick mapping of svn to accurev concepts

4725870
textmate	aptana
in studio 3 much of this sort of functionality is still coming as aptana is going more of a textmate bundle route for a great deal of their features which i think is really cool

4725888
children	parent
i need to duplicate an object and all of its children what i m doing now is retrieve the object make a deep clone and put all ids to 0 parent and children and save it back to the db but the original object gets modified in the db

4725888
children	parent
i m serializing the object and i save it in a file then i deserialize the object and put ids to 0 then i make some operations for some values of the parent and children to change the original values i save everything fine but the problem is when i flush the session

4725919
width	height
another solution is saving the actual value of width and height in some vars and restoring on mouse out

4725936
google-chrome	firefox
after a while i understood that it was not possible to define a function with the name evaluate in the firefox and google-chrome

4725936
google-chrome	firefox
i wonder that is other function name which are reserved in firefox and google-chrome and how we could be aware about this reserved keys

4725969
cvs	svn
- svn is a descendant of cvs and keep most of its structures and fault

4725969
pull	push
you push and pull to the remote server allowing you to do a local versioning without disturbing the central repository then allowing you to branch as much as you like

4726020
getter	setter
it seems django doesn t have any kind of getter setter functionality inside of models i d like to be able to use entry.status and not something like entry.full_status because it becomes awfully confusing having lots of differently named properties

4726027
put	get
note that if i put a breakpoint on the service s method it doesn t even get that far

4726067
google-chrome	firefox
i have some troubles with confirm dialog not working with firefox but working with google-chrome

when i try your code it works successfully in both firefox and google-chrome if somelink is defined and fails to work as you describe in both if it is not defined

4726117
chgrp	chmod
to fix this you want to issue the command chgrp -r www-data log followed by chmod -r g+x log

4726154
distance	polygons
how do i decide the distance of a polygons

4726154
distance	polygons
painter s algorithm is the simplest to implement but it works only in very simple cases because it assumes that there is only a single distance or z-value for each polygons which you could approximate to be the average of z-values of all points in the polygons

4726154
distance	polygons
in reality there isn t a single distance value for a polygons -- each point on the surface of a polygons can be at a different distance from the viewer so each point has its own distance or depth

4726171
free	malloc
if the map contains pointers that were allocated with new or new or malloc then each pointer needs a corresponding delete or delete or free

4726215
cvs	svn	perforce	cvs	perforce	svn
there are so many features or just default behavior i d expect from a cvs that tfs seems to lack compared to svn git or perforce which i have experience with so my question is which tricks do you know which hidden features are out there to make tfs easier to use more convenient

4726215
perforce	svn
the tortoise- svn git merge tools or that of perforce are way better here

4726221
inherited	properties
dependencyproperty is overkill if you don t need any of its other features value inherited binding from the properties etc. it is best used for control properties not model properties

4726237
getter	setter
getter setter are members and therefore accessed via an instance

4726252
punctuation	words
a lexical analyzer is still required you must have something that will break the text into individual tokens words numbers punctuation etc.

nsoperationqueue	nsblockoperation
give the block to an nsblockoperation and hand that off to an nsoperationqueue

4726327

i m trying to set the dialog to be 180px less than the height and width of the screen.

4726327
width	height
is this the right way to set width and height or should i be doing something differently

4726333
mouse	keyboard
i do suspect you re not on the right track though if you have a console-mode service that needs a keyboard mouse and a graphical ui

4726349
put	get
note that you don t need a hook to be notified when a menu window is shown you can put a handler for the wm_enteridle message test for wparam to see if a menu caused the message get the menu window from lparam and again send a mn_gethmenu to find out the specific menu

4726357
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

g++	gcc
it appears that gcc and g++ has similar functionality

4726540

say that i in java have 3 classes wheres the super one has a function named func i now make a subclassing which overrides this and a subclassing to my subclassing now working on my sub-sub-class how will i call the func of the sub class and the superclass

4726846
put	get
this is basically the same thing as when you put a mutable type in a dictionary and you get what you deserve

4726884
post	get
can i tell sinatra that i want to use get and not have it implicitly select post

4726890
phpword	phpexcel
yes trying to determine the mimetype is your best bet short of just try catching to load the files with phpword phpexcel and phpowerpoint directly to see if they throw an exception mark baker correct me please if they dont throw exceptions

4726921
superclass	subclassing
you can access the superclass methods from within the subclassing itself

4726923
google-chrome	firefox
it works great on firefox and google-chrome however i have an issue with ie

4726923
google-chrome	firefox
what i found during debugging is that in google-chrome and firefox all the dropdownlist populate the request.form request.form voltage actually displays what the user has picked on the dropdownlist however in ie this request.form doesn t get populated at all it s just an empty string.

4726973
versioning	upgrade
i ve found out after i upgrade maven to versioning 3

4726997
children	parent
if you have code in your parent class that is shared across multiple subclasses perhaps that code could be moved to a non-overridden method so that it is readily accessible by all children granchildren etc

4727007
getdate	dateadd
dateadd day -7 getdate can be optimised because it s constant

4727083
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in firefox ie8 and safari 5 when i apply this property to a div that is used for containing ad banners like adsense leader boards or flash at the top of my content there is still some overlap happening in google-chrome when the window is resized to be small enough that they collide

4727115
google-chrome	safari
it looks perfect and exactly how i want in ffox google-chrome safari etc...but upon inspection in ie 6 7 8 is is not right

4727119
for-loop	loops	width	height
my idea so far is to loops through every pixel within the image for-loop based on img width height from this compare each pixel against a list of colours from this an algorithm is checked to see if the colors keep differentiating between the license plate white and the black of the text

4727129
flexunit	asmock
asmock dynamic mocking framework for as3 with integration support for flexunit 1 4.0 4.1 asunit and fluint

4727148
width	height
the problem is that this window must have size 80 width and 100 height of the screen of the user that is it should cover all the vertical space

4727280
allocator	stl
as with most stl containers it uses an external allocator to actually allocate the memory

4727284
super	abstract
so i d like to define an abstract super class where i can define this common code and behaviour

4727284
super	abstract
but how do i define an abstract super class for a surface usercontrol

4727354
getter	setter
you should use setter and getter that s what they are for

4727354
getter	setter
attributes mark parts of your code such that reflection can be used on this code - it is a rather heavy weight approach just because you don t like the look of property setter and getter

4727361
post	get
and user had to accept it to get it post on their wall

4727370
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
you may want to set the prompt ivar of the uinavigationitem object of your uinavigationbar

4727421
cos	sin
it s perfectly common to have parts of a project be generated perhaps a perl script creating a fast sin cos lookup table expressed as an initialized c array for an embedded system

4727421
getter	setter
also various mechanisms to save the trouble of implementing a zillion getter and setter

4727424
outputstream	inputstream
i ask the same question for inputstream outputstream java.sql.connection java.sql.preparedstatement etc

4727430
passenger	webrick
phusion passenger is the de facto apache mod and yes it s better than webrick which is really only good for tiny sites or testing

csla	.net
my company generates the entire dal and bo layer without out custom functions from a data model using the csla .net templates and codesmith

4727532

4727597
setinterval	settimeout
javascript timers with settimeout and setinterval

4727637
jar	manifest.mf
as i ve suddenly discovered jar specification says that being included meta-inf and manifest.mf must be first and second entries of package and not just directory and file within archive

4727637
jar	manifest.mf
how do i check that meta-inf and manifest.mf are properly ordered within jar

4727643
crypt	hash
it s also good practice to store the hash cost number of times the hash has been stretched even crypt does that

4727643
hash	salt
possibly the worst issue is that you first have to query the database to know the salt cost algorithm and then check against your generated hash this requires an extra trip to the db

4727677
swt	swing
you can use it with swing swt and once you learn it is a pretty powerful layout manager imho

4727704
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
also to learn about this lifecycle set a breakpoint or nslog statement in each of these methods viewdidload viewwillappear viewdidappear to see when they are called

4727715
post	get
since you are using sql server 2008 you could take advantage of sql server reporting services ssrs and create a report that can be called via web service or http get post by coldfusion

4727775
rss	feed
you sign up supply your rss feed s address then copy-paste the resulting code where-ever in your template you like

4727800

4727823
ubuntu	linux

4727825
ienumerable	iqueryable
when i change the ienumerable to an iqueryable the databind fails because the data has already been disposed of

4727889
post	get
post better because codeigniter was written to favor post requests over get requests

4727907
postgresql	mysql
i m primarily a postgresql user and i frequently hear about mysql getting bad press much like php

4727932
matlab	simulink
is there s a way to convert simulink blocks or a matlab .m code to c code automatically

4727941
postgresql	mysql
similarly when students would group by column_a and then select column_b where column_b had multiple values within each group instead of raising an error as oracle postgresql or sql server would mysql happily picks a column_b value at random and includes it

4728059
width	height
usually you have to call measure on the control so that it may size itself accordingly infinity lets the control expand to its width and height

4728076
google-chrome	firefox
i don t have to support ie6 but i do have to support ie7 firefox and google-chrome

4728140
google-chrome	firefox
they run fine in debug mode ie firefox google-chrome with all the swf s and swc s appearing in the bin-debug folder

4728145
versioning	upgrade
this also benefits from the fact that your versioning code must increase for the app to be seen as an upgrade by the market so you don t need to remember to change a separate value to detect the first-run

4728149
rss	feed
the service takes your batch of 10 000 links imported from sitemap backlink builders etc and chops them into rss feed of x per feed for aggregation

4728184
put	get
what this means is that if you get some libraries via nuget and put your project in source control another developer is then able to use your project without needing nuget at all

4728196
rss	feed
the ideal would be for everyone to have an rss feed for their products

4728236
filtering	grouping
i was able to filtering contacts by grouping by using the following query

4728236
simplecursoradapter	spinner
obviously you need to know the group id in order to complete this how i did this was used a simplecursoradapter to a spinner w the following cursor

4728237

then it depends on your server platform on any linux flavor ubuntu debian mac os you could use apache nginx in front of passenger mongrel thin unicorn .

4728547

width	height
when you initialise the vector you have width and height the wrong way around

4729790
width	height
your fillmatrix function has width and height in a different order to that in which you call it later in showmatrix

4729790
width	height
you could also just get the width and height from the vector within showmatrix instead of having these as arguments

4729791
width	height
but all that does is increase the width not the height

others have reported problems with maven 2.2.1 and 3 backing m2e and i ve seen the same

4730158
int	double
in java for primitive types int double etc. you cannot write .tostring because the types aren t objects

4730211
tostring	gethashcode
i will point out that while in java perhaps you had to write the unwieldy integer.tostring x for variables x of primitive types like int in c# and in .net in general all types including so-called primitive ones inherit from object and so have the method tostring along with gettype and gethashcode available to them

4730267

one strategy i use when i need to generate graphs from data in a db is to extract the data in some kind of xml way oracle sqlx or cocoon xsp esql or exist-db xquery and process it through an xslt to generate svg

4730287
dictionary	map
i don t think there s a way to map your indexer directly but you can expose the underlying dictionary type and map that instead

dictionary	map
if you don t want to expose the dictionary as public you can map it as a private property instead as explained here

4730311
superclass	subclassing

my problem was a little different in that i had a top-level qwidget instead of a qdialog or a qmainwindow that had children within a layout

4730540
qlayout	qwidget
this is normally set to qlayout setdefaultconstraint which simply affects the minimumsize of the qwidget that owns it

4730676
margin	height
happens that because i have set the margins of the #childdiv to a negative value in order to center it when i change it to relative that negative margin is taken into account when calculating the height of #container resulting in a smaller #container

4730757

4731710
super	abstract
making an abstract super entity will make this a lot easier

4731710
super	abstract
to do it you get all the names of objects in the abstract super entity and test them against the value to be validated

4731710
super	abstract
edit if you use the abstract super entity then you should get the max id of the objects in the abstract super entity if you want them to be unique

draggable	droppable
one problem i had was having a draggable element that too wide to be dropped on to a droppable element if the tolerance option is at the default value of intersect

4731864
uilabel	uitextview
i have tried various methods of recalculating the height of my uitextview based on the content that is loaded in them at runtime and though very laborious and inane i have gotten that to work but they then bleed over the uilabel positioned in the xib below them

4731864
uilabel	uitextview
do i really have to recalculate the y coordinates of every uilabel after calculating the new size of the uitextview

group-search-filter search filtering to find grouping memberships for the user

4732077
junit	mockito
the most important advise please try to write unit tests for this functionality first using for example junit and mockito and good design will come naturally

4732128
children	parent
i have semi-solutions that work situational for the former question children visible in overflow hidden parent

4732128
children	parent
if the parent div does not need to be position relative simply set the children styles to visibility visible

4732128
children	parent
if the parent div does need to be position relative the only way possible i found to show the children was position fixed

4732140
hide	show
but the functions bindmethodstoobj show hide hideifclickoutside keydownhandler selecttime all exist

4732153
post	get
some real world examples would be things like if you allowed a user to delete an account over get instead of post someone could post the following comment on your site assuming the site has some way to post comments or other input etc.

4732153
post	get
if it was done over post instead of get someone could craft a form and trick users into submitting it and the same result would happen

4732168
put	get
an x86 board is of no use for that because you can just put the extra x86 on the motherboard instead. you d be quite lucky to get something like that under 1000 much less near 100

hash	salt
i recommend using a salt instead of a seed for messagedigest family hash functions

4732381
hash	salt
prepending a salt is also more powerful than directly setting the seed values because in addition to changing the internal state of the hash if the salt is not a multiple of the digest block size then it can also perturb the alignment with which the input is fed into the hash function

4732443
cout	cin
my program so far my question is do i have to include the if statements after each cout cin code or is there a way to generalize it

however it seems that the effect will only be transient in contrast i18n saves the chosen locale in session which basically makes it quite persistent

4732526

4733823
int	chars
then in terms in invalid input-testing i doubt that the choices really need to be infinite and will fall into several cases that you can test reasonably well with just a few alternative inputs arguments eg for an int input test passing a zero negative int masssive overflowing int chars

4733823
getter	setter
getter and setter etc should then be implicitly tested by higher-level functions

4733828

as a rule of thumb create a private member field for local access to your property and a getter setter for external access

4736386
getter	setter
lots of 3rd party libs such as spring rely on public methods for dependency injection inversion of control and and aspect oriented programming so using getter setter facilitates that style of programming

in c chars gets promoted to int in expressions

4736764
int	chars
d prints an int it will print the ascii representation of your chars

4736764
int	chars
prints 4 because a chars literal is an int in c and not a chars

4736782
getter	setter
if your getter setter uses synchronize using will bypass that the safe-guards

4736799

4736995
pop-up	dialog
is there an equivalent easy method to call to pop-up a warning dialog

4737017
width	height
in many cases height or width will return the same values as those methods

4737017
children	parent
you have a handful of different height values to look at but keep in mind it is always the responsibility of the parent to size it s children

4737017
width	height
adding children to a component will not necessarily change it s height or width

4737017
width	height
if you set height or width then these values are set

4737017
width	height
there is some magic under the hood so that explicitheight and explicitwidth are masked behind height and width

4737017
width	height
i don t usually deal with scaling but if you need the unscaled height and width of a component there is an unscaledwidth and unscaledheight protected properties of the component

4737659
google-chrome	firefox
it works exactly as intended in google-chrome and firefox but ie won t do a thing

4737663

you can easily put the linkbutton directly into the markup of the gridview as long as you don t mind using a template field and there will be no need to mess around with the rowdatabound event

4737725
hide	show
ultimately the best solution would be to have all the markup on the page when it loads and just show docs and hide docs it as necessary

4737748

4738023
minimum	diagonal
the solution will be the minimum of the operations in the diagonal of the dp array going from bottom-left to top-right as well as each entry just above and just below the diagonal

4738023
minimum	diagonal
this works because the entries along the diagonal represent the minimum edits required to make the first i and last n-i characters of the string equal and the entries just above and just below represent the minimum for strings ending up with odd-length where the middle left-over character doesn t match against anything

4738061

versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the newer versioning and the getrevision method on changeset should do you well

4738139
getter	setter
the hardest thing i find is to judge the value of a tool in the context of my application - i do not need a tool that generates java files with getter setter methods given a list of variables - to me that is yet another level of indirection but then junit in eclipse is helpful for debugging

4738207

4739146
phpmyadmin	mysql-workbench
i think you should install phpmyadmin on your server this will allow you to access your database from work school cafe etc mysql-workbench is more advanced and gives you more features so you can deal with changing the structure and editing any rows columns relations and much more look at phpmyadmin s features it has most if not all

4739146
apache	lighttpd
btw if you are not using apache or lighttpd for the http-server you will need to read through the conf files for phpmyadmin and then write up the required conf script for phpmyadmin to work with your http-server

4739149
apache	nginx
i switched from ms-centric solutions about a year and a half ago and now i m hosting all of my websites and web projects on linux mono apache mysql based virtual servers i was originally using nginx instead of apache but mono-fastcgi-server was randomly causing thrashing so i choose apache as a web server

4739171
base	fractions
if we used base 8 or 16 in real life then people around here would be saying base 10 decimal fractions packages are inaccurate why did anyone ever cook those up

4739171
base	fractions
the problem is that integral values translate exactly from one base into another but fractions values do not because they represent fractions of the integral step and only a few of them are used

4739171
base	fractions
the idea is to avoid trying to express the binary number with a base 10 fractions

4739231

hey guys when i am writing my plugin how do i get the post data from the textbox and insert it into the db

4744491
width	height
if you want to change the width and height of your text field use textfield.width and textfield.height

4744491
width	height
you can combine those with textfield.autosize as well if you set width after autosize the textfield will resize only vertically while if you set height after autosize it will resize horizontally

4744510
maven-release-plugin	pom.xml
you then just need a script that updates the version numbers of all the child pom.xml files to the correct revision whenever you do a release or my much less preferred option use the maven-release-plugin

4744551
width	height
as i am designing a liquid layout all my width and height are in

4744552

provide a handler for the onresize event of the container on which the twebbrowser sits and manually set the twebbrowser s height and width to those of the container optionally adjusted for any margins you want to have within the container

4744562
folder	directory
the directory structure and .class files will be organized by packages in folder

4744598
accessor	properties
note that i didn t use the generated properties accessor in either initializer method

4744598
accessor	properties
if you aren t required by circumstances you should generally avoid using properties accessor in -init methods and -dealloc primarily because of potential pain-in-the-ass issues with side effects of automatic key-value coding notifications

4744598
accessor	properties
a good rule of thumb is to leave the use of synthesized properties accessor for the callers of your class and the implementation of other methods in the class

4744598
accessor	properties
when implementing other methods in your class you generally should use the properties accessor

4744613

4744748
portrait	landscape
if you need different layouts for portrait landscape please check answer from anand

4744759
accessor	properties
question 2 the properties statement in your interface is really just a directive to the compiler to automatically generate accessor methods for an instance variable that have the characteristics you specify

4744759
accessor	properties
the compiler will look at the properties line and generate invisible accessor code for you

4744759
accessor	properties
if you didn t use properties you d have to write accessor methods similar to the above in your custom class

4744792
free	malloc
you must pass in the same pointer value to free that was returned by malloc or your program will have undefined behaviour

mysql is designed for speed over everything else postgresql is not the default mysql table type does not even handle transactions.

4745227
postgresql	mysql
what is more common is inserting small chunks of data from different connections simultaneously in this case postgresql uses row-level locking - a feature not supported by the default mysql table type which theoretically at least should cause it to outperform mysql

public	protected
if there is a public create method inherited then reintroducing a protected create method won t actually hide the public one at all

4752020
mp3	ogg
i would like to use taglib to read write coverart especially for mp3 and ogg files but i couldn t find any examples

4752069
cout	cin
cin and cout have a special relationship where reading from cin will automatically flush cout beforehand

4752069
cout	cin
this makes sure that the the prompt you wrote to cout will actually be seen by the user before the read from cin is waiting for input

4752074
google-chrome	firefox
it worked in firefox google-chrome everything but ie8

4752092
client-side	server-side
but once you annotate code on the server-side with hibernate validation-constraints you don t need to do anything on the client-side

4752105
icommand	ivalueconverter
i also use ivalueconverter that converts xml string to icommand

4752125

textview and imageview

4752175
switching	screens
then when you switching your displaystate to fullscreen just move everything based on the screens edges

4752178
getter	setter
in adobe flex the getter is called implicitly by the vm its running on whenever a setter is called even though no explicit check is being made

4752179
inherited	subclassing
create two new types in your edmx that inherited from the current table type then use the mapping editor to specify the column documenttype that defines which subclassing to instantiate and the value that corresponds to each subclassing

4752250
google-chrome	firefox
i m on an hp desktop with windows 7 firefox 5.0 ie9 and google-chrome 12.0.742.122

4752253
touchesbegan	touchesended
i ve noticed this in other places touchesbegan and touchesended as well but i ve been able to hack around it

4752272
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
here s a good rule of thumb based on tests done in google-chrome safari and firefox splicing a single value into the middle of an array is roughly half as fast as pushing shifting a value to one end of the array

4752288
int	chars
to detect which key combination was pressed check the lowest four bits of the low-order word for the modifiers shift alt control and compare the high-order word against the virtual key code - which for letters is equal to the chars value of the capital for example the virtual key code for a is int a but not int a

4752303
put	get
get put delete of the reflection layer objects still make perfect sense idempotency etc

4752317
punctuation	words
note there are some cases you will have to handle here you may have to split at punctuation characters and hyphens and you may have to cope with a single words that is longer than the formatting width

4752326
spaces	delimiter
so i d like to say my column delimiter token is 3 spaces and then trim the data within each to have my actual columnar data

4752331
google-chrome	safari
have you tried it in other browser with debugging capabilities like google-chrome or safari

4752342
post	get
if the connection was successful it sends over the information using an http get request traditionally get is used for getting information post is used for setting it

4752369
google-chrome	firefox
i have seen this problem in both firefox 3.6+ and google-chrome

4752384
spaces	delimiter
another option is to use explode using the delimiter spaces

4752408
haskell	ocaml
if you are looking for something more concise and elegant i would suggest you to look forward functional languages like ocaml or haskell maybe f# if you want an api similar to the java one that have the so called type reconstruction which is how the real generics thing should be implemented

4752440
nsurl	nsstring
i ve tried passing an nsurl and an nsstring probably incorrectly -p but to no avail

4752447
pop-up	dialog
when you do joptionpane showmessge your thread thread.currentthread is going to do wait and the dialog will pop-up

4752503
min	max
i think the explanation is there timespan structure incorrectly handles values close to min and max value

4752516
memcpy	memset
how about memcpy followed by memset

4752528
memcpy	memset
you can use memcpy and memset like

4752580
min	max
i use this method which compares the min and the max after dividing by the mean

4752583
vim	textmate
is there a possibility in vim to repeat execute and update # markers textmate feature for ruby code

4752596
printf	fgets
when i debug an osx application from xcode i can communicate with the application s console from the xcode debugging console - for example the application can printf to stdout and that s displayed on the xcode debugging console and my application can call fgets on stdin to which i can type input in the xcode debug console

4752612
put	get
to clarify there is absolutely nothing you can ever put in a or b to get a different output on the comparison just by putting it on the other side of the operator

4752616
postgresql	mysql
for mysql sqlite postgresql use limit

4752666

4752702
flask	web2py
if you want something small flask web2py and a number of others work

4752716
uitableview	reloaddata
uitableview reloadsections withrowanimation or even reloaddata will work but if that isn t good for you for other reasons as it wasn t for me i didn t want the current text field to resign first responder you can keep references to all of the headerviews and then update them directly when necessary

4752728
free	malloc
in this function i allocate a buffer using malloc free and call the same audio processing method i mentioned above

4752746
button	checkbox
i need to add a label in the north and 3 checkbox in the center and 3 button at the south

4752773
post	get
it includes parsing get and post requests as you mentioned in the question

4752834
range	minimum
requesting the range should optimize getting the minimum and maximum

4752842
fadein	fadeout
i am trying to display a the following div via fadein fadeout when a user saves data in a form

4752892
post	get
for example i ve come across websites that use form elements such as inputs where the name values use s and square brackets which is generally for things like arrays via get post

4752901
width	height
i wanted to know if it is possible to find the width and height of a .bmp image in c

4752909
vb.net	vb6
i think it would be the easiest to migrate to vb.net asp.net web forms if you take into account the current vb6 developers

4752909
vb.net	vb6
vb.net is not completly the same as vb6 but it s closer than java

4752926
profiling	debugging
obviously you have to include debugging symbols to decode profiling session but do you profiling with -o0 or with higher optimization levels

4752947
integer	fractions
when a finite value of real floating type is converted to an integer type other than _bool the fractions part is discarded the value is truncated toward zero

4752947
integer	unsigned
the remaindering operation performed when a value of integer type is converted to unsigned type need not be performed when a value of real floating type is converted to unsigned type

4752970
opera	google-chrome
opera and google-chrome use utf-8

4752976
tabcontrol	tabitem
your question is a bit unclear but you can t bind your class termino directly to the itemssource of the tabcontrol as it s not derived from tabitem

4752976
tabcontrol	tabitem
actually thinking about it you should be creating a list of tabitem to set to the itemssource of your tabcontrol and binding your class to the tabitem

4753005
int	boolean
int is commonly used as a boolean in c at least prior to c99

4753012
width	height
it provides a way to scroll content inside a fixed width height element

4753013
width	height
i ve seen the function bitmap.createbitmap sourcebitmap x y width height but it requires my large image as the source input

4753042
int	boolean
you could use defines to avoid using int and 1s and 0s directly for boolean logic

4753072
folder	directory
but how would you store it in a text file in a directory or folder of my choosing with one email per line

4753132
required	placeholder
change all your mail-merge fields with easy to find and parse placeholder that are not going to appear int he document normally and will not required xml encoding

4753141
getter	setter
that s what you re asking for - runtime code that introspects the properties and generates getter setter

4753152
interpolation	splines
i found a cubic splines code in matlab to give me the interpolation polynomial

4753201
profiling	debugging
to see if this works for you you can open up sql profiling or grab the trial for nhibernate profiling and debugging your code

4753204
querypath	phpquery
if you want to match more complex html then prefer a proper parser phpquery or querypath simplify it tremendously.

4753207
put	get
i really just want to get to the root of javascript best practice and find out how something like this should really be put together

4753226
partition	voltdb
if you re storing in memory you re likely going to run out of space and require horizontal partition sharding and may want to check out something like voltdb if you want to stick with sql

4753228
user-controls	tabcontrol
the problem i have is that i have do create and declare the delegate in every single user-controls and the main tabcontrol

4753253
tvos	ios
app size for ios tvos only

4753259
google-chrome	safari
i then thought to achieve this with using a 3 column table in my header and style my td elements using background-image and repeat-x but that seems not work well in google-chrome and safari

4753287
width	height
i found out you can recreate absolute positioning by adding your child views to a relativelayout and set the relativelayout.layoutparams to have only default values except width height margintop and marginleft

4753299
boost	stl
i am not aware standard stl has a way to make this neater though i guess boost does - however we don t use boost right now and i am interested anyway

4753324
spaces	delimiter
the strings are delimiter by whitespace tabs newlines spaces

4753359
post	get
the closest you can get is the approach described here the post describes razor views with webforms master pages but you should be able to flip the view engines around

4753363
post	put
my understanding from reviewing is that clients should only send content-type headers on post and put requests

4753364
public	protected
a method should be public if it needs to be called from outside of the class that contains it private or protected otherwise

4753366
public	protected
if its an internal method only make it private or protected otherwise you can make it public

4753383
min	max
i need to run a comparison on the min and max based on the plan.age_id data

4753402
public	protected
if the method is only supposed to be accessed by sub classes and your class is public then make the method protected

4753405
public	protected
that means private is better than protected protected is better than public etc ..

4753533
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
have you added the second view to an exisitng view using addsubview or added it to some form of uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller

4753544
factors	matrix	factors	mean
whenever you see some math showing a matrix inversion that should be read to mean solve a system of linear equations or factors the matrix and use the factorization to solve the system

4753564
min	max
one can use an openmp built-in functionality for reduction operations a reduction is an operation like calculating a sum of a list finding the min or max of a list etc which can be done one element at a time only by looking at the result so far and the next element as suggested by ejd

4753579
cassini	iis
use iis or iis express rather than cassini

4753594
memcpy	memset
memset memcpy to a local buffer and

4753633
sorting	grouping
i have a sorting grouping issue that i m hoping somebody could add some insight on

4753633
range	min	range	max	min	max
what i have right now is sorting everything by -pub_date and then getting a range of the max and min dates on a given page

4753644
folder	directory
you ll quite possibly have to ftp it in even though it s on the same machine depending on user rights etc. as a tip ftp is into a temp directory in the ftp folder and then move rename in ftp parlance it into a for collection folder once the ftp has completed

4753697
mvvm	delegatecommand
prism has some elements that can help you with mvvm delegatecommand and compositecommand for example but i think it s more complete with another mvvm framework

4753709
post	get
i tried to post a similar question to the rvm google group but it did not seem to get posted

4753713
width	height
the width and height should be max 200 pixels

4753713
gif	png
the file format should be png gif and jpeg

4753718
iprincipal	iidentity
i have been trying to wrap my brain around the program flow of security with iidentity iprincipal and role authorization in an mvc2 application -- but i m really struggling here and could use some mentoring

4753741
redhat	fedora
and then restart mysql with redhat fedora centos

4753752
content-length	content-type
additionally if no entity was provided in the request and the content-length is zero assuming the transfer-encoding header is not set and is not identity the server should not try to consume an entity regardless of of the request method or whether or not there s a content-type header present

4753760
width	height
i have a class for menu and i also want a class to apply to all of my hyperlinks a certain height and width

4753785
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari have such built in tools too and so does the latest version of opera

4753788
google-chrome	firefox
the console for firefox firebug and google-chrome allow for unbinding of that event

4753824
filtering	grouping
somehow i m leaning towards the interceptor simply because i have to create a custom interceptor for my project so i m thinking of grouping all these filtering in spring mvc config file rather than having opensessioninviewfilter in web.xml and my custom interceptor in spring mvc config file

4753836
google-chrome	firefox
all my charts work perfectly on firefox and google-chrome but i m facing a huge problem on ie

4753871
devise	cancan
i m using devise and cancan for authentication authorization

4753890
versioning	upgrade
only your web hosting company can upgrade php to the new versioning

4753909
uptime	reboot
it returns ticks since the device was last reboot otherwise known as uptime

4753910
uptime	reboot
it returns ticks since the device was last reboot otherwise known as uptime

4753928
uptime	reboot
it returns ticks since the device was last reboot otherwise known as uptime

4753929
width	margin
explaination the rendered width of the ul will be equal to the sum of all the list item widths and this will include any margin and padding adjustments for the list items

4753970
google-chrome	firefox
i have it working on firefox but google-chrome is giving me permission errors that look this like

4753970
google-chrome	firefox
information about how google-chrome interprets cors requests differently than firefox

4753972
explode	implode
i m not a ruby dev but is there some equivalent of php s explode so you could explode the string insert a new item at the second array index then implode the parts with again.

4753989
children	parent
however this wouldn t get the width of the parent but the max width of it s children

4753999
vb6	vba
this requires win32 api calls which can be made from vb6 or vba but i m not sure of the exact effect on your project once you do this..

4754011
int	chars
usually when i write anything in c++ and i need to convert a chars into an int i simply make a new int equal to the chars

4754025
children	parent
then after the initial array is built move the children under their parent manually by parsing the initial array

4754066
ssl	https
one additional consideration - if your site is ssl and you need to support android 2.1 or earlier the ssl certificate on the https version of the microsoft cdn will crash those versions of the android browser per this issue

4754075
ttabsheet	tframe
now if you want to use a standard windows tabbed interface you could still use the page control as you have suggested you know that each ttabsheet has a single tframe on it and you can check it s type and work with it as required

4754075
hide	show
when you click a tab you hide everything and show the correct tframe

4754080
width	height
so the reason you get 801 and 601 is because the height and width of the total content on the stage is 801 x 601

4754080
width	height
if you are displaying this in a webbrowser then you can set the height and width of the movie

4754080
width	height
if you do want to allow for height 100 and width 100 in your html markup then you have a couple options

4754148
freeglut	glew
the examples do not only include source code but also visual studio projects and all the necessary libraries freeglut glew

4754166
bazaar	git
this means that if your newbies got stuck they d have a greater chance of receiving help in the git tag than in the bazaar tag

4754181
min	max
scales well with the bounds of in_range and out_range their min and max values

4754265
mouse	keyboard
we re going to use lync on kiosk-like pc without physical keyboard and mouse only touchscreen

4754271
post	get
when i try and post a request with a json body i get this error

4754293
inherited	properties
apparently ie 6 7 do not properly handle setting the css cursor properties to inherited

4754293
inherited	properties
to fix this we set cursor to auto instead of inherited and used an empty string to clear the properties instead of null

4754318
int	boolean
just discovered that type-hinting is allowed in php but not for int strings boolean or floats

4754338
folder	directory
there is large number of reasons why it could happen - some file in use some process have working folder set to the directory some files are not visible to your process due to permissions and so on

4754346
hide	show
i have a form with some input texts and radio buttons i want to show when the user hit a hyperlink some other elements of the form and when the user hit again hide them

4754357
hide	show
bind the hyperlink to a click event and then hide or show the elements you want in there

4754357
hide	show
so will hide or show all radio buttons based on their current state ie

4754372
hide	show
this has the advantage that you can call other js processing on a show or hide that might be specific to a show or specific to a hide such as changing the link s text

4754385
move	drag
i would do it by adding a event listener for when the mouse move if the distance from the slider becomes too much stop the drag early i m not sure exactly how your slider works but this may help

4754413
portrait	landscape
you can simply copy and paste the following code and you should be able to launch the modal view in portrait landscape mode

4754413
portrait	landscape
edit i said portrait mode instead of what i meant landscape mode

4754441
getchar	kbhit
if you don t want the program to wait for a keyboard press kbhit combined with either getch or getchar will suffice

4754458
jstl	taglib
if you see the jstl tags unparsed in the html source then it means that either the jstl taglib isn t been declared in top of jsp as follows

4754475
post	get
you could do it in 1 curl request if on the crm server script after processing the post vars you do a header redirect that attachs the post vars as get vars to the esp server url

4754484
uiview	uiwindow
all you will need to do is in your uiview or uiwindow better yet implement making sure the view becomes first responder

4754486
int	chars
you can convert chars to int and viceversa easily because for the machine an int and a chars are the same 8 bits the only difference comes when they have to be shown in screen if the number is 65 and is saved as a chars then it will show a if it s saved as a int it will show 65

4754488
nunit	mstest
export tests to mstest nunit export rename some stuff etc.

4754488
google-chrome	firefox
tried running the test in google-chrome iexploreproxy and firefox

4754504
apache	nginx
i like passenger and apache or nginx

4754523
cvs	svn
i m just picking up git after years of svn and cvs

4754645
width	height
you will probably want to do it proportionally which is to say you want to keep the same ratio of width to height so that the image doesn t appear stretched after resampling it

4754661
post	get
additionally if you have a link it won t get replaced might be a little more than you need but i thought i d post it anyway

4754673
bazaar	git
mercurial git and bazaar are all great and vastly superior to nothing

4754713
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve got a page that displays properly and beautifully in google-chrome safari firefox and opera but very slightly reformats in internet explorer and iphone s mobile version of safari

4754720
int	double
in the case of primitives casting can be used to demote primitives from one type to another so casting a double to an int works by dropping the decimal component

4754737
casting	autoboxing
imho this is a non-sense casting to integer together with autoboxing would be fine but i know no single case when this compiles without warning and without error

4754743
nscolorpanel	nscell
i have a custom nscell with the following code to display an nscolorpanel when it is clicked

4754846
pull	push
the issue is that i can not git push changes from my netbook to my online server however i can run git pull on my netbook and get added modified files from the work i do on the server

4754914
pull	push
after doing git push from whichever machine that you ve just finished coding on do a git pull from the other

4754920
jar	war
that way when i do mvn package i get a jar with all of the classes that i want packaged and when i run mvn integration-test i get a war that cargo starts up as a test harness

4754921
cos	sin
end points of the hands aare at r cos theta -r sin theta from centerx centery

4754923
ienumerable	iqueryable
since iqueryable in turn implements ienumerable

4754923
ienumerable	iqueryable
why in the first declaration iqueryable has to explicitly implement ienumerable as well

4754926
memcpy	memmove
also it may interest you that there are already two functions available in the standard c library memmove and memcpy

4754931
mouseleave	mouseenter
this first fades your divs then attaches a hover event on them - where the first function is run when the mouseenter the area and the second function is run when your mouseleave the area

4754941
mouseleave	mouseenter
this binds two functions to your divs one for mouseenter and one for mouseleave and as you can see they do opposite fadetos to each other

4754995
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the following will work in ie as well as firefox and google-chrome safari

4755009
subtraction	add	subtraction	addition
for example you might have commands like add that do addition sub for subtraction or call for function calls

4755010
freemarker	velocity
but struts does evaluate jsp freemarker velocity and generate the final html which is passed to the user

4755014
chown	chmod
i understand php has functions chown and chmod however when trying to run these commands even from the command line i am unable to handover ownership of the files to the user apache

4755047
passenger	unicorn
i fixed it by using dalli memcached client and reseting the connection in the after_fork callback of either unicorn or passenger

4755050
jaxp	saaj
can there be conflict between the jaxb jaxp saaj reference implementation in java 6 and xerces 2.x referenced by a war in a standard java ee container like tomcat and if so how given the classes have the same name but are in different namespaces

4755071
post	get
i know the difference between post and get however if i used post instead of get anything not good besides not up to w3c standards

4755133
google-chrome	safari
also this way you don t have to worry about setting cookies in iframes which doesn t work in safari and google-chrome

4755159
telerik	radcombobox
i did something similar with a label and a radcombobox from telerik

4755173

here is a nice extensive tutorial using node.js together with express and other frameworks q node+tutorial

4755174
vmware	esx
i am a vmware esx user i have 30 production vm s with the largest being 232gb

4755185
width	height
the viewgroup under that relativelayout is set to the same width and height of the relativelayout at runtime

4755217
min	max
i have given min and max values along the y - axis with the interval of 50

4755235
post	get
and if after doing this you re still having problems please update your question to include more details on the problem you are seeing and also post a comment on this response so we get a notification from stack overflow that you did update the question.

4755241
width	height
after - ie s flash is notified of the width change but still thinks it s height is the same

4755266
nhibernate	queryover
i m wanting to create a generic method for list with nhibernate and queryover

4755273
post	get
a good hacker can change post to get easily

4755273
post	get
if you get this far know that post changes data adds a membership or charges a credit card whereas get only fetches data searches for red shirts

4755273
post	get
the makers of browsers make their browsers behave differently for the results of post vs get

4755273
post	get
then know that get has a url length limit and that you may need to resort to post in this case.

4755296
innodb	myisam
i have recently switched my database tables from myisam to innodb and experience bad timeouts with queries mostly inserts

4755296
innodb	myisam
one function i use previously took 2 seconds to insert delete and update a large collection of records across 30 myisam tables but now that they are innodb the function causes a php timeout

4755304
getter	setter
how many times getter or setter called in the jsf lifecycle

4755309
addclass	removeclass
you can use .toggleclass instead of addclass removeclass and put your class names in as arguments of the function

4755351
versioning	upgrade
so if you have newly encountered this error check your nunit versioning as of december 2010 or so the only thing you need to do is upgrade nunit

4755360
accessor	properties
i had defined them for debugging purposes as gbd cannot see the values of properties without defined ivars it seems and this prevented primitive accessor from being generated correctly

4755378
accessor	properties
for field and properties access timing i wouldn t worry too much - in reality in release build simple properties accessor will be get inlined giving same performance as field access

4755397
getter	setter
how many times getter or setter called in the jsf lifecycle

4755397
getter	setter
preferable for getter setter to just do the getting setting

4755404
hash	salt
as a security measure django stores passwords as salt one-way hash

4755442
junit	jmock
loaded from jmock not from junit

4755442
junit	jmock
my understanding of the solution is make the test class use the hamcrest jar from jmock instead of the one from junit

4755497
entity-relationship	diagram
what represents single line with an arrow mark in entity-relationship diagram

on a quick google there are many post on utilizing mysql text search to get relevant results sorted by relevance

4757423

in mysql boolean type is a synonym for tinyint

4757456
tinyint	boolean
mysql doesn t really have a boolean type if you create a boolean column it will actually be a tinyint

4757776
maven	pom.xml
you can t set maven s internal properties directly on the command line but you can get there with a little trick by adding placeholders in your pom.xml

4757796
getter	setter
in practise my use of this is to do more complicated things than just wrapping property setter and getter the code in the componentmodel namespace is probably better for this - as in the way that mvc leverages it but properly woven these kinds of solutions provide excellent performance and accessibility to the end-user the application coder in my case

4757827

multiplying	add	multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication	addition	multiplication
in the remote case those operations are not simplified assuming that there is a jit that maps the multiplication and add opcodes in a 1 1 relationship to their cpu instruction counterparts in most modern architectures all integer arithmetic operations usually take the same number of cycles so it will be faster multiplying once than add four times just checked it addition is still slightly faster than multiplication 1 clock vs 3 clocks so it still pays using a multiplication here

4757909
addition	multiplication
but in many cases addition is faster than multiplication

4757943
imagick	ffmpeg-php
the weird part is there are a lot of php extension available in hombrew out of the box such as apc imagick xdebug ffmpeg-php but no php

i have an ipad app where i would like to hide and show a category list kind of like the small view in a split view controller and the main view which contains a uinavigationcontroller stack

4758122
innodb	myisam
this is less of an issue if you use innodb rather than myisam tables that said. additionally you should ideally prevent all access to the database whilst you re carrying out an alterations as otherwise changes may be lost if you have to roll the database back to its previous state

4758146
mojolicious	catalyst
alternatively have a look at catalyst which has a bit more requirements than mojolicious but also has a couple books out and a bigger community behind it

i went through this process before for testing diff player versions 9 10 in ie firefox and google-chrome and detailed it here

4758293

4758574

with yourkit profiler it seems to me that these entities are still in the l1 cache of hibernate referenced in statefulpersistencecontext and since i have opensessioninview i guess the problem is that the conversation is a bit long and the cache need to be cleaned.

4758582
for-loop	arrays
you d better use an arrays of objects and use an ordinary for-loop to keep the specified order like

4758582
inherited	properties
just a side note when iterating over object using for â in you really should use hasownproperty to check whether it is an inherited properties or not otherwise you might include inherited properties in your select box

4758625
getter	setter
so if you need a breakpoint on the getter setter you will need the verbose form

4758651
oncreate	ondestroy
this way you limit the repetitive work to creating this object and calling its oncreate ondestroy methods

4758686
free	realloc
if realloc returns null the data originally pointed to by m_pbuffer is lost you have nothing pointing to it and you can no longer free it

4758708
for-loop	loops
for example if your loops requires a dummy variable then a for-loop maybe more appropriate

onclick	onfocus
when the onclick or onfocus event is raised for switching between tabs however you manage it just call a function to change the src of the image on the active inactive tabs

button	checkbox
alternatively define your own custom handler interface s to be called when the button is clicked or the checkbox is checked

4766153
button	checkbox
finally have singlerowadapter create event handlers to attach to the checkbox and button - these event handlers simply call your own custom handlers

int	double
it also makes assumptions about the size of int s and double - in particular it assumes 32-bit int and 64-bit ieee floats for double

4766468
int	double
the key here is that non-denormalized ieee floating point values and a 32-bit int in a double will always be non-denormalized end up with a representation looking a bit like where xxxxxxxx is the fractional component and e is the exponent

it you want to extends a class rather than implements an interface or create a class out of the blue you need to use a library to create bytecode

4767114
textview	listactivity
given the above layout in your xml and that your corresponding java class extends the listactivity the textview will automatically be shown for you when your list doesn t have any items and it will also automatically be hidden when the list get its first item

i would recommend you to prevent possibility of changing viewmodel.lst lst s type should be ienumerable instead of list ilist of course if your further code doesn t require list functionality

4767303
post	get	post	put	put	get
script tags will always fetch content via get so you can t do a delete post put or suchlike with them

4767355
getter	setter
getter setter are generally used from outside class from inside directly access the fields

4767355
getter	setter
the main advantage purpose is encapsulation of getter setter

4767355
getter	setter
if your getter setter has some logical code then use it

4767355
getter	setter
more on getter and setter

4767356
put	get
subreports we show within the main crystal reports and also we can show it as on-demand report that means we put an hyper link in the row and when user click that hyper link then will get the subreport

4767359
chunked	transfer-encoding
the data arrives as a push response ie chunked transfer-encoding

4767379
getter	setter
yes getter and setter are useful

4767379
getter	setter
so it s a good idea to use getter and setter even if they do not contain much logic other than these checks

4767385
getter	setter
you re supposed to use the getter and setter almost everywhere including inside the class

4767385
getter	setter
the same applies to getter and setter

4767385
getter	setter
essentially you should always try to use the getter and setter whenever they provide the functionality they want

4767385
getter	setter
there s no point writing getter and setter if you aren t going to use them

4767404
versioning	upgrade
how it will work if i upgrade asp.net mvc to versioning 3 in addition to uprading to .net 4.0

4767505
hash	md5
now this check is done on a few things i think probably the file size file name and of course the crc md5 hash or something...

4767514
width	height
in this case height width and job_id are all numbers and pix is an array of arrays of integers

4767527
for-loop	arrays
from there you can just create a for-loop over the different layers of your 3d arrays

4767529
next	except
i then push the next view controller which does need a prompt and the bar expands except behind the view hiding the title and back button

4767563
range	min	range	max	min	max
the range is set dynamically so when either the min max values on my usercontrol change the client validation function is updated

4767824
lapply	tapply
i am not sure if apply is actually faster than for-loops though tapply and lapply definatly are

4767827
ubuntu	linux
for ubuntu it s explained here but it will most likely apply to other linux distros too

4767830
folder	directory
unzip the download into a directory you have complete control of usually a directory under your username preserving folder

4767830
folder	directory
download eclipse package from eclipse.org and extract it to a folder in your home directory

4767840
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
you have to register for the mousedown mouseup and mousemove events and move the form according to the movement of the mouse

4767841
ubuntu	linux
that said it s a lot easier if you re on a linux system already - the package sources are divided into an original source tarball plus ubuntu patches so if you don t use apt-get source you ll need to manually apply the patch to the source code

4767845
move	drag
this should be what you are looking for enhanced drag and move winforms

4767910
matplotlib	scipy
the easiest solution i found was to get a make file which downloads numpy scipy and matplotlib and compile them for you

4767924
children	parent
unfortunately if i were to disable selecting text in the parent div all the children divs immediately adopted that behaviour and that is not what i meant

4767924
children	parent
i want that the parent div won t be selected but its children will

4767936
pop-up	dialog
one way is when we download something from microsoft s website a small pop-up window with no close maximise and minimise button and then the save dialog box appears

4767950
min	max
i m thinking min and max would be the amp of the wave and rateofchange would be a product of the sine function i just can t figure out how it all goes together

4767967
pull	push
from here you can git clone git push git pull the repo as you wish

4767998
children	parent
the parent thread process will assure the children aren t trying to do the same thing

4768085
boost	stl
with the large size of current c c++ libraries like stl win32 boost posix etc

4768135
put	get
that s why most communities and similar pages put a proxy between the page and the external ressource they strip the session-id if it is stored via get

4768138
submit	submission
for clarity i am using the following with the jq submit function in the click handler for this form submission

4768226
versioning	upgrade
the eclipse versioning available through the official ubuntu channels is 3.5 and should not be manually upgrade to 3.6

4768229
maven	pom.xml
to create two jars you need two maven modules pom.xml

4768233
free	malloc
for each malloc call you typically need a corresponding free call in order to avoid memory leaks

4768233
free	malloc
in your case you have two malloc calls in application.c 730 and application.c 731 for which there is no free call made by the time your program terminates

4768233
free	malloc
a common cause of this issue is storing the result of two malloc calls to the same pointer without an intermediate free call

4768260
jar	manifest.mf
you may also add classpath references in the executable jar file manifest.mf or for more experienced users use maven assembly plugin which will create artefact with all its dependencies packed within a single jar

4768318
for-loop	loops
you have a while loops inside your outer for-loop while read in.read b 0 10

4768409

4768428
rtp	sdp
such solution could take external stream description in sdp format and your actual rtp packets

4768428
rtp	rtsp
edit btw it s weird that you receive just rtp stream w o any description of its format usually its description is provided somehow by rtsp mpeg-ts or something else

4768459
gitolite	gitosis
while arrowmaster is correct in saying that gitosis has been depreciated in favour of gitolite there is nothing to say that you cant use git for web deployment there are loads of people doing it including me

4768459
pull	push
what you need to do is the following get gitolite setup and have a working installation whereby you can clone push and pull into the repositories that gitolite will create for you

4768459
gitolite	gitosis
after a long time messing around and having some success with gitosis i switched to gitolite and haven t looked back

delete parent will delete all children

4768515
retaincount	dealloc
why does the second log nslog after image dealloc i self retaincount

4768548
public	protected
that aside what private and protected inheritance do is the same as public inheritance except that all the member variables are functions are inherited with at least private or protected accessibility

4768554
public	protected
private inheritance means that all public and protected members of state would be inherited by world and would become private

4768563
public	protected
the public protected private keyword before the name of the ancestor class indicates the desired visibility of members from the ancestor

4768565
dictionary	map
a dictionary allows us to map one type a key to another in this case a delegate

4768565

that way you can have standard build scripts ant etc. that can operate in the same way if you re using maven then there s a standard place per-project - src main resources

4768865
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
see the documentation for the uinavigationitem and for the uinavigationbar specially adding content to a navigation bar

4768869
xslt	xquery
in its absence an xslt or xquery solution using recursion is likely to perform better when the number of nodes to be selected is small compared with the number of following siblings

4768876
stdout	fflush
it might be too late then to print error anyway the stdout might have been abrupted too early and the file will never be fflush closed

4769102
min	max
i know select max amount from salary but i need without max min or order by clause

4769162
getter	setter
beware also that you should not uses hashes for things that have fixed names properties you should define your own classes with its getter and setter

4769214
post	get
the name of the dropdownlist generated will be the following and if your controller action doesn t take a model having a property called post with a property called categoryid and this categoryid property is marked with required you will get the behavior you are describing

4769244
hash	salt
the hash is computed using the salt and the password

the code below works as intended in firefox opera safari google-chrome

4769432
mouse	keyboard
update 25 01 after a few days of working on my application i ve noticed i don t really use pywinauto that much right now i m only using it for finding window and then i directly use sendkeysctypes.sendkeys to simulate keyboard input and win32api functions to simulate mouse input

4769466
put	get
let me get this straight you want to remotely put an app on a large number of phones and have it install itself

4769482
antivirus	mcafee
it could be mcafee antivirus installed on my machine

4769496
pthreads	fork
note that while c++ does not specify _exit and c99 leaves it implementation-defined whether it flushes buffers pthreads requires that it not flush buffers since this would break the main usage of _exit _exit handling failure of execve after fork

4769506
luabind	luabridge
the thing which lua does best is the great interop with c c++ code using libraries like luabridge and luabind

4769509
accessor	properties
the issue sounds like the raisepropertychanged method isn t being raised by your mvvm light viewmodel - if you re binding get accessor of your isenabled properties on the viewmodel directly to a value in isolatedstorage then the viewmodel isn t going to know that that underlying value has necessarily changed

4769526
imagemagick	minimagick
it simply plugs into tools like imagemagick and minimagick

subtraction	addition
i already have addition and subtraction

4769663
subtract	add
those were easy - simple 32-bit add and subtract

4769663
multiplying	add
with multiplying and divide i can also add many trigonometric and exponential log functions

4769663
multiplying	division
and i think i can deal with just multiplying as my library has a reciprocal function and i can use that to implement division

4769693
multiplying	multiplication
the multiplication is easily done with 64-bit multiplying

4769720
put	get
if you multiply a.b c.d the value you get is a.b 65536 c.d 65536 so to put this back in the right representation you need to divide by 65536

4769720
put	get
when you divide a.b c.d the value you get is a.b 65536 c.d 65536 so to put this back in the right representation you need to multiply by 65536

edit thanks to all of you who pointed out that it is in fact the icollection interface not ilist which provides the count property and also that this is due to explicit implementation of the interface

4770040
postgresql	mysql
it should work with ms sql source data i ve only used it with mysql and postgresql source databases and is quite flexible in regards to mapping the source data to the drupal schema

4770061
libsvm	shogun
how about other ones such as libsvm shogun

4770086
gridview	datalist
1- bind a gridview or datalist from this xmlhttp request

i want to make a grid like background with animated tiles opacity to .8 and back to .25 on mouseover and mouseleave

4770145
grass	ogr
i want to automate the process i use now fairly time-consuming and would prefer to use python numpy scipy ogr grass instead of esri s stuff

4770151
width	height
use - nscell cellsizeforbounds to find the height of the cell for a specific width

4770151
width	height
for cellsizeforbounds you can pass a really tall rectangle that s the width of your column and it will return a smaller rectangle that is the right height for the text to fit in that width

4770163
jmonkeyengine	ardor3d
you could look at the easy-to-understand jmonkeyengine or ardor3d sources both of which support collada loading

so minimum 0 bunnies max 1000 bunnies bunnies are returned not added by users

4770240
unsigned	short
obviously making id an unsigned short fixed the problem

4770244
udp	rtp
2 i ve been having issues with free rtp libraries like jrtplib which probably is very good anyway it just dosn t want to work for me to make them work more than i could almost tolerate and am thinking of just writing my own interpretation ontop of udp

4770244
udp	rtp
does application-level protcols like rtp simply build their header directly inside the udp payload with the actual data afterwards

4770244
udp	rtp
3 rtp does not give any performance boost compared to udp since it adds more headers all it does is making sure packets arrive in a sort-of correct manner based on timestamps and sequence numbers right

4770244
voip	rtp
is it -really- that usefull to use an rtp implementation for your basic voip project needs instead of adding basic sequencing yourself

4770244
rtp	sip
7 is sip dependant on rtp

4770244
udp	rtp	voip	rtp
i may plan to add softphone functionality to my voip client in the future and want to make sure i have a good foundation rtp if i really must otherwise my own udp interpretation

4770263
jtextfield	jlabel
why not just call jtextfield textfield jbutton button jlabel label and jpanel panel

4770268
put	get
you can t get people to automatically have entries in their .hg hgrc when they clone -- doing so would make it possible for someone to put rm -rf in a commit hook and wouldn t that be a bummer for the erstwhile cloners

4770327
disk	ram
perhaps with temp and logs on some form of ram disk since you ve got no need of recovery

4770408
jquery	simplemodal
and a jquery plugin called simplemodal

4770417
configure	libtool
when configure complains about a missing tool go back to cygwin setup and install the corresponding package flex libtool ncurses-devel you ll need at least the following

yacc	bison
i am using this windows version of flex lex and bison yacc to port my query compiler from linux to windows

4770459
profiling	debugging
visual studio 2010 premium and enterprise editions have a profiling built in -- i believe the feature is called performance explorer. if that s not available just do a debugging build and do some manual profiling by stopping the code periodically to see which code is executed most frequently edit as mentioned by doc brown

4770476
button	checkbox
if i have a group of checkbox button what is the correct way to determine the button state

4770476
button	checkbox
but sometimes no checkbox button are checked and some still have

i think it is better to use strdup or strcpy to copy strings

4770555
debian	linux
i m running debian linux

4770570
postgresql	mysql
i m not sure if this is how other dbms oracle db2 postgresql deal with bool+null but this answer is based on the access determination mysql and sqlite agree

4770597
post	put
i ve already put a lot of effort into the python app and i was hoping someone could tell me one of three things if not i have to switch to java which according to an earlier post apparently has a library for handling mp4 files id3 tags

4770613
onfocus	onblur
just erase the value onfocus and then if the value is still empty refill it onblur

4770630

range	max
if your original time value range from 0 to some number max you can do the scaling like this

4770890
cos	sin
the cos and sin values represent the x and y components of the vector between the sun and the origin so you should multiply by the distance of the sun from the centre of your scene which is usually constant

4770928
webclient	webrequest
however it s worth bearing in mind that webclient does rather a lot of work on the ui thread despite the async part - if this is for a production app you probably want to use webrequest directly

4770931
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql tend to be popular choices for independent and small development shops

4770963
database-normalization	denormalization
what you are talking about is called database-normalization or in your case denormalization

4771041
multiplying	add
it appears to add multiplying subtrct except it will not divide 2 qbjects

4771058
hide	show
although it s worth noting that running the toggle method only when it s checked assuming that it starts off un-checked involves the user clicking the input once to show it and then again to remove the check and again to re-check it so that it hide as a result of the toggle

4771205
cpu	processors
the reason i m asking is i remember reading somewhere that if you have as many tasks as the number of virtual processors tasks on the same physical core can sometimes starve some cpu resources and prevent each other from getting as many resources as needed possibly decreasing performance

hide	show
also .delegate accepts only one function so for the hover event you need to test the event.type to determine show docs or hide docs

4772298
hide	show
for show hide a shorter way to write this is to use toggle docs which can accept a switch argument where true means show and false means hide

rspec	capybara
at the bottom of this page in the webrat and capybara section it looks like capybara is unsupported for rspec view specs

4773096
rspec	capybara
i seems from the examples that you still do the heavy lifting with capybara and rspec matchers

this ball class extends view class and implements ontouchlistener

4773278
oncreate	ondestroy
if you start an async task in an activity that dies i have no idea what it meas for the task basically to avoid it you either need a thread that starts in the application oncreate and dies in it s ondestroy that does those things for you so it s activity independent or you need to use a service with sticky broadcasts so even if your activity is not listening for the broadcast because of orientation change it will get that broadcast once it s back on and listening

4773622
rspec	capybara
i don t think steak adds any complication for anyone familiar with rspec but if you think so and you don t really care about all previous things then you don t need to use rspec at all you will probably be happier using just test unit + capybara

postgresql	mysql
if you don t want to pay the huge premium for oracle your choice is between mysql and postgresql sqlite is mostly meant for development not production

4774760
postgresql	mysql
postgresql seems to be the choice of most django core devs andrew godwin went as far as putting friends don t let friends use mysql into a djangocon talk

4774760
postgresql	mysql
imho postgresql has two clear advantages over mysql

4774763
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is arguably technically a better database then mysql so if you ve never used it before it might be worth investing some time to lean it

in firefox v3.6 os x loading the page after launching the browser shows that the height width is not correct immediately after setting drawimage fails

4776670
width	height
the onload handler does fire however. loading the page again however shows the width height being correct immediately after setting and drawimage working

4776670

in google-chrome v8 os x i see the same results as in firefox the image is not available immediately but takes some time to asynchronously load from the data url

4776680

4777023
post	get
i m not aware of any way to open a new browser window with a post request with get being the default http method used to open pages which makes sense really

4777023
post	get
an alternative however would be to post the data using a simple http request in air and once you get a response to the post request in air you can open a new browser window using a get request

4777024
int	chars
dec2bin converts a number to a string representation so x 1 obtains a chars not an int

or alternatively is there any other way to record sound in android to a wav file or alternatively mp3

4777181
mp3	wav
oh and i know that mediarecorder can y be used because it doesn t support either wav or mp3 formats

4777206
children	parent
is it possible to keep the position of children relative to their jquery resizable parent

other options would be using an http debugging proxy like charles or fiddler as ericlaw suggests

4777309
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
you could also use a tool like firebug firefox web inspector safari google-chrome and other webkit-based browsers or opera dragonfly all of which provide some ability to view the request and response headers and bodies though most of them don t allow you to see the exact byte stream but instead how the browsers parsed the requests

4777351
gif	png
the problem with your code might be that the nsdata doesn t contain valid png data but only raw image data gif data jpeg data or another kind of non-png data

4777421
post	get
that should be post change instead of get change

4777450

4777692
codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana	cakephp	kohana
once you understand and can code this then learn a framework such as codeigniter cakephp kohana

i know this works with the firefox and google-chrome extensions but i have never tested it with an ie extension

4777718

google-chrome	firefox
it worked flawlessly in all other browsers i tested with firefox google-chrome ie 6 7 8

4778004
mp3	wav
the big downside of this is of course that a huuge wav file has to be created and woe be unto thee if the mp3 happens to be 15 minutes or so.

4778024
google-chrome	firefox
the advantage that you have is that unlike upgrading an operating system upgrading from ie7 to google-chrome 8 or firefox 3.6 is a more reachable goal for the average user of your app especially if you provide a link and upgrade instructions

4778045
opera	firefox
opera webkit and firefox in their

4778082
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox and safari google-chrome but not opera or ie. other than this there is no way to do this

4778109
google-chrome	firefox
i am working on a site when i look at it with firebug in firefox various elements seem to have heights like 133.8 pixels whereas firebug lite in google-chrome reports the height as 133px for the same method

4778127
hide	show
if you use hide you will need to call show before slidedown

4778145
hide	show
i m also up for suggestions maybe there is a better way to do this i thought creating hidden div tags for each item and then running javascript for when the image is clicked and showing it that way however that seems stupid in my opinion it seems to make more sense to make my div control once and then update the labels inside it on each image click and then show or hide it

4778204
post	get
you have the basic get and post requests and that s pretty much it

4778262
post	put
you can try multipart post or else you could try put http methods to transfer the file as binary

4778273
rss	feed
i am working on a schedule system that collects information from a rss feed

4778300
rank	max
if you want to show ties at the max value change row_number to rank

4778328
width	height
the problem is that if i use just a with a background image i cannot set the height and width

4778335
hide	show
this would have the div either show or hide before the page is ready

4778359
inherited	properties
then i have a couple classes that inherited from this class powersupplyvoltage and powersupplycurrent that each define read write methods and properties for holding the last read written values

4778370
width	height
generally if you want to set the width height as you expected you ll need to set the display to block

4778408
implements	extends
in a language implements classical inheritance like java c# or c++ you start by creating a class--a blueprint for your objects--and then you can create new objects from that class or you can extends the class defining a new class that augments the original class

4778421
post	get
if i have thousands of post and the content for each of those post is huge then it would be immensely wasteful for me to store all of that content in a php variable just to get the titles and permalinks to those post

4778430
redmine	trac
i used trac at my old job but i find that redmine has everything that trac has except it come s out-of-the-box with everything you need and it s easier to use

4778449
boost	stl
as for not reinventing the wheel like many have said already make sure to first explore the possibilities in the standard template library stl which is much richer than you might think and then look at boost www.boost.org which has libraries for a lot of diverse purposes and they are extremely high quality and some are just works of art like spirit proto lambda and mpl

4778457
rss	feed
i m trying to build a function that retrieves schedule information based on what day it is the rss feed has the next 10 days in advanced

4778457
rss	feed
the problem is sifting through the rss feed to remove the data i don t want - for example 24th jan 2011 day 7 needs to be 7

4778474
put	get
if you put this url in your browser you will get a json result

4778481
rss	feed
the delimiters around the pattern don t appear in your rss feed as literal characters so strpos is never going to find them

4778485
awt	swing
i suggest if possible that you not code in awt but rather code with swing which is much more robust and flexible

4778518
fadein	fadeout

4778637
g++	gcc
i recall seeing a gcc or g++ warning message from ffmpeg or x264 along the lines of

4778654
put	get
it all looks fine but i tried to get the value of the first-child and it wouldn t work unless i put the entries directly into the html as in the source file -- but i can t do that because the entries need to load dynamically via js

4778750
direct3d	gdi
if i use direct3d s drawtext which behaves like the gdi counterpart and i enable the dt_wordbreak formatting flag it ll cut the text on apostrophes whenever the situation arises which leaves many titles and text displays looking like a mess

4778772
folder	directory
you can t have a folder and a file with the same name any more than you can have two files with the same name well in different directory you can obviously but that doesn t appear to be the case here

4778782
multiplying	multiplication
in reality multiplication cannot be done in constant time so you ll need to multiplying by the speed of whatever multiplication algorithm you re using

for winforms i would suggest learning about the mvp model view presenter and the mvc pattern

4784181
ubuntu	linux
as long as i can visualize my own progress is fine.does anyone know of such an application for linux ubuntu

4784185
aggregate-functions	sum
for instance if you are using group by in a view for it to be indexable it should contain a count_big and all aggregate-functions in it should distribute over union all only sum and count_big actually are

4784201
width	height
pay attention that the result is expressed in radiant.if it is a circle and you have x y relative to the circle you can pass radius-y radius-x if it is an ellipse you can pass height 2-y width 2-x

4784209
width	height
if you run it in kaxaml or in a wpf window page your button will now keep on getting bigger and bigger both width and height

4784221
vb.net	vb6
now i want to write a little tool vb6 vb.net c# ... that uses a word 2007 com object to automatically add thumbnails

4784255
google-chrome	firefox
works fine on firefox and ie but in google-chrome the inner cells are not centered like the code seems to do

4784255
google-chrome	firefox
the firts image shows how google-chrome renders it and the second how firefox do it

4784310
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
that will give you the basic code to start with and vba will probably be easy for you as you already know vb6 and vb.net

4784310
vsto	add-in
vsto i don t know in what version the preview option was introduced but as far as i know the development of the com interface is somewhat behind of the .net add-in interface

4784310
vsto	add-in
so if you can t find the option at all in the interface you d probably need vsto visual studion tools for office to develop an add-in that can control word from the inside using the .net interface that word provides

4784373
vim	kate
i just started using the kate editor was using vim for c dev

4784462
width	height
compare the width docs and height docs of the container to the position docs properties of the element taking into consideration the scrolltop docs and scrollleft docs

4784502
width	height
by will now overflow the height keep getting bigger i assume that you mean the width as well as the height of your button

4784502
width	height
well that is because you have the width bound directly to the height

4784577
kde	gnome
this is why for example gnome and kde can get along on the same display and why really old x-windows programs that know nothing about panels or desktops still work just fine on modern systems

4784578
pdfsharp	itext
so you can use either itext or pdfsharp to read the pdf files but its the getting meaningful data out that s going to be the challenge

4784637
ant	pom.xml
as i don t have a cs-major in the background mathematics engineering instead i have had the pleasure of battling through and learning concepts such as project management pom.xml version control svn and build scripts ant

4784641
rss	feed
you are asking nokogiri to parse the xml rss feed as html

4784688
daemons	systemd
sbin â systemd binaries or server binaries daemons might need to be superuser to run

4784700
mouseover	mouseout
you may end up having to instantiate the mouseover and mouseout manually

4784750
profiling	debugging
i have a project with a parent pom.xml which define profiling and a debugging profiling

4784750
profiling	debugging
i want that one of my sub-modules adds the dependency jboss-seam-debug when the profiling debugging is activated

4784750
profiling	debugging
it s like the children pom.xml re-defines my debugging profiling .

4784750
maven	pom.xml	children	parent
which didn t work only by passing because i don t pass the system property it s the maven property which is activated by my parent pom.xml and that my children doesn t see .

4784778
google-chrome	firefox
42now.com uses favicon.ico in google-chrome and firefox

4784785
hash	salt
salt sha1 hash just won t cut it in a world where renting a few aws instances to compute fast rainbow tables.

4784793
min	max
i understand that there are limited min max etc. args to use but we want to make a generic statement and add some text

4784847
for-loop	loops
instead use a while read loops or a for-loop with globbing

4784866
equals	gethashcode
i know that the intersect extension uses the gethashcode instead of the equals to compare items which is why i really don t care what s in my equals as this class will never be called but for the intersect extension on entitycollections

4784873
udp	tcp
can one use sockets which as i understand it or network-layer constructs to send byte-wise messages compliant with higher protocols such as tcp or udp http ftp etc

4784892
width	height
the problem is that when i layout a view in the ui builder it s the correct width and height but when i actually load it in it fills the entire screen

4784902
equals	gethashcode
i know that the intersect extension uses the gethashcode instead of the equals to compare items which is why i really don t care what s in my equals as this class will never be called but for the intersect extension on entitycollections

4784902
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode is used as a first quick way of bucketing values but equals will still be called for any items with the same hash otherwise you can t know they re equals

4785011
setinterval	settimeout
an alternative if you only have 4 images would be to create a single huge image with all four in a texture atlas and then use settimeout or setinterval to call drawimage with different parameters to draw different subsets of the image to the canvas

4785018
autoresize	scrollbar
edit to clarify i want to autoresize the textarea when typing so there s never a scrollbar

4785045
bazaar	git
i personally happen to like git and github but others like mercurial and bazaar

4785054
listener	eventhandler
i ended up having to use an eventhandler and attaching an event listener to the linechart itself

4785093
width	height
the complete width and height are always used

4785148
width	margin
set the width of the ul element to something that would fit all li elements if each of the li element is 20px wide and there are 5 elements the ul element should be at least 100px. you should also consider the padding and margin of each of the ul element and add that to the total width of the ul element

4785153
memcached	apc
let s assume i have these variables saved in apc memcached and eaccelerator

4785233
filtering	grouping
you want to filtering on the two date values using a between grouping on user_id and then use having to filtering the grouping results

4785272
addclass	removeclass
simply wraps the native dom this element as a jquery object again so we can access the jquery functions like addclass and removeclass

4785275
hash	md5
i am trying to create a single md5 hash of multiple strings in java

4785280
width	height
you could also write some jquery to grab the window viewport height width like and size your entire page s container div accordingly

4785291
hash	salt
i don t have time to go through the whole blocks of code but basic salt hash validation is as follows

4785301
hash	salt
if you want to validate the entered password you would do the same as with the original password prepend the salt and hash that value

4785301
hash	salt
so lookup the salt that was used when hashing the original password and use it when hashing the entered password and then compare the stored hash with the new calculated hash

4785320
hash	salt
hash the password they entered when logging in with the salt from the database

4785360
google-chrome	firefox
i test it on google-chrome 8.0.552 and also it acts same on firefox 3.6.13 but 4 pixel less is fine

4785410
openssl	m2crypto
i am trying to build m2crypto 0.21.1 with openssl 1.0.0c or 0.9.7m for python 2.5.4 on windows but swig is conspiring against me

4785420
hash	salt
you would first need to grab the salt key from the database by searching on the entered username and then you would hash the entered password with the salt you grabbed from the database and check that it matches the password for the username in the database

4785438
width	height
i just set the width height to be a percentage of the container

4785451
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested in ie firefox and google-chrome and the page speed is the same

4785451
yslow	pagespeed
i have the yslow and pagespeed extensions installed in firebug

4785453
google-chrome	firefox
however i did some research and found that the following works in firefox ie google-chrome

4785506
openssl	m2crypto
the problem is that the m2crypto setup.py by default points to but if that openssl directory is the source tree include isn t the right place to look on windows at least - you need to be looking in inc32 otherwise opensslv.h is just a line pointing to a different file which is why swig bombs out on line 1

4785526
portrait	landscape
the image and the thumbnails should always displayed in portrait and not in landscape mode

4785557
hash	salt
i think you are storing the hash salt only basically enabling a login with any empty password

4785606
superclass	subclassing
now let s override it in a subclassing to double the superclass s answer

4785606
superclass	subclassing
that s because when the superclass s method makes a recursive call the recursive call goes through the subclassing

4785653
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i ve tried moving the code from viewdidload to viewdidappear animated and it still behaves this way

4785684
post	get
i ve got a simple form sitting in a master page for some reason i cannot get the submit button to post back it doesn t do anything at all

4785756
width	height
i managed to center the div but now .nivo-controlnav a loses its width and height because is not floating left

4785759
superclass	subclassing
recursive calls might be to a subclassing instead of to a superclass

4785781
margin	text-align
first off what s making this complicated is the text-align center and margin auto property in your body selector

4785781
margin	text-align
2 remove text-align center and margin auto from the body and set these only where you need them

4785808
union	distinct
by default union only grabs distinct values therefore your exact result

4785856
hide	show
be able to show hide a scrollbar in the text widget when the amount of text grows larger than the widget size

4785856
width	height
this seems to require a pack layout because the text widget can only be given a width and height in characters not pixels .

4785880
post	put
what you need to do is to put some checks to differentiate between an initial page load and a post back

4785893
width	height
or since you know the height and width of the img

4785976
google-chrome	safari
recently google-chrome and safari s inspection tools allowed users to edit full chunks structural code in a very buggy manner but you still can t edit full stylesheets

4785976
google-chrome	safari
usually when someone brings this up google-chrome and safari developers say but you can edit css and that s true to an extent

4785976
google-chrome	safari
has there been any momentum in either of the google-chrome or safari camps to build a plugin to match this unparalleled function

4785976
google-chrome	safari
otherwise maybe someone will step up to the plate and develop it for either google-chrome or safari

4786002
versioning	upgrade
i ve never had need of anything beyond the 1.x versioning so i never bothered to upgrade any hosting code

4786019
subscript	superscript
this allows you to specify text as superscript or subscript for example

4786107
lwjgl	jogl
i am currently developing an applet for some opengl es stuff but i am absolutely unsure how i can handle the natives that comes with jogl and or lwjgl

4786107
lwjgl	jogl
so i plan to use the applet loader from lwjgl but implementing the opengl es with jogl

4786114
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome do

4786149
hash	md5
md5 string calculates the md5 hash of string returning the result in hexadecimal

4786177
width	margin
i want the width of .nivo-controlnav to automatically fit the width + margin of .nivo-controlnav a

4786192
google-chrome	firefox
i have been a long time firefox user and have recently been experimenting with using google-chrome as my primary browser

4786192
google-chrome	firefox
there seems to be a way to configure google-chrome to use fiddler but it is not nearly as seamless as firefox in terms of enabling disabling

4786229
sudo	passwd
sudo normally has some kind of time-out value so that if you issue a second sudo command within the time-out period you will not be asked for your passwd again

4786250
folder	directory
you can put miscellaneous support files and libraries in the lib folder in the root directory and they will be available for use in your application the files in the app folder

4786270
serializable	deserialization
but i think a work-around for your specific case would be to specify type as java.lang.object since this should work ok for serializable string will be output as is and for deserialization it will be deserialized as a map

4786270
getter	setter
actually you might want to have separate getter setter if so

4786277
udp	tcp
they only allow you to do basic operations opening a connection tcp or udp writing or reading bytes and closing the connection

4786278
google-chrome	firefox
if you have already explored firefox a good deal then why not use firefox and google-chrome in parallel

4786278
google-chrome	firefox
use google-chrome as much as possible and explore the same way you explored firefox

4786297
keyup	mouseup
is done using the keyup and mouseup

4786299
ddms	adb
window - preferences - android - ddms - adb connection timeout ms

4786337
serializable	deserialization
if i serializable about 11k of these in an array as an array deserialization takes about 1.3gb of max vm size to read about 170mb of disk image into a 250mb of final vm size

4786337
serializable	deserialization
if i serializable each of the above 11k objects individually to the same file along with a count indicator deserialization takes about 250mb of max vm size to read a slightly smaller 160mb of disk image into a 250mb of final vm size

4786340
google-chrome	firefox
if so then do what cam says and analyzer the headers you can do it in firefox via an extension or you can do it in google-chrome natively

4786347
hide	show
having said all that if you are using dynamic controls just to show and hide different views of the same screen then i suggest you donâ t use them

4786360
versioning	upgrade
i just ran into a tricky issue where an upgrade to versioning 5.5.8 of mysql resulted in a syntax change that broke an existing script due to the use of type where engine is now required in a create_table command

4786374
put	get
you get to put a shiny 2.0 label on your resume site

4786390
hide	show
i am toggling show hide using jquery on a div block via

4786390
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
safari firefox opera all work fine so i m thinking this is a google-chrome bug

4786391
implements	extends
i have implements a tab bar screen and all my screen classes extends it

4786393
x86	64bit
this might be overkill for your application but for me changing the platform target to x86 prevents 64bit ie from being used either in the controls or in popups

4786421
google-chrome	firefox
i ve switched from firefox to google-chrome around 6 months ago but i don t really use it very much for development purposes

4786423
nsurl	nsdata
you can get the objectid transform it to nsurl using the urirepresentation and then archive it in a nsdata using the nskeyedarchiver

4786457
put	get
to put it more succinctly if in your example ragstatuscid is an integer and you attempted to call string dr ragstatuscid you would get an exception because the type is not a string it s an int

4786471
min	max
then you could use the min x max x and the min y max y to draw your rectangles

4786480
width	height
groupbox text id x y width height style extended-style

4786518
post	get
the access token should be passed using the get method not post

4786539
udp	tcp
can one use sockets which as i understand it or network-layer constructs to send byte-wise messages compliant with higher protocols such as tcp or udp

4786539
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
sockets gives you access to transport protocols such as tcp or udp actually with java it s only tcp and udp in the future probably sctp as well

4786539
udp	tcp
you can build stuff that works on top of tcp udp not implement tcp udp yourself unless you want to implement an ip stack on top of tcp or udp - which is what several vpn or tunelling protocols does

4786539
udp	tcp
yes these commonly work on top of tcp you can implement http ftp and other protocols that that runs above tcp udp by using sockets in java - that s what sockets are for

4786540
awt	swing
i assume the other program is not a swing app in which case only awt robot works and by sending native windows messages you can reliable find the other programs textbox even if it doesn t has the focus or is hidden in the background

4786583
post	put
i would put names into a post array

4786589
centos	linux
i want to develop php application on linux centos 5.0

4786593
children	parent
this way the parent will still fit where you want it but the children will just float as they should with the space they need

4786605
post	get
in the original version i get the output that can be seen in the bottom of this post this is only one line which is the database

4786618
g++	gcc
it works fine for code that s generated by gcc g++ but if you depart much from what it can does produce you can run into all sorts of problems

4786621
csv	tsv
on the other hand filemaker can import other formats csv tsv excel and has its own xml format so you can use these formats

4786632
clang	llvm
for compiler tools there is llvm clang which are open-source under bsd license

4786650
firefox	safari
my js script navigation bar fails to render on an aspx custom navbar in safari but it works fine in ie and firefox

4786650
opera	safari
the bar won t expand upon bar clicking in safari opera

4786650
opera	safari
the html that is generated from the aspx page will operate fine in all browsers yet i lose my webresources pictures in safari opera

4786697
min	max
for min max for float and double here is what you want

4786703
tabcontrol	tabitem
within my tabcontrolviewmodel my view is basically a tabcontrol with 3 tabitem welcome tabitem1 tabitem2

4786745
int	double	jtextfield	jlabel
this would lead me to the analogy that jlabel and jtextfield are like the int and double primitives in java

4786757
min	max
then if you consider this type to be signed min and max values are -2 number_of_bits - 1 and 2 number_of_bits - 1 - 1 or if they re unsigned min will be 0 and max 2 number_of_bits - 1

4786757
int	double
this applies only to int types so not for floats and double and then only for two s complement int representations

4786775
children	parent
if a has nothing else but other children the parent s height will always be 0

4786802
spaces	delimiter
i wrote this function but i don t think it s effective enough i used the explode function with spaces as a delimiter but what if the user puts two spaces instead of one

4786846
superclass	subclassing
the variable is clearly declared in the superclass yet the subclassing can not see it

4786895
submit	submission
also how to submit the form such that the list of objects gets re-created on submission

4786899
uielement	adorner
i would like to be able to somehow outline or highlight any particular uielement or perhaps even visual in an adorner layer

4786943
versioning	upgrade
makes it much easier to upgrade cocos versioning mid-game development

4786967
getter	setter
i have a getter and a setter for the map encapsulated in a custom type which can be used simultaneously by both threads is a concurrenthashmap still a good solution

4786967
getter	setter
or maybe i should synchronize the getter setter or perhaps declare the instance variable to be volatile

4786985
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works in every other browser i tested firefox opera google-chrome safari etc so i am a little frustrated

4787009
put	get
that is sufficient as the purpose of concurrenthashmap is to allow lockless get put operations but make sure you are using it with the correct concurrency level

4787009
getter	setter
the wrappered getter setter make no difference so long as it is still being read written to by multiple threads

4787016
put	get
retrieval operations including get generally do not block so may overlap with update operations including put and remove

4787031
put	get
therefore every time i get somethign that looks promising i have to put it onto my actual phone and try it out - time-consuming and a hassle

4787043
ienumerable	iqueryable
difference iqueryable and ienumerable

4787043
ienumerable	iqueryable
linq to sql works on iqueryable and linq to object work on ienumerable

4787081
gif	png
what you need to do is have all the images point to a pixel gif or png

4787134
peer	p2p
the flash player has p2p apis that allow direct connection with other peer typically other browsers over udp

4787136
min	max
consider if you have a min x max y in the select clause which row should other columns not grouped come from

4787150
mouse	keyboard
and by responsiveness here i mean the general feel of how the application responds to mouse clicks and keyboard events the little lags between the user clicking somewhere and the program actually redrawing all the needed things to represent the response to that click

4787190
put	get
for example get the max ids from transaction and put this in a table variable

4787260
button	checkbox
to modify the size looks of a view like a checkbox radio button use the background and button properties to specify your own drawables

4787275
qpushbutton	qvboxlayout
â qvboxlayout addwidget qpushbutton â

4787282
domxpath	domdocument
now in domdocument you could do this by using domxpath

4787296
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
2 - using ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse objects

4787350
int	chars
to concatenate a long int to a chars you need to use itoa which will take the int and return a chars later you just need to do some string process to concatenate them

4787369
rss	feed
instead of sending emails when an item is in a workflow state why don t you try using the rss feed that sitecore generates for each state

4787369
rss	feed
the majority of email clients have built in rss readers which typically will show the feed as a separate inbox

4787371
accessor	properties
also things like retain copy properties won t work if you don t go through the accessor

4787384
pop-up	dialog
if you want to disable your app while logging out you can pop-up a non-cancellable dialog

4787413
folder	directory
i would like to add prefix on all folder and directory

4787414
post	get
well _post is used exactly like _get just need to change the input form to use post rather than get

4787457
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox 3.9 ie9 beta google-chrome latest and opera 11 both alerts execute

4787515
width	height
btw since the height are all the same it might be easier to just put these in a container div to control the width and use float left

4787517
config	ini
maybe you need to improve your config parsing or declaration process so that you always have to declare some kind of associative array in an ini file

4787597
oncreate	setcontentview
one call to oncreate one call to setcontentview is all you should have

4787626

4787797
rss	feed
gmail offer an rss feed which could make this possible

4787843
gridview	detailsview
the buttonfield class is used by data-bound controls such as gridview and detailsview to display a button for each record that is displayed. but i don t see any datasource in your code

4787860
google-chrome	firefox
if you are thinking about the way google-chrome or firefox works where the download goes into a download manager and the user stays on the page theres no more interaction with the server on the old page

4787867
pop-up	dialog
i have a form that has a button when clicked it pop-up a dialog form

4787879

i found out if i put text here in the code i d get these results

4787935
children	parent
this uses the technique of putting most widgets as children of the parent then using the in_ parameter to put them in a container

4787955
singleton	facade
easy examples might include a singleton how to guarantee the existence of a single instance of a code or a facade how to provide a simple external view to a more complex system

4787969
hide	show
if you wanted to show hide the form field based on the value of countrylist you could use toggle

4788001
restrict	shared
you could restrict by ip address but its possible for a number of people to shared 1 ip address such as a small school or business

google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome looks similar to firefox

4788054
google-chrome	firefox
i can see by the content size displayed in fiddler that the body is in fact gzipped for google-chrome and firefox but not ie

4788118
width	height
i get the url back from provider and i do window.open .... and open it as a new window with a predefined height and width

4788135

update i realized the glviewport inside of the setframebuffer call was setting my width and height backwards

4788156
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
this wont work in ie but works in firefox opera google-chrome etc.

4788166
folder	directory
i ve also organized each script s files into separate folder and directory but that hasn t helped either

4788200

4788269
portrait	landscape
also i would rotate the device between portrait to landscape modes to check the the specific orientation-mode css codes which gave strange results

i m using a microcontroller with a software ieee754 32-bit fpu which has sin and cos functions

4788332

while safari doesn t have google-chrome s specific tab-related api it does have a perfect solution to this problem

4788694
free	realloc
additionally from a philosophical point of view you are trying to do too much in the function compare your function to realloc -- which may free memory or do nothing or allocate more memory and change the value of a pointer depending on the arguments passed in

post	get
i need to get the information of all the videos available on a page so far i havent found a way to get these results on a html page no flash other than tricking the search page into returning the whole list back using 3 underscores as the search keywords the problem is that the search is doing a post to a page which i assume is then redirecting to the final page and it gives you something like this the problem there is that this url is only alive for 5 or 10 minutes so i cannot use this url everytime i need to run the stand alone file the search is in a form with a post to which i imagine takes all the data from that form there is some other hidden fields and then redirects to that results page is there a way i can do the post with all the data and then get the page that is being redirected

4788861

when the project grows it has come to a point where inheritance doesn t make any sense anymore because i have situations where 80 of the children daos need that api but 20 don t yet they still inherit from the same parent dao because they share other similar apis

4789074
uefi	acpi
for extra complexity it s possible to include a lot more in this predefined state address of acpi tables description of preconfigured video mode etc so that it s possible to write boot loaders for other types of systems and the kernel won t need to care if it booted from pc bios or uefi or openfirmware or whatever else

4789090

any children tables which need to point to a parent point to this pseudo index table

4796949

the way this works is...first you calculate the document width and height then you calculate the div width and height and then you subtract the div width from the document width and the div height from the document height and consider that the pixel range you re willing to put the div in so it doesn t overflow out of the document

quicksand	galleriffic
however it seems as though quicksand screws up the data array which causes galleriffic to not see any elements aka the images on the second call

4797936
quicksand	galleriffic
now i looked into the code for removeimagebyindex and it seems that galleriffic keeps a cache of information about the images it uses which does not get updated when .remove gets called by quicksand

4797936
quicksand	galleriffic
quicksand removes the images incorrectly and galleriffic doesn t get updated to the changes

4797936
quicksand	galleriffic
well one option would be to try and rewrite the removal and addition parts of your quicksand script to be aware of galleriffic

would serializable deserialization work with a subclass of a ccnode and would it be any quicker than what i m doing

4799922
sorting	filtering
the app engine datastore doesn t do any sorting filtering joins or other meaningful operations in memory so query times are generally fairly constant

4799924

4800132
int	double
but the return type of such a function is assumed to be int not double which is why the program executes incorrectly

4800132
atoi	atof
tangentially never use atoi nor atof they hide input errors

4800132

rss	feed
i am developing a site that parses rss feed and displays them in a series of divs

4800432
rss	feed
this isn t working properly it sets the height of all the divs equal to the height of the tallest div before the rss feed loads most likely due to the fact that i need to use a live event handler

4800513

wordpress	joomla
i am looking at the usual list of candidates including drupal alfresco wordpress joomla and also more general frameworks like django

4800535
queue	fifo
the reason that when using fifo increasing the number of pages can increase the fault rate in some access patterns is because when you have more pages recently requested pages can remain at the bottom of the fifo queue longer

4800535
queue	fifo
belady s anomaly points out that it is possible to exploit the fact that larger cache sizes can cause items in the cache to be raised in the fifo queue later than smaller cache sizes in order to cause larger cache sizes to have a higher fault rate under a particular and possibly rare access pattern

4800560
post	get
this post suggests that you should be able to get the ie developer toolbar to show you the xpath for an element you click on if you turn on the select element by click option

4800930
put	get
to get better performance you could put your overlay in another window either by using windowmanager.addview or by using a poupwindow

4800971
getter	setter
you can t avoid some of the places where you might not want those heavy stuffs since every declaration creates getter and setter implicitly but application development in grails is very fast you will have a habit of using cool things as versioning in current data but if you have transactions then why do you need those i don t know if you don t want to get into the nuisance of scaffolding but still want to see it as a reference then you can have two copies one code generated from scaffolding and other without it so that you can develop your own version with carefully crafting the application with a reference to the scaffolded version

4800985
post	get
i ve been trying to get this working forever and have found every blog post and message i could but none cover this situation and the docs don t help at all

what could be causing the line 1 to throw a unicode error on the ubuntu server but not the centos server

4801171
width	height
it points to the same space that containera does in your design and takes up the entire container div s space because of width and height 100

4801181
width	height
an interesting design issue about these notifications is that they cannot have a specified width height is fixed - they should be able to handle in ascii drawing 1 and 1000 where 1000 is not a perfectly rounded circle but instead looks more like a capsule

4801195
int	double
the compiler looks at the types of the operands for a single operation and promotes both to the larger type if one is int and the other double it ll convert the int to double then do the operation

4801195
division	multiplication
this means the division would be done on integers giving an integer result and only after that integer result was obtained would that integer be converted to a float for multiplication by pi

4801195
int	double
converting to a combination of float and long will save about 14 bytes of data storage but then add around 14 bytes of extra instructions to handle all the conversions between int float and double at the right times so you ll end up with slower code that uses just as much memory anyway

here you output the int 0 followed by the chars newline to the standard output stream

4801320
std	ostream
next you see that the function returns a std ostream

4801320
std	ostream
std ostream is in fact typedef d as and therefore your function can only output telegram objects to streams that work on char types

4801320
std	ostream
the reason the function returns a std ostream is so that you can chain calls to the function

4801320
std	ostream
the first parameter a std ostream is taken by reference

post	get
i ve looked at a couple of blog post about this but can t seem to get it right

4805105
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
first the aggregate-functions such as min max avg count sum will all use a group by if there is another column involved such as your example.

4805135
folder	directory
if i would have like 1000 directory on my ftp root i mean jan2011-26 jan2011-25 jan2011-24 jan2011-23 jan2011-22 and so on... is would be bad to check every single folder i don t even want that

4805135
folder	directory
it s fine if the script only checks the last 5 directory so only jan2011-26 jan2011-25 jan2011-24 jan2011-23 jan2011-22 but it has to check if any new directory is created in these 5 folder

4805147
button	checkbox
encased in the alt tag of multiple checkbox and radio button is an id that corresponds to the ids of hidden containers and fields

4805147
button	checkbox
therefore the combination of button and checkbox that are checked determines what hidden areas are visible as seen here

4805154
decoder	encoder
it uses the service provider interface for supporting other formats for which you can provide a decoder encoder

4805155
button	checkbox
so if the user clicks on the choose file the normal response occurs but if the user clicks on a button that says choose from library they then get prompted with a facebox screen where they choose an item by means of radio or checkbox inputs when they are then done or submits from the facebox screen the first form gets updated with the data

4805169
pop-up	dialog
if you right-click on a maven project and select properties from the pop-up menu you enter the project preferences dialog which has a maven- lifecycle section allowing to customize which build phases should be bound to the build lifecycle whenever the project is refreshed or clean-built

4805169
put	get
however these customizations are coarse-grained and get lost upon project-configuration-update same if you put file org.maven.ide.eclipse.prefs where these settings are saved under version control .

4805184
width	height
after this set the height and width properties to 100

4805190

the project has a for-loop nested inside a while loops

4805258
for-loop	loops
i tried to put a boolean operator in the while loops that controls the for-loop but that doesn t control what goes on inside the for-loop until the for-loop gets to the end

4805280

listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
otherwise you can use a gridview repeater listview third party control etc for display with entity framework ado.net linq to sql etc for data access

4805296
for-loop	loops
i tried to put a boolean operator in the while loops that controls the for-loop but that doesn t control what goes on inside the for-loop until the for-loop gets to the end

4805298
width	margin
my first idea was to make a wrapper div for each section which handles the background and another content div inside of it with width 950px and margin 0 auto

4805325

search here for delphi profiler for some suggestions if you re using delphi xe you can use the included aqtime

4805454
children	parent
let say i have a predicate for sorting tree roots together and another predicate to sort children of a common parent together

4805454
children	parent
each node have a parent accessor and a children enumerator

4805461
getter	setter
aside from implementing a usertype you can enable property access in jpa 1.0 - by moving all annotations to properties in jpa 2.0 you can configure access type for individual property with access and implement conversion logic in getter and setter

4805526
dlsym	dlopen
we just used dlopen and dlsym along with a pair of extern c static functions that must be defined in the dll

4805576
stdout	stderr
my python code spawns the child process and it prints out messages both stdout and stderr

4805576
stdout	stderr
i need to print out the stderr and stdout as soon as the child process prints out something

4805578
maven	m2e
i use commandline shell rather than m2e for maven

4805584
int	double
personally i think it is unlikely that a switch from int to double precision floating point operations is likely to yield performance improvements

4805587
kerberos	ntlm
i can t use kerberos ntlm as the server isn t on a domain and ntlm is weak anyway

4805595
hide	show
in both methods i m able to hide them but if i tried to show them the scripts takes to long to load and stops

4805599
integer	unsigned
firebug detects array-like objects simply by looking if they have a length property whose its value is an unsigned 32-bit integer less than 2 32 - 1 and if they have a splice property that is a function for example the following object will be detected and printed as an array on the firebug s console

4805617
stdout	stderr
i mean lines printed as soon as the spawned process prints something to stdout or stderr then you can do something like

4805617
stdout	stderr
in this case two threads will print every time that a line is written either to stdout or stderr

4805617
stdout	stderr
the parameter type_pipe just makes the distinction when the lines are printed to know if they are coming from stderr or stdout

4805638
translation	localization
i recommend using the if statements as you suggest then tapping into the localization system by using to translation your strings in the template file adding the translation to the locale csv files if necessary

4805697
postgresql	mysql
i m mainly interested in postgresql and mysql but any other pointers would be appreciated as well

put	get
i ve managed to find tuts on how to get the picture if you provide the url but i want to get the addy from my dictionary to then be put into my uiimageview

4805730
int	double
you can then represent a date as an nsdate instance as a double or if you desperately need to save memory as an int like unix timestamp

4805782
hide	show
if you are using jquery ajax then you can use ajaxstart and ajaxstop functions to show and hide visual feedback ui

4805815
children	parent
you will have 1 parent the first query that produces then children the second query now there could be 2 10 20 etc

4805840

i can t get over what appears to be a simple css formatting problem in chrome i want to put a table towards the right and a label and some buttons toward the left inside the same paragraph

4805910

this works easy enough in other browsers firefox ie7 8 but in google-chrome the table stretches over the entire page under the label

4806018
jpql	hql

i would like to execute one time release prepare and then execute release perform for each environment to generate the corresponding package file

4807037
prepare	execute
how can i prevent cleaning up this metadata in order to execute release perform with different profiles without having to execute release prepare again

4807047
portrait	landscape
there is a hack that will accomplish this but i seriously advise against using it - your design should adapt to whether someone is in portrait or landscape mode

4807047
portrait	landscape
step 1 query the window.orientation property to see if you re in landscape or portrait mode

4807047
portrait	landscape
step 2 if you re in portrait mode use a -webkit-transform rotate -90 on a div that s wrapping your entire page to force it into a landscape layout

4807047
portrait	landscape
this won t work quite correctly - the browser ui will still be in portrait mode but presumably the user will figure out that they re supposed to rotate the phone back into landscape mode in order to view the content

4807070
mouse	keyboard
this has the side-effect that the selecteditem will always be displayed on the top even if it was selected by mouse keyboard etc

4807132
google-chrome	firefox
is there any way to force either firefox or google-chrome to interpret a loaded resource as a particular mime type

4807132
google-chrome	firefox
are there any extensions or hidden commands for firefox or google-chrome that provide view as mime type functionality

4807169
width	height
the other ads code is basically the same save with different width height and name

4807178
width	height
so first you add 100 width and height div to fill whole screen and all inside that div positioned in center and in center you add another diw wich will be lets say 900 width and here will be all the content

4807178
width	height
after that you add header wich is 100 width and 180 height all those divs position is absolute so you can type where each one goes

4807179
post	get
however i am working right now on adding presence in the chat sense so that your app can register to get a post when a client connects to or disconnects from a channel created with a given client id

4807193
stdout	stderr
if your python script doesn t feed the foo process fast enough then you could offload reading stdout stderr to threads

4807203
put	get
as an example lets say i m working with a product that requires i put s onto my page which then get embedded into my existing website

4807204
getter	setter
getter setter and other member functions ommited for brevity

4807204
getter	setter
if you have public getter and setter which are just boilerplate consider marking the corresponding data members as public instead

4807287
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari and ie8 on windows are having the same problem of not showing the number 7 in front of the element

4807303
post	put
a couple of years ago i looked into this and the state of things then was that there was a way to work online with equifax but rather than a regular web service you had to manually put together a post request to a page they hosted and could then read the relevant response

4807311
mouse	keyboard
if i use the actual keyboard autocomplete works but if i use the virtual keyboard by pressing with mouse autocomplete does not work

4807314
rss	feed
you can use the following site to retrieve an rss feed that you could probably disseminate for the data you want

post	get
i was looking around a found a mention of changing the post method of a form to a get method

4807399
post	get
i thought i would post it here and see if there is a way that i can get my comparison done via generics

4807409
post	get
i tried changing over from get to post and got the exact same

4807425
comparator	icomparer
you could accept an icomparer that will do the comparison for you and that comparator can define what it means for one string to be less than of greater than another

4807431
abstract-class	superclass
can an abstract-class extends a superclass in php

4807431
abstract-class	superclass
so the answer is yes an abstract-class can extends a superclass in php

4807445
post	put
should i put the url of the file in the post headers or the file itself

4807471
single-quotes	double-quotes
when you use echo there s a big difference between wrapping the guts in double-quotes and wrapping them in single-quotes

4807476
width	height
i assume you re putting a full width height div with a higher z-index than the original page

4807500
client-side	server-side
some third-party controls that support just-in-time loading supply both client-side and server-side logic while others try to solve the problem 100 client-side

4807505
ubuntu	debian
second part of the problem was that ubuntu probably debian as well has two apt packages for the above pgpool and pgpool2

4807511
width	margin
if you have a div or other tag that you want centered on the page you need to specify a width for it and then using the margin rule center it

4807528
folder	directory
you get that error message because you might be asking the webserver for the directory listing of www folder

4807528
apache	nginx
apache is also terrible at sending static files so i have my apache setup on port 8080 and nginx setup on port 80 which forwards to apache

4807529

crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
i am looking into building a login system and after reading the php manual when you pass a 2 digit salt to the crypt function it returns a hash string and the first 2 digits of the string are the salt that you used

4807677
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
so i do not understand why then would the crypt function return all hash prepended with the salt value used

4807707
springboard	backgrounding
resuming the app from the springboard works as expected the orientation is the same as when it was sent to the backgrounding

4807732
hide	show
this way users can hide show fonts as they see fit but also hide all fonts inappropriate for their region

4807734
hide	show
when the menu item is accessed it will call the querystatus method which you can then determine if you want to show hide menu items

4807744
cpu	processors
we had some projects building an x86 variant some building an x64 variant and the configuration manager had solution platforms for any cpu and mixed processors

4807767
post	get
according remus post i ve tried to use the event notification to get the exact moment when the queue stops

4807771
hash	salt
yes the salt is supposed to be kept secret but then so is the password hash

4807771
hash	salt
to check a password against the hash you have to combine the salt with the password and then check it against the hash

4807771
hash	salt
so any user or process with the right to see the password hash should also have the right to see the salt since the password hash by itself is not useful for checking passwords unless you re going to brute-force the salt

4807771
hash	salt
the purpose of the salt is so that if two different users have the same password they ll hash to different things

4807771
hash	salt
but knowledge of the salt by itself doesn t mean you can reverse the password hash

4807771
hash	salt
if you can find a way to keep the salt more secure than the hash value it certainly wouldn t be a bad thing but it s hard to see how this is feasible when any program which needs access to one needs access to both

4807783
hash	md5
for any modern password usage you d be better off with more modern hash such as sha1 sha256 md5

4807788
width	height
recently i needed to find width and height for setting default size of .dialog representing graph

4807792
getter	setter
i thought adding public getter and setter would enable me to unit test this properly and would be useful for my app

4807794
hash	salt
the salt is appended to the has so that you will know which salt to use when you get the password and want to see if it matches the hash

4807794
hash	salt
the idea here is to use a different salt for every password so that someone cannot precompute a hash table

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
built-in uiviewcontroller like uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontrollers explicitly pass down these calls to their children that s why it seems like a broadcast when they arrive but when you insert your own uinavigationcontroller subclass to the vc hierarchy you must yourself pass down these calls to any children uinavigationcontroller

i want to know how i can see exactly what the cron jobs are doing on each execution

4811744
postgresql	mysql
i know that solutions like mysql postgresql and ms sql server are relational database systems and nosql mongodb etc

4811753
put	get
but it s possible for instances to be created that don t get put into the dictionary which could lead to problems

4811754
getter	setter
note that you do not need those jsonproperty annotations since you have getter and setter which imply title as per bean naming convention

4811796
post	get	post	put	put	get
i would expect to be able to send a put or post with my topobject as i want it to be after the modifications and get a 200 ok back possibly with a link to get that information back

4811820
children	parent
there is no way in css to style an element based on what its children elements are or to change a parent s style from a child element s style declaration

4811863
children	parent
you have to inherit the parent pom in the sub-projects and specify the children in the parent as modules

4811899
maven	pom.xml
take a look at maven parent pom.xml vs modules pom.xml

4811925

4811953
queue	fifo
can one grab arbitrary elements in the queue or is it strictly fifo

4811986
.htaccess	httpd.conf
in general it is better to put everything in httpd.conf because all the rules are created at the start of apache instance and live in the memory not on the disk like .htaccess with filesystem access

4812024
google-chrome	firefox
but in google-chrome and firefox everything works for the most part but you may have to tweak the margins and size specifically for the select element

4812037
mouseout	mouseleave
instead of using the mouseout try using mouseleave for the tag

4812095
hudson	bamboo
automated builds are a must for any serious organization and you should pick an scm that can be access by your build systems hudson cruisecontrol bamboo etc.

4812100
inherited	properties
since uitableview inherited from uiscrollview would i have access to the delaycontenttouches properties of uiscrollview from my table view controller

4812111
rss	feed
there is a rss feed that can be limited to one of the shared folders but it kind of filters events to keep volumes low

4812145
versioning	upgrade
i also upgrade for 10 to the versioning that lets you search within directories and not just files

4812199
width	height
the problem i am having issues in attacking is how to resize the sidebar width when the nested nssplitview s height is altered

4812199
width	height
the way i have it setup now is to set the inner scrollview s delegate to be the windowcontroller that owns the main splitview then do a calculation on the height to alter the width of the info panel

4812296
width	height
now whenever your mysplitview resizes it will automatically update the height of the view to match the width

4812298
cublas	cufft
if you re trying to work with cublas or cufft you should use cucomplex

4812299
width	height
i have no control over the size of the images being uploaded i suppose i could restrict the width and height but that wouldn t be practical in this situation

4812299
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
now what i would like to do with the above code is to take out the width height and margin specifications so as to allow an image no matter how big or small to be exactly centred and without the use of javascript

4812300
bash	subshell
in bash the double parentheses set up an arithmetic context in which dollar signs are mostly optional by the way for a comparison also used in and arithmetic expansion and is used to distinguish the sequence from a set of single parentheses which creates a subshell

4812316
width	height
as for the size of the image element you can specify it s width and height so that whatever size the image the user will upload it will still be the same

4812317
ubuntu	debian
the default usr lib is the correct value for finding libjpeg.so.62 on debian ubuntu

4812500
serializable	deserialization
imo you should only consider rolling your own format and implementing the corresponding serializable deserialization code if you have a clear requirement to do so or if you have clear evidence that the existing alternatives won t work

4812502
google-chrome	firefox
quicktime with data url works with both firefox and google-chrome recent releases no betas you have to follow instructions from quicktime website initialize quicktime by calling qt_writeobject function i had to provide initial valid src pointing to beethoven s mp3 file just to keep it from complaining - maybe it s not necessary register listeners as detailed in the said reference and after getting callback qt_load call document.movie1.seturl mydataurl method

4812557
integer	fractions
specifying an integer value for the second parameter allows you to indicate the number of fractions digits the result should contain

4812564
put	get
i want to get up to 8 images and imagine there s a way to create an array and put it through a loop instead of making an individual instance for each image

4812587
serializable	deserialization
binaryformatter serializable just like marc gravell explained seems to indeed support version tolerant deserialization i also tested it to work with xmlserialization

4812636
matplotlib	scipy
i recommend learning python and the modules numpy scipy and matplotlib there s a ton there so beyond the basic tutorials just learn as you go

4812636
sdl	pyglet
there s also pygame which expands on sdl simple directmedia layer and pyglet which uses openal the opengl of audio

4812715
next	except
there is a grey background on the ul - if the width of the items exceeds 1024px the items should wrap to the next line - and they do but the grey background is not there except oddly enough in ie7 - very annoying issue

4812719
getter	setter
them really the next thing you need to remember is that value is both a getter and a setter

4812733
width	height
then i have mod_rewrite which reads the file from xyzdir into a php script which then translates the width and height and returns the image

4812736
getter	setter
while this does not necessarily do as good a job of describing private member variables getter vs setter and the like it may help with the concept to interface excapsulation and private vs public methods

4812752
firefox	safari
i have it positioned with the bottom and right at 0px but the image overlaps the scrollbars on firefox and safari anyway.

4812792
uilabel	nsstring
a uilabel s text property is an nsstring

4812797
manual	jmp
looking at the book 2a of the intel instruction set reference manual it can only be done using jmp ptr16 32 where the ptr16 32 is an immediate value or using jmp m16 32 where the m16 32 is a memory location containing the 48-bit jump address the 16 32

4812827
cos	sin
if you want it to move in an ellipse the easiest way that i know of would be to give the y values as a function of time with sin and the x values as a function of time with cos

4812827
cos	sin
then the y value would be radius in the y direction sin elapsedtime speed + y value of the center of your ellipse and the x value would be radius in the x direction cos elapsedtime speed + x value at the center of your ellipse

main new feature is calling parameterized methods instead of only calling javabean getter setter inside syntax

4812901
button	checkbox
so based upon the question type the application would dynamically generate the appropriate amount of radio button or checkbox for the users to select

if you want to define a in the parent and allow children to use it as appropriate then you can define it within a section

4813059
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in this case safari google-chrome andoid and ios would use the video tag while ie firefox and opera would use flash

4813059
opera	firefox
this would catch the case of firefox and opera users who did not have flash installed should not be an issue with my user base

4813108
post	put
as zac noted in the comments the simplest solution to the question you post is simply cat file.txt so i must assume there is something more interesting going on so i have put the two options that solve the question as asked as well

4813164
post	get
the reason why the post table doesn t have categories is because all that is done through the taxonomy system more info which takes a few minutes to get your head around

4813466
hindi	tamil
i am also providing my custom fonts for arabic hindi tamil and other languages in assets still nothing works

4813479
consistency	acid
both c s stand for consistency but the notion of consistency in cap means that all nodes see the same data at the same time and the notion of consistency in acid means that any transaction the database performs will take it from one consistent state to another

4813481
gif	png
it would also be extremely helpful if it is also be able to convert the file to a web-frendly graphics format like jpeg gif png etc

4813492
stdout	stderr
it would mean the stxp70.bat stared it with start command and you can t communicate with that because it s not inheriting your stdin stdout stderr pipes

4813546
terminate	timeout
as i understand it session_end has nothing to do with the current request because asp.net session is terminate by the timeout after the last request from the client has arrived

4813555
querypath	phpquery
basically querypath and phpquery this 2 tool can help you

4813556
min	max

setting vertical-align top in the styles of the first left div works in google-chrome and firefox didn t try ie or safari i assume safari works

width	height
the normal approach would be to resize so either height or width of the image is equal 60px and then crop a 60x60 from center like this

4813631
pop-up	dialog
the use case should be user clicks the image the dialog pop-up

4813760
inherited	properties
to learn in what type in an inherited hierarchy a properties was declared have a look at propertyinfo.declaringtype

4813767
getter	setter
if so an automatically implemented property will have the attribute on the getter and the setter

4813769
inherited	properties
if you want to findout whether or not a properties is inherited compare the propertyinfo.declaringtype to the type you are testing

4813782
google-chrome	firefox
by the way - all modern browsers except ie already offer built-in spellcheck support that is available inside the radeditor as well - you can try it by opening a radeditor page with firefox google-chrome etc

put	get
it is perfectly possible that between calls to the outer get and to the inner put some other thread calls the outer get too and gets the same inner map

4813850
getter	setter
you can try setter and getter method of the two different class to set and get the value

4813906

post	get
i need to post a variable and get result in codeigniter using ajax jquery

4813938
postgresql	mysql
note that mysql is not the only choice and there are plenty of others which might be better for new applications for example postgresql

4813940
cpu	processors
also - the processors in newer fancier ethernet cards offload a lot of work from the cpu so you shouldn t necessarily expect a cpu hit

4813951
postgresql	mysql
you should definitely go with mysql or postgresql

4813979
getter	setter
for this purpose make nsstring and nsinteger as a property then synthesize it for setter and getter

4814036
children	parent
referencing a collection of children from a parent object is something that should generally be avoided if possible

4814036
children	parent
it is usually possible to just do a lookup for the children based on the id of the parent

4814052
mouse	keyboard
click events whether initiated by the mouse or keyboard shortcuts are not raised for a button control that has its enabled property set to false . this is the closest you ll get to anything like flushing the buffers

4814053
margin	height
you could also query the height of the div and use jquery to set the body s top margin

4814325
portrait	landscape
use the layout-port directory for your portrait-only layouts for smaller screen sizes and then add your xlarge layouts to the layout-xlarge directory if you want to use the same layout file for portrait and landscape on xlarge or to layout-xlarge-land and layout-xlarge-port if you want different layout files depending on the orientation

for each of the resources you mention there s a way of saving this type for example for image files you could use nsdata to save the image data to disk and for text files you could use the method writetofile atomically encoding error

4814454
dictionary	map
use an associative array also called map or dictionary since different programming languages use different terms for the same data structure

if that s the case you would look in the _post variable to get the values you re sending to the server via the ajax object because you ve set post as the request method

when you are adding these two chars with each other they are first being promoted to int

4814756
int	chars
this is true on any platform where sizeof int sizeof chars

4814781
hash	md5
if you just want to determine quickly whether the files are the same or not you might consider using a hashing algorithm - md5 each file and compare the resulting hash

4814807
git-rebase	undo
but hgsvn has the drawback that it does no automatic git-rebase for stuff which gets back into svn so when you have had to merge in terms of a mercurial merge the svn history with your local history you can t export every local commit only the merge commit there is the way to export every commit even when there is a merge but the first local commit will undo the recent svn history and the merge commit will redo it which causes a defect svn history

4815049
getter	setter
when people get used to their ides they learn shorcuts they know where to look for some functions refactor generate getter setter implement override required methods.... so if you force them to use some other ide it will just make things harder for them and slower for the overall process

the app-key should not be handled in the keydown event is has to be handled in the keyup event

left top width height

min	max
the min max values are dynamic and added from code behind i think this may be my issue

4815299
width	height
it has only width and height

4815368
min	max
the min max values are considered only when flex is calculating the size of the component

4815368
width	height
if you explicitly set values to width height yourself those values will be ignored

4815368
width	height
when setting a fixed value in mxml for width height that value gets saved in explicitwidth explicitheight etc while percentages get stored in percentagewidth percentageheight and so on.

4815375
width	height
but below that number and as long as the width of the window is considerably smaller than it s height it leaves a white space on the right of the screen

for-loop	loops
while loops for-loop and iterator performance test

4819648
accessor	properties
properties are just syntactic sugar for a pair of accessor methods and so what you re actually doing here is calling a method and passing the resulting value as a reference

4819663
vsto	add-in
to deploy a vsto add-in for office 2007 for all users you have two options

4819665
hide	show
within each fragment transaction you can specify in and out animations that will be used for show and hide respectively or both when replace is used

4819665
hide	show
to achieve the same thing with hiding or showing a fragment you d simply call ft.show or ft.hide passing in the fragment you wish to show or hide respectively

4819685
inherited	properties
it looks to me like you might create a class or classes which inherited from system.eventargs and then define a custom properties to access your custom parameter

4819686
boost	stl
the only project using the stl naming conventions seems to be boost where much prototyping for the stl is being done

4819693
google-chrome	firefox
this works for google-chrome and firefox 4 where defineproperty exists and it works for firefox 3.6 where defineproperty does not exist

4819712
children	parent
i am taking in data that is in a tree format but with the possibility of several children for each parent node and the only tree s i can seem to find data on are tree s with weights or tree s where at most each node has two child nodes

4819743
mouse	keyboard
mouse and or keyboard anything what you like

4819743
mouse	keyboard
but one could created custom profiles too assigning any mouse or keyboard action to any of they physical keys of the phone

4819756
quicksort	mergesort
technically mergesort has a better time-behavior î nlogn worst and average cases than quicksort î n 2 worst case î nlogn average case

4819756
quicksort	mergesort
so it is quite possible to find inputs for which mergesort outperforms quicksort

4819821
int	chars
when you log don t just log the strings log the unicode chars that make up the strings as int

4819821
int	chars
just cast each chars in the string to an int and log it

4819865
apache	nginx
if you re deploying on apache or nginx this should be easy enough to configure in the relevant site config files

4819923
width	height
i know how to set layout width and height but don t know how to set layout_alignparentleft true

4819981
viewdidload	viewwillappear	didselectrowatindexpath	viewwillappear
to give you the best answer it would be necessary to see what s in your viewdidload viewwillappear and probably tableview didselectrowatindexpath methods

4820035
put	get
when you next access innerhtml therefore what you get is ul ul because that s the corrected form of what you put there last

4820074
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox and google-chrome

4820107
google-chrome	safari
webkit browsers safari and google-chrome render it with a one pixel gap between the bottom of the nav block and the body block

4820109

in the bootstrap file of each of my modules i am populating my zend_navigation instance so that i can create html xml sitemaps side-bar navigation admin navigation and now i want to create an rss feed

4820146
width	height
setting position to absolute left to -1000 top to -1000 width and height to 100 using jquery or by yourself

4820148
mysqlconnection	mysqldatareader
i have the mysqlconnection in a using block as well as the mysqlcommand and mysqldatareader

4820277
ienumerable	ienumerator
the collection wrapper would implement the ienumerable interface and getenumerator would create an instance of the iterator wrapper the iterator wrapper would implement the ienumerator interface

4820282
zlib	libz	bionic	libc
you ll need to extract bionic libc and zlib libz from the android build as well as ffmpeg libraries depend on them

4820314
mp3	wav
are these wav files or mp3 files that you re trying to play

4820321
ubuntu	debian	innodb	myisam
i would like to test performance of my mysql myisam and innodb engines under debian or ubuntu server for cpu and memory consumption

4820345
for-loop	loops
i thought the for in loops worked the same way as a for-loop

4820351
width	height
on the page styling i have a #flashcontent with width 100 and height 100

4820351
google-chrome	firefox
this works with no problems on ie and firefox but there is a small problem on google-chrome

4820363
hide	show
then you can use the membership class to determine if a user is a particular role and hide show ui elements as necessary

4820399
slideup	slidedown
you can use the slidedown and slideup methods - they re a littler easier to work with

4820407
httprequest	httpresponse
i m sending an httprequest to a java servlet and then having the servlet send back an httpresponse

4820428
onresume	onpause
keep track of this yourself via onpause and onresume in each of your activities

4820445
hide	show
i m supporting an application that uses all over the place to show hide table rows

4820475
hide	show
your alternative is to wrap the tag in a panel and hide or show that

4820489
hide	show
often you ll find the use of placeholders to show and hide content on pages or in asp.net mvc you might see the use of inline code blocks such as .

4820514
mouseleave	mouseenter
i prefer mouseenter docs and mouseleave docs in this situation as it behaves better when hovering over children

4820514
slideup	slidedown
i then restructured your javascript to use .mask-layer for the hover events and simplified the animation with slideup docs and slidedown docs as follows

4820515
translation	localization
all of my forms have localization enabled and are translation into 3 languages

4820519
gmail	hotmail
and you probably already know normal css style tag is not working in webmail like gmail and hotmail

4820520
hide	show
first of all you do not need to make the trip to the server to hide and show controls unless you need new data

4820520
hide	show
second any decent javascript framework will allow you to hide show controls based on the control s id class name or whatever css selector

4820520
post	get
moreover using a javascript post get to a generic handler will give you the data that you need without the postback

4820536
post	get
focus on simple html forms and use post get cookies files and server variables that rapache provides and then manipulate inputs within r script

4820578
min	max
that offset can mean that the value exceeds the max or min limit e.g excel uses 32-bit fields to store numbers or it refer to a cell that doesn t exist maybe you try to refer a column after amj or a row after 65535

4820712
width	height
the obvious solution to this is to simply set the width height property manually with the pixel measurements of my background image but this seems too naive

4820806
width	height
how i get uploaded image height and width for display in it s original size

4820845
width	height
if i have an image of 400x423 how can i calculate a new width and height for that image that best fits into my 240x180 box

4820859
post	get
so i need get data no from post db table bu from users

4820894
hide	show
i am trying to hide and show radcombobox depending on the result

4820917
mouse	keyboard
the user activity can be tested by listening on javascript keyboard keyup and mouse click events

4820921
setinterval	settimeout
you could use javascript s settimeout or setinterval to do this or look into jquery s timers

4820945
width	height
newwidth width newheight height

4820982
inherited	properties
i want the plugins themselves to be as simple as possible to write so i want them all to inherited some basic methods and properties from an action class

4821024
width	height
you can bind width and height to pixelwidth and pixelheight of the imagesource for imagebrush like this

4821082
portrait	landscape
i ve got an activity which should have two rather different layouts depending on whether the user holds it in landscape or portrait mode

4821082
portrait	landscape
i ve got a method to determine if the phone is currently in portrait or landscape mode - if getwindowmanager .getdefaultdisplay .getwidth is larger than getwindowmanager .getdefaultdisplay .getheight then it s in landscape

4821082
portrait	landscape
in my portrait layout xml file i have a few image views which are not present in the landscape layout xml file

4821082
portrait	landscape
this all works fine for switching from portrait to landscape but then when switching back into portrait my code that is executed only for portrait mode gives a null pointer exception - it can t find the view elements

4821082
portrait	landscape
the portrait version of the layout file contains these spacers but the landscape version does not

4821082
portrait	landscape
the code all works fine going from portrait to landscape but when going back to portrait i get the nullpointerexception

4821082
portrait	landscape
obviously this landscape layout is working fine - the error occurs when going from portrait to landscape and then back to portrait

4821082
portrait	landscape
it would certainly still be good to get input on this problem - it seems like a very powerful feature of android to be able to have completely different layouts for landscape and portrait

4821091
multiplying	add
when the user types a number ex 6 we shift the existing number left one decimal place ex 0.000 00.00 multiplying the typed number by 0.01 6 0.06 and add that to our existing number 00.00 00.06

4821091
multiplying	add
shift left 00.06 00.60 multiplying the typed number by 0.01 1 0.01 and add 00.60 00.61

4821091
multiplying	subtract
when the user hits the delete button if there is one we take the last number entered ex 1 multiplying it be 0.01 1 0.01 subtract it from our number 0.61 0.6 and then shift our number right one decimal place 0.6 0.06

4821156
put	get
if i put the same date but put it in as a date type 2 i would get

4821156
minimum	max
so for each set of rules there will be a minimum of 3 possible max of 6 for now this could always expand at any time i will basically be entering a starting date.

4821180
jar	war
that way if you later split the modules into several jar war files into separate maven project for example they are already in the correct directory structure to split them by module

4821203
x86	64bit
if it was possible to run them in a 64bit shell i m pretty sure ms would have shipped both x86 and x64 management shells

4821229
width	height
imagebrush isn t best solution for such requirements because it hasn t width height properties and does not present in visualtree it s just a tool for rendering

4821239
apache	nginx
as you get to needing more performance you might use nginx or apache as a reverse proxy serving your static files quickly and something like thin to make your application run faster

4821254
try-catch	exception-handling
well if you need to truely handle the exception-handling then you ll need try-catch blocks in your code where the exception-handling might happen

4821268
public	protected
both public and protected members of are accessible in class

4821274
post	get
very important point to note if i post to the action with no angle brackets i get the form data as expected

4821280
min	max
check if there are non-transparent pixels on the cut line if so remember min max for bounding box

4821309
stdout	stderr
it s not that sneaky bastich bug where java punishes you if you don t manually drain stderr and stdout when making a system call

4821312
setinterval	settimeout
info using setinterval instead of settimeout shouldn t and doesn t change anything

4821362
uiview	calayer
i d suggest looking at the documentation for uiview and calayer youview.layer and include quartzcore framework in your project

4821365
bash	zsh
if that is the case you can also set this into your terminal profile like .bashrc if you use bash or .zshrc if you use zsh etc

4821454
screens	tablet
if you want to design an app for a tablet you should be looking at the screens size

4821536
bytearrayinputstream	audioinputstream	bytearrayinputstream	objectinputstream	fileinputstream	audioinputstream	fileinputstream	bytearrayinputstream	fileinputstream	objectinputstream
the inputstream could be backed by a audioinputstream bytearrayinputstream fileinputstream filterinputstream inputstream objectinputstream pipedinputstream sequenceinputstream stringbufferinputstream or any other kind of inputstream

4821539
maven	m2e
new maven project_ wizard i assume you have m2e installed

4821585
draggable	droppable
using jquery ui i have a div foo which is both draggable and droppable and a div bar which is only droppable

4821585
draggable	droppable
i just said foo and bar and draggable and droppable so many times that even i m confused but this example should clear things up

4821592
restrict	shared
the network and cpus are shared io is restrict you can t use all resources

4821656
calloc	malloc
personally i would use calloc rather than malloc so that your new nodes have zeroed contents

4821715
google-chrome	safari
you could probably achieve it using css3 webkit animations but the trade off is it will only work in the likes of google-chrome and safari but you won t require any javascript at all

4821744
range	min	range	median	range	max	min	median	min	max	median	max
basically you need to get the range of data min and max possible needed index values subdivide into segments let s say 100 segments and then determine a value for each segment by some algorithm average value median value etc.

4821782
google-chrome	safari
in general you shouldn t need to do this with modern browsers ff3.6 google-chrome ie9 safari

4821814
width	height
and how can i access image s size height width

4821877
filtering	grouping
i d also want to be able to create a query so that we can filtering on that grouping as well

4821976
setinterval	settimeout
i see you re not using setinterval but maybe it s something similar with settimeout

4821978
ubuntu	debian
i use php 5.3 php-fpm on ubuntu debian

4822017
width	height
the image will render in its natural size if the img tag has no width and height attribute and the css does not define style width and height for it

4822026
int	double
adding an index to the format it would be int double double

4822051
hide	show
i am trying to hide and show radcombobox

when looping through given a version # like 2 how to get it to show version-2 but hide all the others

4822144
textview	listactivity
when i scroll down to view the rest of the listactivity in my current tab i want the textview above the tab to scroll out of sight

4822226
fgets	fread
the best way to do this is use fread and fgets to read line by line this is extreamly fast as only one line is read at one time and not the while file

4822260
geocoding	geocode
from apple s developer docs each map kit application has a limited amount of reverse geocoding capacity so it is to your advantage to use reverse geocode requests sparingly.

4822292
versioning	upgrade
the database was created by or upgrade by versioning 10.5

4822340
folder	directory
the .git folder is only stored in the root directory of the repo not all the sub-directories like subversion

4822350
cvs	svn
unlike other source control systems like svn or cvs git stores all of its metadata in a single directory rather than in every subdirectory of the project

4822355
updatepanel	scriptmanager
leaving the updatepanel in i have used the debugger to ensure that the script is indeed registered with the scriptmanager both immediately after the call to registerstartupscript in the web application project and in the onprerender method of the page in the main project

4822372
portrait	landscape
ideally i want the new viewcontroller that i m pushing onto the stack to start off initially in portrait not landscape

4822372
portrait	landscape
my only guess is that apple doesn t want a user transitioning from landscape to portrait despite allowing us to go from landscape back to a previous controller that is in portrait

4822418
equals	tostring
the implementation of hashcode equals and tostring

4822418
equals	tostring
equals and tostring delegate to guava again whereas equals uses pattern matching

4822449
serializable	deserialization
i am using gson to handle json serializable deserialization

4822450
submit	submission
each form submission should return a value asynchronously so that they could submit just two of the tests and then see the return values of the tests without refreshing the page

4822498
updatepanel	scriptmanager
registers a startup script block for a control that is inside an updatepanel by using the scriptmanager control and adds the script block to the page

i can t find out what namespace reference is needed to use nhibernate s queryover

4822564
min	max
even more how do i set bounds of max and min scaling

4822574
accessor	properties
the problem is probably that you are using the properties accessor for the initial setting of the arrays in -viewdidload

4822574
accessor	properties
since well-implemented properties accessor will retain the object you are getting 1 retain from the +alloc and another retain from assigning it

4822600
width	height
chrome you can can drag and drop onto a file upload so you can do drag and drop but you have to fake it by hiding the form via opacity 0 but make it large via a wrapping div and a width 100 and height 100

4822600
google-chrome	safari
safari is the same as google-chrome except you can only do one file at a time more on this at the link above at the end of the post thecssninja link

4822620
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
again firefox is fast at doing this but google-chrome safari are way too slow

4822636
post	get
but now for every post again let s assume thousands millions whatever... i have to first query for a list of id s and then again to get each post s content

4822660
tinyint	varchar
at the moment the column type is tinyint but i need to convert this to a varchar since it now needs to store a

4822672
typedef	typename
even if it does exist you still have to typedef typename base size_type size_type

4822675
put	get
20 000 get requests 2 000 put

4822688
tinyint	varchar
others could give you a headache but tinyint to varchar s pretty straight-up.

4822730
vmware	virtualbox	rtos	ecos
a do-it-your-self solution is possible using virtualisation you could for example use the free virtualbox vmware server or virtual pc and run a free or open source rtos such as ecos in the vm

4822791
cpu	hyperthreading	cpu	processors	processors	hyperthreading
count each processors that supports hyperthreading as one cpu

4822828
post	get
hey i am trying to find a way to get my post records filtered

4822877
int	boolean
they are much more type-safe than int strings or sets of boolean flags

4822883
google-chrome	safari
in safari 4 and google-chrome 8 it returns 6

4822907
apache	nginx
nginx will still proxy the request because it s not your media path and then apache will deliver the file back to nginx

4822953
getter	setter
in javascript there is the possibility to create getter and setter the following way

4822953
getter	setter
but is there a way to get the getter or setter function

4822953
getter	setter
to pass values from the a -field of a b -object to the a -field of a a -object i need to get the setter getter function before overriding them

4822958
int	chars
main int argc 1 const chars argv 0x003e63e8 line 115 + 0xa5 bytes c++

4822968
udp	tcp
we will be sending unicast and multicast udp tcp and broadcast ip traffic through the devices

4822968
subnet	packets
our devices then act like simple passthrough routers and have two interfaces one on the 10.0.0.0 24 subnet one on the 10.0.1.0 24 subnet which they just forward packets back and forth from

4822968
udp	tcp
packet injection is probably feasible for udp and broadcast ip but very likely not so for tcp

4823015
google-chrome	firefox
it fires in firefox and i haven t checked google-chrome

4823015
google-chrome	firefox
you will notice that ie does not trigger the change event while firefox and google-chrome does

4823042
queue	fifo
if the incidents should be in lifo or fifo order consider queue and stacks

4823064
union	distinct
however if you re certain the data from the top and bottom queries will not overlap use union all where union attempts to make the results distinct making the engine do additional work which can be considerable if there are a lot of records

4823154
int	chars
i m attempting to write a structure consisting of a an array of chars an int value and a pointer to a pipe

4823185
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

4823197
uilabel	uitextview
if you have a tableview containing your own custom uitableviewcells that contain uitextview and uilabel whose height must be determined at runtime how are you supposed to determine the height for each row in heightforrowatindexpath

4823204
jruby	rubinius
and if you want to use an alternative implementation of ruby try out jruby or rubinius once these runtimes implement full 1.9.2 compatibility both are currently fully 1.8.7-compatible and working on 1.9.2 compatiblity

4823204
jruby	rubinius
both of these alternative runtimes are better equipped to provide extraordinarily better performance jruby can take advantage of the hotspot jvm and rubinius can take advantage of llvm

4823204
passenger	thin	passenger	unicorn	thin	unicorn
additionally ree is best when used with phusion passenger but there are new ways of deploying rails apps nginx in front of thin or unicorn that provide strong benefits and which do not make use of phusion passenger

how can i get the message to put as a whole to output to the jtextarea

4823222
inherited	subclassing
they cannot be instantiated directly and a subclassing of an abstract-class can only be instantiated directly if all inherited pure virtual methods have been implemented by that class or a parent class

4823224
chown	sudo
if that still doesn t do it try the bit up at the top about sudo chown -r root wheel library startupitems mysqlcom

4823244
int	chars
the problem here is twofold - a you increment the pointer before you check the value read in and b you ignore the fact that fgetc returns an int instead of a chars

4823264
gdi	directdraw
so cross-platform here means using gdi though some older directdraw apis might work in that case you have a much easier time with hardware overlays and better performance

4823272
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
which phones are mdpi hdpi but also large screens

4823284
tablet	galaxy

google-chrome	safari
visit any video with an html5-capable browser works with at least safari google-chrome and ie9 and choose to switch to html5 player.

4823360
getter	setter
getter and setter do not count for a behaviour.

4823363
width	height
you can do this by calculating and adding to your view s center point the offset based on the difference between the initial and final anchorpoints multiplied by your view s width height or you could set the view s center to the initial touch point

4823386
opera	firefox
works perfectly on opera firefox webkit browsers

4823389
textview	imageview
you have to set the imageview with wrap_content the textview with fill_parent

4823413
src	attr
the attr docs method to change the src

4823457
google-chrome	safari
however under google-chrome tried both 5.x and 9.x beta and sometimes safari this ends up populating a bunch of other fields that don t even match the

4823457
google-chrome	safari
go to url using google-chrome or safari -- sometimes fails as well

4823459
actionscript	mxml
now i would highly suggest extending button with actionscript but it is also possible to do in mxml

4823487
int	double
accept at least int double string parameters

4823544
unixodbc	iodbc
linux driver managers unixodbc and iodbc are the free ones both use the same configuration files odbc.ini and odbcinst.ini or .odbc.ini and .odbcinst.ini in your home directory

4823566
google-chrome	firefox
he has a drupal based website which is working perfectly in firefox google-chrome

4823582
filesystems	fat
on the other hand i don t know if filesystems that do not offer security at all fat would be so concerned to give you the content of the clusters that they happened to allocate for the new part of the file

4823632
chown	chmod
edit you will want to use the chmod shell command to grant read write permissions on the directory to other unless you don t want to let anyone write there just www-data in which case you ll need to use chown as well

4823639
google-chrome	firefox
to check this use a dom inspector firebug in firefox or the dev tools in ie8 or google-chrome to see where the element containing the lightbox is it s usually at the end of the page

4823651
rvm	bundler
people seem to be addressing issues as they come up ie bundler rspec2 rails3 rvm

4823654
opera	firefox
however when the very same construct is used from the target url firefox and opera keep refreshing the page every 3 seconds making http requests to the server regardless of the fact that the url for redirect has already been reached

4823666
integer	unsigned	unsigned	short
if you want to scan a hexadecimal short integer you need to use hx but this also means you need to provide the address of an unsigned short rather than a plain short

4823694
wordpress	joomla
next plenty of pro sites use joomla wordpress and drupal

4823697
strlen	memmove
you might consider a combination of strlen and memmove instead

4823709
getter	setter
this is why for example chains of degenerate getter and setter in java beans don t actually translate to huge heaping piles of wasted register space at runtime

std	ostream
your compiler is being nice to you one is the built-in std ostream overload that looks like this

4823956
std	ostream
with the first candidate the first argument requires a derived-to-base conversion the std ofstream needs to be converted to a std ostream for the function to be called

4823956
int	double
the second argument requires the use of the built-in double to int conversion then the use of your converting constructor to convert from int to base

4823961

rss	feed
i ve just installed simplepie to parse my rss feed to display on my site

4824054
uilabel	nsstring
note that it can be a simpler variant of the method to really populate the data - instead of actually resizing a uilabel in a cell for example it can just use the nsstring height methods to determine how tall the uilabel would be in the final cell and then use the total cell height plus a border on the bottom and uilabel placement to determine the real height

4824101
post	get
there is no other change other than using post versus get method

4824133

4824200
width	height
i want the image to scale so the width fills the screen and the height adjust proportionally

4824200
width	height
what is happening is the image is scaling down so the height fills the list row but there is plenty of room for the width to be bigger

4824200
width	height
why is the image shrinking to some seemingly arbitrary height and how do i get it to fill the screen by width

4824221
public	protected
it needs to be protected or public for the image class to be able to access it and it needs to be also virtual if you want to be able to override it in the image class

4824222

4824368
google-chrome	firefox
good thing i have managed the users switch to firefox or google-chrome

4824372
free	malloc
the danger here is that you have to deallocate free everything you allocated using malloc and if you forget you create a memory leak

4824378
put	get
when i put a url as a parameter i could use this api to get page form s all contents

4824378

4824738
chunked	transfer-encoding
if the client sends a message with transfer-encoding chunked you will need to parse the somewhat complicated chunked transfer encoding syntax

4824748
for-loop	arrays
first of all while the arguments object available within a function is not an arrays it is array-like enough such that an incremental for-loop is preferable - not only because it runs faster but also because it avoids other pitfalls - one of which is exactly what you re falling into

4824748
inherited	properties
first let s focus on all - by which i mean to say not just properties of the object itself but also potentially properties said object has inherited from its prototype or its prototype s prototype or so on

4825169
integer	unsigned
prime function generated primes and i encoded the primes onto bits of number 32 bit unsigned integer

4825252
int	double
stronger variable typing - in access you can actually declare your variables with a specified data type such as string date int long single double etc

4825252
folder	dir
access does give you some ways of access files and folder using vba s built-in functions methods such as dir but these functions don t cover all the bases

4825259
dictionary	map
it can be treated as an array list vector hash table an implementation of a map dictionary collection stack queue and probably more

4825282
width	margin
the stackpanel stacks its children based on their widths if you increase the width of an item or increase its margin the stackpanel will simply expand to accomodate this

4825385
prepare	execute
in languages such as esql c you prepare the execute procedure statement then declare a cursor for it followed by open fetch in a loop and close

4825385
prepare	execute
the analogous operations should work in jdbc and java too - with the possible difference that you may not need to separate the prepare and execute phases

4825452
intersect	contains
so the result would contains the data integers corresponding to the intersect integers

4825525
hide	show
instead display an overlay div which listens on click and hide itself and show the hidden input and give the input focus

4825550
implements	extends
the two things i am currently considering are extends authorizeattribute or just making a new attribute that implements iauthorizationfilter

4825613
getter	setter
if you are interested in efficiency you would be better off creating custom classes with attributes getter setter for the properties

4825645
bnd	maven-bundle-plugin
most tools bnd the apache felix maven-bundle-plugin will actually do this for you

4825670
webclient	webrequest
my question is what happens when you want to check the exception and do an action based on the exception such as alert the user the disk has no space or mark a url as 404 .net webclient webrequest throws on this or retry later if a 500 error code occurs

4825705

you can put the portrait layout in res layout-port the landscape version of the layout in res layout-land and a default for square screens i suppose in res layout

4825854
draggable	droppable
more specifically you want the draggable and resizable plugins perhaps the droppable too depending of what you are trying to do

4825899
rss	feed
i am reading rss feed and pushing both title and link into an array in jquery

4825900
implements	extends
then the remaining interface methods have to be implements by the concrete class that extends the abstract class

4825911
super	implements
since you are just inheriting what s being implements in super class uiviewcontroller if you don t call super methods then implementation that needs to be done is not done

4825911
super	implements
if i am correct it seems like super loadview implements something very critical to avoid the loop

4825939
multiplying	add
how do i ensure that the objects of addthread and multiplythread can acquire locks for add int op1 int op2 and multiplying int op1 int op2 methods respectively at the same time without blocking out each other

4825940
hide	show
my script for hide and show

4825966
multiplying	add
those two methods already use two different objects to synchronize on so you already can call and execute add and multiplying at the same time from different threads

4825986
accessor	properties
further it tells me that i do not need to define a corresponding properties in the implementation object but that i will have to write custom accessor setter methods

4826013
codeigniter	cakephp
cakephp + hudson codeigniter env

4826026
for-loop	loops
the for-loop will work but it seems better practice to use .each if for no other reason just because you don t have to hard-code the values -- if you use for then if you ever change the number of properties you ll have to go update that loops too

4826031
implements	extends
arraylist extends abstractlist and implements list cloneable serializable

4826032
switching	screens
it allows you to switching between threads and by having the call stack and locals visible on the screens you should then start to get a feeling for where you are

4826047
implements	extends
arraylistdemo itself doesn t implements the interfaces or extends arraylist

4826060
implements	extends
not at all because arraylistdemo does nt extends or implements any class object of course

4826062
google-chrome	firefox
checked in google-chrome firefox mac and win to see if it also happens there

4826133
public	protected
it can be public protected or private

4826156
versioning	upgrade
the 1.4.x versioning should be fine although it shouldn t hurt to upgrade it to something more recent

4826319
post	get
you will get a very similar solution to the post of cubanacan using subversive within eclipse

4826320
chunked	transfer-encoding
you are entitled to insist on either transfer-encoding chunked or content-length so you don t have to worry about determining the length in any other situation

4826335
quicksort	heapsort
heapsort would be great here as would quicksort or introsort

4826348
daemons	launchd

4826403
hash	md5
in alternative is there a way to convert a sha1 or md5 hash to a string with these limitations

4826421
google-chrome	firefox
after initial investigation found that the google-chrome firefox new versions have good support for this

4826421
opera	safari
however ie opera have not implemented it and safari have partial support for this

4826421
google-chrome	firefox
my understanding is that the google-chrome and firefox are only two browsers today to have support for the drag drop file to web browsers feature

4826423
next	except
next the grep is trying to throw away all the other lines except the ones that start with free shipping so its output should be like

4826423
spaces	delimiter
next the cut is extracting out the third column delimiter by spaces so the output should be

4826464
qstring	qtextstream
qstring default constructor assumes it s latin1 unless you change it with qtextstream setcodecforcstrings

4826479
free	malloc
does anyone know if free and malloc are threadsafe on visual c++ 2010

yes file api successfully implemented in webkit browsers as of today.in gecko it is partially implemented and for other browser it is not implemented yet

4826567
int	double
i have written this program for calculating square root of int or double type values by method overloading concept

4826567
int	double
how can i fix my error so i can find the square root of an int and a double

4826579
chown	chmod
chown the file .htaccess to set the owner to php s user then chmod 755 that should do the trick

4826583
int	double
math.sqrt returns a double but in your first class method you re trying to return this directly from a method that returns int

4826589
int	double
type mismatch cannot convert from double to int

4826589
int	double
by the way a square root of an int can be double so by having a return type int you are truncating possibly important information

4826615
serializable	deserialization
failing that you might start bottom-up and make a custom language to describe the calls and then use that to generate the serializable deserialization and proxy code

4826721
width	height
every box has a fixed width and height and inside they have an img and some text the images are like icons they re the same width and height

4826750
autoresize	scrollbar
you will of course have to call .modal.defaults.onshow each time you change the content ajax call tab change etc but you can keep the autoresize and autoposition capabilities whilst avoiding unnecessary scrollbar

4826838
calloc	malloc
the new operator or for pods malloc calloc support a simple and efficient form of failing when allocating large chunks of memory

4826847
button	checkbox
note that there is no form or submit button all thing is done on checkbox on click event

4826858
ria	smartclient
smartclient is its own ria framework the code you posted is their own syntax

4826880

right now i might have to get all the post from a page filter by user and do the same with comments but if the page has 3k post and tons of comments that will be very slow

4826893
rss	feed
it has an rss feed too

4826937
post	get
as for how to code the templates here s a good blog post on it which will get you started

4826947
allocator	stl
by default the standard stl container classes use the std allocator class under the hood to do their allocator which is why they can throw std bad_alloc if there s no memory available

i didn t scan your site but if you re using any standard software on your website like wordpress drupal joomla etc

4827088
google-chrome	firefox
unlike firefox and google-chrome apple doesn t have an auto browser language detecting landingpage so i rerouted it via google search to achieve that

4827115
versioning	upgrade
you have an older versioning and you need to upgrade or install the json extension yourself

4827123
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
many times after filling up a bytearrayoutputstream with bytes and then create an inputstream

4827123
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
ideally once the inputstream getter is called a flag should be set in the bytearrayoutputstream so writes will fail

4827134
post	get
i can t work out how to get r returned to the data grid some post suggest using dbms output but nothing is written to it when i run the code

4827171
button	checkbox
so i would need a button that deletes an item once a checkbox is selected

4827176
floating-point	integer	floating-point	fractions	integer	fractions
in ieee standard binary floating-point format actually representing numbers by scientific notation i know that an integer value of one is always assumed to be added to the fractions part illustrated by the significand part of the binary and is not included in the binary so what confuses me is how to how to distinguish between 1 and zero floating-point values because i assume both have a totally zero significand and i guess the differentiation here should be done by exponent part but don t know how

4827195
ftp	telnet
ftp passwd telnet etc

4827207
qcombobox	qcompleter
if i set the qcombobox editable the user can insert text and the qcompleter is automatically created

4827352
integer	unsigned
another example is that if you randomly scatter casts between integer types then eventually you ll suppress a compiler warning for a narrowing cast or a comparison between signed and unsigned values that you should have paid attention to

4827364
rss	feed
this classification includes unauthenticated requests such as rss feed and authenticated requests to resources that do not require authentication

4827406
width	height
i have extended view and override ondraw and onsizechanged so i can draw on the screen after i have the full height and width of the screen.but when i tried on my phone the imgs are slightly in different position than that i have defined.also i have define actual values in px in my code and i think i can t use dip at least i don t know..

4827431
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
gwt can only handle unchecked-exception which means sent from server to client which are not serialized that extends from runtimeexception

4827455
rss	feed
you could also scrape some stats from the rss feed generated by the itunes store rss generator but again this just gets currently popular apps rather than actual download numbers

4827481
listview	gridview
i need to set the listview view to a gridview that have a complex header like this based on a 3 dimensional object list i created

4827492
width	height
screens you have to first identify height and width of device and according to it u should write some method tht will set ur image at place whr u want on diff screens

4827492

get height and width of screen you ahve to writ this method at start of activity

4827521
libxml2	libxslt
i m using libxml2 and libxslt to process xml files

4827546
mousemove	mousedown
your problem is that when the mousedown event occurs on a button that button captures the mouse and doesn t release it until the button is released which means that the mousemove events are not received by the other buttons

4827566
gmp	bigint
gmp can do bigint operations for both c and c++

for-loop	arrays
is there maybe some quick method to copy one arrays to another from starting position to ending not to use for-loop for every byte manually

4827649
int	chars
sizeof int might not be equal to sizeof chars

4827714
lxml	elementtree

stdout	stderr
asynctask.m -- sample code that shows how to implement asynchronous stdin stdout stderr streams for processing data with nstask

4827848
ontouchevent	ondraw
use ondraw to draw the same image so i can move it around using ontouchevent

4827868
for-loop	loops
you could also use a for-loop instead of the while loops and then put in a conditional

4827869
viewdidload	viewwillappear
edit if you need the nextcontroller to store the startdate in the viewwillappear you should initialize it there or even better in the viewdidload and not in the buttonpressed - method before assigning the startdate

4827883
hide	show
views s exposed form layout is partially handled in the theme layer see views-exposed-form.tpl.php so more work is probably needed to hide show the labels

4828009
src	attr
in that listener you change the src attribute by invoking attr help

4828026
mouse	keyboard
this would require changing the way mouse and keyboard events are handled

4828026
mouse	keyboard
i ve found an old mailing list post that describes how to listen to changes in the document and changes in the presentation but nothing that describes how to intercept low-level keyboard and mouse events such that the default behaviour can be overridden

4828111
subtraction	addition
this instr_generic could now execute either an addition or subtraction for example depending on what is on the hardware

4828163
longlistselector	silverlight
i would use the silverlight wp7 toolkit s longlistselector to do this

4828215
post	get
if you re not too keen on writing your own theme you can instead use the plugin get post which allows you to embed a shortcode in the content of any page and return a list of entries

4828226
int	double
which indicates that the literal is a floating point number rather than an int and the f suffix which tells the compiler the literal should be of type float rather than the default double type used for floating point literals

4828268
nsstring	nsdata
there is 1 thing they have in common though and thats foundation which contains nsdata nsstring and so on

4828361

mouseup	mousedown
in wpf most controls have mouseup and mousedown events and the mouse-button-specific variations but not a simple click event that can be used right away

4830164
mouseup	mousedown
the obvious problem is that you cannot simply omit the mousedown event because if your click is started on another control and it is released over the control that only handles mouseup your supposed click will fire while it really should not both mouseup and mousedown should occur over the same control

4830220

4830542

rsa	aes
in our installer created by vs2008 we re encrypting our connection string with aes key and iv and then creating a rsa key-pair and storing them in machinekeystore

4831634
rsa	aes
the installer will use the rsa public key to encrypt the aes key and iv and store the encrpted key and iv with the encrypted connection string

4831634
rsa	aes
after installation our application will read the encrypted connection string with the encrypted aes key and iv back and use the rsa private key from machinekeystore to decrypt the aes key and iv and then decrypt the connection string with the aes key and iv

4831634
rsa	aes
the encryption in the installer works with aes and rsa public key

4831634
rsa	aes
doing the same thing with aes and rsa encryption for the connection string within our application without the installer involved works fine

i m creating a drawing app for tablet and am interested in how to best handle the drawing canvas relating to screens orientation changes

4831824
portrait	landscape
the issue relates to the different size of x y in portrait landscape modes

4831824
portrait	landscape
if a user has a canvas that fills the screen minus notification and title bars and in portrait mode draws near the bottom of the canvas say at point 140 460 on a 320x480 screen when the screen gets flipped to landscape and recreated from the x y vectors that i ve stored the point at 140 460 is now out of the bounds of the screen because the screen is now 480x320

4831824
portrait	landscape
likewise if they draw points in landscape near the right-hand edge of the screen and flip back to portrait those points will be out of bounds

4831824
screens	tablet
as i m designing this for a tablet i d like to give the user the flexibility to draw as they like yet maintain some sanity when it comes to the screens bounds etc

4831824
portrait	landscape
i thought about the possibility of hiding the title bar showing notification allowing orientation change and then if the screen is rotated to landscape rotating the canvas back to portrait but when the navigation bar moves from what would have been the top in portrait to the right-hand side in landscape i still get the same x y bounding issues just to a much smaller degree the width of the notification bar effectively

4831827
width	margin
if the negative margin is working you can get the centering back by adding a wrapper div with a fixed width and margin 0 auto

4831827
width	margin
in my testing the negative margin didn t change the width of the box

4831827
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
update instead of negative margins you can probably use box-sizing border-box so that the border doesn t add to the element s width in the first place

i wonder how it will be scheduled on a centos 5.3 box with four xeon x7560 2.27ghz processors and each processors core has hyperthreading enabled

4832001
processors	hyperthreading
for my understanding there are four 8-cores physical processors the total physical cores are 32 each processors core has hyperthreading enabled the total logical processors are 64

in essense you could push this either post or get into your application and json_decode it to the object in the first section

4832270
hash	md5	client-side	server-side
i figured that i could calculate the md5 hash values of the client-side and server-side and see if they re the same but what s happening is i use my application to decompress a zip file and then without changing any of the underlying files i use my application to re-compress it but the old and new zip files have different md5 hash

button	checkbox
so i need a form that will have a checkbox for each of the 3 letters a submit button that prints the entire page upon clicking and for the form to apply a class to each of the selected letter s div when the print button is clicked so the print.css will only print the divs that have this class applied to it

you start having to use things like recursive regex replacements using callbacks and don t even get me started on what happens when users improperly nest their tags or put double quotes into their anchor urls

4832374

4832591
rss	feed
first of all nowadays i recommend using an atom feed instead of rss

4832591
rss	feed
the specification of atom feed offers more value than the rss one with internationalization content types and other things and every modern feed reader supports it

4832591
rss	feed
add the link to atom and rss feed on the layout

pull	push
you will need to push to a web service or other cloud database the current position of the device using location services then have the app pull from another service

4832908
filesystems	ntfs
for the ntfs filesystems one could mention block size set to 4k ntfs storing files less than block size in mtf size of files number of files fragmentation etc

put	get	folder	directory
if you create a new directory or folder on your website and do not put a index.html file in it you may be surprised to find that your visitors can get a directory listing of all the files in that folder

4833006
folder	directory
for example if you create a folder called incoming you can see everything in that directory simply by typing in your browser

the easiest way to get a 32-bit value from it is probably to call rand twice in a row and and put the two values together

4833053
multicastdelegate	delegation
i compared the memebers of delegation and multicastdelegate classes in object browser and i couldn t find any new additional member present in multicastdelegate

4833053
multicastdelegate	delegation
if my assumption is correct i wonder why not custom delegation types directly derive from the delegation class instead of multicastdelegate class

4833056
filesystems	ntfs
no more permission problems like properties security tab in ntfs filesystems

4833071
multicastdelegate	delegation
basically the split of delegation and multicastdelegate is for historical reasons

4833071
multicastdelegate	delegation
sadly you need to be aware of both of these classes because even though all delegation types you create have multicastdelegate as a base class you ll occasionally manipulate your delegation types by using methods defined by the delegation class instead of the multicastdelegate class

it might be a bit on the edge of what is considered restful however note that our api is restful in all aspects and even though the dedicated streaming service does not adhere to the uniform interface get post put delete our api does

4833103
post	get	post	put	put	get
our api allows us proper control over resources and their meta data via get post put delete and we provide links to the streaming service thus adhering with connectedness aspect of rest

best would probably to have a js functions that knows how to handle what to hide and show as well or adding styles within the tag elements themself or not outputting the id s explicitly

min	max
each row needs to record the name average min max etc

4833321

the call template will need to iterate through all the records to find avg min max etc so i m not sure what to pass in as the call parameter

4833346

4833464
inline	inlining
when inlining the code from your inline func call it b is copied into the caller func a

inline	inlining
so if module a extern referenced a function marked as inline but the code was in module b module a will make calls to the function rather than inlining it

do we need to increase the height and width and the dpi

4833588
width	height
or is it simply enough to leave the dpi as is and increase the height width

4833588
screens	hdpi
for example if i have an image that s 100 x 100 with 160 dpi in order to render it identical on an hdpi screens it should now be 150 x 150 with 240 dpi

4833588
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
i saw some examples where the splash screens for mdpi was 320x480 at 160 dpi but then the hdpi splash screens was at 480 x 800 at 240

4833588
width	height
furthermore after looking at the icons in the android sdk they only scale up the width and height not the dpi

i was wondering if someone could post for me the changes i need to make to this code to get the current rating values to display on the page before the form is submitted as well as after as it is written now

4834226
mouse	keyboard
the example only shows how to retrieve keyboard input events but it wasn t that difficult to change it to listen for mouse move events instead

4834231
hash	salt
you ll probably need to get data anyway so the unique salt is probably faster too because you won t need to calculate the hash over username

but i discoved today mvc assumes a get to be a post if a page request a get from itself

4834763
apache	nginx
if you do not require the performance of nginx then you may find a pragmatic solution is to just use apache

4834963
profiling	instrumentation
instrumenting profiling put a lot of overhead into each function call and if all you want is an overall speed difference it won t be accurate because you re partly measuring the cost of the instrumentation itself

4834963
profiling	instrumentation
a wall-clock-time stack-sampling profiling not instrumentation that reports line-level percent is your best bet

4834969
equals	gethashcode
not that it is relevant to the posed problem do read up on overriding equals you need to override gethashcode too and check for error cases like null type-mismatch

4834977
factors	mean
use numcolwise mean the numcolwise function converts its argument a function into a function that operates only on numerical columns and ignores the categorical factors columns

so i guess the question still remains how do i get ie9 dev tools to show the location where console message especially console.error came from in the script the same way that google-chrome dev tools and firefox firebug

4838926
accessor	properties
usually you want the accessor generated by synthesize to handle the retain release when the properties is set to a new value

4838926
getter	setter
you can then use synthesize to generate the default getter and setter

4838926
getter	setter
if you do not use the self.myiblabel notation you are bipassing the getter and setter and working with the ivar directly

4838959
onresize	onload
with plain javascript you can control when the code runs for example onload or onresize

4839119
post	get
this method is as safe as any other kind of incoming get or post data - you will always need to sanitize the data before working with it

4839134
hex	binary
and translation form hex to binary is trivial

4839175
filtering	grouping
sphinx can do grouping and counting as well as fulltext and attribute searching filtering on many columns in several different search configurations

4839211
jquery	anythingslider
this method is used my jquery anythingslider

4839221
rss	feed
yes it would be possible to make charts from an rss feed but it really depends on the data you re trying to graph

4839221
rss	feed
there may be a public api for obtaining this data rather than using an rss feed

4839222
hide	show
i m trying to use jquery to show hide div tags based on the selected index of a drop down menu however it isn t working

4839268

asp.net-mvc	castle-monorail
castle monorail asp.net-mvc web framework castle-monorail

4839516
inherited	properties
you could get around this by checking to see if each properties name refers to a properties that wasn t inherited from the prototype using the hasownproperty function but again this would be much less efficient than

4839618
button	checkbox
if working for vista or greater and just want to grab very basic information via checkbox radio button etc then have a look at this vista_taskdialog_wrapper and vgtaskdialog

4839625

4839726
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
tested on firefox 3.x google-chrome and safari 5.0

4839731
fflush	gets
this is because the exception occurs when the session gets fflush

4839731
fflush	gets
and perhaps it gets fflush when the transaction is committed - by the spring proxy

4839781
put	get
only difference is that the engine of chrome os is put directly onto the hardware allowing the webpage to get a better performance because it has only one abstraction layer to the hardware instead of 3 or 4

4839812
post	get	post	put	put	get
in our case this one matches get word - this header could use get post put or delete words

4839843
getter	setter
further some feel that encapsulating the fields with getter and setter is a good idea but again it would greatly expand the code length

4839857
button	checkbox
many of the standard ui items radio button button checkbox etc will have a different look than the ui builder will show

4839869
dictionary	map
the first step is to create a dictionary to map the emails to their status values

4839881
userid	usergroups
in a relational database i d probably have a third table called usergroups with a userid column a groupid column and an isowner column

4839886

4839897
uiview	subviews
have a uiview in the nib file and add remove the viewcontroller s views as subviews as they are needed

4839897
uiview	subviews
have a uiview in the nib file as an iboutlet and replace the uiview with the viewcontroller s view so that they are subviews of the mytabbarcontroller s view directly

4839897
uiview	subviews
don t have a uiview in the nib and programmatically set the frame of the viewcontrollers as they are added so they are subviews of the mytabbarcontroller s view directly

4839916
int	boolean
because php is dynamically typed you can turn a boolean variable into string array into int and so on

4839917
getter	setter
2 getter and setter default comments - comments for set get methods that just tell that correspondent method sets of returns field value

4839920
metal	opencl
i could have chosen between 5 choices out there opencl cuda firestream close to metal directcompute

4839920
metal	opencl
well not really after filtering them for my needs none suits i am using radeon 3870hd so cuda is out i want crossplatform directcompute out close to metal evolved to firestream equivalent of cuda for amd and fs is now deprecated for good of opencl

4839924
getter	setter
2 -5 getter and setter default comments

4839945

static properties aren t inherited

4840012
mouseup	mousedown
i am preforming events on the mousedown and mouseup parts of the click which is why i cant use click

4840012

but event.preventdefault is not preventing the concatenation of # to the url when envoking mouseup or mousedown methods

4840051
g++	gcc
the first 2 ones use gcc and the final one g++ giving a python extension as a result

4840051
g++	gcc
my problem is that after gcc compiles the code with no errors g++ starts to complain it can not find one of my class definitions more details below

4840051
g++	gcc
as you can see gcc compiles my code fine but when g++ does its thing it fails to find the definition of my mesh constructor which i define in my header file

4840064
mouseup	mousedown
if you re talking about clicking a link it is probably because there isn t a default behavior to prevent for mousedown and mouseup

4840064
mouseup	mousedown
the default behavior of clicking a link requires a combination of mousedown plus mouseup on the link

4840064
mouseup	mousedown
if you mousedown then drag off the link before you mouseup the link is not followed

4840064
mouseup	mousedown
only when you mousedown then mouseup is the default behavior activated

4840077
google-chrome	firefox
i know that everything is working because my production app is serving data-uri s to firefox and google-chrome and whilst i don t have access to ie screenshots from browsershots suggest that all is well

4840100
inherited	properties
jquery runs a for...in loop on the object passed which iterates over all enumerable properties of an object whether inherited or not

4840100
inherited	properties
it doesn t do any checks to see if the object s properties is owned by the object or inherited via the prototype chain

4840115
integer	unsigned
according to that wikipedia page changing time_t to an unsigned integer cannot be done because it would break programs that handle early dates

4840115
integer	unsigned
however i don t understand why it wasn t made an unsigned integer in the first place

4840172
put	get
put those two things together and you get the horrible mess you mention

x86	64bit
2 objective-c programs use the new abi runtime on 64bit x86 machines

this means that whenever it processes an event such as selecting an item in a select list it does an http post back to the server to get the new html

4840502
lisp	smalltalk
ruby draws inspiration from smalltalk lisp and perl but there s no reason you d need to know them before learning ruby as a matter of fact it s probably easier to learn than the former two and learning perl will probably teach you some habits you ll need to unlearn to write idiomatic ruby

4840529
slideup	slidedown
you can then call slidedown on all the reportdivs as a group before calling slideup on the one you need via its id from the dropdown

4840530

is there any object-object mapper that can map properties from a dictionary or other name-value collection

4840595
inherited	properties
i ve noticed that the pathitem inherited the position properties from pageitem and position

lisp	scheme
for a background into the basis for a lot of this stuff you would be well advised to start looking into impmenting continuations and other techniques pioneered in lisp scheme

4840598
lisp	scheme
as it happens lisp scheme are the perfect languages for writing dsl s and other languages in and if you haven t already merely learning them will improve your programming in exactly the areas you are looking for right now

4840625
getter	setter
if you want instances of the foo interface to implement a variable then the interface should define getter and setter methods and these methods should be implemented in an implementing class for example to hold the corresponding state in a private instance variable declared by the class

hash	md5
note that the md5sum and md5 utilities have a command-line option that can verify all the md5 hash listed in an md5sum file automatically

4840841

4841001
children	parent
looks like this has nothing to do with jquery and just is a problem with chrome hiding an parent element that has a huge number of children elements

4841019

i m working on modifying part of an existing rails app to use the class-table-inheritance gem all s well except that i have defined some instance methods in my superclass -- person which all subclassing need to be able to access

4841134
inherited	subclassing
since the cti gem doesn t actually use ruby inherited all subclassing still inherited from activerecord base and the gem does some funky voodoo to link the activerecord fields together i can t access these methods in the subclassing i ve created

4841135
post	get
i realize the query should be get not post but i m pretty sure that s not the problem

from the appdelegate i create the uiwindow and uiviewcontroller

4841196
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

4841201
caanimation	catransition
caanimation which catransition is a subclass of has the delegate method animationdidstop finished which you can use

4841206
vbscript	vb6
escaping quotes in vb6 or vbscript strings is simple in theory although often frightening when viewed

4841219
for-loop	arrays
i know that i could use a for-loop and putchar or that i could copy the arrays and then add a null-terminator but i m wondering if there s a more elegant way

4841222
temp	tmp
if the tmp alias is recognized as a temp buffer of the preliminary query as defined by the outer from clause i might have something that will work.

4841255
printf	strncpy
while strncpy can be dangerous in the hands of someone not used to it it can be quicker in terms of execution time compared to a printf printf printf style solution since there is none of the overhead of dealing with the formatting strings

4841363
implements	extends
what about declaring public dynamic class tracer extends proxy implements talker with all methods that need to be defined

4841378

4841610
google-chrome	firefox
ie has a js debugger built-in as of ie8 i think firebug is probably the way to go in firefox and i m pretty sure google-chrome also has a built-in debugger

4841618
google-chrome	firefox
you can use firebug under firefox or the google-chrome inspector right click on the page and inspect... under google-chrome

4841625
google-chrome	firefox
internet explorer has a javascript debugger built in hit f12 google-chrome has one built in too but there is also a firebug lite that should work if you like firebug for firefox

4841719
zlib	libpng
whit this information i looked on the include files of the libraries dependencies of poppler like zlib libpng cairo ... and i found in various cases that they don t have a preprocessor directive to especify the static version of the lib

4841725
nginx	lighttpd

4842010
disk	ram
it could be achieved though by creating a ram disk

4842010
disk	ram
have a look at this link linux ram disk creating a filesystem in ram

4842030
width	height
as you will see you just have to set up the height and width to half the border-radius

4842075
implements	extends
it also means that you can have them in separate namespaces and that a given type can extends both 1 of them without any nameclash because they are namespaced in opposition to java where a single class can t implements two interfaces with homonymous methods

4842205
inherited	properties
the same settings work for all the other dlls in the project cli and c++ and they inherited the same properties

4842228
mvp	presenter
which at least partly breaks separation of the view and the presenter if you re trying to work with the mvp pattern

4842228
mvp	presenter
now if you wanted to delegate all logic to a presenter class again in an mvp setting you would manually have to forward events such as a button click from your view to the presenter

4842230
dictionary	map
map the database dictionary tables and read the required data from them

4842253

4842368
google-chrome	firefox
this happened to me in ie8 only while in google-chrome and firefox it was fine

4842368

in google-chrome and firefox it seems to be working as expected button click causes current time to display in the user control nothing else happens but in ie8 the div inside the user control loses its styles background color borders

4842388
mouse	keyboard
you still need to redirect keyboard and mouse input events to your subclass

4842390
button	checkbox
worth mentioning is that i had a custom layout on my list items there is an icon a title a description and then the checkbox or radio button depending on if it s a single or multiple choice list

base	fractions
example for base 2 with 8 bit fractions and 8 bit exponent

4842624
base	fractions
in order to understand this better try to experiment with different base and sizes for fractions and exponential part

4842624
base	fractions
once you grasp how this representation works you should be able to write code to obtain representation of any number in any base fractions exponential part combination

i was thinking of implementing a bool flag in the standarduserdefaults which when set to yes unlocks the upgrade this is for the lite versioning

4843221
mouseup	mousedown
use the mousedown and mouseup events to change the background back and forth

4843252
int	boolean

4843253
dictionary	map
looking at the json string you posted response.groups.items looks to be an array containing one item a map dictionary containing one key categories. logging it out to a string is going to traverse the whole tree but to access it programmatically you have to walk the tree yourself

4843311
pow	math.h
there s no operator for power you ll need to use pow function from math.h or some other similar function

4843333
put	get
i think if i change the value of the â pythonpathâ define i ll get a python interpreter seeking his files in a relative directory so i ll just have to build it both for gnu linux and window and to put the both executables on a pen-drive then i ll get a portable python environment

4843349
qobject	qmetaobject
if it is complicated you could use qmetaobject facilities for reverse-engineering qobject at run-time

4843424
implements	extends
from a quick look into the sdk there is an oninfolistener interface which you can implements in a class extends mediaplayer

4843424
int	boolean
that needs you to have public boolean oninfo mediaplayer mp int what int extra implemented

4843444

you may jump out of these and a common use is to use a goto in place of a multi-level break

4843641
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i don t know for sure if this is the wrong approach but i would subclass the uitabbarcontroller sooner than the uinavigationcontroller

4843648
goto	break
goto has been in large replaced by specialized statements like continue break try...catch

4843648
goto	break
in the hard cases you can still exorcise the goto in nine out of ten cases you can break the code into smaller routines use try-finally use nested ifs test and retest a status variable or restructure a conditional

4843650
int	chars
because strcmp is slow but an int compare is fast if all your commands are 4 chars long - which happens to fit in a 32bit int - you can cast each string to a 32bit number and then switch based on that

logmein	hamachi
i have setup logmein hamachi and i can connect to an office machine and see shared resources folders and printers on that machine

4843750

post	get
1.3 quick checklist for choosing http get or post

4843966
post	get
however before the final decision to use http get or post please also consider considerations for sensitive data and practical considerations

4843966
post	get	post	put	put	get
note that there is not just get and post in the http protocol but a couple of other verbs like put head delete etc as well

4843978
post	get
if the user is logging in to a website that has effects on future requests so it should be a post not a get

4843978
post	get
it s easier to for the user to change query string get values but it s not too difficult for the user to change post values

4843978
post	get
using post for security isn t really a valid reason except for the fact that post variables aren t part of the url and aren t bookmarked while get variables are

4844105
width	height
change the value of width and height in childdiv based on your image

4844112

i think your best bet is to make several overloads of your parsing function one for each of the basic types int chars string etc. and then provide a generic one that has iconvertible as its generic constraint

4844188
gcov	lcov
i trying to use gcov and lcov for my c++ project

but when clicking the submit button the form is submission without any post data

4844214
margin	height
i don t know of a good way to put the treeview instance as a converterparameter googling converterparameter yields some interesting ideas on how to achieve this ... but i think your approach is wrong - instead of passing the entire tree view to the converter and then find treeviewitems by name why not pass the treeviewitem to the margin binding with a converter that will search the visual tree and find the required height

4844272
std	ostream
you are probably using friend becouse you saw code using that for the operator with std ostream but that cannot be a member becouse you would need to be a member function of std ostream

you can use nginx as reverse proxy with apache

4844628
apache	nginx
where nginx will handle static files and apache handle dynamic files

4844629
switching	screens
it s supposed to show the splash screens fade in a logo and then switching to another activity

content-length	content-type
the code there is bare minimum and it looks as if it does not set properly the content-type and content-length of the request

4844689
content-length	content-type
content-length is there so is the content-type and all the other fields

4844693
uiview	calayer
first of all i m not sure i agree with your linked answer i don t see how layers are a better approach than views given how uiview are basically just wrappers around a calayer designed to make life easier

4844696
google-chrome	safari
take a look at this thread safari and google-chrome back button changes hidden and submit values in forms

to the best of my knowledge the outputstream is not like a socket it is not directly connected to an inputstream on the server

4844959
awt	swing
i know java has a drawing api awt and swing - but probably no the best for the animation factor - on the other hand there is also flash that has new capabilities within as3 to produce such an effect but if this app was to traverse into mobile development flash wouldn t be a great choice

4844963
consistency	acid
3 b transactions b if you need to make transactions multi-step operations that need to act like they re one step you may have difficulties with many non-relational systems because they tend to sacrifice more than they strictly need to with respect to acid atomicity consistency isolation and durability

4844967
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if so make sure you get the case rightâ you don t want your app to be broken for people who run it from a case-sensitive volume nor do you want it to be broken for people who use the default case-insensitive file-system

4845122
outputstream	inputstream	system.in	system.out
what i need in java are inputstream and outputstream objects connected to these file-descriptors just like system.in system.out and system.error are connected to file-desctiptors 0 1 and 2

4845122
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
use new fileinputstream dev fd 3 and new fileoutputstream dev fd 4 to get the streams connected to the filedescriptors the paths are for freebsd replace with your operating systems paths

4845164
decoder	encoder
i suggest using as3corelib which is a library full of useful helper classes including a json encoder decoder

4845165
prng	random
assuming that r is a standard seeded prng function if r x is random then r x is also random since it is simply an alternate seed to your prng

4845168
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
i m pretty sure this can t be done using pure java -- you ll probably have to use native code to bind a file descriptor to a filedescriptor object or a fileinputstream or fileoutputstream object

4845187
folder	directory
i m writing a small ruby program to list directory differences between two folder locations

4845275

cruisecontrol	teamcity
my suggestion would be to use a build system like teamcity or cruisecontrol to pull the latest code from your source control build it and package it up as an msi

4845533
fflush	gets
you can periodically fflush all records under a certain rank say anyone ranking under 100 gets removed from the scores table to keep recomputations fast since nobody would ever climb in rank after being knocked down by a higher score

4845534

you could try jquery with fancybox or colorbox plugin

4845630
superclass	subclassing
let s see why superclass must be initialized before subclassing

4845630
superclass	subclassing
the static initializer of a superclass can cause some side effects that the compiler cannot see and the subclassing may depend on such side effects

your rpi function is using u16 unsigned short i guess as data type which is far too small for an integer with the value 42949672

4845822
salt	md5
i m asking this as i m using a form to log people in but i m also hashing their passwords with md5 together with a salt for verification

4845844
ssl	https
https is a protocol used to prevent watching the data being sent between you and the server by isps or public wifi hijackers and other cases it may not prevent a spyware on your server to read it to post data using ssl you only need to set the action attribute to a full https end url assuming you already installed an ssl certificate

4845844
salt	md5
about the md5 i believe that your combination of md5 and salt technique is fairly secure and it prevents hackers to easily find popular passwords if they gained access to your database

4845870
inherited	subclassing
will be inherited from the parent when you instantiate a subclassing so you simply need to use

4846049
int	boolean
essentially what i need to store are three things one string two int and maybe two boolean

4846055

portrait shows no ad landscape shows the ad as where expected - not stretched but the max width issue is well known and not a problem

4850556
portrait	landscape
i can click on the ads that appear in landscape but tapping the area they re meant to be in portrait does nothing

4850561
hash	salt
when a user enters their password it hash it using the salt in my core.php file

google-chrome	firefox
having tried a whole bunch of things to make the whole thing work in google-chrome firefox and ie i m getting close by initialising the scrollpane like this

4850627
google-chrome	firefox
the autoreinitialise fixes this in ie and google-chrome but there is a visible jump every time it reinitialises in firefox

4850661
globalization	localization
the best way to be 100 sure of the correct globalization as well as localization is to put all the checks in the code itself

4850710
width	height
flash player 9 only support 2880 px width and height

4850725
hash	md5
to write this code you can make an md5 hash according to an algorithm of your own so every user must have a key related to lets say his user name and email address that will unlock if the key is typed correctly

4850725
hash	md5
lets say if you have a user name muster and an email address mymail mail.web you can combine it in an algorith of your own simplest one for example is concatination mustermymail mail.web now encoding md5 hash to it will give a 32 char 9192ec1632022ab6b3706dc053d7b20f which forms a serial and this serial can t be decrypted unless you know the algorithm that it was encrypted first

4850725
hash	md5
to make an md5 hash value try this

4850742
textmate	sublimetext
textmate itself is mac-only but many other windows text editors support its bundle format like e and sublimetext

4850767
nsstring	nsxmlparser
void parser nsxmlparser theparser didendelement nsstring elementname

4850805
skip-lists	tree
re-balancing is costly you may consider a skip-lists also better for multi-threaded accesses or a splay tree

4850808
put	get
sorry - i couldn t figure out how to get this to put in line feeds

4850857
post	get
perhaps you would be better of just opening a new page and pass whatever paramters it needs either via a get post or server-side

4850865
getter	setter
do they have getter and or setter

4850876
hide	show
then you should use the visible property to show and hide the controls as needed

4850918
portrait	landscape
preview comes good in both mode landscape or portrait

4850967
swift	objective-c
download xcode free and learn objective-c or swift swift is easier to learn than objective-c

4850997
post	get
no but you can pass in some parameters through either a get or a post the first one would be the name of the action you want to execute and the other ones would be the parameters to pass in

4851050
h.264	webm
there re two types of video formats - uncompressed raw video formats like rgb or yuv or whatever else and compressed like h.264 or webm etc.

4851050
rar	zip
for analogy - think you have zip archive and you need to make it rar archive - first you ll unzip your file s and then compress by rar

dotnetzip	sharpziplib
both dotnetzip and sharpziplib support encrypting the contents of zips and are free

4851171
dbcontext	objectcontext
deleting is just wrapper around attach and set state to deleted - it is the only way how objectcontext wrapped in dbcontext can know that it has to delete object

4851199
appendto	each
appendto comes before the exisiting content but each new appended content comes before the previous append

4851219
getter	setter
with property and synthesize the getter and setter are created for you

4851244
apache	nginx
we re using is apache nginx django 1.0 and postgresql

4851310
put	get
but before i get ahead of myself is it possible therefore just to put all the nsfetchedresultscontroller stuff inside the entity managed object class

4851317
glut	glfw
instead of glut you should use the far superior glfw for which also excellent haskell bindings exist

4851333
inherited	properties
ccnodes and by inherited ccsprites have a userdata properties which is a void

4851337
accessor	properties	getter	setter
when i generated the accessor for this properties using eclipse ide it generates following getter and setter

4851364
google-chrome	firefox
and in google-chrome its picking up multiple embeds but not in firefox

4851381
int	chars
after n i want to read n lines which have an int and a chars

4851395
width	height
i need the height and the width of the image to do some pre-processing

4851450
fgets	fgetc
fgets or fgetc are faster as they don t need to drag the whole formatting variable argument list ballet of fscanf into the program

4851454
hide	show
as an alternative instead of creating and destroying the window every time you can use the showwindow call with sw_show and sw_hide to show and hide the popup

4851490
submit	submission
i am submission modal popup form after submit that form i want to load div on parent page that display submitted contents without refreshing whole parent page it works in ff but not in ie this is my code

4851541
move	drag
i found a way to cancel this last item move but if i drag and drop another item below this last item it gets move

4851552
int	double
you re explicitly converting the double to int what do you expect would happen

4851566
int	double
you are casting your double to an int which means it will remove any floating point precision

4851566
int	double
you need to update your updatefeed class expect a double instead of an int and then you don t need to do any casting

4851578
stateless	stateful
thus there are ways to externalize your application s session data or any stateful data which should really be kept to a design minimum in the restful stateless nature of the web from your web server and to another system

4851610
post	get
now each method can be annotated with requestmapping like in your case with a requestmethod atribute of requestmapping specifying whether to dispatch to the method in case of post or get

4851610
post	get
and you should be doing post to get the correct dispatch method

4851611
min	max
i assume here that table1.actual_intime corresponds to min cast table2.date + + table2.time as datetime and table1.actual_outtime to max ... which seems to agree with the description given

4851620
int	boolean
so depending on the actual type parameter for t this could be an array int or an array boolean or an array of some of the other primitive types in java or an array of some reference type

4851647
post	get
support for submit methods post and get as well as head delete ...

4851680
zoo	quantmod
i am trying for technical analysis with r using packages ttr quantmod zoo

4851683
fgets	strtol
you might get a little speed-up by replacing the fscanf call with fgets and then manually parsing the string with strtol to bypass the format-string parsing that fscanf has to do but don t expect any huge savings

4851717
post	get
all i m trying to do is get the number of the order in which the post is being displayed in the wordpress loop

4851762
getter	setter
you can demonstrate this yourself by creating a class in your ide and defining the private boolean active variable and then getting the ide to generate getter and setter

4851938
mouse	keyboard
how hard it is depends on how heavily your desktop app relies on a keyboard mouse and a large screen

4851986
width	height
i know i can get screen width height in a browser can i get any other information about the device

4851993
min	max
is the min and max memory of the server set on startup to values that help it perform better

4851995
hex	binary
the problem is that if i try to get the hex value of the test variable i only see 0a and infact on the other computer that receives the data i cannot convert back the binary data into a struct

4852004
post	get
you just need to allow the user to specify their openid provider s endpoint url via a form and get the value from the post

4852044
int	chars
what does int argc chars argv mean

4852081
width	height
your code fixed i ve replaced width and height constants with 300 just to get it to compile and commented out mouse handler registration

4852092
pascal	delphi
it has also made it easy to use the same code in delphi and free pascal with minimal changes.lately however i have begun to question this due to embarcadero s vauge statements on the evolution of delphi and it s upcomming safety model

4852148
width	height
i have a silverlight application that works but i now need to resize some items using a percentage instead of using fixed height and width

4852148
width	height
what i want the code to do is take the innertec and productlabel and calculate the height and width by first looking at the cellsize which is a variable set elsewhere and then create these objects with a percentage of cellsize

4852207
ant	maven
you might have an ant file that builds each site or maven

4852215
width	height
you can use star widths and height to define the proportional width and height of rows columns in order have grid cells which are some percentage of the overall grid

4852219
hex	binary
all the ways it s useless to encode your binary into hex

4852228
hide	show
when the user touch a button it calls an ibaction named refreshquestion which is supposed to show an image hover the screen to ask the user to wait a moment then it has to call another function and finally it has to hide the image

4852249
int	boolean
so my question is now given any built-in numerical type int short ... that is to be interpreted as a boolean value what is the your preferred way of actually storing that value into a variable of type bool

4852254
gif	png
the lines are jagged use a compression format suitable for line art jpeg is not suitable for line art gif and png are

4852254
gif	png
there are compression artifacts specify a less lossy jpeg level or use a lossless compression type like gif or png

4852354
mouse	keyboard
it gives you keyboard mouse events millisecond timers and some very basic window management

4852357
min	max
and you can give values to max and min in your xaml or where you create the validationrule

4852361
zoo	chron	zoo	xts	xts	chron
ttr functions use xts internally which allows them to handle most time-series classes xts zoo timeseries chron its irts fts etc. as well as data.frame matrix and numeric integer vectors

4852370
codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana	cakephp	kohana
because i was unsatisfied with the restrictive way any of the popular php frameworks codeigniter cakephp kohana processed requests as well as their size i wrote a framework that is designed for really only two purposes process a request and determine an action to take and then separate the code for that action from the view response

4852382
google-chrome	firefox
here is a sample that uses .ajax and works cross browser well google-chrome ie8 firefox 3.6

4852392
wildfly	glassfish
if you re already on servlet 3.1 el 3.0 tomcat 8 wildfly 8 glassfish 4 etc make use of new el 3.0 operator

4852392
jboss	glassfish
if you re only on servlet 3.0 el 2.2 tomcat 7 jboss 6 7 glassfish 3 etc make use of new el 2.2 ability to directly invoke methods such as string#concat

4852414
inherited	subclassing
3 class methods are inherited by subclassing

4852424
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
my scripts work under current versions of google-chrome and apple safari but firefox seems uncooperative

4852459
primefaces	richfaces
primefaces and richfaces have scrollable datatable components which fetches new rows by ajax

4852470
getter	setter
it contains all the properties of the person and getter setter method

4852472
jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket	tapestry	wicket
i m deciding between jsf 2.0 wicket and tapestry

4852504
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works fine in google-chrome safari and firefox even with the fallback player but in internet explorer i get the javascript error seen here

4852550
uiview	subviews
the nib file contains another uiview where all of the gui is laid out and then in the awakefromnib function of the widget this nib view is added to the widget itself as a subviews

4852562
rss	feed
for example i want to get to nsstring a content of rss feed from

4852594
rss	feed
i am having issues with a colleagues machine truncating xml while using nokogiri to parse a media rss feed

4852594
rss	feed
the feed is a standard media rss feed and the xml is not malformed

4852696
min	max
keysize0 min max step 384 16384 8

4852723
button	checkbox
for select boxes checkbox and radio button the event is fired immediately when the user makes a selection with the mouse but for the other element types the event is deferred until the element loses focus

4852768
post	get
i have tried from my malicious javascript running on another site to first do get of the page parse it and extract requestverificationtoken and then do a post

4852776
mdpi	hdpi
those densities are split equally between normal hdpi and normal mdpi

4852778
post	get
i m using jquery ui to post multiple values in a dialog to a php script but i cannot seem to get them posted

4852779
firefox	safari
i am finding that the tool-tip display is inconsistent when using safari and firefox

4852784
google-chrome	firefox
everything is working great on firefox and google-chrome category nodes use the specified folder.png and test case nodes use hlp.png as their icons

4852809
fflush	gets
useful information this cache gets merged with the database whenever fflush is called

4852825
post	put
you can put all your common methods and validations in the post model and specific ones in the other classes but all those classes will have access to each other s fields because they share the same table that s not a big problem though

4852876
versioning	upgrade
i don t know if you re able to upgrade to a newer versioning but your problem may have already been fixed

4852907
google-chrome	firefox
testing in google-chrome firefox if i add clear both to your tag

4852908
jar	war
depending on your requirements application-wide configuration files can be placed outside the jar war so that they can be modified without having to rebuild the jar

4852935
hash	md5
short way if its the same black image always - compare file byte by byte or md5 hash to a sample black image

4852944
xrange	enumerate
what is faster a for-loop using enumerate or using xrange

4852964
google-chrome	firefox
i noticed that in source code of transformed site both on google-chrome and firefox syntax is highlighted up to the closing head tag

4852977
postgresql	mysql
summarizing i think that what you need is just a single commit_on_success around process_post possibly supported by transaction savepoints - which unfortunately are available only in postgresql backend even though mysql 5.x supports them as well

4853036
int	double
it is not converting data into double but just using int binary data as double

4853095
int	double
you re taking a vector of int and telling it to use the raw bytes as double which isn t going to work right

4853097
uiview	subviews
the nib file contains a root vanilla uiview where all of the gui is laid out and then in the awakefromnib method of the widget this nib view is added to the widget itself as a subviews

4853117
multiplying	multiplication
in order for divide and conquer matrix multiplication to work it needs to be able to multiplying two potentially different matrixes together

4853171
google-chrome	firefox
i can use ie9 or the latest google-chrome of firefox

4853192
int	double
if you decide for whatever reason that you really need to use gsl it looks like you ll have to copy your array of int s to an array of double s first then use gsl on the result

4853211
cpu	processors
one ec2 compute unit provides the equivalent cpu capacity of a 1.0-1.2 ghz 2007 opteron or 2007 xeon processors

4853212
hash	md5
due to the difference in encoding between a jpg and gif the 2 will not have the same md5 hash

4853214
hash	md5
an md5 hash is of the actual binary data so different formats will have completely different binary data

4853214
hash	md5
so for md5 hash to match they must be identical files

4853218
hash	md5
md5 is a hash

4853279
oncreate	onstart	onresume	onpause
life cycle methods include oncreate onstart onresume onpause and onstop

4853279
oncreate	ondestroy
there s also ondestroy -- the complement to oncreate -- but i don t currently use it

4853279
onresume	onpause
these methods are called in response to various events like pressing the home button but what was important in my case was that minimizing the application calls onpause and maximizing it calls onresume

4853279
oncreate	ondestroy
hence i needed to call my set up and tear down methods from those locations and not for instance from oncreate and ondestroy

4853281
button	checkbox
i have some jquery checkbox button and they work fine

4853283
xrange	enumerate
for loops can use both enumerate and xrange at the same time though it would be silly

4853315
hash	md5
in otherwords comparing the on-disk bytes of the same image in two different format is pretty much guaranteed to produce two different md5 hash since the file s contents differ - even if the actual image is the same picture

4853341
hash	md5
md5 is a hash algorithm so it does not compare images but it compares data

4853366
google-chrome	firefox
this renders fine under ie8 firefox and google-chrome

4853388
put	get
here you get the request uri as in php the path and convert it to one line string and put in the before mentioned string statte var

4853447
fink	macports
see either what to do if libxml2 is being a jerk or if like me you prefer to build from source instead of using fink or macports use libxml from source

4853466
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome and firefox but it doesn t work on the iphone or ipad

4853478
post	get
i found another post which i m unable to find now that stated when using wcf to get the physical application path you should use hostingenvironment.applicationphysicalpath

4853552
rss	feed
im creating an rss feed for my site and going with this way of building it

4853576
super	implements	touchesbegan	touchesended
to implements these view changes i counter-intuitively put the display code in a touchesbegan withevent and z touchesended withevent before calling their respective super methods

4853576
touchesbegan	touchesended
one thing i m guessing is that the visual appearance of the buttons shouldn t be manipulated in the touchesbegan withevent and touchesended withevent but then where

4853623
tabcontrol	tabitem
this should let you recursively walk up until you find the tabitem then walk up to the tabcontrol from there

4853628
fadein	fadeout
here is a custom fadein fadeout fadeto to solve your problem

4853631
firefox	safari
this script works fine in ie firefox not in safari 5

4853646
width	height
inside oncreate you can grab an instance of display using getwindowmanager .getdefaultdisplay and query its width height and or rotation to decide if you want a title feature all before setting the content view

4853654
folder	directory
i m unaware of a plug-in macro or other tool that ll import a directory into an actual project with folder that mirror the file system s

4853725
public	protected
this is an abuse of inheritance to an extent but the advantages over a nested impl class are 1 you can access each member as name rather than data.name reducing code changes when refactoring and 2 though only sometimes desired you can promote individual members to protected or public without affecting other members

4853726
width	height
this should be all that s necessary if your layout doesn t have any controls that increase their height as width is constrained like wrapped label

4853732
jboss	weblogic
we use openejb on tomcat used to run on jboss weblogic etc.

4853734
hide	show
well if you are trying to dynamically show and hide it during the lifetime of the activity i am not sure if you can do that with the official window title due to the note that has been mentioned about window features needing to be set before setcontentview is called

4853734
hide	show
one thing that you could do is implement your own title bar and dynamically show and hide that.

4853734
hide	show
since when you change orientation your app goes through a set of lifecycle changes you have an opportunity in oncreate to show or hide your title

4853737
getter	setter
also assumed strlist was a public field otherwise it should be called strlist and have an appropriate getter setter as that would be following java conventions

4853738
vsto	add-in
i m trying to run an excel 2007 vsto 3.0 add-in we ve created

4853785
for-loop	loops
if you use file to read the file you can just use a counter inside a for-loop counting the number of iterations then when you need to go back to where loops stopped use that counter

4853805
setinterval	settimeout
it sounds like something is calling either setinterval or settimeout every time you

4853816
maven-install-plugin	maven-jar-plugin
once you ve disabled maven-jar-plugin maven-install-plugin may give you trouble too

4853817
codeigniter	pyrocms
pyrocms in my opinion the most well maintained and mature opensource and free cms for codeigniter

4853833
google-chrome	firefox
it looks exactly how i want it to and performs great in ie8 firefox google-chrome

4853835
inherited	properties
the call to the hasownproperty function is there to keep this code from iterating through properties present on obj that are actually inherited from the object prototype

4853850
vaadin	wicket
i would say wicket or vaadin

4853850
vaadin	wicket
wicket probably has more resources than vaadin

4853850
vaadin	wicket
this is only a guess and is not based on actual performance testing probably wicket will be doing better than vaadin

4853858
jdk1.6	jdk1.5
now in my systems has jdk1.5 but weblogic has jdk1.6 as well myeclipse supporting 1.5 only

4853900
mp3	ogg
if you ask people to compare between mp3 aac m4a mp4 and ogg - they will give you different answers

4853908
children	parent
this expects parent to always be populated before its children

4853915
qmenubar	qwidget
i was only able to do this by adding my qmenubar and custom widget to a new qwidget and using that as the menubar

4853919
put	get
first of all i would put this code in a helper so you get rid of all the tags and you clean the view then look if you can apply the case statement and latter remember maybe you can include line_of_code if condition or condition

4853974
post	get
i would suggest to find if you can post the image data to facebook maybe base64 encoded and use the phonegap api to get the base64 encoded content of the foto and post this directly to facebook

4853999
pull	push
i just want things as loose as possible as i feel it gives much more reliable code when i use kind of a push pull approach

4854019
post	get
for my scenario i need to get the current user id to keep track who has edit the blog post which i save the user id with before_save filter

4854079
width	height
i ve looked into creating a custom panel either to replace the grid or to contain the scrollviewer but at no point during the measureoverride arrangeoverride calls do i ever get a call which can tell me about the final width height of the grid row column i care about eg row 0 column 0

4854084
hash	md5
you can choose silverlight if you want to break files into smaller parts and you can consider md5 hash given inbuilt in silverlight

4854098
profiling	debugging
this works fine for debugging but does not seem to work for profiling

4854101
nunit	mstest
we did all the above with horrible mstest but you could use any testing framework i recommend nunit

4854106
direct3d	directx
the directx sdk has a section on accurately profiling direct3d performance which while not directly related to your question can supply some hints as to what is and is not expensive and in some cases why

4854106
fflush	gets
but essentially to try and directly answer your questions the reason the calls are expensive isn t that there is necessarily a lot of data to transfer but rather that there is a large body of work beyond just shipping data across the bus that gets deferred until the command buffer is fflush

4854199
freemarker	velocity
however it also provides support for alternative view layers such as freemarker velocity and even xslt urgh if you don t want to use jsp

4854211
screens	hdpi
so if you having one version of a picture in the drawable folder and another in the drawable-hdpi folder then the app will use the hdpi version if the device has a hdpi screens

4854243
udp	tcp
not sure but it might be using tcp udp port 445 like the net start stop command

4854276
cout	cin
so you remember that if you think cin as a keyboard and cout as a monitor what you type goes into the variable

4854279
postgresql	mysql
do postgresql or mysql have implicit row timestamps or version numbers which one could use instead

4854331
direct3d	direct2d
i m trying to render some geometry using direct2d rendering to a direct3d msaa surface but for large textures 5000x2500 i get strange results

4854335
cout	cin
in the case of cin and cout and other stream types and operators move values to and from streams

4854337
post	get
the difference with other post is that you can set get multiple bits using a mask field

4854364
button	checkbox
each is a product when checking the checkbox if there are options available and or an acknowledge checkbox to be acknowledged before form submit then keep the button hidden and show a div with another checkbox in it when that checkbox if exists is checked then show button

4854364
hide	show
the show hide on each div is working properly existing code so i am trying to create a function to be called within that function for the onclick event

4854368
move	drag
i d love to be able to drag joe s name into a different position without moving the time itself joe smith move 11 00 does not move

4854417
width	height
the tableviewers tables extend beyond the width and height of the composite that contains them and i am not able to view table columns beyond the right edge or rows of the bottom table that extend below the bottom of the composite

4854437
ienumerable	ilist
you could expose that ilist as an ienumerable

4854480
post	get
the issue we are seeing is that when a user s session is timed out between bringing up a get form and hitting the save button that does a post they are sent to the login page but spring is saving the original post information in the session

multicastdelegate	delegation
one could simply use a multicastdelegate rather than a list of delegation but in some circumstances like object cleanup an exception thrown from one cleanup operation should probably not disrupt the operation of others

4854641
multicastdelegate	delegation
while one could assemble the collection of cleanup operations using a multicastdelegate and then use getinvocationlist to run each within a separate try-catch block it would be easier and more efficient to simply use a list of delegation from the get-go

another option i had in mind was to actually load separate forms for each element and show hide them as needed while editing and then use ajax to save them

4855212

4855902
antialiasing	transparent
graphically speaking double-buffering can be a double-edged sword in some cases low-key graphics it can be beneficial to turn it off but if you have more advanced renderings gradients transparent bitmaps scaled bitmaps fancy fonts antialiasing lines etc. you can get better looks and speed with double-buffering as a slight lag can be better than interactive drawing with flickering

4856234
post	put
if you re only worried about the standard routes interfering like edit simply put your match statement after your resources post

4856264
width	height
if you do you will be able to take the advantage of html canvas property which is that if you change the width height of canvas with css the canvas will behave like an image so you could set every element to be 20 shorter

4856264
width	height
though you d have to run javascript on it as if you d like it to stay same width you d have to set the width to be exact same value before applying the shorter height

4856264
width	height
if you d omit this bit you d scale the canvas in both height and width

i just thought of another one your externalinterface call could have any object s bounds as parameters which you could then use to superimpose an empty transparent gif or png with the appropriate title via javascript

4856741
mouseover	mouseout
the drawback would be that you d have to have a back channel to forward mouse events and change the behavior of your flash controls to ensure your ui works correctly mouseover and mouseout would no longer work as expected once the image is on top of the flash player

this handling events page says that if the contents of the page change during a mousemove event the rest of the events in the chain including mouseup are not sent

4856785
disk	ram
modern systems have quite fast disk subsystems reasonably good i o schedulers and large enough ram capacities to allow for extensive data caching which makes it quite unlikely that a single writer reader combination would saturate the disk subsystem unless you are doing something unusual like recording several video streams at once

hide	show
i ve tried various combinations of hide and show invalidate update etc

4857206
int	double
it will have to figure out that double y will always be an int easy and then understand the mathematical range of sqrt for the set of int hard

4857206
math.h	sqrt
a very sophisticated compiler might be able to do this for the sqrt function or for every function in math.h or for any fixed-input function whose domain it can figure out

4857208
filesystems	xfs
if you use the xfs filesystems on top of the ebs volume then you can tell xfs to freeze the filesystems so no updates happen then call the ec2 api to snapshot the volume then unfreeze the filesystems

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
when you re dealing with layers upon layers of uiviewcontroller and uinavigationcontroller you have to be very careful to dismiss them in the reverse order you presented them

4857846
google-chrome	firefox
whenever i drop multiple files folders into the browser google-chrome will filter out the folders and firefox will return 0 for .size so it s trivial to protect against those cases

4857849

4858639
int	chars
how can you implement the function tolower which is int tolower chars

4858675

4858882
width	height
rather than set the height and width set the coordinates and have the position fixed

4858893
spaces	delimiter
a better way of doing this would be to separate out the handling of database results from the view output logic and then you can sidestep the issue all together using implode to allow php to join each of your authors together into a single string split by your delimiter of a comma and a spaces

4858937
linefeed	delimiter
i know line feeds in foxpro are chr 10 + chr 13 but when creating an import record comma delimiter i need to imbed the linefeed into the field when i add the chr 10 + chr 13 into the .txt file it puts an actual linefeed into the import record rather than being embeded

4858949

use it as the table s column model and then ask it to hide show the columns you want

4858958
vim	emacs

what i surmise from this is that i can put in the extra effort to manually compile each and every extension i want but i cannot get the extensions to compile in directly

4859248
profiling	benchmarking
but to get a general understanding about costs you have to use a profiling or a benchmarking

4859446
free	malloc
and allocation performance is not a trivial component of overall performance -- benchmarks show that many real-world c and c++ programs such as perl and ghostscript spend 20 to 30 percent of their total execution time in malloc and free -- far more than the allocation and garbage collection overhead of a healthy java application

4859600

rss	feed
i never really set up twitter for my facebook account but when the official tool doesn t work properly i would suggest you to use the notes application on facebook to feed an rss feed to your wall

4860502
rss	feed
twitter gives every not locked twitter account an rss feed which contains it s tweet and one for the tweets the user favorites

4860549
boost	allocator
note i am intentionally not using smart pointers like boost shared_ptr because the c library handles all of the memory allocator deallocation etc and since i dont know when the lua garbage collector kick in all of the wrapper classes i expose to lua via tolua++ contain raw c style pointers as private members

4860550
int	chars
what do you need to do to clean up an int or chars not a pointer

4860563
gridview	rowdatabound
i think on particular button click it will not change you can only change by writing the required code in gridview rowdatabound event

4860601
int	chars
you don t have to overwrite int or chars arrays unless you really care that data store in them can be somehow used to obtain sensitive data like passwords from your program

4860607
width	height
img src width 400px height 303px align center alt

4860613
int	chars
there is no particular cleanup required for int or chars data

4860613
int	chars	free	malloc
int and chars data on the heap - from new or malloc - may be deallocated using delete or free but again the old content is just left in memory until some further new or malloc reuses that memory

4860655
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
my application contains a uitabbarcontroller and a uinavigationcontroller

4860705

4860810
std	ostream
because when you pass a to std ostream it will print the c-style ie char array string it points to

4860816
int	chars
this is probably because you have 32-bit int then an 8-bit chars then the compiler chooses to insert 3 more 8-bit chars so that the string object will be aligned at a 32-bit word boundary

4860845
int	chars
this is why an int followed by a chars will take 8 bytes in the structure so the string member is at offset 8

4860866
inherited	subclassing
in particular it only stops creation of a __dict__ if your class inherited from a base class that does not have a __dict__ such as object and even then it won t stop __dict__ being allocated in any subclassing unless they also define __slots__

4860895
int	double
you should parse it to double first and then cast it to int

4860914
int	double
you can use the double.parsedouble method to first cast it to double and afterwards cast the double to int by putting int in front of it

4860957
int	double
however since you re not interested in the decimal component you can safely drop it by just casting the double to an int

4860976
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you probably need to retain the objects you create for uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller

imperative	declarative
should we use declarative datasource controls with entity framework or go with the data access linq to entities imperative class library as we used to do with windows forms

4861725
fileinputstream	filechannel
the next step for you is either to read the whole file in a byte array or to create a filechannel from a fileinputstream then mmap it and read from the resulting mmaped bytebuffer using .getfloat

4861733
free	malloc
when you manage memory you do malloc and free a lot of time

4861757
put	get
but now what does not make sense to me anymore is what arguments the put or get methods will accept return

4861769
imperative	declarative
the 2 major programming paradigms are the declarative paradigm where the programmer writes down abstract relations thus telling the compiler what he wants and the imperative paradigm where the programmer writes down algorithms thus telling the computer how to get what he wants

4861769
imperative	declarative
an example for a declarative language would be prolog an example for an imperative language would be fortran and real programmer can write fortran programs in any language

4861769
imperative	declarative
as an example for code which is imperative and declarative at the same time consider this implementation of the fibonnaci-sequence in perl6

4861769
put	get
in practice you often use functions imperatively - you put in an input value to get out an output value

4861771
arp	udp
if my machine sent a udp broadcast message to network 0.0.0.0 24 in other words udp broadcast sent to 0.0.0.255 then my machine would forward the packet to the gateway machine which it can look up via arp

4862029
int	double
array of int double are considered as blittable types types that have same layout in managed unmanaged worlds - these are typically get pinned when marshalled

4862043
hide	show
you could work a jquery if statement and say if window.width was more than the width of your content show the scrollbar if not then hide it

4862080
inherited	subclassing
this way if the class is subclassing and the rectangleofcolor message is received by a subclassing the instance returned will be the same type as the subclassing for example the array method of nsarray is inherited by nsmutablearray

4862083
subnet	packets
it sounds as if your configuration application is listening for broadcast packets on all network interfaces and expecting to receive packets from foreign subnet

4862083
subnet	packets
that should not work - the os should only pass-on broadcast packets from the subnet each network interface is on not from all subnet on the same physical ethernet segment

4862412
illegalargumentexception	unchecked-exception
and java.text.format is supposed to convert an arbitrary object to string but for some reason it throws an unchecked-exception illegalargumentexception if the object to be converted is somehow wrong type null so in practice you must remember to write a try-catch block whenever you use format

4862412
try-catch	exception-handling
if i was a language designer i would make all exception-handling checked but instead of a try-catch -block one could use a plain annotation to say i don t care about this exception-handling which essentially would convert that checked exception-handling into a runtime exception-handling

4862412
try-catch	exception-handling
this would give the benefits of checked exception-handling nothing goes unnoticed unless explicitly told so and the benefits of unchecked exception-handling no heavy try-catch blocks all around

4862413
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception	illegalargumentexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception are used for programming errors such as nullpointerexception illegalargumentexception etc

4864037
many-to-one	one-to-many
first of all the list of projects associated with a particular userid doesn t make sense since you have one-to-many many-to-one relation so that each user can be associated with no more than one project

4864047
accessor	properties	getter	setter
properties are logically equivalent with getter setter method pairs whatever you can do with a with a you can do with a getname setname pair and vice versa especially as c# has getter and setter accessor so we can play with the accessibility too

4864047
public	protected
but there are some folks that feel that public or protected properties are a bit like cheating from an oop perspective especially if all that the property does is just expose a backing field

4864047
getter	setter
when i use getter and setter method no such distiction is immediately obvious

4864056

solution is take each digit that is 1 subtract one and multiplying by 9 for each digit that appears after it

4864181
multiplying	add
we can prove this easily there are f n numbers that are less than n then multiplying these by 10 and add in each of the digits 0 and 2-9 at the end 9 different digits

4864181
subtract	add
to get the number that do subtract this from n and add 1 if our number itself contains a 1

4864181
subtract	add
subtract 80 from 99 to give us 19 and do not add 1 as 99 does not contain a 1

4864266
teamcity	ncover
ncover is extra options to the nunit-launcher of teamcity so i hope this is as simple as just enabling that when i get that far

4864274
google-chrome	firefox
if you re using a modern browser ie 8+ google-chrome firefox why don t you use html 5 local storage

4864385
google-chrome	safari
the first time we view it with google-chrome and safari the images are zoomed in and have scrollbars

4864385
google-chrome	safari
how can we fix this so that the images are displayed with their correct sizes the first time viewed in google-chrome and safari

4864465
width	height
the main thing i wanted to check was that the ratio check will prevent and from ever being larger than the original width height as this would break it but i don t think it will

4864477
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
my browser was caching clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml

4864486
post	get
again m attaches k not timeout to the get or post request to h

4864539
google-chrome	safari
the problem is unique to safari not webkit so google-chrome is fine

4864599
subtraction	addition
for example when doing finite field arithmetic under rijndael s finite field you can based on the knowledge that the characteristic polynomial is 2 with 8 terms assume that your integers are of size uint8_t and that addition subtraction are equivalent to xor operations

4864599
subtract	add
well basically if you add or subtract two elements of the polynomial they contain either zero or one

4864703
jboss	glassfish
jboss is comparable with glassfish and others

4864703

obviously a way to simplify this would be to query all threads a user has posted a message in and then send a separate query for each one to get the most recently added post info

4864949
innodb	myisam
with innodb the size of the combined index would be roughly the size of col1 plus the size of col2 plus the size of the table s primary key or 4 bytes if using myisam

4864949
innodb	myisam
with innodb or myisam the combined index should be smaller than two separate indexes since with two separate indexes the primary key or 4 byte row pointer would be included twice once in each index

4864975
udp	tcp
if you don t need the sequence control and reliability of tcp you could consider to use udp to send short messages

4865003
portrait	landscape
using a combination of html and js how could i detect whether a device is in landscape or portrait and then change the size of an embedded video accordingly

4865003

width	height
the problem is only after the onload fires does the browser know the actual width and height of the image available through this.width this.height if not bonund to class scope

4865065
width	height
the onload here should be what injects the image into the container and sets width and height to host it

udp	tcp
but if i were you i would consider using udp instead of tcp

4865274
udp	tcp
on most embedded systems i ve worked with using tcp several different stacks udp is lighter-weight outperforms tcp in terms of code size throughput

4865274
udp	tcp
there are times when the benefits of tcp justify the overhead but from what you ve written i think you should consider a basic udp datagram set up

4865275
accessor	properties
the properties is not synthesized but using a simple accessor i can write

4865690
int	chars
i agree that a chars is just as handy since you can always cast to int to answer your question as to why this is happening when a cin input is exected as an int but a chars is entered the input is kept in the input stream for the duration of the loop which is why it seems to disappear.

4865721
vaadin	wicket

4867830
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
apache like all the alternatives lighttpd or nginx is multi-threaded

4867870
nsoperation	nsnotification
the nsoperation sends the nsnotification on the secondary thread to my uitableviewcontroller - this causes the delay

4867913
width	height
i would reference the window height and width in javascript

4867913
width	height
then size the video width to 100 and grab the actual pixels of the width of the video in javascript then divide the width by the ratio wanted to get the height

4867937

4867988
packets	pcap
but when i use pcap to send packets with no ether_head and no ip header

4868006
wan	lan
if you re using host headers you can modify this approach so that the site remains internally accessible over your lan wan while the maintenance site is handling external requests

4868069
nunit	moq
i am using nunit and moq latest versions

4868105
gridview	rowdatabound

4868213
apache	nginx
my webapp run on apache while i m serving the static files from nginx

4868216
getter	setter
they manage getter and setter code for you so you don t have to think about these questions

4868223
for-loop	arrays
to do that i was going to use a simple for-loop starting from the 3rd value in the arrays to the sizeof myarray

4868233
division	modulo
you can achieve the result wanted by using modulo and integer division

4868234
submit	submission

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have a facebook iframe application that works perfectly in ie6 8 safari google-chrome firefox etc

4868279
memset	malloc
then i added a memset after the malloc and it brought the number of allocations down to 120 which makes much more sense

4868284
sorting	filtering
so to me anything to do with sorting and filtering the data should absolutely be done in the model as should the process of extracting albums from a list of songs

4868335
memset	malloc
it requests memory from the os kernel but the request is not satisfied until the memory is written to with memset . this allows for greater efficiency in the system s memory management but it can result in misleading malloc behaviour

4868394
int	double
if your data type is a native data type int int32 long decimal double or float you can do the operations you have

4868461
google-chrome	firefox
the idea is for this to be very similar to google-chrome or firefox s quick find

4868484
jar	war
normally you probably want to compile and package your java app into a jar or war and then transfer that up to your ec2 server

4868484
vmware	virtualbox
if you don t have a spare desktop lying around you can use one of the virtual machine products like vmware or sun s virtualbox and build a server instance on one of those

4868514
width	height
this is absolutely positioned at 0 0 with 100 width and height and a z-index of 100 this has to be higher than anything else on the page

4868539
public	protected
derived classes also have protected ctors and a public static method the named constructor pattern to create instances

4868595
uitableview	reloaddata
if you are doing lazy loading of the frc then kill the frc and call reloaddata on the uitableview to get the new frc with the new predicates sort descriptors to be used

4868607
base-class	derived-class
a when someone will delete a derived-class object via a base-class pointer

4868624

if you can use tomcat as your server - you might want to try amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk it will greatly simplify your task by providing an easy instance of tomcat to deploy

4868638
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk is an even

4868662
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
your best option is to create a uiviewcontroller then add a uisegmentedcontrol then a uitableview

4868674
hide	show
i would love to be able to hide the results row and just show the question and the average while hiding all of the individual responses

4868674
hide	show
my hope is to hide the information between tablestart and tableend so i can show a question and the average without the individual responses displaying

4868681
post	get
if you post such questions to our list you ll surely get support within a few hours

4868707
awt	swing
neither jfreecharts nor jopenchart has not been ported to android as far as i know and will not work on an android as-is not will any other awt swing based api due to differences in their respective canvases etc

4868709
subtract	add
php s datetime class has the two methods add and sub to add or subtract a time span from a datetime object

4868712
inherited	properties
given the following xaml markup i would expect the text in the hyperlink to turn orange when i mouse over it since i am setting a foreground colour on its parent control and it should filter down by properties value inherited

4868757
openbsd	freebsd
i also found that freebsd has a pthread_np.h header that defines pthread_main_np so this should work on freebsd too 8.1 at least and openbsd 4.8 at least has pthread_main_np defined in pthread.h too

4868757
openbsd	freebsd
so basically you should be able to do it directly on mac os x freebsd and openbsd

4868757
solaris	netbsd
you can use the tid 1 approach on netbsd and solaris

4868770
pop-up	dialog
the following code works to pop-up the confirmation dialog for my app to access twitter but i am unsure of what to pass in as the authenticationtype

you can use standard ones like 3des aes blowfish and so forth for this

4868915
hash	md5
using md5 hash on a string in cocoa

4868923
width	height
i would approach this by binding the visibility property of your controls to the width or height depending on your layout of the window via a converter

4868930
jruby	mri
if you are going back and forth between jruby and mri you can add something like this to your gemfile too

4868932
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

4869034
pop-up	dialog
and the dialog pop-up

4869054
hide	show
i am trying to create a uitableview that is set up so that when i click on a section it hide the rows from the previous section and show the rows of the newly selected section

4869100

i love firephp and i ve been using it for a while but they ve put out this massive upgrade and i m completely flummoxed trying to get it to work

4869145
jquery	curvycorners
the jquery plugin i would recommend is curvycorners it does not require you to change anything

4869214
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i would use google-chrome and it s excellent developer tools for this or another browser like opera or firefox with similar capabilities

4869233
equals	gethashcode	referenceequals	gethashcode
you changed pk which doesn t affect the outcome of equals because you have that referenceequals check in there but the result of your gethashcode does change

4869233
equals	gethashcode
taking the more conceptual approach i think you can look at it like this if you have overridden the equals and gethashcode behavior for your type then you ve taken ownership of the concept of what it means for one instance of this type to be equals to another

4869235
folder	directory
i m in a similar boat and i have two folder in my home directory projects and reference

4869363
client-side	server-side
or is there a cleaner way to have the client-side web page ask the web server to run a server-side executable without reloading the web page

4869398
outputstream	inputstream
otherwise bring a httpservlet in between which gets an inputstream of the desired resource and writes it to the outputstream of the response

4869424
uiview	subviews
so far i ve created uiviewcontroller controller with xib file and in viewdidload method of view controller from the template i create that custom view controller instance and add it s view as a subviews of that empty uiview added in interface builder the same you would change class in programmatic approach

4869471

i have some django code that runs fine on a sqlite database or on a mysql database but it runs into problems with postgresql and it s making me crazy that no one has has this issue before

4869577
x86	64bit
it s a pointer sized to the native word length ie 32-bit pointer on x86 64bit pointer on x64

4869578
children	parent
next if you change it to children it would then be a local variable but you need an instance variable for the instance of the definition of the parent class so you need to use children

4869611
hash	md5
my script compares 2 source trees creates a map of possible changed files compares md5 hash and creates a diff-package

4869644
put	get
i already have the xml reader working but when i put the xml into my code it returns with no data which is what i told it to do if it can t get any data from the xml

4869682
mouseover	mouseout
presumably this is because it s triggering the mouseout event of the item box when details gets displayed but immediately triggering the mouseover event again when the details box is hidden

4869685
base	fractions
in that context it makes no sense to move from the base pointer up some fractions of the size of an object

4869720
floating-point	integer
if you want to use a floating-point number as an array index you need to cast it to an integer

4869721
post	get
is there a way in javascript to get it to do a get reload and not prompt the user to resubmit the post data

4869745
wan	lan
compare in fiddler content length of default.aspx accessed via lan and wan to make sure that it is not altered

4869764

4869790
regasm	gacutil
when you use gacutil to install an assembly to the gac do you also need to register it with regasm

4869804
pull	push
i will say that in general if i have different views of the same data like in your case i will use commands to push out the data but if a view just gets a data update i will often have the view just pull the data from a proxy

4869815
maven	pom.xml
to get my project into eclipse i can choose file- import- maven and then i get all the maven projects imported and can build fine or i can choose file- import- git and make a new project that ignores the pom.xml and does not generate the project properly

4869830
mouseout	mouseleave
that way the pointer is still in the correct item when it s over the details div and mouseout isn t sent until the mouseleave both divs

4869854
getter	setter
ps yes i suppose the helloworld class should have getter and setter but it works just fine that way and makes the example shorter

4869860
daemons	launchd
when this function is called the terminal becomes so sluggish that i have to launchd a seperate shell and kill the daemons with top to get a responsive prompt back

4869865
width	height
i tried giving the div that has a set width and height overflow hidden

4869871
width	height
i have a class called room.h room.m which basically takes dimensions generated in the app for width and height of the room

4869901
width	height
putting the image in a with fixed height and width and overflow hidden most definitely will crop an included

4869920
stdout	stderr
daemon processes should not take input via stdin or deliver output to stdout stderr

4869935
public	protected	ivar	subclassing
i am hoping for some clarification on how private vs protected vs public works with respect to class members when programming in objective-c - i thought i knew the difference i ve added some comments to my parent class person with respect to the same but the fact that the compiler did not complain when i tried to access a private ivar member of a parent class via the subclassing now has me confused

4869935
getter	setter
or by using property synthesize the setter and getter methods have i essentially made that member protected and therefore accessible to the subclass

4869937
stdout	stderr
all programs including daemons are entitled to assume that stdin stdout and stderr are appropriately opened file streams

4869937
stdout	stderr
if the code was written to survive without standard output or standard error for example it opens a standard log channel or perhaps uses syslog 3 then it may be appropriate to close stdout and stderr

4869937
stdout	stderr
alternatively you can redirect both stdout and stderr to a log file - beware continuously growing log files

4869941
spy++	sendmessage
hey guys i am trying to send a message to a game to automate text commands the problem is that i can t figure out how to use the information from spy++ to write a c# sendmessage function

4869944
interbase	bde
i am trying to connect to a interbase db at runtime via the bde

4869967
getter	setter
your properties generate public getter and setter methods

4869981
hide	show
the second function translates a checkbox change into a hide show event

4870040
put	get
how are you doing the get and put requests

4870186
apache	nginx
nginx should be the first one serving requests and pass back to apache django the non-static ones

4870204
put	get
if i start with i get a list of all products regardless of what keywords i put in

4870220
for-loop	arrays
the answer thus has to make use of the fact that we only return at most sqrt x items and the only other answer i have so far is doing a for-loop search for the minimum element in the arrays removing the minimum from the arrays stashing it in a new arrays say b and repeating the process on the now smaller modified version of a of length x-1 which gives us running time like so

4870220
for-loop	arrays
that counts the number of for-loop iteration of the min-search and gives us at most y or sqrt x iterations in the worst case scenario and there are at most x items in the arrays

4870230
google-chrome	safari
it uses webkit engine used in google-chrome safari etc. and it is very easy to use

4870232
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png	tiff	bmp	tiff	png
i would like to be able to accept bmp gif jpeg and png and maybe one or two others like tiff formats

4870250
nsurl	nsdata
if you know the url of the xml document you can use nsdata datawithcontentsofurl nsurl url

4870270
google-chrome	safari
it uses webkit engine used by safari google-chrome browsers and it is very easy to use

4870276
google-chrome	safari
it uses webkit engine used by safari google-chrome browsers and it is very easy to use

4870290
int	chars
what i am trying to do is use the atoi function to convert two chars chunks of the string into int

4870293
postgresql	mysql
i tested the same query in postgresql and mysql and it worked as i expected it returned 2

4870304
getter	setter
but in the class extension as readwrite which allows your .m to modify the value using the getter setter

4870313
google-chrome	safari
it uses webkit engine used by safari google-chrome browsers and it is very easy to use

4870322
portrait	landscape
this defines whether the printing will be portrait or landscape

4870368
disk	ram
many transactional databases forces some writes from the local ram buffers back to disk by issuing a sync operation

4870368
fflush	gets
all the data related to a single file gets fflush back to the magnetic plates or flash cells effectively ensuring that on power failure no data will be lost

4870381
int	chars
edit to understand the computing bit you ve got to understand that ascii chars printable the ones you store on strings don t correspond to their int counterparts

4870381
int	chars	multiplying	subtract
by multiplying the first chars by ten and adding the first chars you re summing the ascii values not the int ones so you ve got to subtract the bias

4870381
multiplying	subtract
subtract 0 the base number for ascii would work for one character ascii 2 - ascii 0 2 but you ve got to multiplying it by 11 for two characters

4870388
single-quotes	backslash
you should either use single-quotes to initialize the string or escape the dollar sign with a backslash like you did in the regex

4870401
post	get	twitter	bit.ly
my idea solution would be for the handler to make an async call to bitly bit.ly get the result then post to twitter and facebook at the same time on different threads as they are independent of each other

4870410
octal	decimal
you could also use octal escapes o047 that s a lower-case oh or decimal escapes d39

4870424
jpopupmenu	jmenuitem
i used the jmenuitem and jpopupmenu and i m getting this npe

4870432
daemons	systemd
i would write a daemons that manages the unmount remount on behalf of all of the processes on the systemd

4870465
jquery	simplemodal
so i want my users to be able to click a link in a simplemodal jquery box and have it close the current modal box and open a new one with new content

4870472
gridview	objectdatasource
ps iam using objectdatasource to bind my gridview control

4870487
superfish	hoverintent
have a look at the superfish jquery plugin it just adds some fancy animation and hoverintent support to a standard suckerfish css menu system

4870493
zoo	xts
packages such as zoo or xts use these types for indexing

4870524
int	double
you need to cast your altitude to an int first or use a double f formatter

4870547
width	margin
the key to working out what you ll want to do is understanding exactly what clientwidth and offsetwidth measure and that the css width of an element is its content area and excludes any margin border and padding defined on it see the w3c box model here

4870592
qcombobox	qabstractlistmodel
i have extended my own qabstractlistmodel to change the background color of qcombobox

4870611
direct3d	directdraw
the goal is smooth and low cpu video playback as much as direct3d directdraw video rendering in c++ programming

4870611
directx	direct2d
i tried direct2d with windowsapicodepack to render video and the result is cpu usage is pretty low but the problem is that i have no way to render video smoothly since there s no accurate timer to update video at exact time like directx in c++

4870611
direct3d	directx
maybe i need to go back to c++ world to use direct3d natively and hosting c++ with directx window in c# wpf window

4870649
spy++	sendmessage
what spy++ is showing you is the parameters that were sent to sendmessage

4870664
children	parent
i d probably approach the problem by adding a class to the hovered item to modify its behavior when you disable child elements as css won t let you set styles on a parent object based on properties of their children

4870713
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
when displaying greek symbols with for example i get very different results in google-chrome and safari versus firefox

4870713
webkit	gecko
is there a way to get webkit to render the letters closer to gecko s style which i much prefer here

4870803
postgresql	mysql
your select will work same in postgresql like mysql

4870804
google-chrome	safari
mozila google-chrome and safari have implemented

4870815
firefox	safari
i would guess that firefox is using the symbol font whereas safari is using whichever unicode font has the right characters

4870820
junit	testng
junit testng and spock are all reasonable choices for writing not just unit tests in groovy

4870834
post	put
after i create a book i put this code into my post book id 2 this works fine if i just place it in my post but all of the other content of the page is entered via custom post so this needs to be as well so it flows inline with the structure of the document

4870885
put	get
i understand that the propertynames correspond with the propertyvaluestrings but why don t these get put into seperate columns in the profile table

4870905
multiplying	multiplication
now quaternion-vector multiplication is as simple as converting a vector into a quaternion by setting and leaving x y and z the same and then multiplying

4870905
multiplying	multiplication
then multiplying the two quaternions distributing out the terms and rearranging them based on the results of each of the 16 multiplication

4870925
width	height
so i have a div with a set width and height and i want the content inside to slide automatically without hover or interaction from the user after like so many seconds to reveal different content

4870927
inherited	subclassing
to clarify what i meant my subclassing i was not referring to inherited but rather structure

4870930
base-class	subclassing
i have an abstract base-class to enforce some subclassing to overload the operator

4870948
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
yes all the uiviewcontroller make use of the same uinavigationcontroller

4871026
udp	tcp
there is really no long user actions or any other activity takes a long time just lots of tcp or udp packets being received that require the screen display to be updated

4871043
getter	setter
the difference is that if you declare property then you can implement using synthesize which auto-codes your getter setter for you

4871043
getter	setter
if you declare an instance variable and do not specify a corresponding property then you cannot use synthesize and must write your own getter setter

4871043
getter	setter
you can always override the auto-coded getter setter by specifying your own

4871047
implements	extends
i should add that this line is part of an app that uses rmi and part of a class which extends unicastremoteobject and implements a remoteinterface.i specify that because i am under the impression that a nullpointerexception can occur when you deal with synchronization even if nothing is realy null maybe when something is locked and i deal with synchronization in this app.the method that contains the line though is not synchronized and nowhere in my code i try to use the array as a monitor i only have some synchronized methods no smaller synchronized blocks so i nowhere choose a specific monitor explicitly

4871117
maven	pom.xml
if this does not work you could update your question with the full stacktrace specifying the exact line that maven fails to validate the pom.xml

4871137
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
after testing a small site that i built for my school in firefox seamonkey google-chrome opera safari camino and ie8 i found that my site s absolutely positioned divs were all pretty consistant

4871170
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you have 2 basic options for your base controller uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller

4871170
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you can put a uinavigationcontroller inside a uitabbarcontroller but not the other way around

4871170
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if you have a uitabbarcontroller the easiest thing to do is to assign different view controllers uiviewcontroller subclasses to each tab

4871170
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
meaning that you could push the same view controller on a uinavigationcontroller or set it as a tab on a uitabbarcontroller or present it modally

4871228
firefox	safari
alternatively if you don t have to use safari you could use firefox with the firefox throttle plugin

4871290
x86	64bit
the jet oledb only supports x86 32 bit os and not x64 64bit

4871295
listview	gridview
on postback the itemdatabound event no longer exists and therefore the gridview events do not exists since its contained in the itemdatabound event of the listview

4871300
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
logic belongs in viewwillappear called before the transition animation starts when the view has no parent yet and viewdidappear called after the animation when the view is fully visible. loadview is called once when your vc thinks the view will shortly be needed and isn t called again unless a low-memory condition dumps the view and it needs recreating

the vala language compiler can handle a very different looking syntax genie which arguably could be considered a different language or an alternative syntax for one language

4880911
vala	genie
afik anything you can do in vala you can write in genie ignoring work-in-progress details bugs to the delight of anyone who doesn t like curly brackets

use setinterval instead of settimeout and your problems should be resolved

4880989

from a physical standpoint in sql server an int key will take up more than twice as much space as a chars 2 or chars 3

4881890
post	get	post	put	put	get
understanding rest means understanding http methods get post put delete ...head

4881890
post	get	post	put	put	get
the key to make such an api simple is to have your server provide a restful service and your entities holding the required attributes datecreated datelastmodified etc. so you can create requests easily done with asihttprequest be they get put post delete and add the appropriate http-headers for a conditional get if-modified-since

4881900
pull	push
make a separate branch with only the changes you want to push back to torque3d and then pull from that branch into the torque3d repo

4881931
free	malloc
returning anything allocated with malloc is fine as long as whoever uses your function takes care of free ing it when they re done

4881937
int	chars
however googling lead me to determine that the return value of printf is an int of the number of chars s output not a chars of the chars themselves as i had hoped

4881940
free	malloc
you can certainly return an array allocated with malloc but you have to make sure the caller of the function eventually releases the array with free

4881940
free	malloc
if you don t free a malloc d array the memory remains in use until program exit

4881958
asterisk	freeswitch

4881994
superclass	subclassing
can a superclass variable be assigned any subclassing variable

4882002
superclass	subclassing
you can assign a subclassing instance to a superclass variable

4882003
superclass	subclassing
where a is a subclassing b is a superclass and c is an interface that a implements

4882003
superclass	subclassing
a subclassing can be cast upwards to any superclass

4882003
superclass	subclassing
a superclass cannot be cast downwards to any subclassing this is unreasonable because subclassing might have capabilities a superclass does not

4882012
min	max
a min max width can be specified in the format picture string with the format min-max

4882027
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
you could use nsdatecomponents and nscalendar

4882069
uiview	calayer
is calayer better than uiview in terms of performance

4882098
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if there is no direct method for that then since uitabbarcontroller is a subclass of uiviewcontroller you can access its view size and get the difference of its tabbar frame size

4882124
implements	extends
in order for that assignment to be legal classa has to extends or implements interfaceb

4882183
printf	strncpy
this is what functions such as printf and strncpy do

4882257
folder	directory
but whenever i go to preferences- android and put the folder where my sdk is eclipse keeps complaining about the missing tools directory

4882269
subtract	add
its very convenient because as 32 bit integers you can add subtract angles 350 degrees plus 20 degrees ends up overflowing wrapping back around to 10 degrees

4882269
integer	unsigned
also you can decide to treat the 32 bit integer as signed -180 to 180 degrees and unsigned 0 to 360

4882271
atomic	interlocked
i am currently trying to achieve thread synchronization in c++ .net using only atomic operations using the system threading interlocked class in .net

google-chrome	firefox
ultimately i use firefox for general browsing and google-chrome without greasemonkey plugins for admin purposes

hex	binary	octal	decimal	octal	binary	octal	hex
hex decimal octal and binary are all bases of number systems but they count the same thing

4882583
hex	binary	octal	binary	octal	hex
we use binary octal and hex because binary is the language of computers remember a digital wire can either have current or not have current values 1 or 0

4882583
hex	binary	octal	binary	octal	hex
each single hex character describes four binary digits exactly while an octal character describes 3 binary digits

4882583
octal	hex
hex is used much more often than octal

4882583
hex	binary
just convert each character in the hex to the corresponding binary digit as above

4882589
awt	swing
the only problem is that we don t know what to use our very own engine with awt or if we could use swing to make it easier

4882632
inherited	properties
it s easy to break parts of the code into different files or inherited properties in child classes

4882642
awt	swing
while you could use the java awt and swing libraries to build a game you would probably have an easier time finding a game-specific library and building around that

4882685
vim	emacs
understand that i m comparing emacs and vi not vim

4882685
vim	emacs
i ve never learned the extensions that vim has added to vi and it s likely that many of them are features copied from emacs

4882685
vim	emacs
if so and if you re already proficient with vim emacs may not hold as many advantages for you

4882685
hash	md5
many software projects distribute a tarball of the application on a page that also includes an md5 hash of the tarball

4882685
hash	md5
so how do you compare the md5 hash on the distribution page with the md5 hash computed from the downloaded file

4882685
hash	md5
first copy the md5 hash from the webpage into a new emacs buffer

4882685
octal	decimal	octal	hex
type the two keystroke command ctrl-x and emacs will display the character its ascii value in octal decimal and hex the character offset from the beginning of the file and the character offset from the beginning of the line

4882716
put	get
you could put that line in bootstrap.php but you might get this error still config.php is loaded first

we are using groovy to test our restful api using a series of helper functions to build the xml put post gets and then a series of tests on the nodes of the xml to check that the data is manipulated correctly

4882865
google-chrome	firefox
we use poster for firefox google-chrome seems to be lacking a similar tool for hand testing single areas or simply to poll the api at times when we need to create further tests or check the status of things

4882873
datamapper	activerecord
it works quite nicely once you replace datamapper with activerecord

4882890
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
what i am doing works in google-chrome safari and firefox

actionscript	mxml
now i m getting no errors or warnings but i cannot see the mxml objects in the intellisense when working in the included actionscript file

4882911
actionscript	mxml
moreover all other inluded actionscript files can see objects in their mxml counterparts

4882937
int	chars
byte chars short or int return the value of the type

4882937
int	double
so in your case you have x int and y double if you follow this rules you ll find the solution

4882941
hex	binary	octal	binary	octal	hex
converting between binary octal and hex is pretty easy

4882941
hex	binary	octal	binary	octal	hex
these are easy because the radixes for binary octal and hex are all powers of 2

4882941
hex	binary	octal	decimal	octal	binary	octal	hex
several other answers show how to convert from binary octal and hex to decimal

4882954
width	height
in this case all html input types would have height 100x and width 200px

4882991
put	get
can i get a method to parse a string eg apple fruit and put the elements in a two d array

4883049
width	height
this has nothing to do with asp.net you need to design your pages with width height with percentage and not pixel

4883056
children	parent
this is also very useful because sending a sigterm to the parent perl script propagates this signal to each of the children who then forward this signal onto qsub thus gracefully terminating all associated submitted jobs

4883056
stdout	stderr
the attempted submissions that produce this error fail to even generate the stdout and stderr files and

4883067
int	chars
you can t add a chars pointer and an int like that you can but it won t do what you expect

4883073
int	chars
further they are already short chars 2 chars 3 vs int

4883081
ostringstream	std
to get around this you can write into an std ostringstream

4883087
int	chars
in c c++ you cannot append an int to a chars array using the + operator because a chars array decays to a pointer

4883119
stdout	stderr
this will redirect the stderr output to the stdout

4883130
chunked	transfer-encoding
i would bet it is sending back transfer-encoding chunked which is ending up in your data

4883139
apache	nginx
use the nginx apache mod-wsgi and you can t go wrong

4883148
led	electronics
while a led 3d tv might be in electronics - tv - led - 3d

4883202
actionscript	mxml
as a workaround i made a copy of the mxml file and the included actionscript file

4883202
actionscript	mxml
i then deleted the local copies of the mxml and actionscript files and renamed the copy to the original

4883203
min	max	width	height
while developing you need to understand during the process what the screen resolutions you intend to support - basically the min and max height and width and check them during development not after you have it looking good at one resolution

4883305

touchesbegan	touchesended
then override all the touch handlers touchesbegan withevent touchesended withevent etc...

4883514
width	height
the solution was quite simple because images in frames have same height but different width i simply made a transparent border rectangle and put it over each frame

4883575
jobs	cron
the hosting provider however only allows cron jobs to be run every two minutes

4883582
pascal	delphi
free pascal has a port and a converter for that and it will almost certainly work in delphi maybe changing one thing to remove a here and there

4883584
post	get
what you want to do is use the stream table to get the status post for users

4883591
tabs	tabpanel
as far as i can tell extjs interprets this as do not open any of the tabs when showing the tabpanel the first time

4883666
put	get
when you generate a keyfile you ll get a .pub fileâ use that one but put the name in your gitosis.conf without the .pub

4883674
width	height
in air 1.5 and flash player 10 the maximum size for a bitmapdata object is 8 191 pixels in width or height and the total number of pixels cannot exceed 16 777 215 pixels

4883674
width	height
so if a bitmapdata object is 8 191 pixels wide it can only be 2 048 pixels high. in flash player 9 and earlier and air 1.1 and earlier the limitation is 2 880 pixels in height and 2 880 in width

4883689
packets	multicast
i have same packets and multiple ip address clients and i can not use multicast

4883690
boost	stl
does google protocol buffers support stl vectors maps and boost shared pointers

4883690
boost	stl
i have some objects that make heavy use of stl containers like maps vectors and also boost shared_ptr

4883714
udp	tcp
udp conversely would not provide much benefit over multicasting if your application will run over a lan you are in charge for configuration of that s the reason i specified tcp

4883764
public	protected
wrong actually the order in the layout of data members within the same access specific public protected or private is dictated by their order in the code however no order is specified for data members with different specifiers

4883781
svcutil.exe	basichttpbinding
however you can only use basichttpbinding but you can overcome that by using a ssl connection and also to generate a wsdl proxy for the wcf service you cannot use the desktop version svcutil.exe you ll have to use netcfsvcutil.exe

4883805
google-chrome	firefox
by the way i want to point to the fact that such program will only work in microsoft internet explorer don t mind to have something like this in mozilla firefox google-chrome opera...

super	self
my question is is there a short cut for super type self self

4883869
gentoo	debian
seems like this guy has done it and provides a howto for debian and gentoo

4883885
waitpid	fork
i think you ll want to fork and exec and waitpid - set up and run your own process and wait for it to finish on your own

4883897
super	self
don t do that if super could just use type self as its first argument then it wouldn t have been written to take two arguments in the first place

4883917
width	height
validation of the picture s width and height should be performed before

4883939
versioning	upgrade
you ll need to upgrade your hardware if you want to beta test the new versioning of ios

4883941
width	height
the width and the height of the image

4883943
ready	each
then when you are finally ready to transmit the data you could either iterate through this collection of name value pair connections and send them data as byte array one by one to each client or spawm off one thread per connected client and have it send the data concurrently

4883954

another post details the necessary steps probably for an older update but still it should get you started clickety

4883961
filesystems	fat
but for external storage like the sd-card android is using the fat filesystems to make the cards compatible with windows

4883961
filesystems	fat
it s a good thought but since the fat filesystems lack any access rights features everything stored on the sd-card is available to all apps

charat	indexof
i mean a loop does make it possible to treat characters in a string like an array of characters with the string method charat and indexof right

4884083
packets	multicast
the short answer is you use multicast packets in python

4884083
packets	multicast
multicast sits somewhere in between unicast packets going to one host and broadcast packets going to all hosts in that it allows host via applications running on them usually to register an interest in certain multicast groups

4884083
packets	multicast
multicast traffic can cross routers as well as switches with appropriate support and the idea is that a minimum spanning tree gets built for sending packets to all subscribed hosts

profiling code of course run in release without debugging symbols

4884179
allocator	stl
standard malloc uses mutex and standard stl allocator does the same

4884179

pull	push
it works fine except the particles will not push each other away only pull towards i debugged that sub going through it command by command and realised the value h would not change what ever it was set to during the first pass through the sub is what it kept the only way to change this value is to manually set it i.e h 1

getter	setter
so the main difference between properties and ivars is that properties dynamically creating the setter getter methods and you can override them

4884268
getter	setter
with atomic the synthesized setter getter will ensure that a whole value is always returned from the getter or set by the setter regardless of setter activity on any other thread

4884268
getter	setter
that is if thread a is in the middle of the getter while thread b calls the setter an actual viable value -- an autoreleased object most likely -- will be returned to the caller in a

4884311
log4js-node	log4javascript
not to be confused with log4js-node as it is an adaption of log4javascript to nodejs

4884313

4884326
accessor	properties
your class properties someobject have generated accessor with annotation properties synthsize in your .h .m files

try chgrp as well as chmod

4885240
wordpress	joomla
major frameworks do this including joomla and wordpress

4885270
jar	war
if the war depends on the jar then the jar needs to be build and added to the local repository before the war is built not after as you have written in your question

4885270
jar	war
it has to be done in this order so that the jar file can be included in the war file.

4885270
jar	war
just create a parent-module with child modules for the jar and the war and declare that the war module depends on the jar module

4885278
jar	war
if your jar project and war project follow the same release cycle it would be a good idea to create a common parent pom and make the 2 projects modules of that parent

4885306
width	height
i understand that it means that the view gets both flexible width and height but how does it store two variables like that

4885338

4885511
hash	salt
your proposal is to send the value hash salt + data to s

4885511

screens	mdpi
but when i test it for mdpi with the images in both the -hdpi and copied into -mdpi it doesn t scale them down do i have to resize all the images and have them duplicated for the mdpi screens

4885582
post	get
i read the following post using get currentmethod and i noticed that this method is slow

4885596
eurekalog	madexcept
your best bet in my opinion is to add madexcept or eurekalog or something similar to your application and give it to the customer to try again

4885620
portrait	landscape
i m trying to force the portrait mode for my application because my application is absolutely not designed for the landscape mode

4885726
mouseover	mouseenter
try to bind to mouseover or mouseenter instead of hover

4885726
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you only pass one function to hover this function will be called on mouseenter and mouseleave

4885746
mouseover	mouseout
edit using mouseover and mouseout like felix said is the best way imho

4885761
portrait	landscape
btw your question is not completely clear but i gather that if you change mode portrait landscape in a certain activity your application crashes

4885785

4885874
integer	unsigned
for a serialization protocol format i have to encode unsigned numbers up to unsigned 64bit integer in a space-saving way that should still be easy to implement meaning i m not looking for a dedicated compression algorithm

4885919
int	boolean
the answer to your question is that as many others have pointed out you re using lowest as a boolean type instead of a number type such as int which would be in harmony with the rest of your program

4885919
int	boolean
for historical reasons mainly because of the c inheritance boolean values have been associated with int numbers for which 0 meant false and any other value meant true

4885919
int	boolean
that s why the boolean type is still compatible with int that s a way of saying this and when you assign it to a zero then it holds false

4885928
concave	convex
i m successfully drawing the convex polys which make up the following white concave shape

4885980
clang	llvm
llvm has been around for a while but â at least in my neck of the woods â it has only risen to prominence very recently possibly due to the fact that apple has been pushing heavily of late to replace gcc with clang in their own tool-chain

4885992
accessor	properties
imo you should primarily be using protected properties and provide accessor methods

4885992
public	protected
but don t just use protected visibility on all your properties it s okay for some to be public and private again it all comes down to responsibility

4885995
mouseover	mouseout
mouseover and mouseout are wrong king of events for this case

4885995
mouseleave	mouseenter
you need something like mouseleave and mouseenter

4886008

4887768
getter	setter
getter and setter provide that public interface for that to happen

4887768

apache	nginx
there are numerous complete guides to setting up nginx + apache via a quick google search but here is the gist for setting up nginx

4888945
apache	nginx
if you really want to serve your site from port 8081 you could potentially have nginx listen on port 8081 and have apache listen on a different port

4888945
apache	nginx
the point is apache sits in some obscure port only serving requests sent to it from nginx while static file serving is handled by nginx

this could be done with either tcp or udp depending on your reliability requirements

4889258
udp	tcp
instead of single multicast udp socket you would have a number of tcp sockets one per destination

4889342
multibyte	substr
i would just do a substr once it is url encoded but that might take off part of a encoded character space becomes 20 and if it was at the end it could get truncated to 2 which is invalid or that part of a multibyte character would get truncated ï gets encoded as cf 80 and it could get truncated as cf cf 8 all of which are wrong

4890059
keydown	keyup
while keydown and keyup will tell you which specific key on your keyboard is down or just came back up the keypress event is supposed to tell you what character would appear on the screen that s why the jquery documentation that you referenced says

4890059
keydown	keyup
for example a lowercase a will be reported as 65 by keydown and keyup but as 97 by keypress

4890059
keydown	keyup

you can then use the actualheight and actualwidth properties

4890217
width	height
in this example the menuitem has not been given an explicit height or width

4890252
width	height
i found that resizing the image to 1280px width 911px height works nicely for a browser window size of 1024x768 which is pretty much the minimum that anybody s going to be using these days

4890261
submit	submission
also how to submit the form such that the list of objects gets re-created on submission

post	get
i know there are otherways to send data get post etc. but a simple parameter on the querystring is most of the time sufficient for nonsensitive items

4890490
integer	unsigned
an obvious example in unsigned int s favor would be the integer division operation

4890490
integer	unsigned
in case of unsigned integer division this problem does not arise which is why generally integer division works much faster for unsigned types than for signed types

4890490
floating-point	integer	integer	unsigned
on the other hand when you are mixing integer arithmetics and fpu floating-point arithmetics signed integer types might work faster since the fpu instruction set contains immediate instruction for loading storing signed integer values but has no instructions for unsigned integer values

4890490
integer	unsigned
this code is noticeably larger because the fpu instruction set does not work with unsigned integer types so the extra adjustments are necessary after loading an unsigned value which is what that conditional fadd does

4890490
integer	unsigned
in my code 99 of integer types are unsigned

4890492
stdout	stderr
some servers when dealing with cgi scripts close their connection to the browser when the script closes stdout and stderr

4890884
width	height
previously we had it set to 100 width and height

4890884
width	height
once i changed to fixed pixel for width and height i was able to view our application in both ie and firefox

4890922
put	get
the variable needs to be volatile so that subsequent reads of the variable within a method don t get optimized away in other words if you re checking this condition in a loop or multiple times within a given function then we put volatile there to ensure that the value is checked each time rather than being cached locally

4890929
udp	tcp
i ve been told on the processing forums that the best way to communicate with processing through puredata is to use tcp or udp messages

4890929

persistent	transient
it has helped me time and time again to visually see the state of the entity to determine whether or not it s transient or persistent in the logging in terms of transactionality and just general debugging

4890949
hash	md5
a good way to make a token is to create a random string + something that uniquely identifies the user such as their username or email and then use md5 or a similar function to hash it

4891494
equals	gethashcode
yeah the base class itself is not required but overriding equals and gethashcode is something you ll want to do on all your entities so the base class makes that a lot less repetetive

width	font-size
determine if the span s width is greater than the useable width of the input element and update the font-size accordingly

4891902
serializable	deserialization
you could add custom serializable handling with the iserializable interface which would allow you to step through the deserialization process in the debugger

4891932
folder	directory
upload your site in the root folder of your site or virtual directory and upload the content of compiledsite not the folder itself

4891949
hash	md5
this ominous string is just something very random hash maybe md5-hashing see md5 -function but it has no meaning and there would be no reason trying to decrypt it

don t forget the checkbox and radio button -

4892058
post	put
in your example your intent is to put the message to the server at least that is how i understood it so most probably you want to use put requests and in this case the message text would be in the post request body

4892061
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
safari 3+ google-chrome 2+ firefox 2+ and

4892080
folder	directory
if you can remotely access the client computer s registry i highly doubt that you can put the batch file in a temp directory somewhere and place a reference to it in the runonce registry folder

4892086
pop-up	dialog
i believe that this will accomplish what you re looking for in that the dialog won t pop-up unless until the debugger stops in your code

4892115
versioning	upgrade
easier versioning upgrade if one cluster needs to move forward and the other needs to stay behind for legacy apps

4892175
button	checkbox
it was meant for checkbox and i needed it for radio button

4892229
equals	tostring
if x and y are equals their tostring s should be equals but an equals tostring does not necessarily mean that the objects are equals think of the equals hashcode relationship

4892243
folder	directory
i did notice that maven puts tomcat in my project target tomcat folder and there are some differences such as there is no lib directory

4892301
folder	directory
organised the folder and files but again it won t read the css file whether i put it in a subdirectory or in the same directory as the .info file

4892444
width	margin
i would like to make the margin property dependent on backgroundrectangle actualwidth similarly as i made it with the width property

4892444

edit summary it seems that my web app can be accessed by anyone only firefox or google-chrome and by me using my main computer

4892455
google-chrome	firefox
i published to this server only firefox or google-chrome

4892490
pull	push
the biggest speed benefits are gained when you want to push pull small amounts of data to the server for example when the state of a checkbox changes

4892490
post	get
this can be done with ajax in only a few bytes where traditionally you d perform a post redirect get form submission fetching the entire page again

4892547
put	get
indeed if i put the following in the oncreate method i get the same problem

4892555
macbook	isight
i am trying to capture a single frame from the apple isight camera built into a macbook pro using python version 2.7 or 2.6 and the pyobjc version 2.2

as example it is butt-heart to create properties from getter and setter

4892657

all of them use height 100 and a margin bottom for the central div the height of the footer or similar for the variable height content

4892685
factors	mean
i mean what are the factors governing this decision

4892754
slideup	slidedown
if you read the jquery documentation for slideup and slidedown they go like this

4892754
slideup	slidedown
ergo use slidedown to make stuff visible and not slideup

4892770
uiview	subviews
it works fine if both are subviews of a uiview

4892778

i am enqueuing jobs in my rakefile s cron task as such

4892779
put	get
when i try to put the js on the actual .aspx pages that will be using it i get the same no definition error

4892791
cpython	ironpython
most packages do not install directly into ironpython forcing you to install into cpython then copying over the relevant modules

4892798
luabind	luabridge
rather implement it in c++ using luabridge or luabind where it is natural and powerful

4892800
google-chrome	firefox
i can t say for sure if either firefox or google-chrome is right but your code is ambiguous because window could refer to either the current frame or the target frame depending on where the javascript is executed

4892809
rvm	bundler
rails 2.3.8 + bundler rvm + ruby 1.8.7 cucumber 0.9.4

4892822

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
our team had almost completed our application layouts which were working perfectly in google-chrome firefox and safari

4892924
pull	push
developers from time to time would git pull others work from origin repo into some local branch and git push their own work to appropriate branches of origin repo

4893005
post	get
the request file program was on another port on the 8888 port which already is a different server which dont enables ajax dont know why to get the post data

4893006
multicastdelegate	delegation
i looked over the implementation of delegation and multicastdelegate in the .net 4 source code

4893034
getter	setter
make both the getter and setter private

4893034
getter	setter
use it s getter and setter to wrap the generated datetime as a time

4893045
min	max
the android docs do say when user-scalable is no that the min max scale values are ignored

4893061
centos	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos

gitolite	gitosis
but i will recommend not using gitosis and use gitolite instead

4893145
post	get
when i get an id it returns the user id but i want the post id

4893154

iirc to fix this issue when dealing with proximity zones i used the mouse position to show hide the content the button

4893187
nsstring	nsobject
i need to convert nsobject to nsstring

4893204
hide	show
inside a nested div so that when a hyperlink is clicked it will show one element and hide the other like this snippet

4893238
quicksort	mergesort
here are some examples on how to achieve it multithreaded quicksort or mergesort

4893249
quicksort	mergesort
consider a mergesort over a quicksort i am biased towards mergesort - remember there are numerous different kinds of mergesorts including bottom-up

4893256
ordinals	difference
the following example illustrates the difference between ordinals and culture-sensitive comparisons using the indexof method

4893257
int	chars
operands that are int constants ï oating constants enumeration constants chars

4893263
int	boolean
the statement is an assignment so you re ultimately trying if 0 || 0 but the || operator expects boolean not int

4893318
inline	inlining
i know that vc++ will rarely inline with loops even if the inlining yields benefit

4893336
for-loop	loops
repeat-until is the only pascal statement i can think of that necessitates a far-removed second part - because it makes sense the condition for-loop exit to be textually where it will be checked - after loops body

4893343
apache	nginx
this is of no use if the web server for example apache or nginx is not configured to support the upload progress feature because you will probably see a 0 to 100 jump in the progress bar

4893353
google-chrome	firefox
oddly when i brought up firefox to see if it s related to chrome-only the problem went away both on firefox and on google-chrome

4893380
httphandler	httpcontext
...but when i only have an httpcontext available to me such as when i am in a httphandler

4893383
openssl	libcrypto
all the symbols youâ ve listed are exported by libcrypto which is part of openssl

4893402
inherited	properties
notice that there is no parent attribute in the tag but because the name attribute begins with the codefont style name which is a style that you have created this style inherited all style properties from that style

4893434
portrait	landscape
is it possible to setup the uisplitviewcontroller to work in landscape mode the same way as it does in portrait

4893435
post	get
anyone know how i can get the post id of the current page

4893435
post	get
so if i m on a particular post inside my header.php i want to be able to get the current post id

4893443
unistd.h	string.h
neither strings.h note the plural name this is not string.h nor unistd.h are part of iso c

4893487
put	get
can t i just get raw code and put it in my ruby application

4893498
pull	push
then in your individual page layouts you can leverage all the columns push pull alpha omega goodies that make 960 so great

4893531
inherited	properties
you can use the testcomponent object s inherited properties parentapplication to get a reference to the application object

4893565
pop-up	dialog
but with an incorrect username password an authentication required dialog box pop-up in my browser and my flex app won t respond with its proper handler until i click cancel

4893639
put	get
these get put into the app storage directory of course

4893662
hide	show
i need to hide or show images for individual cells in a datagridviewimagecolumn

4893662
hide	show
but this is a bit inconvenient because the image show hide code is now in my cell formatting event

4893700
opera	google-chrome
it s a superset of the ecmascript specification and of current implementations like ie google-chrome and opera

4893718
prng	random
if time returns the same value each time your loop executes you seed the prng with the same value just before you use it each time so when you query it for random numbers it returns the same values

4893727
getter	setter
the main argument for using setter getter everywhere is that it means you can rename the field by just changing its name in 3 places its definition the getter setter methods and all should compile and be fine

4893766
hide	show
i scrapped that and opted for nssegmentedcontrol instead with manual show hide of objects

4893793
sorting	filtering
if your sorting and filtering were more complex you might for example want to use a map-reduce operation to create a collection that s display ready but for a simple date ordered set the existing indexes will work just fine

4893794
filesystems	hfs
after some googling i found out that about resource forks a feature apparently unique to apple s hfs filesystems

4893799
vim	emacs
where setup_vim and setup_emacs would be sub-functions defined later in my file and is a user defined variable ie vim or emacs

4893848
implements	extends
the way i ve implements payment systems like this is to have the base class as you mentioned but have the base class instantiate the required payment vendor which extends the base class

4893865
profiling	debugging
what i want to know is if there is a way for me to know measure profiling while debugging or not if the actual memory used by the application after the list was cleared and null-ed is about the same as before the list was created and populated

4893883
width	height
b i set the flex app s width and height in the application tag to the same as that in the div

4893909
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing that override those methods subclassing that may not even be aware that the superclass constructor is calls those methods must not assume that the subclassing constructor and superclass constructors have been fully executed

4893919
rss	feed
i ve got my rss feed in xml file which i can not edit

4893919
rss	feed
i built my own javascript rss feed reader but it s not working unless i will get rid of all empty tags and all html tags

4893941
filtering	grouping
the grouping by filtering things so that only the items with the right assigned employee are counted but there is a partial cross-product for some of the terms leading to the inflated counts

4893956
vim	textmate
i ve switched from textmate to vim for about a year ago so i ve been immersed in books screencasts and forums about vim and how people customize their .vimrc s

4894000
octal	decimal
for example octal is 8 decimal is 10

4894034
multiplying	division
multiplying that by 26 and you get 23 actually 22.99999416 on my calculator but since the initial division was only two steps we stop here - the very slight inaccuracy is due to the fact that the floating point numbers are being rounded

4894059
uiview	subviews	ivar	subclassing
i m working on creating a uiview subclassing which i m calling marqueelabel that animates a subviews uilabel ivar in a marquee fashion when the uilabel text is too long for the containing view

4894060
int	chars
all you have to do is take chars convert them into an array of int then do the calculation to turn that into a number

4894108
tax	shipping
functionality for prices tax rates multi currency package and shipping specials etc

4894119
webrat	cucumber
is there anyway to configure cucumber to switch between webrat and selenium

4894122
opera	firefox
update edge opera and firefox implemented this already

4894148
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning of the facebook c# sdk 5.0.1

4894162
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
before it s suggested using firefox safari google-chrome ie8 is not an available option.

4894163
kde	gnome
or try life without kde or gnome for a while

4894179
openrowset	openquery
i prefer openquery over openrowset given that openquery does not require the connection-string definition within the proc

4894183
nfa	dfa
nfa advantages over a dfa the representation uses less memory

4894220
automake	autotools
one option i m considering is using either automake or the whole autotools toolchain to build a makefile

4894238
pull	push
mercurial isn t designed to work on remote repositories except to clone push and pull

4894252
google-chrome	firefox
i really like the design in firefox and google-chrome though

4894257
gif	bmp
i have no idea about image formats such as bmp jpg gif so given any of those would it be possible to read the image to then map that pixel state

4894284
nfa	dfa
similarly many algorithms for generating lr k parsers can be more intuitively motivated by exploring how the handle recognition automaton works in terms of nfas rather in terms of dfas though most algorithms for generating these parsers go directly to the dfa rather than the nfa

4894287
prepare	execute
the first time the rule gets execute it starts the server keeps relevant information in static field s and does whatever is necessary to prepare the test

4894287
ant	maven
a third approach is to let your ant maven gradle whatever build set up tear down common resources before after running the tests

4894287
maven	cargo
the maven cargo plugin is a typical example for this approach

4894288
nfa	dfa
nfa representations are more compact but dfa s are easier to simulate

4894288
nfa	dfa
oftentimes there is an exponential size increase when an nfa is reduced to a dfa

4894291
udp	tcp
i just need to apply the hook to udp packets and not disturb tcp tcp is used for remote debugging

4894295
istream	getline
you can call istream getline -- will read into a character array

4894314
for-loop	loops
or could it be done take the tile size set when creating the tile make a nested for-loop and take x y for the middle of the first tile and just iterate by adding tilesize to the x on the inner loops and tilesize to the y on the outer loops

4894356
move	drag
the blue label is meant to move when you click and drag it

4894385
put	get
the build products get put in . stage

4894391
disk	ram
if i allocate more than 1gb of ram to the win7 machine in the vmware player settings it goes so slow and is continually swapping to disk

4894399
put	get
the build products get put in . stage

4894413
children	parent
in main why can i access the parent and each of its children

4894417
min	max
i believe you can try using gtk_window_set_geometry_hints function and specify max and min height for your window

4894417
width	height
in this case you would still allow width change whereas height will stay constant

4894427
post	get
i ve got a handler configured for a model and it s rigged for get and post

4894435
rss	feed
serializing objects is very useful when you have to cache things such as rss feed

4894469
width	height
with firefox i guess you ll have to resort to some oblique techniques such as storing the element s original width height in custom properties and using

4894469
width	height
then in the func callback check if the new width height differ from the ones you stored previously take the respective resize action and store them again for the next event callback

4894469
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
i haven t been able to find a decent workaround for google-chrome safari and opera yet

4894488
google-chrome	safari
now it s not working on safari or google-chrome

4894488
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
ie 6 mozilla firefox google-chrome safari opera.

4894507
range	infinity
theoretically scores will range from infinitesimally close to zero down to negative infinity

4894516
jlabel	jlayeredpane
another way to do this is to add the jlabel to a jlayeredpane or to a jpanel held by a jlayeredpane and add a mouseadapter as the jlayeredpane s mouselistener and mousemotionlistener

4894516
jlabel	jlayeredpane
then when clicking on the label move it to the jlayeredpane s jlayeredpane.drag_layer so it moves on top of everything else then place the jlabel on whichever is the most appropriate level on mouse release

4894553
children	parent
this will have the effect that since a parent cannot be copied and since the parent contains its children the pointer to parent that the children have will never go invalid as long as the children are not destroyed since they are destroyed along with their parent

4894553
children	parent
note also that move-semantics and or deep-copying can make the parent copyable or at least movable while keeping the children consistent with their parent

4894553
children	parent
in main why can i access the parent and each of its children

4894559
implements	extends
junit 4.9 is cooking a better solution for this in the form of a builder but i think before then the cleanest although a bit difficult to implements way to address this is to make a custom runner implementation extends one of the existing ones

4894643
degrafa	flex
in flex 3 the easiest way to apply a gradient to an element is to use degrafa and its excellent cssskin class

4894656
children	parent
i just noticed that when i drag a parent is should drag all it s children as well which it currently doesn t

4894687
yesod	happstack
both happstack and yesod have been around a while

4894692
put	get
the only way to get rid of the exception is to put an xmlseealso decimalquantity.class on the position class itself

4894748
google-chrome	firefox
this works just fine in firefox but in google-chrome the value of thiswidth is a nan

4894789
width	height
tip .show and .hide doesn t not reserve the width and height of the element.

4894818
portrait	landscape
i have created one game which uses images and my game is in portrait and landscape mode

4894835
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
out of the box you can load a few different image formats with delphi bmp jpg png gif i think these days too

4894914
client-side	server-side
when a asp.net site is published the actual solution is no longer available to the public and all you get is the html representation client-side rather than the source server-side

4894924
inherited	properties
so far i ve found that using inherited to combine shared properties works best

4894938
filtering	grouping
i can t recall the exact syntax but you should be able to annotate each grouping with the number of persons with position worker as well as the total number of persons then filtering it to only the grouping where those two counts are equal

4894945
typedef	struct
the problem is that when you re using typedef struct to introduce a new struct that doesn t require the struct keyword you cannot refer to the typedef -ed name inside the declaration of the struct

4894945
typedef	struct
also your typedef statement is currently invalid because you haven t given a name by which to call struct shareddata

4894972
width	height
update if really necessary use screen.width and screen.height to access the width and height of the screen

4894974
width	height
just check to see if the top left corner falls within the bounds of the rectangle and then compare the lengths of the width and height

png	ico
may i need to convert png files to ico

min	max
you would have to account for this to make sure there is a min and max speed you want the balls to bounce

4898519
int	double
