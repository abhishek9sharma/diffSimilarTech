listview	gridview
i ve created a listview with a gridview component in it

2500016
google-chrome	firefox
there seems to be a discrepancy between the xpath that i m seeing in google-chrome devtools as well as firebug on firefox and what my c# program is seeing

2500022
int	chars
less memory-limited implementations might for example cache all chars and shorts as well as int and longs in the range of -32k - +32k

2500110
cairngorm	mate	cairngorm	puremvc	mate	puremvc
there are others out there such as puremvc cairngorm mate

2500145
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox largely behaves like safari google-chrome opera and the tons of tiny-marketshare browsers out there

2500173
folder	directory
this produces a directory listing of whatever folder you pass to it

2500191
children	parent
of course a bigger treeview would have several parent and lots of children and they will all add up to one root node

2500237
google-chrome	firefox
however both work only in firefox get no errors results in ie8 or google-chrome

2500262
submit	submission
so you may if you really want to organize your page as one big single form and so submission will submit all the values each time

2500292
fiddler	charles
perhaps you should use the fiddler or charles proxy tools to see what actually happens with the request from your browser

2500332
for-loop	loops
it seems that the foreach loops runs only once because there is only one entry and the for-loop prints it 5 times

2500344
stdout	stderr
with that code the stdin stdout stderr file descriptor of my prgname are associated to the socket when looking with ls -la proc pid fd and so the terminal capabilities of this process doesn t work

2500344
stdout	stderr
a test with a connection via ssh sshd on the remote device and executing localy under the ssh connection prgname show that the stdin stdout stderr fd of this process prgname are associated to a pty and so the terminal capabilities of this process are working fine

2500374
folder	directory	folder	dir
in my answer to this question where the asker needed a fast way to get a directory listing of a folder on a network drive i suggested using the dos dir command

2500424
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the most common place to begin interacting with your outlets is in a viewdidload viewwillappear or viewdidappear method after the call to super s implementation

2500430
subtract	add
that is if the previous angle is negative subtract 360 and add 360 if the previous angle is positive

2500446
fast-forward	merge
footnote speaking of my experience i eventually found switching fast-forward to off was mostly helpful for git newcomers - however once the feel for workflows and concepts start to sink in you definitely want to avoid blurring your log graph with tons of pointless merge remote ..blarf type commits

2500447
integer	unsigned
i ve got to modify a c program and i need to include a set of unsigned integer sets

2500457
google-chrome	firefox
there is a similar setting with firefox and google-chrome i believe but i am not sure how to set it up

2500460
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve been able to change the background color of the more tab s uinavigationcontroller by subclassing the uitabbarcontroller and adding the following code to the viewdidload method

2500483
squeak	visualworks
smalltalk has the whiletrue -message implemented through recursion in visualworks or through compiler-inlining in squeak pharo

2500564
strlen	strstr
php has no object oriented base no string class it uses c-like functions strchr strstr strlen ... this makes oop harder you have to have more discipline to develop good code

2500577
hide	show
when the uiimageview is show i hide the nav bar with

2500580
post	get
behind the scenes it relies on a combination of http post get methods + soap + an activex control to achieve the desired functionality

2500622
sorting	filtering
this question is similar to gwt table that supports sorting scrolling and filtering

2500659
keydown	keyup
you should remember that if a key is hold it will write several times and if you are only using keyup keydown or keypress you will still get the other characters that were repeated unless you erase all the undesired chars from the textfield - which if long could diminish performance

2500779
oncreate	setcontentview
yeah either setcontentview hasn t been called in oncreate of the activity or else the view you are trying to get isn t an edittext

2500838
google-chrome	firefox
i really recommend browsing with google-chrome when you re looking to debug javascript it s error console is very useful for not just determining errors like this but also for pinpointing the location in the script that is throwing the error which might be an advantage beyond firebug in firefox

2500852
domcontentloaded	onload
you could use an onload event instead as that will work in all browsers and is usually only a fraction of a second after the domcontentloaded event

2500873
google-chrome	firefox
this layout works well on firefox ie8 google-chrome and other browsers but on ie7 and ie6 the div does not float over the other divs messing my layout

2500968
qmainwindow	qdialog
i have a qmainwindow displaying a qdialog

2501065
int	chars
you ll need to write your own method to take every two chars interpret them as an int and store them in an array

2501077
puts	gets
it makes a db connection gets data puts it into the table and shows the table in new window

2501097
put	get
put the predicate in the join condition instead then it will get evaluated before the missing rows are added back in.

2501126
hide	show
unless the amount of data needed to update is really large likely to change often or your intended client is really limited in bandwidth or computing power like mobile devices you may allso embed all the data needed on the page and selectively hide and show the data based on the selection without using a server call

2501130
textview	imageview
in the table cell i have an imageview the images are displayed via url and a textview webview

2501267
width	height
i have changed the width and height of the viewbox

2501267
children	parent
i need to get the location of children in canvas with respect to viewbox parent

2501273
width	height
i have a question if i set a image height in css and try to get height width i get different results in different browsers

2501296
margin	height
edit alternately you could add 20px padding to a wrapper div then set your container to height 100 with no margin and it should fill up to the padding of its wrapper

2501328
pull	push
you can clone a part of svn repository locally to an hg repository and work with hg locally and svn remotely push and pull do what you would expect of them

2501329
google-chrome	firefox
here s a blog comparing subpixel rendering in google-chrome and firefox

2501342
width	height
opera 10.10 height width 2008 x 3008

2501445
spatialite	gdal
i built spatialite library then gdal library with spatialite support

2501475
google-chrome	safari
you can also transfer the purchase to a free typekit account which will cover google-chrome + safari too

2501492
cpython	ironpython
what can be done in cpython that can not be done in ironpython

2501497
int	boolean
it s not very good practise to use yes no for your you re better off using an int or boolean value

2501508
readonly	temporary
also if the table is readonly then you won t be able to add indexes to make it any faster so like astander said i would suggest a temporary table with a join

2501532
getter	setter
the error preverifying class is thrown on a very simple class 4 private field with getter setter implementing serializable that s all

2501551
mp3	flac
this command converts an input mp3 file i didn t find other audio files on my pc to flac and sends it to stdout which goes to stdin of oggenc2 by using pipe |

2501614
typedef	struct
you ll want typedef struct .

2501635
cpython	ironpython
if you are writing 100 pure python you can do everything that cpython can do in ironpython

2501647
mate	puremvc
as for using mate the annoying carhorn or puremvc we created our own framework two years ago

2501665
typedef	struct
typedef your struct first like

2501665
int	boolean
in that case your function would return a boolean to indicate success or failure and take two pointers to int as parameters

2501691
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the only way in apache that comes to mind is putting the rewritebase directive into a tag but that is only available in httpd.conf itself not in .htaccess files

2501704
postgresql	mysql
the above works in postgresql mysql needs as defined here for full list of functions that are influenced with this server mode see in this ref

2501730
min	max
i have some validation code which should display the max min of a control when a bad value is entered

2501738
qtcore	qtgui
i have qtcore qtgui network and webkit checked

2501739
width	height
i set everything to fire after a 200ms timeout and the real width height are displayed

2501739
google-chrome	firefox
tested and works in google-chrome ie and firefox

2501749
getelementsbyname	each
however if you want to do something with each of the radio buttons in the group you could use getelementsbyname which returns a collection of all elements found with the given name

2501801
implements	extends
you could extends a say interface b extends a and extends aimpl and implements b class bimpl extends aimpl implements b .

2501831
jsf	seam
i thought the hidden parameter would work because that is how i would do it with straight html and i m a little surprised that its not working for jsf seam

2501950
hex	binary
imagine that i have a several viewer component that are used for displaying text and they have few modes that user can switch different font presets for viewing text binary hex

2501954
scrollable	panels
now i found that i can spare myself a lot of trouble in my js project if i insert a scrollable iframe into each panels

2501954
width	height
this is also true in particular of the iframes 100 width 100 height

2501954
google-chrome	firefox	width	height
all of this works a treat in firefox and google-chrome but ie6 is doing something rather cute so long as i do not affect the width of the browser window but only change its height only the panel div changes in height

2502008
folder	directory
check your git installation folder or the directory where you have launched the command

2502008
folder	directory
usually the contents are just downloaded in the current working directory in a folder

2502039
getter	setter
the property call defines the property and the synthesize call will create setter and getter for you methods to set and retrieve the value of itemid

2502133
udp	tcp
most commonly at the bottom of the application layer you will be choosing between tcp ip or udp

2502133
udp	tcp
if you need in order delivery of messages you need to use tcp as opposed to udp

2502144
superclass	subclassing
you need to change the base class superclass to have a virtual method with the same signature as the derived class subclassing

2502204
google-chrome	firefox
it looks correct in firefox google-chrome ie8 but not ie6 7 the footer s background is white and inside the box

2502279
mouse	keyboard
however there is an authentication system which prevents unauthorized programs from access an x server the place where the keyboard screen and mouse are

2502290
put	get
you would get the same error if you put a system.out.println in the first method after the return statement in it

2502322
width	height
you ll need to use the pre-defined width and height of the gui with the internal variables a_screenwidth and a_screenheight and force param2 of gui show as an expression to make it work

2502322
width	height
for example if the width of the gui is 900 and the height is 550

2502347
for-loop	arrays
your second line does not even access the arrays - make sure that it s not the first line of the body of the for-loop that throws the exception

2502367
firefox	safari
it does not work in safari 4 but does work in firefox 3.5.9

2502368
valgrind	gprof
i ve found valgrind cachegrind with kcachegrind to be helpful in analysis of un-prepared no gprof code embedded binaries

2502385
bmp	png
any ideas how i can display an image file bmp or png centered on the screen as an application splash screen when running a windows console script based on a batch file vbscript wscript or python console script

2502397
jobs	cron
i ve seen some people suggest cron jobs but i m not sure how feasible it would be to create three new cron jobs every time i send an email use them once and then delete them afterward

2502411
chaiscript	c++
i m using script language chaiscript with c++ and qt

2502412
opera	google-chrome
looking at google s browser security document the following browsers translate non-reserved nn sequences in the address bar msie7 msie8 ff3 opera google-chrome

2502431
rss	feed
i am getting last 20 status updates posted by some twitter user via rss feed the feed xml is parsed and the statuses are displayed in a listview

2502431
post	get
when i click a listview item i get the option of re-tweeting and post reply

2502443
pop-up	dialog
in a long-running operation i m showing a pop-up dialog created from progressdialog to prevent other operations from happening

2502463
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox google-chrome etc

2502569
gwt	cssresource
if you use cssresource to inject your css file gwt will handle pruning unused styles for you just like it does in the case of unused code

2502614
put	get
i didn t put in all of the fields but you get the idea

2502623
gwt	cssresource
if you bundle css files with clientbundle via the cssresource class the gwt compiler can actually generate errors on unused css selectors

2502638
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog that pop-up you ll see the command line which includes all jars parameters etc

2502663
jsf	seam
which means seam jsf was treating my form submit as a non-faces request

2502694
hash	md5
an md5 hash is often used to verify the integrity of a file or document

2502694
hash	md5
here s a good article on generating an md5 hash in javascript

2502712
children	parent
this was another post i ran into when i was researching - sql selecting parent and their children

2502763
hash	md5
for example check out the pseudo code or an actual javascript implementation for computing the md5 hash of a string

2502765
mouseleave	mouseenter
i thought i was missing something too but i do know that the jquery validation plug in doesn t react to mouseenter mouseleave

2502765
versioning	upgrade
i also found the need to upgrade to the latest versioning of jquery.validate.js from the developer s page because we are using a later versioning of jquery 1.4 here

2502773
hide	show
i want to hide all the descendents of the ul for my tree menu when the page loads up then as each main li link is clicked display the direct child and if the direct child has children grandchild when the the child is clicked i want it to show the grandchild elements

2502866
cpu	hyperthreading
i can t say i ve specifically tried #cores + 1 but on our systems intel i7 940 4 hyperthreading cores lots of ram and velociraptor drives and our build large-scale c++ build that s alternately cpu and i o bound there is very little difference between -j4 and -j8

2502872
stdout	stderr
this worked for me for redirecting stdout stderr can be handled similarly

2502963
wxpython	pygtk
also pygtk is lighter than wxpython but i ended up bitting the bullet and using wxpython for the same purpose recently it is heavy but it didn t have any affect on the script performance

2503025
children	parent
but when traversing the tree i cannot manage to determine the actual number of children without iterating over the parent node

2503028
versioning	upgrade
just upgrade rubygems as normal if it messes up just download the last versioning and run sudo ruby setup.rb

2503037
spaces	delimiter
assuming it s white spaces delimiter this code should do

2503046
free	malloc
if not for example it intends to use free you ll need to use malloc instead

2503087
getter	setter
i would like to be able to have a default mapping controller that i can configure then override the getter setter for a particular field if needed

2503111
installation	upgrade
i haven t actually tried this myself but you should be able to use an installation disc for rhel 5.4 to upgrade even if you are off-line although you ll need to get on-line somewhere to download the disk image

2503111
rpm	yum
basically you create a custom repository on you hard drive with the rpm files from the disk and point yum at it or use the disc directly

2503114
rss	feed
for example take yes i know her twitter page off by heart lol on the right hand side of the page is a link to her rss feed

2503172
put	get
i put the resulting library in opt local lib and i still get the same error message

2503269
int	chars
my first idea was to substring those three chars convert them to an int add 400 to it convert them back to a string and then call replace on the original string

2503348
cairngorm	puremvc
i ve seen massive misuse of frameworks like puremvc and cairngorm mainly because apply them in an all-or-nothing fashion

2503349
hamcrest	lambdaj
in his last release lambdaj implements it with a smart use of closure and hamcrest matcher

2503351
ncover	fxcop
inside there it builds the projects runs nunit ncover fxcop stylecop etc

2503351
teamcity	nant
i haven t used teamcity but there should be a way to pull down the source and then run an msbuild or nant build script which will then handle the build steps

2503358
jtextfield	jlabel	jtabbedpane	jtextfield	jtabbedpane	jlabel
unlike many basic components jtextfield jlabel etc the jtabbedpane ignores the foreground and background colors when setting up to paint

2503365
freebsd	linux
many appliances are based off of stripped down linux or freebsd kernels running apache or a lightweight httpd

2503388
jquery	simplemodal
the simplemodal jquery plugin gives you the option to autoposition your modal window

2503407
put	get
i would hesitate to put code that calls user_default c functions in production code so you might want to look at the source for the function and replicate it in your own code so you don t get bitten by a behaviour change in a future erlang release

2503415
versioning	upgrade
i would continue with the practice of exporting the site as upgrade are needed but have a symbolic link to a directory outside of the versioning controlled directory with the user uploaded content

2503476
width	height
itextsharp uses 72 pixels per inch so if you know the height and width of your desired page size in inches just multiply those numbers by 72 to get mywidth and myheight

2503507
accessor	properties
if you need thread safety you can bake that into the accessor methods properties

2503522
rss	feed
using the open source trac provides a wiki integrated rss feed of the commits to the project and code browser

2503594
mp3	ogg
it uses a list to store mp3 and ogg files

2503594
mp3	ogg
however i would like to create this list myplaylist dynamically with a javascript function which would retrieve the mp3 urls and the ogg vorbis urls from the html code

2503623
opera	firefox
i ve tested on firefox 3.5.8 and opera 10.10 on ubuntu

2503642
getter	setter
in order for custom properties to be de serialized properly you need both a getter and a setter

2503647
children	parent
1 when you realloc the node list you actually move in memory the node objects so the parent pointer in their children must me updated as well

2503660
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol	rss	feed
i am displaying an rss feed in the uitableview in rssviewcontroller depending on the segment selected on the uisegmentedcontrol

2503660
rss	feed
for example i have two rss feed by default i am displaying the rss feed at segment 0

2503660
rss	feed
the rss feed that i load at segment 1 has only 5 rows

2503660
rss	feed
when i scroll the rss feed at segment 0 then before the scrolling stops i switch to the rss feed at segment 1 i crash the app with the following error

2503660
rss	feed
if i wait till the scrolling on the rss feed at segment 0 stops then select segment 1 everything works fine

2503739
inline	inlining
i looked up inline member functions to be sure i understood and i dont think the inlining is the cause but i am not sure what is

2503761
inject	interceptor
an injector can easily be inject into your guice aop interceptor some thing like this

2503774
post	get
if i have a controller action that may recieve both http get and http post from a number of different sources with each source sending different data

2503784
super	extends
for the long answer all that super and extends stuff in the generic type constraints is what josh bloch calls the pecs principle usually presented next to a picture of arnold -- i m not kidding

2503784
super	extends
producer extends consumer super

2503796
google-chrome	firefox
i have this code that it is working on firefox and google-chrome but in ie8 ie7 it s not working

2503816
bibtex	latex
i am a graduate student with many scripts bibliography data in bibtex thesis draft in latex presentations in open office posters in scribus and figures and result data

2503837
post	get
the usual pattern is to have two controller methods one controller method handles the get the other controller method handles the post

2503873
folder	directory
turns out this error occurs when the mobile.browser file is placed in the app_browsers root folder so just make a sub directory for it instead of

2503903
width	height
given an instance of a ccsprite in cocos2d in iphone what method can i use to obtain the image width and height

2503912
subtraction	addition
those are aaa ascii adjust for addition aas subtraction aam mult aad div

2503920
webkit	gecko
with gecko and webkit the text displays fine

2503927
width	height
the only solution i know for this is either adding the shift to the image itself or using an absolutely positioned element with a slight offset hovering behind the element - but that would require you know the width and height in advance

2503942
getter	setter
actually i often use methods instead of direct access to attributes the good old getter setter approach sometimes

2503945
post	put
therefore you need to make a form that post to the action then put a or in the form

2503965
udp	tcp
you didn t specify tcp or udp so i ll just give you some general guidance

2503965
udp	tcp
for tcp or udp just allocate a single buffer of size n where n is the biggest message size you could possibly have sent from the remote player or server

2503965
udp	tcp
for your socket whether udp or tcp make it non-blocking

2503998
actionscript	haxe
i know of flashdevelop for windows but how about developing actionscript or haxe on a mac

2503998
actionscript	haxe
what is people using to develop actionscript haxe on a mac

2504016
versioning	upgrade
my apps deploy the v1 schema from the initial script then run upgrade script for each versioning

2504016
versioning	upgrade
each script know how to upgrade from versioning n-1 to n and only that

2504016
versioning	upgrade
when you attach an older database you see the famous database is running the upgrade from versioning 611 to 612 and you see that the upgrade goes step by step does not upgrade straight to current versioning 651 or whatever is current in your case

2504016
versioning	upgrade
in other words your build server should build the current database using the upgrade scripts and then as a build step script out the database and produce a build drop with the current versioning schema script

2504026
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i ve tried setting the frame of self.tableview in different places viewdidload viewwillappear etc but nothing happens

2504052
hide	show
what i want to do is whatever link i click in the list it will show its corresponding table and hide all the others

2504053
viewdidload	viewwillappear
not viewdidload or viewwillappear

2504068
jboss	glassfish
any application server jboss glassfish will contain one to control what a loaded application can do

2504071
background-image	background-color	background-color	transparency
how do i use css3 gradients for my background-color and then apply a background-image to apply some sort of light transparency texture

2504124
junit	easymock
typically you would only do this if you are using a lot of static methods from a particular class like i use it all the time for junit asserts and easymock

2504151
uiview	calayer
i have a uiview which has about 8 different calayer sublayers added to its layer

2504184
client-side	server-side
if you absolutely must have a client-side app look at making the server-side restful google this if you don t know what it is and you can utilise the existing http libraries in the .net framework to send and receive data to from the server

2504186
hash	md5
http post over ssl to with username and md5 hash of password - compare this to the md5 of the password you have stored for them

2504194
client-side	server-side
the server-side code is vbscript and so far we ve avoided the various javascript libraries by the simple expedient of almost never using client-side scripting

2504197
int	chars
evaluates to true and the only overload of find that would work is the chars c size_t pos version as bool can be converted to an int 1

2504224
int	chars
in fact quite a bit of i o depends on eof having a value that couldn t originate from the file which basically translates to a requirement that chars have a range that s smaller than int not just smaller than or equal to as the standard directly requires

2504224
int	chars	unsigned	short
that does leave one loophole though it s one that would generally be quite horrible that chars and short have the same range size_type is the same as unsigned short and int has a greater range than chars short

2504261
accessor	properties
a properties with a single name is basically prohibited by the same rule since it is internally a pair of methods with no argument for the get accessor

2504263
int	chars
seeing as there probably isn t a string predefined for each numerical value i m guessing that the computer goes through each bit of the int from right to left each time incrementing the appropriate values in the chars array base10 notation places

2504265
int	chars
so the declaration of int 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 will not compile as well as chars 3

2504337
youtube	vimeo
however i m also researching how i could provide an embed feature like youtube or vimeo etc. without compromising this security feature

2504343
uilabel	uitextview
this view has a uilabel a uiimageview and a uitextview

2504366
awt	swing
a netbeans form is actually just a displayable swing or awt container class which you populate with components like jtextfield objects

2504395
width	height
that is i can do away with the wrapping div and thus need not rely on ie6 to honour the automatic relative dimensioning height 100 width 100 of the wrapped iframe

2504436
int	chars
because 1 is an int and because 1 can t possibly be an address the compiler finds the only overload of string find it can call is the one with chars c size_t pos

2504478
pop-up	dialog
i need to pop-up a quick dialog for the user to select one option in a uitableview from a list of roughly 2-5 items

2504483
vsto	add-in
in a vsto add-in i m developing i need to execute a method with a specific delay

2504528
pthreads	fork
as long as you are working on a pthreads os you can use fork and exec

post	get
in the post body which lets me get all the data across multiple tracking ids for a range of dates

2504576
listview	gridview
i read this question on so and while it does give me some good insight i don t know how to add the necessary binding to a row because i am using a listview with a gridview as its view not a listbox

2504611
mouseleave	mouseenter
use the mouseenter and mouseleave events

2504669
bash	zsh
the shell bash zsh etc is responsible for wildcard expansion so in your first example there s no shell hence no expansion

2504769
google-chrome	firefox
debugging in google-chrome isn t as pleasant as firefox

2504777
button	checkbox
theres a button when clicked will add the selected checkbox value into database but right now when the button is clicked and after the postback the page will show the error system.nullreferenceexception

2504806
virtualenv	setuptools
python duh setuptools or pip virtualenv and an editor

2504813
comparator	comparable
if you don t pass an explicit comparator to a treeset it will try to compare the objects by assuming they are comparable

2504813
comparator	comparable
treesets are sorted sets and require either objects to be comparable or a comparator to be passed in to determine how to sort the objects in the set

2504816
comparator	comparable
for treeset you either have to make the elements comparable or provide a comparator

2504816
equals	compareto
the interface defines one method compareto that must return a negative integer zero or a positive integer if this object is less than equals to or greater than the other object respectively

2504835
postgresql	mysql
in python you may use postgresql mysql sqlite or some other database

2504835
pylons	cherrypy
there are about 200000 pylons zope django cherrypy werkzeug...i won t bother starting an argument by recommending one

2504835
wxpython	pygtk
there are wx bindings wxpython gtk+ bindings pygtk and two sets of qt bindings

2504838
vim	emacs
vim or emacs could be the most powerful but also the most difficult to learn at first

2504857
comparator	comparable
treeset is only appropriate if you need the set sorted either by the object s implementation of comparable or by a custom comparator passed to the treeset s constructor

2504861
src	attr
attr sets the given attribute in this case src

2504881
implements	extends
when the you call lookup on this object will only return the object that was used to initialize the object if it implements extends the object that is used in the query

2504896
ubuntu	linux
i ve used python on windows and on ubuntu and linux is much cleaner

2504977
int	double
and some of them are int double pointers c# pointers array and whatnot

2504984
opera	firefox
from my logging i found that in firefox and opera doing this automatically calls the plugin destroy method npp_destroy npapi

2504986
int	chars
how would you write a collection that can store either int or float or chars

2505023
firefox	safari
this problem is on firefox mac and pc safari looks good

2505035
client-side	server-side
under-reporting by the client-side rig versus server-side eems to be the usual outcome of these comparisons

2505035
client-side	server-side
data sources recorded in server-side collection but not client-side

2505037
folder	directory
look in the samples directory of the webcontent folder

2505041
lxml	html5lib	lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup
i ve read raves about beautifulsoup html5lib and lxml but i cannot figure out how to install any of these on windows

2505052
width	height
graphics.drawroundrect is better because it takes two parameters for the corners - elipse width and height and then you could apply both scale factors but it doesn t allow me to specify different radius for different corners

2505064
gridview	objectdatasource
i ve got a gridview connected to an objectdatasource which is bound to some custom objects in my code code is below

2505070
xls	.doc
we ve implemented a policy that all .doc files must have the svn needs-lock property set to prevent parallel access on files that are hard to merge we ve also done this for xls ppt pdf etc.

2505096
pull	push
until now i had only worked on my home desktop but i just bought a laptop and am trying to set it up so that i can work on the project from either computer and push pull changes

2505102
ecj	javac
as an aside another difference between ecj and javac in my experience javac will tell you to get lost if you have a string constant over 65535 bytes long this is a limitation in the class file format

2505117
children	parent
with css you can reference children from parent but not parent from children

2505127
lxml	beautifulsoup
if it is not well formed you need a fault tolerant parser such as beautifulsoup element tidy or lxml s html parser

2505127
lxml	beautifulsoup
lxml and elementree use a mostly compatible api that is more of a standard than beautifulsoup

2505127
lxml	elementtree
in my opinion lxml is the best module for working with xml documents but the elementtree included with python is still pretty good

2505127
elementtree	beautifulsoup
in the past i have used beautifulsoup to convert html to xml and construct elementtree for processing the data

2505129
firefox	safari
but i want to run it on web browsers internet explorer mozilla firefox safari etc.

2505155
pull	push
i still haven t worked out how to fix it properly since i want to continue to push pull to both repo s but manually adding the info to the project s .git config works

2505194
apache-fop	xhtml
in this case directly converting from xhtml to pdf a would be an ideal solution either using itext directly the example uses itextsharp a .net port of itext but it s the same for java or by using apache-fop as others have suggested which also uses itext internally when outputting to pdf and although it is more bloated inefficient and complicated to setup than using itext directly it might produce better results than the itext example -- only one way to settle that you have to try it out on a few of your xhtml files as samples

2505203
versioning	upgrade
what you want to do is set you installer up in such a way that the new versioning of your software sees the file deletions as upgrade to a prior versioning

2505203
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade guid always stays the same within your product family of different versioning

2505203
versioning	upgrade
in general if you follow this pattern and then specify file deletions in your new versioning the installer should interpret the file deletions as upgrade and you should not get any errors on subsequent execution of the newly-installed versioning

2505225
udp	tcp
both in tcp and udp

2505271
ienumerable	icollection
i see that implements icollection and ienumerable but that only allows me to read values not add them

2505296
submit	submission
therefore submission it twice would submit the order twice

2505296
post	get
in order to prevent this you need to make the refresh do a get request instead of a post request

2505296
post	get
this will make it so when the user hits refresh it will be sending a get request instead of a post request and it won t prompt for confirmation

2505296
post	get
user now will be refreshing a get request instead of a post request

2505307
post	get
alternatively use get instead of post to send your data.

2505309
post	get
the most used are get and post

2505317
unix	solaris
i am running python 2.6.2 on solaris 10 unix and recently installed the pythonldap 2.3.9

2505324
pull	push
if they re only created in mercurial then one work-around would be to set up a svn-gateway repo on the remote system and do the push from there and never pull from that repo back into mercurial

2505330
shadowing	named
did you named a file in the current directory ldap.py that is shadowing the one that you want

2505346
inherited	properties
a dependencyproperty is a properties whose value depends or can depend on some other source such as animation data binding styles or visual tree inherited

2505346
inherited	properties
imagine how you would implement something like styles or properties inherited the ability to set something like a font or data context on a parent element and have its value propagate to all child elements

2505358
stdout	stdio
the parent process can redirect the stdin and stdout streams of the child process implementing character-based message passing via stdio

2505366
inherited	properties
a dependency properties is a properties where the current value is dependent hence the name on other aspects such as default values validation coercion value inherited or animation

2505437
width	margin
you can make three css classes with appropriate margin so taht div willl be in center apply these classes on the basis of width of inner div

2505448
put	get
i also like a create a top-level application group into which i put the app delegate main xib file if any pch file info.plist app icon default.png and other things related just to the application so they are all easy to find - after you add a number of files each of those things can get lost in giant lists of stuff

2505462
getter	setter
if we can access the private members through setter and getter then what is the use of private

2505477
getter	setter
because the getter and setter can act as a proxy

2505477
getter	setter
just because your getter setter is named getname and your property is called name doesn t mean it will always be that way

2505485
getter	setter
no one forces you to put in getter and setter for every variable

2505485
getter	setter
indeed blindly using private members + dummy getter setter for every variable is pointless even though many object oriented encapsulation tutorials do this all the time for some reason

2505503
getter	setter
there is somewhat of a debate right now as to using protected vs private or to use concepts akin to properties in some languages delphi c# rather than getter and setter as in java

2505539
inherited	properties
i don t really want to over-complicate my data model with each subtype being inherited even though no additional properties or methods are included except pc types which would ideally have associated accessories and software but that s probably out of scope here

2505544
getter	setter
as you mentioned using accessors makes private variables a bit pointless and in some environments performance consequence of using getter and setter just makes it worthless

2505544
getter	setter
on the other hand if you don t have such concerns i think using getter isn t so bad but you should think twice before using setter

2505549
google-chrome	firefox
the table object model works in the couple of browsers i tested it in google-chrome and firefox on the mac so it may not be a bad idea to familiarize yourself with it

2505557

here you can find sample code which uses openejb testng and jmockit for unit testing

2505596
inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
first you ll want to implement at least ieditableobject inotifypropertychanged and idataerrorinfo on the individual items in a data-bound collection which in your case would be the employeegridviewadaper class

2505602
gridview	datalist
i have a datalist and inside it there is many rows and in one of these rows i have a gridview

i can push my project code onto the server but when i do a clone or pull it returns a fatal early eofs error at about 75-80

2505645
onclick	onmouseup	onclick	onmousedown	onmousedown	onmouseup
if you want your action to be performed only when the mouse is used then consider using onmousedown or onmouseup instead of onclick i d suggest the latter in your case

2505648
portrait	landscape
but the issues is that subviews added in the lower part fo mainview are not responding to touches in landscape mode but working fine with portrait mode

2505659
inherited	properties
if you want to use multiple inherited to combine everything into one big class it might make sense to do this then you can refactor each of the parent classes so that every method and properties is either private starts with __ or has a short 2-3 character prefix unique to that class

2505742
hash	md5
now if i use say a java program that implements the same hashing alogorithm md5 can i expect the hash values to be the equal to the value generated in c#

2505758
hash	md5
my suggestion would be to use a common accepted hashing algorithm like md5 to achieve the same hash values

2505764
hash	md5
what you really want to know is whether a hashing algorithm such as md5 will produce the same hash value for identical files on different operating system platforms

2505764
hash	md5
in the case of text files transcoding between different character encodings or changing line termination sequences will make the files different at the byte level and result in different md5 hash values

2505840
wxpython	pyqt
gui tcl is inbuilt but wxpython or pyqt are recommended

2505869
ssl	https
hypertext transfer protocol secure https is a combination of the hypertext transfer protocol with the ssl tls protocol to provide encryption and secure identification of the server

2505890
client-side	server-side
you should validate it with both client-side and server-side ie

2505925
inherited	properties
if you need access to the user array in many controllers that inherited from the systemadmincontroller what you can do is store it as a protected properties of the systemadmincontroller eg

nzmath mpmath scipy and sympy were all taken into consideration as well

2506106
put	get
but after i put the controller out i got the above error so i commented out all the code but i still get the same error

2506111
hash	md5
while i don t know for what purpose you want to use a hash algorithm i d like to say that some collisions have been found for md5 so it might be less secure well we probably can t say broken since those collisions are hard to compute

2506156
postgresql	mysql
i don t remember which version of sqlite it was but i learned the lesson that if you want to have reliable concurrent writes to sqlite database then you better use some other database like mysql or postgresql

2506165
post	get
i had to do a cleaner double post of this one to get the answer

2506193

ostringstream	std
i posted some code to create strings in place here basically a wrapper to hide the std ostringstream and make calling code cleaner

2506359
move	drag
working i can drag move the slider manually

2506376
inherited	properties
not really - you want those decoupled because your business entities will be a good entity model while the service objects will be optimized for the use in the service which may mean other properties composition and inherited decisions

2506382
ubuntu	freebsd
can i build the program for freebsd on my ubuntu computer by changing some build options or i need to build it in freebsd os

2506389
freebsd	linux
you can run a lot of linux programs on freebsd see

i get this error whenever i put more of my gotoxy and textcolor but when putting more printf this error does not appear...well this was not appearing before it just appeared in lately after tons of codes are inputted

2506576
keydown	keyup
currently i do this by manually handling the keyup and keydown events

2506606
ubuntu	linux
in terms of development environment i would recommend that you install a copy of ubuntu linux in virtualbox since setting up a working development environment on that particular distribution of linux is as simple as a single invocation of sudo apt-get install and linux is de-facto compliant with unix

width	height
the code above only needs to rotate by 90â at this time so i m just setting destwidth and destheight to the height and width of the original image

2506763

if you want to rotate over 90 degrees your width and height should be exchanged

2506771
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have four uinavigationcontroller assigned each to a tab in a uitabbarcontroller

2506771
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
each uinavigationcontroller manages a uiviewcontroller which may itself branch out into other uiviewcontroller below it hierarchally

2506771
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
my question is in a case in which a user under one tab has navigated to a uiviewcontroller that hierarchally below the main uiviewcontroller managed by the uinavigationcontroller and then the user pushes a different tab and then goes back to the original tab how can i make it so that the user is presented with the main uiviewcontroller managed by the uinavigationcontroller

2506812
trie	tree
if in-memory efficiency is also an issue you could store your strings in a trie or a radix tree

2506829
folder	directory
for this to work you ve got to have the file in the same directory as adb.exe which is in the tools folder of your sdk directory or have set up adb as a system-wide recognisable command

2506832
client-side	server-side
i am building a framework that will validate forms both client-side javascript and server-side based on a form requirements specification written in json

2506909
std	ostream
if i do std ostream i get the errors

2506920
std	ostream
the ostream class is part of the c++ standard iostream library and is defined in the namespace std

2506920
std	ostream
so you probably should add std before ostream

2506923
std	ostream
as everything in the c++ standard library ostream lives in the std namespace so it s std ostream

2506935
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if you use viewdidappear method it will be keep on calling the mail view.so use viewwillappear method

ostream	istream
i have a function which is implemented in terms of writing the t object to an ostream and a matching function that reads a t from an istream

2507062
std	ostream
you forgot to put std in front of each occurrence of ostream

2507136
int	chars
you need to use an int variable since the range of values getchar returns is a value in the range of unsigned chars plus the single negative value eof

how do you make a flash movie using haxe or actionscript code rather than the ide that supports multiple languages

2507219
octal	decimal
integer can be specified in decimal base 10 hexadecimal base 16 or octal base 8 notation optionally preceded by a sign - or +

2507229
jstl	taglib
the right taglib uri depends on the jstl version

2507229
jstl	taglib
assuming you re using jstl 1.1 which would be the best choice for was 5.1.2 which runs servlet 2.3 you need to specify taglib uri s as per this document

2507231
octal	decimal
check the manual php only supports decimal hexadecimal and octal integer notation but you can use bindec instead

2507231
hex	binary
also keep in mind that each hex digit represents 4 bits so it s easy to convert between binary notation and hex

2507275
jar	war
suppose i have a war and jar projects defined in maven

2507322
pop-up	dialog
the problem is in image two when i click on a choice in the menu the dialog pop-up but it is empty i would like to be able to load the data from my content provider into the edit text in the dialog so in image one it shows donal as the user name so in image two donal should also appear in the edit text in the dialog

2507326
affinity	processors
if i use processors affinity mask then i can control execution of a process on the cores but when i have to run threads on a particular core how can i make these threads core specific

2507335
post	get
well you need to see first what you have written in the page for get and post but i hope you are making sure both requests are sending different contents

2507402
post	get
make sure that the logfiles include all submitted data such as the complete get url with parameters and post with entity body

i am not sure i get the question could you maybe post example data for the source table and also show what the result should look like

2507715
printf	fgets
putting in a printf after fgets yeilds

2507717
put	get
instead use inline functions and you don t have to worry about what you can and can t put in a string and you can get rid of all that unreadable wrapping and -escaping

disk	ram
master key is only ever stored in ram never persisted to disk

2507870
folder	directory
is there any way to annotate the directory so it ends up in the project as a source folder

2507876
jar	war
that is not an acceptable dependency to make a jar plain java code dependent on a war java ee specific application package

2507876
jar	war
if you have code in your war that you are dependent on then that code should be in it s own jar and then both the web app and the jar project would have a common dependency on it

2507908
int	chars
base 2 and 3 for your examples you can easily convert an int to a string of a given base using integer.tostring and map the chars of that string to the symbols

i saw this post only at step 3 i m getting confused he tells to put 3

2508065
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning of richfaces

2508107
lxml	celementtree
while i second the suggestion to use lxml you can get a huge performance boost by using the builtin celementtree

2508112
post	get
but i d just like to run the method without hitting it with an http get or post request

2508160
ironruby	ironpython
ironruby and ironpython are very neat and appropriate for this but as the other answer says powershell may be appropriate if you have a more infrastructure-type thing

2508174
folder	directory
because of this i wanted to put the vb folder into the root of the directory next to the app directory so i can access it directly via .com community - but the htaccess file is getting in the way complaining that it can t find the community controller

2508214
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my approach so far is to target the user-agent string of the the five major desktop browsers msie firefox google-chrome safari opera

2508218
datamapper	activerecord
for a php application with a complex domain model i don t want to use the activerecord pattern i need instead the datamapper pattern as presented in zend framework

2508248
width	height
2 how to increase the height and width of uialertview

2508264
jmenubar	jmenuitem
the jmenuitem of jmenubar drops down to a jpanel added to the jframe but the jpanel erases the jmenuitem

2508282
folder	directory
in the unpacked directory there is a folder entitled lib which contains the packaged .jar files specified as necessary to use jfreechart

2508285
versioning	upgrade
this way those dependent on the service can continue using the existing versioning of the service while some particular dependency can upgrade to the new versioning

2508294
uiview	subviews
a better idea might be to make a custom uiview that you can design in interface builder and have that pop up by adding removing it as a subviews from the current view

2508308
versioning	upgrade
in my days repackaging software for enterprise distribution i certainly made patches transforms and versioning upgrade by methods like you have described with no issues

2508351
lisp	scheme
if you want to learn lisp paip is a better choice to start with because it will teach you a lot about common lisp and a smallish chunk of scheme

2508352
post	get
for that i ve managed to get the source code from snippets.dzone.com post show 5143 and edited it accordingly to my requirements

2508354
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following code that works on firefox and google-chrome

2508354
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome it returns 1 wich is the expected value

2508447
stdout	stderr
i don t want to mix stdout and stderr

2508463
cvs	svn	tortoisegit	svn
if you re a fan of tortoise svn hg cvs etc there is also tortoisegit

2508476
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
the waveform is stored as a instance variable of type nsimage with an nsbitmapimagerep

2508507
migrate	upgrade
so far it looks like the solution is to migrate to apache or upgrade to windows 2008 ii7

2508511
didselectrowatindexpath	viewwillappear
prints well in my viewwillappear in the didselectrowatindexpath and crashes in viewforheaderinsection

2508552
stdout	stderr
awk can t actually see the input from stderr - the pipe only pipes stdout

2508552
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to stdout for awk to see

2508552
stdout	stderr
redirect stdout back to stderr where it originally was

2508552
stdout	stderr
the cshells are notoriously bad at handling stdout stderr

2508565
cpu	processors
the most optimized database server utilizes 100 of its cpu 100 of the time otherwise you re wasting computing resources by having a processors that s sitting there not doing anything

2508577
tolower	toupper
how is a culture different to toupper tolower

2508587
spaces	delimiter
let s assume you defined a word as a spaces delimiter group of characters

2508589
children	parent
also i try not to say anything about the children inside the parent s docblock since the typical parent-child relationship is done as a way to abstract away needing to know the specifics of the children

2508604
folder	directory
edit after some more tinkering it seems that path to file works just as well as long as the file is under the src directory and that copy non-embedded files to output folder is checked in the project properties under flex compiler

2508630
uiview	uiwindow
i have a uiview which is supposed to cover the whole device uiwindow to support an image zoom in out effect i m doing using core animation where a user taps a button on a uitableviewcell and i zoom the associated image

2508630
portrait	landscape
the zooming is performing flawlessly what i haven t been able to figure out is why the subview is still in portrait mode even though the device is in landscape

2508642
mouse	keyboard
they may not have or be able to use a keyboard or mouse

2508674
yslow	pagespeed
check out google s pagespeed and yahoo s yslow plugins for firefox they will give you some decent advice but don t follow them religiously

2508704
width	height
i am currently using a ellipse2d method but that doesn t seem to work and doesn t return a radius as under my understanding it doesn t draw the circle from the center rather from a starting coordinate using a height and width

2508719
ubuntu	linux
however when doing more and more work with php i found myself lost in the internals of linux specifically ubuntu

2508725
opera	firefox
try httpfox for firefox or opera which has dragonfly built-in

2508785
sorting	filtering
the advantage of the list would be that you get sorting and filtering out of the box

2508795
libtiff	libpng	libjpeg	libpng	libjpeg	libtiff
there are open-source libraries for the main formats that you can look at for guidance libpng libjpeg libtiff

2508807
tiff	png
but you ll hit the wall on a compressed format like png tiff or jpeg

2508807
libtiff	libpng	libjpeg	libpng	libjpeg	libtiff
google libpng libtiff and libjpeg to find them

2508814
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2508823
firefox	safari
most browsers safari firefox have good traffic analyzer tools

2508845
accessor	properties
you should still pass them around as variables or at least create properties accessor to get at the backing field

2508854
getter	setter
you should generally use accessor methods getter and setter and keep your internal variables private

2508873
width	height
you have to give it layout by giving it a dimension with height or width or just fall back to the old faithful zoom 1

2508906
profiling	instrumentation
you should see this in your instrumentation or shark profiling most of the time spent in is in turn spent in

2508911
int	double
the intel fpu is 80bits internally floats are 32 and double 64 so converting to float double to reload as an int will lose some bits of precision

2508913
error-handling	exception-handling
so you d need to explicitly catch the exception-handling and generally clutter your code with error-handling

2508953
spweb	spsite
the sprequest warning is usually related to undisposed spweb or spsite objects the best way to avoid this is by doing

2508968
ubuntu	linux
i ve seen a lot of programmers using ubuntu when they needed a linux distro and nearly all of them used it the windows way instead of the unix way

2508969
put	get
i have some height and weight data i want to train my nn so that if i put in some weight then i should get correct height as a output

2508970
put	get
my final goal is to collect data returned by select query into an csv file and put csv file at an ftp location from where client can get it

2509004

2509066
folder	directory
basically i have a file directory code snippet that lets me browse through my htmltemplates folder and am able to select an html document

2509077
serializable	deserialization
datamember field can t be readonly because wcf dont serializable object as-is and every time befor deserialization starts creates new object instance using default constructor

2509079
getter	setter
if what you need is something more complex you might want to create a gen_server process that answer to all config requests getter and setter methods

2509080
int	double
rather than calling them complex types you d be best served thinking int double etc

2509080
int	double
as classes and int double etc

2509080
int	double
if you re doing any type of sophisticated math the class-based numeric representation like int and double will be cumbersome and slow you down - many math operations can only be done with primitives

2509080
int	double
on the other hand if you re trying to put your numbers into collections like lists and maps those collections can only contain objects - and thus you must use or convert to classes like int and double

2509101
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql

2509112
vim	atom-editor
vim has the atom-editor p to match printable characters however trying to do this to match the inverse failed and just left me with every p in the file

2509113
fadein	fadeout
im trying to fadeout the li elements depending on the current page number this number is stored in the attribute actualpage of the parent ul and after fadein those li elements whose page matches with the actualpage attribute of the parent ul

2509173
int	boolean
if you want to setattribute to session you have to use object like int boolean string in servlets

2509219
uiview	uiwindow
this is because as you mention your view has been added directly to the uiwindow therefore when the method to rotate is called for the navigation controller nothing happens to the uiview

2509219
uiview	subviews
the uiview would rotate if it was a subviews of the view controller view

2509243
onfocus	onblur
what about using each input s onfocus and onblur events to dynamically change your submit code as the user shifts focus to and from your controls

2509244
wsdualhttpbinding	basichttpbinding
the service that works uses a basichttpbinding with streaming and the two which don t work use wsdualhttpbinding

2509246
formview	detailsview
just out of curiosity using a formview or detailsview control wouldn t solve the problem you are experiencing

2509305
portrait	landscape	switching	screens
all my app is in landscape mode .in some point i switching to a screens with tab bar controller but it s been placed like in portrait mode.i subclassed the uitabbarcontroller and override the method shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation to return yes always but because the app is already in landscape this method is not being called

2509310
cvs	svn
you could be making multiple changes in hg which add up to just one change in cvs svn so that history will not be kept in cvs svn and you ll have to summarize your commit messages

2509320
children	parent
since they are nested i know i can t save the children before the parent are saved but i would like to save all of the parent at once and then all of the children

2509329
width	height
dijit will try to use your inline styles like width and height to determine the proper settings for its own internal elements

2509439
children	parent
the program meanders around the tree taking all sorts of complex paths following links to parent and children

2509439
children	parent
the program will also grow the tree add new nodes and modify the parent children links of other nodes accordingly the tree never shrinks

2509439
children	parent
but then i have a problem- if i m adding a new node then i may want to lock the node s parent so that i can adjust its list of children

2509450
addition	multiplication
this is not a join set multiplication this is a union set addition

2509492
post	get
when i load the page or do a full postback....i can t get the file to be included in partial refreshes...have no idea why..when viewing the ajax post in firebug i don t see a difference whether i include the file or not..

i am a fan of this page but how do i use stream_get to get the wall post

2509553
min	max
first term is max distance area second min distance it is divided by the complete area and only 1 4th is taken because well aim in the general direction of the hole - not more then to 45 degrees to any side

2509553
min	max
list of clubs and min and max distances they can achive you can also store percentages of bad good hits and apply some randomness for bad hits

2509555
equals	gethashcode
first override the equals and gethashcode methods in your entity objects

2509673
jquery	scriptaculous
jquery is running in no-conflict due to scriptaculous and cufon is initalising correctly generating ready tags in the markup though still no font transformations occur

2509714
svg	vml
the library will handle the cross platform issues of drawing with svg or microsoft s vml

2509749
min	max
the reason for this is that you can happily use common words like min or max without worryign that some standard library has already sued them simply write std min and std max

2509749
min	max
the only problem is if you have a library called mystuff that also has a min or max

2509832
solaris	bsd
if you are looking for reference material you could check out the vfs layers in linux bsd open solaris ..

2509846

but then what is the point of smarty keeping track of all of the post get request cookie server constants if you can t use them in the template without doubling the amount of code you have to write

2509868
children	parent
i have objects in a tree structure i would like to aggregate status information from children nodes and update parent node with aggregated status

2509873

maven	m2e
for the m2e plugin make sure you also install the maven integration for wtp which is optional or you won t get wtp support

2509880
pull	push
you do some work during the day check it in then pull that work to your home repository or push but that requires more work

2510047
int	double
i am looking for a way to ensure that my text field jtextfield jformattedtextfield is returning a double or int rather than a string when i call .gettext

2510077
profiling	benchmarking
these types of benchmarking are very easy to perform using the sql profiling

2510081
allocator	stl
drop it into a test program that uses various stl containers and you can easily see how the allocator is used by the standard containers

2510096
subtract	add
of course i could just add a timer on the client and subtract the server processing time but that wouldn t be very elegant

2510114
folder	directory
thatâ s when a database was considered a directory and each dbase file place inside the directory would appear as a table that exists in a given database thus a database was essentially a folder with files for each table

2510124
width	height
problem the form docked at the bottom edge takes the full width of the form limiting the height of the form that is docked at the left edge

2510124
width	height
i would like the opposite behaviour the vertically docked form taking full height of the form and form docked at the bottom to be restricted in width

2510211
snmp	mib
i think this is a valid snmp mib definitions but wanted to get some feedback

2510213
post	get
what it should get in the post is something like this

2510234
width	height
height 60 | diagonal 123 | width 107 | total sf 13.92 | cost per sf 450 | total cost 6 264.00

2510238
post	get
when reading the other answers trying to use replace i thought i could post this and get someone with mysql syntax experience a few ideas to make a set base solution

2510240
gridview	radgrid
i am using radgrid but i guess this should be applicable to gridview as well

2510271
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
also it was necessary to use objectinputstream instead of datainputstream in the getnewmessage method since the message was sent by objectoutputstream

2510272
tinyint	varchar
by the way instead of storing checked and unchecked in your database as a varchar you can store it as type tinyint 1 and just use a 0 or a 1

2510283
post	get
then when you post you can get the request and set them as needed i hope that makes sense

2510310
width	height
jtabbedpane sets its dimensions to biggest page width height

2510343
postgresql	mysql
i m usually using mysql and postgresql as dbs

2510360
division	multiplication
in your example using gcc the division with the options -o3 -ffast-math yields the same code as the multiplication without -ffast-math

2510390
ready	each
when you are ready to release a combined product just pull from the desired tag for each repository and you ll get the full product release

2510478
put	get
store it in the session but also put it in the get parameters for the page

2510487
width	height
if you don t know what the image width and height are you can set this dynamically with javascript

2510492
pop-up	dialog
if you are just trying to use the microphone and relying on flash to pop-up the dialog to ask the user for permission flash will open a dialog with two buttons allow and deny

2510517
for-loop	arrays
just use a simple for-loop for arrays and nodelists

2510523
for-loop	arrays
you can create a default tant object by calling the constructor with no input arguments and replicate it with repmat to initialize your arrays before entering your for-loop

2510545
pop-up	dialog
start the change password dialog enter some information close the pop-up

2510593
affinity	processors
can we set two threads or two tasks to execute with different processors affinity in a c# application

2510604
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
are stored inside self navigationcontroller i m guessing they are stored there with pushviewcontroller

2510616
post	get
i thought i read somewhere that the bearer method was the one to use for browser post but at this point i m just so happy to get past the first error i hardly even care

2510654
rar	zip
basically i ve created a personal non-commercial project which i don t plan to release that can read zip and rar files

2510654
rar	zip
it can t extract files either so it s really a zip rar viewer if you may

2510654
folder	dir
now i want to populate my raw input into one root archivefolder which will have all the files in the root dir of the zip in the archivefile s arraylist and any additional folder in the root dir of the zip in the archivefolder s arraylist and this process can continue on like this like a chain reaction more files folder in that archivefolder etc etc

2510656
wgs84	utm
for a range of 40km you may find that approximating the world to a 2d flat surface may work although a utm transform would be the ideal way to go - in any case i d advocate using the actual wgs84 co-ordinates ellipsoid for calculations such as great circle distance or calculating bearings

2510662
int	boolean
instead boolean values are stored as int 0 false and 1 true

2510670
int	boolean
instead boolean values are stored as int 0 false and 1 true

2510690
width	height
i ve made sure they re taking 100 width and height inspected the resulting dom layout from my browser and nothing seems to be changed from those properties

this is to try to catch dialog then when pop-up get msg while 5sec

2510702
post	get
however when i post this to the server i get

2510724
post	get
you should try and get the value some other way such as through running the insert on page generation then using an update on the post or something like that

2510729
objectdatasource	detailsview
i m currently grabbing a reference to the object when the detailsview is databound in the objectdatasource selected event handler storing it in session and manually adding entries to the e.newvalues collection when updating fires

2510762
button	checkbox
on a button click you can loop through the listview.items collection using findcontrol to find the checkbox and if checked get the textbox values

2510780
for-loop	loops
the for-loop is better because the scope of the iterator is limited to inside loops

2510797
spaces	delimiter
a line scripter like your suggesting is not very hard to write you could easily use a tstringlist set the delimiter to a spaces set the text property for each line then its a mater of evaluating the first item and dispatching the rest of the parameters on the line to a specific function

2510883
post	get
if your new value follows these requirements and you still get an error post a specific question about the error you re getting

2510884
onmousemove	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmousemove
i have a control which i wrote for capturing signatures on a web page by using onmousedown onmousemove and onmouseup on a div to track the mouse and capture points comprising a signature

2510905
pop-up	dialog
i m using a dojo dijit dialog box to pop-up data for the lightbox effect

2510920
width	height
i kind of worked around width by defining a large value 1000 but height is a problem

2510935
hash	md5
the smallest builtin hash i am aware of is md5

2510959
rss	feed
i m using some php scripts from feedforall to join together rss feed rssmesh and display them as html rss2html

2510992
union	distinct
without the all it defaults to union distinct which causes the rows to be compared for duplicates but the way you have constructed them guarantees that there cannot be duplicates so this extra check is a waste of time

2511009
iprincipal	iidentity
how is the best way to create a structure to store all this information while the user navigates the site i mean on the thread i should be able to check his role his pages the ones he can access i have been reading and there is a lot of stuff there where im confused i saw the membershipprovider iprincipal iidentity etc classes but im not sure what should be the best one for me

2511026
range	max	range	min	min	max
you can also get the keys in a range by using tree.keys min max as described by the zodb btrees api documentation

2511075
hash	md5
use a hash algorithm such as md5 or sha1 then convert the hexdigest via int

2511123
superclass	subclassing
extends bit and that will allow the passed in list to contain the superclass or any of its subclassing

2511136
superclass	subclassing
this will allow a list of any subclassing of superclass

2511145
post	get
problem is - the html i get from the homepage after i send the post command is the default - as if im not logged in - so something is going wrong

2511148
jikes	javac
jikes does a warning but javac gives me an error

2511239
post	get
i originally approached this by creating two separate methods to handle the get and the post methods

2511239
post	get
the post method would redirect the browser to the get method so that any parameters that were specified would be added to the query string and so that the browser would not prompt the user with a dialog saying that it is going to resend the data that they entered if they refresh

2511239
post	get
i would have been fine with keeping two separate methods to handle get and post requests but the identical method signature prevented this

2511269
g++	gcc
gcc g++ version 3.4.5 yes somewhat old is throwing an error

2511270
int	chars
as the user types numbers any other chars is ignored they appear to the left of the caret only length â scale numbers are accepted any other number typed is ignored as the int portion is full

2511319
lisp	scheme
the asterisk performs apply as it s known in lisp and scheme

2511326
unsigned	short
wchar_t is a different type than unsigned short

2511330
ascx	scriptmanager
the telerik control i added requires a scriptmanager so i added that to the ascx

2511330
telerik	radcombobox
the control myidhere referenced in the error message is the telerik radcombobox control that requires a scriptmanager

2511338
width	height
inline elements cannot have width or height

2511355
put	get
i for example often get shown the default apache homepage in german because the webmaster turned on content negotiation but only put content for english in.

2511384
codeigniter	cakephp
using existing php development frameworks like zend_framework or cakephp or codeigniter have ways to do this built-in

2511437
button	checkbox
i would like to check all checkbox in the column when i press the a button and uncheck all checkbox when i press the another one

2511437
button	checkbox
everything is ok but now i would like to check uncheck all checkbox in the gridviewcolumn when i press one button or another

2511520
children	parent
parent window before creating the children

2511537
put	get
for the two arrays just put them in a list and you ll get a list of all their values

2511589
hide	show
so the hide makes sure every table is hidden and the only the one that matches the index i becomes show afterward

2511607
many-to-many	many-to-one
specifically with effective dates and changes even in a simple many-to-one hierarchy it can still make a lot of sense to use a many-to-many link table design

2511677
viewdidload	viewdidappear
if this is the initial controller however it may be easier to start with your root view controller being the data screen and push the presentation screen onto the stack in the datascreenviewcontroller s viewdidload or viewdidappear and used a delayed method to push it after 2 seconds

2511682
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
i leave this as one of the oddities of those java.util.date and java.util.calendar classes

2511728
post	get
you hide the built-in scroll bars with your custom control and instead of calling scrollup down you post windows messages to the area behind your custom control to fake clicks and get the grid view to move around the way you like

2511764
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stderr to stdout at the windows shell level by doing something like

2511768
dictionary	map
i have used an dictionary to map key clb1-items to the corresponding clb2-items

2511769
hide	show
if you want to hide show the element you need to find it within the you re hovering over

2511792
hide	show
you want to hide and show the p element only

2511795
filesystems	ntfs
on windows 7 w2k8r2 you can use findfirstfileex with findexinfobasic the main speedup being omitting the short file name on ntfs filesystems where this is enabled

2511795
filesystems	ntfs
basically they are skipping the filesystems abstraction layer and access ntfs directly

2511902
post	get

the purpose of doing this would be to indicate that two values were linked like constrained width height to an aspect ratio

2512030
getter	setter
getter and setter

2512037
getter	setter
it is easy to consider inlining simple property fetches getter setter but inlining complex methods may result in code bloat

free	malloc
in the face of this uncertainty the safest course is to explicitly allocate new space with malloc release the jni memory and call free whenever the newly allocated memory is no longer needed

2512142
int	double
and even that one has been working for me so long as the elements in the collection were scalars - int double and strings

as for cron being right for the job as long as you have a powerful enough server that can handle thousands of the above cron jobs running simultaneously you should be fine

2512415
firefox	safari
firefox uses googles database of locations while safari uses skyhook so there really isn t anything you can do

2512461
google-chrome	firefox
i did a test in google-chrome and firefox google-chrome with no extension firefox with a dozen

2512461
google-chrome	firefox
so i wonder the benchmark is also influenced by the installed extensions or google-chrome is really so much higher than firefox in performance

2512465
versioning	upgrade
if you do that you won t have to get the gem or the plugin again unless you want to upgrade it to a newer versioning

2512486
jar	war
second running package will invoke jar jar or war war etc depending on the value of the project check the introduction to the lifecycle for more details on this

jar	war
that s one of the big strength of maven you don t need to know if the project is a jar a war an ejb etc and to run the appropriate goal to package it

2512507

i want to generate custom methods in eclipse like the way we can generate tostring getter and settlers right click - source -

2512981
int	chars
hi all is the memory allocated for different types of variable say float int and chars is different for different architecture

2512987
16-bit	64bit
int in particular is particularly prone to that old 8-bit and 16-bit architectures invariably had 16-bit int s while today s 32-bit and 64bit ones invariably use 32-bit int s

2512988
int	chars
it s definitely the case that float int and chars may be of different sizes on different devices yes

2513005
int	double
i finally found the problem with the date difference when i was saving it to a db i used timeintervalsince1970 with an double value but when populating it and setting it to a datepicker i was using a int column type

2513042
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the plan is to do this in apache httpd.conf or .htaccess using something like this

2513114
cout	cin
no this is an explicit way to say cin and cout are declared without actually defining them

2513116
cout	cin
in this case you into your .cpp file and because cin and cout are declared as extern the compiler will let you use them without complaining

2513117
cout	cin
the statements in your example declare rather than define cin and cout

2513147
min	max
you aren t assigning values to any of your max and min variables so they are all zero

2513156
bazaar	svn	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
we are planning to use bazaar as a version control tool over cvs and svn

2513156
cvs	svn
and compared to svn and cvs what extra features does it provides

2513161

post	get
the request was a get redirecting a post would lead to all sorts of trouble

2513323
folder	directory
you re going to need some sort of server side code to generate a list of files folder within a directory

2513330
client-side	server-side
are there are any rules for when to use client-side validation and when to use server-side

2513343
client-side	server-side
you can t count on client-side validation since there are easy ways to go around it so you need to repeat all the validations on the server-side and add new validations if you need for instance using database to add more validations etc.

2513353
uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
i have created a uitabbar and uitabbaritem without uitabbarcontroller on it now i want to know how to place an action on click of the uitabbaritem.what is the method i should use for action on uitabbaritem

2513366
width	height
however you can build your site into a fixed height width element and then centre that element on the page with css

2513366
width	height
i suppose you could force the browser width height with javascript and the onresize event but this will likely annoy your end users

2513429
folder	directory
i have a list box and i want to add a folder directory to that which is at the specified location i have used the code

2513463
namedtuple	dictionary
the namedtuple should not require any more memory according to the documentation than a regular tuple since they don t have a per instance dictionary

what you need to do is define the width and height of your sprite to the maximum space occupied by your objects inside it or greater than that if you want then apply

2513578
textview	imageview
but it will recognize it if it is ontop of textview s or imageview s

2513633
post	get
if you really want to use a full featured ecommerce system you can definitely connect to them through http requests to get post data but that will be a long-term undertaking

2513657
put	get
if anyone still cares i ve put together a little commandline util based on the answers here which you can get at

2513662
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i ve tried adding both a crossdomain.xml and clientaccesspolicy.xml to the service library project but it doesn t help

2513710

to control the coloring of that area put the qtabwidget in a qwidget and set the style sheet on the container

2513829
ant	maven
so my question is what s the most likely difference between an ant build and a maven build that may cause this

2513881
packets	multicast
fundementally this works however the multicast packets all have ttl set to 1

2513885
srp	principles
such a factory is essentially a service locator and i consider it an anti-pattern because it obscures your dependencies and make it very easy to violate the single responsibility principles srp

2513897
cos	sin
has anyone seen this weird value while handling sin cos tan acos

2513915
folder	directory
perform a full checkout of your root directory and create the tags lib folder

2513915
move	drag
next move each of the old lib folders under the new lib folder by using drag drop with your right mouse button

2514024
pascal	delphi

when i show the uiimageview i need to hide both tab and nav bars

2514069
width	height
i want to make a a printable schedule as table with fixed height width cells

2514077
maven	m2e
i usually tend to solve these issues with maven since it really plays well with eclipse using m2e for instance

2514081
versioning	upgrade
we have a program that makes any needed database versioning changes when program is installed upgrade

2514085
content-disposition	content-length	content-disposition	content-type	content-length	content-type
store the actual files outside of the public html area then in your php script simply send the appropriate headers content-type content-length content-disposition and finally readfile the file from the private location

2514254
xmltype	clob
i get the fields and contents by a xmltype xmldom.domdocument etc i can get the field and the content for example in a clob from the xmltype

2514302
firefox	safari
firefox generates filenames such as a5szqrsx.zip.part and safari isn t much better with just unknown

2514308
rpm	yum
i need to upgrade an rpm installed via yum which has an fatal bug in its postun section

2514308
rpm	yum
i know that if i were using rpm directly i could just use the -nopostun option to skip this section but i don t see a way of accessing that option from yum s man page

2514328
implements	extends
public class test_bmp extends jpanel implements mouselistener mousemotionlistener actionlistener

2514328
mouseevent	mouseenter
public void mouseenter mouseevent arg0

2514342
implements	extends
in your case your abstract decorator would extends the decoree and would implements the same interface as the decoree delegating forwarding all method calls to it

2514385
rpm	yum
it looks as though it might be as simple as doing rpm --erase --nopostun to remove the bad rpm and then running yum install to reinstall the good new version

2514407
post	get
http does have a head request as well as the more well known get and post

2514415
hide	show
on click of edit i grab the id show hidden form #noteditor and hide all notes

2514437
put	get
you could put a couple of functions such as getnummembers and getmembersize index etc to get the info you are after .

2514444
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
let me explain for example i made superclass which is vehicle and the subclassing is car so the code to make inherited will be

2514444
implements	extends
public class car extends jframe implements actionlistener

2514451
implements	extends
the variable somedata needs to belong to a class which both extends someclass and implements someotherclass

2514455
google-chrome	firefox

you need advanced feature like show hide compartments re-size etc which are only available inside traditional modeling tools

2514611
width	height
where s is the side of the square pix and width height the dimensions of the window pix

2514613
getter	setter
once you have both getter and setter you can try again to mock out both of them

2514634
hide	show
from experimentation it seems a value of 1 means show and a value of 2 means hide

2514649
width	height
it s dragging up and or left that does not work because graphics.drawoval does not work with a negative width or height

2514660
put	get
so do a get request instead of load and use val function to put data there in your callback

2514745
datediff	difference
then use datediff function to get the difference of days between the checkin and checkout columns in the table room_booking and multiply the difference with the night cost and display the total

2514778
calloc	malloc
compare against calloc instead but also note that malloc and calloc are both available from c++ in the unlikely event that they do prove measurably faster

2514780
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
so firefox google-chrome safari opera etc will ignore these comments

2514786

i want to prevent sending file on hotmail gmail accounts

2514809
put	get
how can i get this to work do i need to put the tab container in it s own update panel which will obviously then contain all the other update panels or should i not use an update panel in the first tab and do a full page postback

2514814
children	parent
so model ejb1 ejb2 and web are children modules of the parent multimodulejavaeeproject

2514817
gmail	hotmail
if that is so then you will probably have to configure your proxy to filter gmail hotmail page requests and remove the html that provides those options

2514817
google-chrome	firefox
if you just mean on your own computer you can get extensions for browsers like firefox and google-chrome that let you do a similar thing

2514817
gmail	hotmail
it will edit your hotmail gmail page to remove the link to add attachments

2514824
jar	war

google-chrome	firefox
using cookie paths is fraught with problems as they are case sensitive in ie and google-chrome but not firefox

2515017
mouse	keyboard
after a bit of research it looks like the office communicator client makes use of a simple audit of keyboard and mouse activity to determine the presence of a user

2515050
ienumerable	ienumerator
another book i found quite useful when i was learning about ienumerable and ienumerator is troelsen s pro c# 2008 book

2515054
versioning	upgrade
if you want to use latest technology and grow with java world you should upgrade your jdk versioning to latest

2515074
folder	directory
in order to download whole directory you would need to look for the files in the folder listfolder method and then download all the files downloadfile for each file

2515084
int	chars
i think the reason is because my ptr is of type chars which only takes one byte but i am trying to store int which takes 4 bytes is the problem

2515090
versioning	upgrade
but to implement accepted solution i need to upgrade to the latest versioning of the client library i.e api 3.0

2515098
sorting	filtering
the sql language offers you under each the order by clause to do the sorting the where clause to do the filtering and the db vendor specific limit offset clauses subselects functions to return only a subset of records based on firstrow and rowcount or lastrow

using parent child relationship where a parent can have children while each child has only one parent does using children.all .ancestor parent.key a good solution where a child is constructed by setting parent parent.key in the constructor

2515149
range	median
something along the lines of having it take a median for a specific range a pseudo-query

2515167
tunnel	packets
gogo6 uses tsp which tunnel the packets to gogo6 infrastructure from where it reaches ipv6 internet

2515189
versioning	upgrade
for example here s a default value per versioning i use to ensure the code copies user settings between upgrade

2515193
folder	directory
this will allow direct access to the community folder which is in root directory

2515212
packets	multicast
winxp sp3 doesn t send multicast bubble packets when behind the same router

2515212
packets	multicast
but at times it sends multicast packets reaches the system in the same sub-net

2515290
put	get
to get the user inputted date taking into account their timezone to match up with the utc corresponding date in the database you should put it through mktime

2515314
daemons	launchd
i have a launchd daemons that runs in the login context of a mac osx 10.6 machine

2515314
daemons	launchd
however i need to control the precise arguments to the agent application very carefully which is why i cannot use a launchd agent like i have for the daemons

2515314
daemons	systemd
i m aware that this is not the recommended apple way of doing things but i don t really have a choice in the matter - the design of the daemons application is pretty inflexible it has to run across many different systemd

2515327
submit	submission
what i need to happen is this when a user clicks submit the jquery validates the input fields and then if the fields have been properly filled-out the original plugin ajax script is triggered submission the data

2515327
submit	submission
i can t seem to find a way to get the jquery script to trigger the ajax function on successful submit and prevent the form from submission in the case that the form hasn t been successfully validated

2515353
queue	fifo
how about writing your own implementations of some collection classes like a linked list a fifo queue a set of even a map

2515374
google-chrome	safari
hoping someone can assist with the issues i am having trying to position this ajax-loader gif file bottom banner centered on all the main browsers - mac google-chrome ffox safari and windows ie8

2515469
children	parent
the query returns what you d expect all children which have the specified parent anywhere in their ancestry

2515502
inherited	subclassing
the problem with multiple inherited is that two classes may define different ways of doing the same thing and the subclassing can t choose which one to pick

2515549
icomparable	compareto
the main problem here is that you explicitly implements the compareto method which only allows you to use it when you use your object as a icomparable object

2515562
innodb	myisam
will be slightly less efficient in innodb and of same efficiency in myisam if you have an index on flagged id

2515628
rss	feed
zend has a ton of libraries for mail rss feed caching auth db etc

2515689
getter	setter
if not you should bind the value to a variable and use getter and setter like so

2515716
g++	gcc
here s some typical function prologue code generated by gcc g++ to be precise first the c++ source

2515717
16-bit	64bit
an int is guaranteed to have at least 16-bit and on 32 bit machines it is usually a safe assumption to have 32 bits but your code may fail as soon as you move to a 64bit machine

2515806
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox and apparently safari and google-chrome will interpret this as a request to the site giving you the duplicate request

2515901

cpu	processors
how to fetch processors cpu flags in c# .net

2515920
ienumerable	ienumerator
deferred eager mean that most of the work will be done on the first movenext or when the ienumerator instance is created for ienumerable it is when getenumerator is called

2515959
ssl	https
apparently it checks the scheme property and doesn t recognize it as https because it just sends plaintext to the 443 port instead of ssl

2515986
pop-up	dialog
also note how the ok button is removed we re going to use to built in button functionality that jqueryui provides for pop-up dialog

2516008
floating-point	integer
about precision issues dx9-class gpus do not have dedicated integer hardware so integer streams are interpreted as floating-point streams with the lack of precision you ve met

2516111
width	height
where m and n are the width and height of the two-dimensional array in your example you have a square two-dimensional array so

2516132
super	extends
don t forget that extends jquery is super easy

2516136
width	height
the height and the width can be customized independently for every columns and rows or can be calculated automatic based to the content of the cells

2516136
width	height
you can change the width and the height of the columns and rows

2516155
post	get
one of these days i ll post a laundry list of questions to get input from others like you ve done

2516157
hide	show
now i want to show a progress indicator view when the user pushes the send button and hide that view when the email view comes up

2516207
updatepanel	scriptmanager
you should look in to using the asp.net ajax toolkit and getting the scriptmanager and updatepanel on your page and using regular .net code to update your gridview

2516230
cvs	svn
unlike svn and cvs in mercurial you can add an ignored file and it overrides the .hgignore -- future changes will be automatically tracked

2516237
hash	salt
if you query your database for the login getting the hash and salt you can tell the user if the login is wrong or the password

2516237
hash	hmac	hash	salt
about storing hash passwords use salt and hmac + sha512 in php hash_hmac

2516252
width	height
in most cases neither image or text fill the whole width or height of the button

2516271

just leave out .show hide or .text if you don t want it show or the message changed whatever you want in each case

2516294
pdfsharp	itextsharp
pdfsharp sharp pdf and itextsharp are excellent

2516319
post	get
i simply needed to use to the request- getparams which would allow me to get post id from the url

2516329
jpa	javax.persistence
i understand that jpa entities are pojos but in order to use it i would have to include a library that implements javax.persistence and the other projects using the same base object have no use for a persistence layer

2516349
getter	setter
you re going to need a private variable to implement this because you have logic in your getter setter

2516354
getter	setter
remember that properties are actually turned into getter and setter methods and you can do a lot of work within their scope

2516411
matplotlib	scipy
personally i think you re better of not using pylab at all just getting stuff from numpy scipy and matplotlib as you need it to keep things organized

2516428
equals	gethashcode
redefines equals it should also redefine gethashcode

2516439
pull	push
compare to standard push pull what is the advantages of using the rebase command in mercurial

2516487

i use some css styling to hide input buttton images and so on but i wonder how can i remove or better modify where what show up on printed page in place of title and page address

2516514
calloc	malloc
if you initialize the array with malloc use calloc instead

2516518
pull	push
normal pull merge push sequence will create a number of commits that are not very useful in terms of the history of your repository

2516521
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode and equals methods work together to provide value-based equality semantics for your type - you ought to implement them together

2516551
springsource	grails
i ve created a grails 1.2.1 application in springsource tools suite 2.3.2 and here is my urlmappings.groovy

all the four public private protected and no modifier is allowed

2516655
getter	setter
adobe livedoc suggests to use the proxy pattern with setter and getter

2516754
interpreted-language	compiled-language
interpreted-language are usually more high-level and therefore have features as dynamic typing including creating new variables dynamically without declaration the infamous eval and many many other features that make a programmer s life easier - but why can t compiled-language have these as well

2516754
interpreted-language	compiled-language
which common features of interpreted-language can t don t do exist in compiled-language

2516760
opencms	alfresco
but on the other hand i also don t feel like using a full blown cms like alfresco or opencms since i think that it is complete overkill for my needs

2516823
mp3	wav
i am looking for a good new component that offers more help with wav and mp3 files too but not found what i am looking for yet

2516834
queue	fifo
an alternative would be to use a queue which the queue is a fifo fifo data structure now it is not thread-safe for access so you would have to lock it but your locking time would be very minimal to put the item in the queue

2516927
freemarker	velocity
you can rely upon template engine like freemarker or velocity or stringtemplate to have on one side your page content and on the other your page rendering

2516951
superclass	subclassing
a class designated with the mappedsuperclass annotation can be mapped in the same way as an entity except that the mappings will apply only to its subclassing since no table exists for the mapped superclass itself

2516967
width	height
the location height and width of the rectangle are saved to disk

2516967
width	height
when i redraw it however the height and width are fine but the location is always off

the .out and .err files are just the stdout and stderr from the invocation of csc.exe

2517077
slideup	slidedown
in ie8 after the slideup slidedown actions are complete the margin between the boxes collapses

2517143
hash	md5
every file you create will have a certain size and a certain md5 hash

2517143
hash	md5
if you want a predetermined size and md5 hash this is not practically possible you would have to calculate all hash to all possible inputs

2517161
hash	md5
unless of course you know the md5 hash of some string and you put that string in the file

2517165
hash	md5
just creating a file with a given md5 hash is difficult enough without adding the size requirement

2517177
hash	md5
md5 is a cryptographic hash algorithm

2517193
children	parent
or is it really that way that all children have to have parent

2517223
width	height
use labels with borders and modify the height width to make them look like lines but this is a hack and won t work for anything other than a straight horizontal or vertical

2517282
listview	gridview
while reskining gridview listview with more columns i ran into a problem that i couldn t change the color of the highlighted row

2517305

2517370
rss	feed
we have the business classes in .net and want to publish rss feed on the asp.net website

2517416
int	boolean
in mysql the false keyword is not a boolean piece of data it s an int constant that equals zero

2517443
rss	feed
here s some vb.net code that i ve used to generate a rss feed from a collection in our bll

2517443
rss	feed
this writes to a file but you could easily use a generic handler .ashx to pass parameters to that would generate the required rss feed on the fly - use response.output for the xml writer

2517519
addition	multiplication
note that this algorithm avoids any math more complicated than addition and multiplication so will likely have much better performance than something that requires trig functions

2517535
for-loop	loops
i have a basic for-loop to loops through buttons and set some stuff and onpress handlers

2517623
google-chrome	firefox

i have list of 200 rss feed which i have to downloading

2517669
rss	feed
when reading in a 3rd party rss feed an xmlexception is thrown due to an invalid datetime in the feed xml

2517670
hash	md5
not being able to find a file with a certain hash is one of the defining properties of a cryptographic hash function such as md5

2517670
hash	md5
while md5 has been broken those breaks only allow you to create two different files images with the same hash but not with a predetermined hash

2517726
hide	show
but honestly that looks pretty simple to implement with a floating div that you use jquery to show hide when the share button is clicked

2517740
int	double
but since it s just a number i have no real way of knowing if it s an int float long double or whatever

2517804
gridview	sqldatasource
now in the details sqldatasource use a sql where clause bound to the selected primary key in the master gridview

2517809
post	get
if the only reason you need query strings to work is to use jquery s autocomplete function i believe there is a way to modify that function to use a post instead of a get

2517809
post	get
how do i set jquery autocomplete to post instead of get

2517825
post	put	post	get	put	get
i need everything that is done by rest including get put post and delete

post	put
it has properties like method post put delete and you can write your payload into the request stream returned by getrequeststream or its async counterpart for high performance

2517888
width	height
according to the syntax and structure section of the jpeg page on wikipedia the width and height of the image don t seem to be stored in the image itself -- or at least not in a way that s quite easy to find

2517888
width	height
the image height and width are stored

2517888
width	height
here s a portion of c code that could help you though decoding the width and height of a jpeg jfif file

2517907
hash	salt
if you want to eliminate any credit card stealing headaches hash them using salt values not stored in the database in addition to salt values stored in the database

2517913
post	put	post	get	put	get
httpclient documents get post put delete head etc.

2517938
width	height
my problem appears to be that when it calls the getpreferredsize for the container the result is just too small the width seems okay but the height isn t

2517964
google-chrome	firefox
thus it will always work in firefox i can t test google-chrome at the moment.

2517978

i have a div element with fixed height and width and overflow hidden and i have a menu that causes this div to scroll to anchors in the text within the div

2518028
versioning	upgrade
what you need to think about a bit is versioning the assemblies and how you re going to deal with upgrade to application a when application b requires parts of application a

2518031
put	get
put all declarations at the top then call some function which will get things going and have your functions below

2518063
codeigniter	kohana
one of the nice things about codeigniter is the excellent documentation when compared to kohana

2518063
codeigniter	kohana
then again kohana is an improved fork of codeigniter

2518115
post	put	post	get	put	get
most web browsers support only http methods like get and post and do not support put and delete

2518119
for-loop	loops
it is referred to as the enhanced for-loop the for-each loops and the foreach statement

2518137
for-loop	loops
the for-loop using index is still useful if you d like to maintain a loops counter for other purposes than getting the item by index

2518137
for-loop	loops
the for-loop using an iterator is still useful if you d like to remove or change elements of the collection itself inside a loops

2518158
g++	gcc
g++ --version g++ gcc 4.4.0

2518181
onkeyup	onkeydown
the currently key events listener provided by android onkeyup onkeydown are associated to an activity so they are notified of the key events if the activity s views are focused

2518232
google-chrome	firefox
firefox ie 8 google-chrome etc

2518244
put	get
the backslash is an escape character so after you need to put 2 in a row to get the actual character to show up in your string

move	drag
but when i tried to drag move it the control wouldn t render itself properly and also goes underneath other controls

2518267
vbscript	jscript
check out this post a jscript vbscript regex lookahead bug

2518274
int	double
if a variable is declared as an int you don t need to use either form of double parentheses you can omit the dollar sign from the variable name as in the double-parentheses forms but you can t add spaces around operators

2518299
ati	nvidia
more useful with nvidia than ati for example

2518338
ienumerable	iqueryable
it makes sense seeing that an ienumerable can t be further filtered but an iqueryable can

2518465
google-chrome	firefox
however if i set display none in the .mp_modalpopup css class and then use .blockui to make it visible in ie 8 the dialogue centers itself vertically but aligns left with half of the dialogue off the page and in google-chrome and firefox the dialogue is not visible at all but blockui is working because the page greys out

2518501
putchar	gets
on the other hand since running is visible only to the translational unit being static by the time the compiler gets to the end of the file it should be able to determine that there is no opportunity for putchar to access it assuming that s the case and the compiler could go back and fix up the pessimization in the while loop

2518523
spaces	delimiter
i have an array in perl i want to print with spaces delimiter between each element except every 10th element which should be newline delimiter

2518528

using the visudo command you could add this to the end of etc sudoers

2518546
temp	tmp
tmp c docume 1 raviw locals 1 temp

2518546
folder	directory
assuming that a newly create java vm uses the environment variable to get the temporary folder location it is not vm s fault that the directory are coming mangled

2518563
post	get
if you do encapsulate as marc gravell suggests the beginning of this post explains how to get your xml to look exactly like you describe

2518593
width	height
basically make .thumbnail not-floated and display inline-block apply width height borders etc. and on #thumbnails_container use white-space nowrap

2518604
versioning	upgrade
i want to upgrade the versioning to use jquery out of the box with cakephp 1.3 and get rid of prototype javascript library

2518607
memcpy	memset
buffer.blockcopy is what i tend to use when i want memset memcpy type behavior

2518607
memcpy	memset
it may be that internally the language calls the built-in classes which in turn are thin wrappers around memcpy and memset

2518633
union	distinct
my approach on this would be find the distinct employeenames you need in your result by making a union between affected tables and then use left joins to get data from both tables thus getting your nulls when you should

2518636
opera	google-chrome
i can download it with google-chrome and opera so probably it s a browser related issue

2518649
int	chars
notice how 2 345.67 was truncated down to just 2 - the comma turns your nice number into a string and now you re bound by string- int parsing rules which drops everything after the first non-numeric chars in the string

2518650
jikes	gcj
since ant 1.6 this attribute can also be used to specify the path to the executable when using jikes jvc gcj or sj

2518700
min	max
your best bet is to use css and set a min and or max width

2518725
children	parent
for our purposes hierarchical data is a collection of data where each item has a single parent and zero or more children with the exception of the root item which has no parent

2518780
serializable	deserialization
this is where serializable or deserialization comes in handy

2518784
jar	war
it may also be used to allow multiple deployments to share the same single jar file instead of having it in each war file

2518837
inherited	subclassing
my line of thought is this since class b is nested inside class a and is private and there is no other class inheriting from class b it should be safe to seal it because it can t be inherited outside class a not even by subclassing of a

2518917
filesystems	fat
useful on broken filesystems like fat

2518917
git-clone	git-init
the default is true except git-clone 1 or git-init 1 will probe and set core.filemode false if appropriate when the repository is created

2518930
fast-forward	merge
git will automatically recognize that this is a trivial merge and perform a fast-forward merge which will add the new commits to the master branch

2518930
fast-forward	merge
a fast-forward merge is similar to what happens when you do an update in svn

2518933
put	get
just got to put in a little elbow grease to get what you want my friend

2518942
floating	right-align
i want the layout so all the labels line up on the left with the label text right-align and the input box all lined up floating to the left

2518960
tabcontrol	tabitem
if you want the exact same look you ll need to retemplate the tabcontrol and tabitem by copying the current template use blend or showmethetemplate to copy the current template and modifying it as needed

2518961
width	text-align
the easiest way is to float elements and set a width and text-align right for labels

2518979
int	chars
the approach i am thinking of is to use an iterator to iterate through the vector and then convert each int into its string representation and then add it into a chars array which is dynamically created initially by passing the size of the vector

2519003
ostringstream	std
you got it right but you can use std ostringstream to create your char array

2519007
qtableview	qtablewidget	qtableview	qabstractitemmodel	qtablewidget	qabstractitemmodel
but qt implements uses mvc for a lot of the classes look at qtableview as opposed to qtablewidget qtableview uses qabstractitemmodel as the model class and there is a pretty strict separation between the view and the model

2519059
setinterval	settimeout
2 javascript settimeout and setinterval are not very reliable when it comes to timing

2519059
setinterval	settimeout
you might want to print out the times that your sound.play call is being made to see whether the irregularities are due to the irregularities in settimeout setinterval

2519134
public	protected
the c++ compiler is not allowed to reorder variables within a visibility block public protected etc

2519136
public	protected
what is the difference between public private protected in ruby

2519168
ienumerable	ienumerator
this class is only visible as an ienumerable of t readonly property and it saves me an additional class that wraps ienumerator of t

2519191
temp	tmp
if you don t want to open any security vulnerabilities by modifying registry settings your application could also create a local copy of the .chm file in the users temp folder tmp and open the help from there

2519195
public	protected
as for what private protected and public mean

2519214
httphandler	httpmodule
then i added the elmah stuff to httphandler and httpmodule in system.web yeah i know this is not for 7.5

2519245
struts	stripes
specially for beginners in web programming or those familiar with action based web frameworks struts 1 webworks spring mvc stripes

2519268
svnkit	jgit
check out svnkit for java and subversion or jgit for java and git

2519280
stdout	stderr	stdout	stdio
in addition standard c programs have already created the stdio files stdin stdout and stderr

2519280
free	malloc
this implies that they are also free ed which implies that they and their buffers were malloc ed which can fail

2519304
width	height
i simply want to specify a height and width and location on my canvas

2519369
daemon	cron	jobs	cron
sphinx is very fast and thinking sphinx is cool but it adds complexity a daemon to maintain cron jobs to maintain the index

2519404
mouse	keyboard
or how are you starting the program via mouse or keyboard

2519422
postgresql	vertica
vertica is based on postgresql especially language-wise

2519467
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
naturally it is only happening in ie and does not occur in firefox google-chrome and safari

2519488
hash	md5
my concern is suppose i generate an md5 hash using a native python string object like this

2519488
hash	md5
then i take a hex version of that md5 hash using

2519488
hash	md5
and send the message md5 hash via a network let s say a jms message or a http request

2519488
hash	md5
then i generate an md5 hash using java like this using the commons codec library

2519503
nhibernate	llblgenpro
llblgenpro v3 will work as a generic designer for a number of orm frameworks including llblgen s own framework nhibernate linq2sql and the entity framework

2519545
width	height
you could enumerate through the default graphicadapter s displaymodecollection property to find the displaymode with the max width height aspect ratio

2519546
versioning	upgrade
our company has been generating pdfs from php using pdflib for many years but have not upgrade since versioning 5

multiplying	add
to do this add 1 to the percentage increase be sure to divide the percentage by 100.0 and multiplying the result by the current value in wage

2519654
google-chrome	firefox
i tend to make liberal use of the firebug extension for firefox or the developer tools built into google-chrome

2519665
fixed-point	fractions
when you are dealing with numbers that have fractions parts and for which inexactness is not acceptable money you must compute using fixed-point math

2519699
qtcore	qtgui
from pyqt4 import qtcore qtgui

2519737
hide	show
having few issues with a jquery hide show item

2519737
hide	show
got a list of images want to show the first one but hide the rest and when the user clicks next the current one is hidden and then the next list item is show

2519769
pthreads	fork
the pthreads fork system call has no native equivalent on windows so cygwin is forced to emulate it in a very inefficient way

2519772
getattr	setattr
note that because myproperty is a property getattr and setattr will be invoking the property s __get__ and __set__ methods rather than actually mocking out the property itself

2519784
spweb	spsite
sadly i don t think this works when copying a folder to a different spweb or spsite

2519811
inherited	properties
unfortunately even if you assign a custom style to the listbox that doesn t include the foreground properties setter it will still fall back to using the default style before attempting to inherited the value of its parent

2519811
inherited	properties
properties value inherited

2519851
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv which is really annoying

2519879

put	get
if you try to put in an invalid name to a domelement you ll get an error

2519962
integer	fractions
this is just a small example to show my problem i am trying to avoid using floating points by making the fractions be a fractions of the max amount able to be stored in that variable in this case a signed integer so 32767 on the positive side because the embedded system i m using i believe does not have an fpu

2519984
16-bit	64bit
as far as i know most if not all processors will hold results for a word word multiplication in a double word -- meaning an 8 bit 8 bit is stored in a 16-bit register s on an 8-bit processor a 32-bit 32 bit operation is stored in a 64bit register s on a 32-bit machine

2519996
division	multiplication
numeric stability is no accident it requires some care in deciding when and how to do division and multiplication

2519999
integer	unsigned
almost any implementation you could possibly meet will wrap around on integer overflow because a everyone uses 2 s complement in which arithmetic operations are bitwise identical for signed and unsigned types of the same size and b wraparound is the defined behavior of unsigned types in c

2520010
division	multiplication
one is to write small muldiv function in assembly language that does the multiplication preserving the high word then the division on that and finally returns the value to c when it s been reduced back into range

2520019
rss	feed
then it will give you a public url to an rss feed of your status updates

2520021
pop-up	dialog
when the listpreference dialog first pop-up the dialog only shows a cancel button

2520027
dns	spf
inorder to utilize that spf record you need to add it to your dns zone file

pull	push
following that suggstion of course will mean that you ll need to have that drive mapped every time you push pull to from the laptop

2520088
fast-forward	merge
the merge was a fast-forward since master was an ancestor of the branch you merge you simply moved master forward to that new commit

client-side	server-side
but if you re looking at learning this with the hopes of it being a career direction or paying job you will probably want to delve into more than just html nobody seems to be looking for people to write webpages that look like they came out of 1998 or 2001 you can get nicer looking stuff that that with almost no html knowledge using wysiwyg tools...once you get the basics of html understood and know where to look up tags and css descriptors you may want to branch out either into a client-side scripting language like javascript or a server-side programming language or framework php ruby on rails etc or trendy web-technology like flash

if it knows it doesn t need reentrancy it can pass in the address of a static struct or array -- in either case a malloc free pair gets saved and such savings do mount up

2520799
innodb	myisam
i think this is what you want if using innodb recommended although you can simplify this with myisam

2520828
free	malloc
returning pointers usually leads to memory leaks as it s easier to forget to free your pointers if you didn t malloc ed them

and use properties instead of accessor

2521773
folder	directory
you shall have to exclude the entire virtual directory or the site folder from revisiting

2521826
children	parent
if you then run sqlmap.queryforobject loadparent new integer 1 or sqlmap.queryforobject loadparent new integer 2 you should obtain a parent object with two children and a parent with four children respectively

2521834
children	parent
so you could have a table containing the data of the parent object and other tables containing fields that are specific for the children

2521885
entity-relationship	diagram
aqua data studio is good but a resource hog and basically pretty sluggish and has non essential features such as the entity-relationship diagram tool which is pretty bad at that

int	double
externc int mylibrary_attr_setparam2 mylibrary_attr_t double

2521962
mousemove	mousedown
i was experimenting with the mousedown and mousemove events when i realized why my problem was occurring

2521962
mousemove	mousedown
in an admittedly silly attempt to avoid writing the same block of code twice i was calling my mousedown handler from within the mousemove handler thinking that certain conditions namely neither mouse button being held down would cause the mousedown handler to effectively do nothing

2521969
temp	tmp
the easy dirty way open regedit locate on hkey_users the asp.net acount buy navigate the tree and look on environment for the temp tmp that have the aspnet temp and just change them and reboot

2522002
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
as kovpas said that subclass your controller from uiviewcontroller instead of uinavigationcontroller you use presentmodalviewcontroller

2522027
realloc	calloc
calloc realloc is left as an exercise

2522030
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
seems that you subclass your controller from uiviewcontroller instead of uinavigationcontroller

2522038
google-chrome	firefox
i can easily compute the complete absolute path for the file i need to open for example open c xampp htdocs controllers foo bar.php when visiting foo bar and i can make sure that eclipse is currently open with the correct project loaded but i m stuck on how i can have firefox google-chrome ie tell eclipse to open that specific file

2522049
post	get
i made such a thing but i used a phase listener a configuration entry in a configuration file that mapped url params to fqn of classes that handle a particular action by action i mean a url param from a get post

2522049
post	get
than the phase listener would parse all the url params from each get post and send each of them to a dispatcher

2522056
width	height
it is now on the beginning of li width and height is set

2522071
post	get
when you have to insert into database or delete sanitize inputs use mysql prepared statements or assert values that arrive via post or get this way

width	height
when the image is resized while maintaining its aspect ratio chances are that either the image s height or width becomes smaller than imageview s dimensions

2522080
range	max
the output range varies depending on the actual kernel used but it s always going to fit in a -max +max range around zero where max is the maximum output magnitude of the filter kernel

2522093
width	height
i can understand the width increasing so the button has space to draw the down arrow but i m not sure a height increase is necessary

2522107
versioning	upgrade
depending on the maturity of webformsmvp you could spend a large amount of time having to re-write sections of your code when the underlying framework is upgrade or when new versioning come out

2522128
hide	show
a simpler approach might be to have all your wizard controls in your markup but dynamically hide and show them rather than dynamically create them

2522195
versioning	upgrade
lastly if you are just switching to spring 2.5.6 then you should consider going direct to 3.0 instead - why upgrade to an already obsoleted versioning

2522315
clang	llvm
the easiest way is to just update to xcode 3.2.1 - using clang then becomes a no-brainer - nothing to install or configure - just set the compiler to clang llvm 1.0 in the project settings

2522330
int	chars
if you are really concerned about speed you might consider first counting chars with int and then obtaining frequencies through float division

2522350
getter	setter
getter and setter for all of

2522382
mp4	h.264
current version of flash can play mov m4v and m4a provided they are only of type container mp4 all quicktime files have litle variation of mp4 but if they contain pure video of type h.264 and audio of aac only then flash can play it

2522382
mp4	h.264
checkout flash video you will need converter to convert them to correct mp4 format since mov etc formats can have video as h.264 and audio as mp3 flash will not play it flash only needs video as h.264 and audio as aac only

2522383
set	bag
if by any chance you have set in the class locationsearchview the following nhibernate would expect to find the locationsearchview class for the defined bag and hence require the 3 columns to map the collection

2522445
submit	submission
however by default the validation plugin hooks up to the submit method on the form and stops there so no matter how you re calling submit it should work already stopping the submission if anything is invalid

2522475
fflush	gets
output the envelope with ack message at the beginning and then fflush the thing so that their server gets it before you end processing

2522505
chown	chmod
how about this set the files to a different user chown and set the group and other rights to read only chmod 644

2522509
width	height
what you need to do is use a single input for just a link and aditional inputs for width and height and filter those

2522533
client-side	server-side
one workaround for ie since you mentioned activex would be to have your application append to the user agent string then check for the existence of this string with your server-side or client-side code

2522579
width	height
the thing is that in this case i have a div that is overflown width a overflow scroll and the div has a fixed height

2522642
rss	feed
however there doesn t appear to be an easy way to find out when people comment - ideally i d like to receive an email whenever it happens but i d settle for an rss feed or similar

sample using vsto excel add-in project and project resource

2522667
post	get
simply pass the session id in a get or post param to the upload script and then in your application do this before session_start

2522669
webkit	gecko
ie webkit and gecko will wait for the last bit before they render anything

2522743
filesystems	ntfs
i find this much preferable to trying to natively deal with the host os s capabilities which is guaranteed to be complicated and error-prone in addition to operating system differences i m sure the various filesystems formats - fat16 fat32 ntfs extfs versions 1 2 3..

2522771

i have a problem using the - void mapview mkmapview mapview annotationview mkannotationview view calloutaccesorycontroltapped uicontrol control method

2522823
tcpdf	fpdi
i am not sure how you added the fpdi and tcpdf to your cake app

2522823
tcpdf	fpdi
i realized what you need to do is import tcpdf then fpdi and then make xtcpdf extend fpdi

2522823
tcpdf	fpdi
because fpdi already extends tcpdf you gain access to tcpdf by including fpdi.

2522968
children	parent
subclass the parent view and pass touches to its children views

2523007
division	modulo
as for why it exists i would guess that it does in part for completeness and in part for the benefit of other languages that may not have easy to use implementations of integer division and modulo computation

2523035
rss	feed
the absolute easiest way is to use your blog s rss feed

2523035
rss	feed

2523080
pull	push
a client wants us to pull down a live copy of their site do some seo work on it and push it back to them

2523083
gif	png
note that if you convert your png files to gif images they are likely to look uglier as gif files can only have 256 colors and do not support alpha-transparency

2523097
post	get
now i have made some integration to a payment gateway where i post some data wait a while and get a post back

2523097

2523124
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

x86	64bit
manually copy the file on 64bit from program files x86 to program files

2523282
hash	salt
certainly a hash is not reversible - but without a salt iv it might be a bit easy to hack

a i ve used xampp for linux successfully on ubuntu

2523350
kate	kde
i use kate just because it comes with kde and has syntax coloring

i ve seen a previous thread best xml parser for java but was not sure if dom4j or jdom is any good for namespaces xmlschema and good support for utf-8 characters

2523414
map	quadtree
because i have implemented a pr quadtree to speed up rendering i thought that i could define some high-priority markers that are always visible defined in the map editor and put them in a queue

2523417
disk	ram
you always quote the lowest supported windows version minimum amount of ram required disk space minimum browser version etc

2523440

uilabel	nsstring
and before you assign this string to the uilabel s text property you can for example use the following method of nsstring to crop the string at a given index your maxlength

2523617
getter	setter
others already pointed that out avoid using setter and getter and use simple attribute access if you don t need to perform additional logic when getting setting your attribute

2523653
uiview	subviews
you could take the actual uiview that the current uiviewcontroller shows and loop through the subviews to get all uitextview s that have user interaction enabled

2523658
button	checkbox
switch off the runtime themes project options application uncheck enable runtime themes checkbox ignore the increased button heights at design time delphi ide uses themes and run the application - you will see normal heights of the toolbar button

2523811

from what i have seen papervision3d and away3d should do much more then 3d charting but i haven t seen any examples on how to draw surfaces in any of them except this line chart in 3d

2523878
width	height
i had to deal with images in my program so i have a lot local variables declared like temp width height

2523885
put	get
once you get into that game it is often better just to put a subagent on the remote device and use standard snmp protocols to get the information

2523885
snmp	mib
you ll re-invent some snmp mib

2523885
snmp	mib
you are probably better off using snmp get-bulk or just doing a mib walk by successively calling snmp-get-next until no more objects are returned

2524028
post	get
when i post the form i only get the file

2524060
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
supports ajax in all modern browsers ie6+ firefox google-chrome safari opera

2524073
converter	multibinding
now i m considering using multibinding with isdeleted as one of bound properties so that converter would be able to figure out which object is deleted

2524079
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
first ftpwebrequest and second ftpwebresponse

2524095
keydown	mousedown
bind the submission to the mousedown keydown event instead of the click

2524106
stdout	stderr
you can redirect the stderr descriptor 2 to stdout 1 by adding for example

2524159
hide	show
you can bind the property visibility of the uielement to the property isdeleted of your object to hide or show the elements

2524174
lisp	prolog
i don t know about open source but i d certainly consider using lisp lenat did or prolog because it has good symbolic manipulation support and eurisko is about symbolic computation

2524176
src	attr
and use #element attr src

2524215
mp3	wav
whether it is playing a wav mp3 file using midi output or just playing beeps doesn t really matter -- i just need something that will enable me to generate arbitrary music client-side

2524216
maven	cargo
the maven cargo plugin can merge war files but i ve never used this outside a testing context where i had full control on what i wanted to merge

2524251
google-chrome	firefox
sessions work fine in firefox and google-chrome but require the use of jsessionid in the url for ie tested 7 8 set to medium privacy

2524260
integer	unsigned
the only time signed unsigned would make a difference is if you would be interpreting it as a number like for arithmetic or if you were to print it as an integer

2524283
width	height
the method resizeimage do the resizing of the width and height respecting the aspect ratio and keeping in a max width and a max height limits

2524284
children	parent
so lets say i have a store of parent children and the parent has a one to many relationship to children parent.children and they all have first names

2524284
children	parent
now on the initial fetch for parent i can specify a sort descriptor to get them back in order of first name but how can i request the children in order

2524285
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
tested on google-chrome firefox ie6 ie7 ie8 and opera

2524326
versioning	upgrade
how do i test the new upgrade to make sure that the current sqlite database and property list files on the earlier versioning do not get deleted overwritten etc

2524333
button	checkbox
i ve ms access db datagridview that displays items two checkbox columns that represents yes no columns in the db and refresh del button

2524333
button	checkbox
when i try to delete a row that its checkbox hasn t been modified the row delets just fine also when i modify the checkbox value press refresh button then delete the row deletes fine too

2524371
width	height
i always get image with both height and width having same values 100

2524389
portrait	landscape
having no end of trouble including a large landscape pdf in a portrait .tex document using pdflatex

2524406
children	parent
if i read your question correctly you want to set up a fetch that returns a sorted list of the children of a specific parent

2524406
children	parent
in the last line the parent variable should be a reference to the nsmanagedobject instance of the parent whose children you want

2524422
width	height
if the width and height are always equal then this would make sense

2524424
width	height
width and height are integers

2524424
int	double
you will be performing int math on these values before storing them in your double

2524457
qabstractitemview	qabstractitemmodel	qtreeview	qabstractitemview	qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
qabstractitemmodel qabstractitemview for example qlistview qtreeview and so one

2524457
qabstractitemview	qabstractitemmodel
it seems that your application thinks that some object is qabstractitemmodel or qabstractitemview descendant whether it is not and tries to connect a slot to its datachanged signal

2524459
crypt	hash
1 you can use symmetric encryption instead of hash crypt function is hash - in this way you would have possibility to decrypt it

2524460
serializable	deserialization
so when the object is first loaded i create a deep copy using serializable deserialization and save the copy to a separate field

2524649
margin	height
css is it possible to get a div that is 100 height less a top and bottom margin

2524654
set	bag
for manytomany changing entity collection type hashset set won t affect the mapping to bag .it only works for hasmany

2524654
ilist	icollection
ilist icollection maps to bag

2524660
integer	unsigned
will it warn you if you pass a 32-bit unsigned integer to a lu format

2524683
width	height
when the device is rotated and onconfigurationchanged is called we d like to be able to get the scrollview s new width height

2524683
width	height	portrait	landscape
on our droid we expected to see the scrollview s width go to 854 when switched into landscape and to 480 when switched back to portrait and the height do the equivalent switch minus the menu bar

2524683
portrait	landscape
clearly we re getting the portrait dimensions when we switch to landscape and the landscape dimensions when we switch to portrait

2524760
button	checkbox
i have a checkbox with id terms and a submit button in my form with class registration

2524760
button	checkbox
i would like the submit button to be disabled initially and then to be toggled on and off whenever the user toggle on and off the terms checkbox

2524760
pop-up	dialog
i would also like to have a confirmation dialog pop-up when the submit button is clicked and that if it is confirmed the submit button will be disabled again to prevent duplicate clicking

2524783
opera	firefox
this works for me in firefox and opera the whitespace is all over the place in ie

2524785
tinyint	boolean
i have a boolean field in my rails app - that is obviously stored as tinyint in mysql

2524795
maven	m2e
i am also using a maven project allowing m2e to manage dependancies

2524813
equals	tostring
the danger i think microsoft wants to avoid here is people writing a ton of extension methods that redefine equals and tostring

2524860
inline	inlining
in the second place if you do have a problem with function call overhead you should declare the functions in question inline instead of using macros to do the inlining

2524868
tiff	png
you can also use tiff or png png has lots of parameters i think you also can tell it to do uncompressed

2524936
hex	binary
hex editor vs hex editor- not so useful for huge binary files - eg

2524962
post	get
i m trying to get pre post annotations working with a web application but for some reason nothing is happening with spring-security

2524973
hash	md5
i would also suggest storing a hash md5 of the file in database

2524989
post	get
if you are using 2.5 or higher you should probably look into the spring mvc annotations which allow you to make any class be a controller with as many controller methods as you like which can absolutely include some that handle post requests -- dosubmit -- and some that handle get requests

2525012
width	height
you can use it to accomplish what you want by checking the rectangle s width and height against your circle s width and height if they match the circle is completely over the rectangle

2525036
terminate	timeout
each instance of the worker thread attempts to gain an exclusive lock on the file it was initiated with until some timeout elapses if the lock is successful it processes the file if it s unsuccessful it either retries as necessary throws an exception and terminate itself

2525044
post	get
please get to the end of this post to see that most profiling tools that point out statically allocated memory errors are usually correct

2525045
width	height
i d say the simplest way to do this is to set the center of the view to be at the center of it s superview which you can obtain from the superview s height and width attributes

2525109
decoder	encoder
don t worry about it in other words the utf8 bytes are just bytes and whatever you re using as an encoder decoder will do the right thing

2525132
pop-up	dialog
on my subcontract entry page i d like for there to be a pop-up dialog box where the user can enter a new company if the company isn t already in the drop-down list

2525156
free	calloc
you allocate it inside the function with calloc but the the caller must free it using free

2525157
post	get
when you access the request collection like that it looks for both post and get parameters checking both request.form and request.querystring

2525157
fiddler	charles
use a proxy tool like fiddler or charles to inspect the request as it leaves the browser

2525162
ant	maven
database activity archiving and rule processing are perfect uses for ant or even maven

2525185
int	chars
main and int main int argc chars

2525189
free	calloc
and if you allocate an array dynamically in a function via calloc and return it it is up to the caller of the function to free it using the pointer that the function returns

2525216
ant	maven
note that it is is a full ide not a command line tool like maven or ant

2525238
width	font-size	width	height
then put the new div wherever you want the preview to appear and style it however you want it to look shrinking the height and width of the div the font-size of the content and also the height width of any images it contains

2525244
put	get
i put some log commands into the oncreate function in the tabactivity as you see and they all get written into the log...i have no idea what i m doing wrong here

2525279
accessor	properties
then call base.trackchange string object in each properties accessor upon which you are interested in change

2525279
accessor	properties
the flag is there because basic state initialisation of the object means that properties changes set accessor calls may be made until the object is fully hydrated the first time

2525280
mockups	balsamiq
balsamiq has an excellent tool for doing mockups of interface designs

2525300
updatepanel	scriptmanager
you can add a little snippet of code using the scriptmanager to execute after the response comes back to the updatepanel

2525331
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on firefox or google-chrome but on internet explorer 7 the condition is always false because the browser sets the property this way

2525331
google-chrome	firefox
and the right way is the following firefox google-chrome

2525364
hide	show
i need to split somehow some html data a text with html tags into two parts and hide the second one with a show hide link

2525364
hide	show
we don t want t to show long ones so one of the options is to show a teaser with a show hide link

2525368
google-chrome	firefox
and this has to work in firefox google-chrome and ie6

2525369
ffmpeg	avisynth	ffmpeg	libavformat	avisynth	libavformat
i would suggest using something like gstreamer or avisynth since they will abstract away a lot of the ugly details decoding video scaling and translation video syncing audio mixing audio syncing video output encoding that would be required if you just used ffmpeg s libavformat and libavcodec directly

2525389
jar	war
packaged file jar war etc.

2525408
int	double
for example what happens when w is int but autoclass get n-1 returns a double or worse something totally incompatible

2525416
put	get
should i put them in different service classes and get a unique url for each version

2525446
stdout	stderr
.communicate read data from stdout and stderr until end-of-file is reached

2525492
jtextfield	jlabel
i am using both jlabel s and jtextfield s and need to be able to truncate my doubles to two decimal places when they are displayed by the application

2525519
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
when you use an aggregate-functions avg sum count min max you need to group your query by the other attributes you are selecting

2525561
jboss	weblogic
i don t know if the specification defines naming restrictions for the ejb modules in an ear but the version part of the filename was what weblogic did not like if modified the war works fine on jboss

2525576
post	get
currently i am sending my get and post requests the same way

2525584
ddms	adb
going back to your original problem check the logcat output via adb logcat or ddms to see if there are any messages from the garbage collector right before the oom fired

2525595
sorting	grouping
subquery is more efficient for myisam since it s heap-based and grouping by would require sorting and or materialization

2525621
getter	setter
i m using synchronized in my setter and avoiding it in my getter because in my app there are a tons of data gettings and very few settings

2525644
irc	xmpp
im trying to write a program that would be listening for data simple text messages on some port say tcp 6666 and then pass them to one or more different protocols - irc xmpp and so on

2525658
firefox	safari
this works perfectly in firefox and safari but not in ie..

2525663
put	get
if map was volatile and you created a new map for every put then that could be made to be safe without synchronisation on the get

2525672
for-loop	arrays
you could use a for-loop to iterate over the arrays until you find the first that is greater than the one you re searching

2525680
post	get
ok i didn t get a single response to this post so here is how i worked around the problem hope it helps someone

2525747
min	max
max and min latitude and longitudes for supplied distance

2525747
min	max
3. loop through results and remove all with lat lng outside max min

2525748
post	get
use post for requests that modify something get for requests that do searches or simply get documents

2525748
post	get
when processing a post request never respond with a document but instead redirect the user to a get request that contains the form submitted or whatever answer you want to give

2525762
freebsd	linux
basically i run this program in linux and maybe freebsd

2525785
folder	directory
my basic question was if it was possible to go up a directory when using createobject component dot path from index.cfm to mycomponent.cfc if the name of my project folder is not static across all installs of the project

2525788
viewmodel	caliburn
you may want to take a look at some alternative mvvm frameworks such as caliburn that take a viewmodel first approach and break this coupling

2525844
pull	push
when you are up and running you can push pull to another repository via the team push pull menu item

2525889
installation	upgrade
i had some trouble when i upgrade to karmic - the plugin installation dialog was only half-functional

2525906
ctime	posix
posix atime mtime ctime

2525988
hash	md5
your technique of receiving the password in plaintext and storing its md5 hash is not very secure

2526019
google-chrome	firefox
i have firefox google-chrome and ie8 installed

2526019
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox and ie8 i don t see the after if alert

2526040
rss	feed
recently i created an rss feed generator for an asp.net application

2526138
jboss	glassfish
websphere as glassfish jboss are all concrete java ee api implementations

2526185
subtract	add
for each of a b c and d you can either add it to the total subtract it because is exactly the same as or leave it out

2526289
google-chrome	safari
works in ffs and google-chrome but not in ie8 or safari

2526295
onclick	onsubmit
it was working fine when attached to the onclick handler of the button but not on onsubmit

2526297
subtract	add
for each time interval for each square for each color channel subtract the two intensities take the square and add it all together if you need to detect clips that might be small parts of other clips it gets a bit trickier but the general principle of calculating feature vectors should work

2526305
stdout	stderr
i have a system set up that s been happily running r from a java servlet spawning processed hooking into the process s stdin stdout and stderr streams as in the second andwer to this question

2526315
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i have tested the functionality in ie7 ie8 firefox 2 firefox 3 opera and google-chrome and everything works fine

2526360
public	protected
notice the guidelines only specify usage for public and protected fields

2526363
invokelater	invokeandwait
building on max gontar s observation that the exception is not thrown when using invokelater instead of invokeandwait the full solution is to implement invokeandwait correctly out of invokelater and java s synchronization methods

2526371
public	protected
as a personal aside i tent to prefix private variables and methods with _ and then camel casing protected variables and methods in camel casing and public variables and methods with pascal casing but that is just me

2526372
google-chrome	firefox
however everything works on firefox google-chrome and ie8

2526515
lwjgl	jogl
opengl renderer via jogl or lwjgl

2526524
disk	ram
i significantly increased the performance of eclipse under 32-bit windows by creating a ram disk using the portion of the os-unadressable memory as illustrated here

2526579
post	get
as this url is modifying some data anyway it should not work with get but only with post

2526583
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
you could allocate the memory using malloc or calloc so it doesn t get free automatically

2526615
post	put	post	get	put	get
first get request shouldn t be used to alter states on the server so for your vote service i would recommend post put

2526670
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython ironruby jython jruby

2526688
memcached	apc
if you just want to cache elements something like memcached or apc s cache is the way to go

2526688
memcached	apc
apc has the advantage of being more readily available you should have apc installed on your servers for the opcode cache if you care at all about performance and memcached has the option of letting you have a cache that s accessible by multiple webservers and or multiple caches

2526699
sorting	filtering
thats mostly filtering sorting and paging lists

2526700
maven	pom.xml
i have a single configuration file which i would like to include as a dependency in a maven pom.xml

2526700
jar	war
looking at the types allowed in the pom.xml i only see things like pom jar war ear .

2526701
cvs	svn
in constrast if a project is using svn or cvs anyone who s had a taste of dvcs is going to be hurting - and they ll want that git-svn hg-svn utility

2526701
cvs	svn
there are a lot of projects out there using cvs svn still so plenty of demand

2526757
zlib	libz
libz zlib compression

2526767
photoshop	fireworks
the reason i would choose mockapp over all the other solutions is that i would assume most already have either powerpoint or keynote on their computer compared to photoshop or fireworks though i m sure if you have those applications on your computer it may be better to use those

2526776
inherited	properties
when only setting the attachedtemplate properties your newly created document will not inherited any content from the template at all

2526777
lisp	scheme
i have been writing common lisp macros so scheme s r5rs macros are a bit unnatural to me

2526781
ubuntu	debian
on debian and debian deriviatives like ubuntu you can use apt-file to find out what package to install given a filename

2526798
post	get
or if you only want to get rid of method post do not render home template in your view but set cookie and redirect user back

2526813
post	get
if this is the case the easiest way around your problem is to do a response.redirect to the same page - so when the user presses f5 it will reload the get request to the page instead of the post

2526813
post	get
if you press f5 this time a get request will be issued as opposed to a post

2526813
post	get
if get and post aren t enough for you you can use other methods to change states in your application

2526813
post	put	post	get	put	get
you may have heard of restful architecture which basically uses the http methods get put post and delete as they were intended

2526831
mp3	speex	wma	speex
speex is designed for speech and should perform better than wma mp3 or other audio codecs that are designed to handle music if you are just encoding speech which i assume since you are grabbing from the mic

2526849
post	get
this is passed via post to fbml pages and via get to iframe canvas pages

2526880
pop-up	dialog
since moving to windows 7 iis 7.5 the debug assertions do not prompt a pop-up dialog anymore

2526880
cassini	iis
i have tested this in a separate project and noticed that they do work when using the integrated visual studio developer server cassini but they do not work when using iis web server

2526881
vim	emacs
edit i m beginning to be sure that the behavior i want can be implemented in emacs vim via either custom highlighting or by messing around with the font itself

2526890
post	get
however when i post back to the page for some action i get an error

2526945
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this behavior is not the same on a non-mobile device it works fine in firefox safari google-chrome

2526965
hash	hmac
an hmac hash message authentication code is not encryption it s hash function in this case sha-256 plus some secret key

2526974
qlist	qhash
i stumbled about a method which seems to be present in all data objects like qlist qqueue qhash .

2526974
qlist	qhash
but what effect does it have on the qlist qqueue qhash .

2526979
width	height
make sure you set the proper width and height on it

2526990
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
the problem is that when i add the uilabel as a subview of uiwindow it will not automatically rotate since it is not a subview of uiviewcontroller uiviewcontroller automatically handles updating subviews during rotations

2526990
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this way the label could be displayed on top of the uinavigationcontroller s bar while also automatically being rotated since it is a subview of uiviewcontroller

2527047
next	except
my next thought was ok the except operator will do the trick

2527050
hide	show
however i also want to show and hide the control elements when they aren t relevant

2527050
min	max	hide	show	hide	scrolltop
i was noticing it always took one more click than it should to do my show hide so i dumped scrolltop to screen using the scrollto post effect callback onafter and found that when the content has reached either extreme that scrolltop is reported to be off still by x amount and doesn t hit the max min until that next click despite the fact that the content is positioned at it s max min

2527130
int	chars
it s not so much a language syntax but a common shorthand for converting a chars or int into quasi-boolean

2527130
int	boolean	int	chars
and so on can act on int chars etc as there is no boolean type however according to the standard they are guaranteed to return 0 for false and 1 for true

2527132
mouseover	mouseout
the mouseout and mouseover functions will will apply to all elements returned by your selector

2527132
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
lastly you should use mouseenter mouseleave in preference to mouseover mouseout since you don t want your hide event to fire when you enter the span element

2527138
mouseover	mouseout
i have a website which uses jquery and lots of mouseover mouseout effect

2527141
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for dlumma

2527267
put	get
all that it s doing is put the previous episode so i get view id 3 if the episode i am watching is 4

2527271
put	get
i don t think i should need an ioref just to get a value out but i needed place to put the file contents

2527282
next	except
the next step from your code will be to write a function to get the rest of the list except for the maximum take care to handle it correctly if the list has duplicates.

2527356
daemons	systemd
from that you can then send messages to the systemd to which you intend to propagate detailing the mst and the bundle to fetch whereby that script daemons begins transfer

2527370
hide	show
i have a menu with submenus that can be toggled hide show type deal

2527370
hide	show
i hide show submenu when clicking on a header and change a style of the header so the background arrow will change up down

2527381
mouseleave	mouseenter
i d use the jquery events to prevent your flicker they provide a bit more intelligent firing here mouseenter and mouseleave

2527381
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can use hover mouseenter mouseleave like this

2527383
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have a bunch of list items in an unordered list styled for a navigation menu and in firefox google-chrome safari and opera things work fine

2527385
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+	filesystems	fat	hfs+	ntfs	fat	hfs+
also mercurial has a naming system in its repository to prevent filename collisions if you use it with a case-insensitive filesystems like fat ntfs or hfs+

2527385
matplotlib	scipy
numpy scipy and matplotlib do most of what i need

2527400
post	get
post - redirect - get

2527407
fold	catamorphism
functional language have fold catamorphism instead of visitor and anybody trying to use visitor in a functional language would be viewed as a dangerous lunatic

2527446
gridbaglayout	miglayout
for this i suggest on the use of miglayout which is an incredibly powerful layout manager easy to specify layouts directly in code or with the netbeans ui designer mattise which uses gridbaglayout and writes the .java files automatically with insertion points for your own code for responding to ui events and such

2527451
free	strdup
oh and if you do use strdup be sure to call free to free temp before you leave the function

2527458
ostringstream	std
use std ostringstream with std string

2527458

2527737
int	double
this test returns true due to the inexact representation of the large int in 64-bit double i am assuming but actually is false if i could tell the xslt processor somehow to use int64 rather than the default 64-bit double for the number data since big int is the actual data type for numbers in the xml input

2528281
int	double
to continue the example the int and double wrapper classes are subclasses of number which both wrappers can be upcast to

2528281

2531113
width	height
i am not entirely sure what you mean by dynamic height and width but as far as i know you need to specify width and height either in pixels or percent of the surrounding element and i don t know of any way to let the size of the swf decide like you can do for example with an img tag by leaving out width and height

2531140
width	height
i had a look on msdn and looks like the wmp object model has some properties which might give you the height and width

post	put
finally you post the data that you have from attachments above to your own freshly generated upload url using urlfetch.fetch with method-post and a payload in standard application x-www-form-urlencoded encoding for the form that the user would be filling in if they were uploading the data directly which is the normal way to put data in the blobstore -- you can use urllib.urlencode to prepare the payload

2531388
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if here i set the width of table.uitbetaling and table.uitbetaling img table.uitbetaling td to the same value both 496 or 498 the problem in google-chrome and safari is solved however in firefox the right side border is than blank

getter	setter
of particular notice is the fact that scala always go to the fields through getter and setter even on other methods of the same class

2531477
ilist	icollection
however if you can use a more specialized type - icollection ilist etc

2531483
svg	vml
use raphael.js mit license - it give you canvas-like api using svg and vml for ie and works in all amjor browsers including ie6

2531486
ienumerable	iqueryable
especially as the ienumerable or iqueryable returned by the query enumeration should only contain one item

2531494
treeviewitem	menuitem
for example the framework uses hic as the base class for both treeviewitem whose header is the item at hand and whose items are the children of that item and menuitem whose header is the menu item and whose items are any sub-menu-items for example in a drop-down or pop-out menu

2531496
inherited	properties
there s no itemssource properties since it can have only a single child or two children if you count header in just like the class it inherited from - contentcontrol

2531501
min	max
i want the box width to be at least 191px min and maximum 450px max

2531502
metaphone	soundex
i m aware of soundex and double metaphone but these don t let me test for the similarity of words as a whole - for example hi sounds very similar to bye but both of these methods will mark them as completely different

2531515
int	chars
ptr chars i which i think means a pointer to a chars at address of where i is sitting so if an int is 4 bytes say abcd are we talking about a or d when you call chars on that

2531517
post	get
if you re familiar with reddit you ll know how all of their post containing pictures get a small thumbnail preview beside the title of the submission

2531520

when you execute such a prepare statement only the statement id and the parameters are transferred not some query string as if you would replace the placeholders by the actual parameters on the client-side your php script

2531583
next	except
the scripts almost works except for not waiting long enough to receive an ip it cycles to next step in the until loop too quick

2531623
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
really the decision comes down to whether you pay for a fully managed subversion repository that is pre-configured such as that offered by cloud forge or beanstalk or whether instead you pay for an infrastructure-as-a-service iaas cloud hosting service such as compute engine amazon-web-services ec2 or azure for a virtual machine and take responsibility for the setup of the subversion server on that virtual machine instance take responsibility for the security and access control of that virtual machine and take responsibility for the domain name ssl certificates etc

2531627
apache	nginx	postgresql	mysql
apache thin nginx sqlite mysql postgresql many parsing libraries rmagick tcp ip etc are c programs used by ruby

2531650
maven	pom.xml
right now i m writing a small java application by my own with few maven pom.xml files

2531701
width	height
one thing you can try is put a uiview with the color you want and position it above the uiwebview with the same width and height

2531722
post	get
if you have control over the web service then you can get it to either reply with a json or use a rest web service as well as a soap web service as javascript can work well with rest or with a form-based post get web service as opposed to soap

2531724
punctuation	words
e.g. if you have a list of words sent that make up the sentence shorn of punctuation and lowercased for simplicity is all you need to make a list of non-stopwords -- could hardly be easier right

2531750
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
c functions deal with dynamic memory allocation only malloc calloc realloc

2531766

2531808
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is based on safari so if you can find a plugin for safari you should be able to use this in google-chrome

2531841
cvs	svn
since it is a generated file it is not typically stored in a revision system such as git svn mercurial or cvs rather the .ac file would be

2531904
width	margin
how i can increase the width of the line numbers right margin

2531922
integer	unsigned
there may also be differences in floating point and unsigned integer representation but most systems and file formats now use ieee 754 and two s-complement respectively so compatibility issues are far less frequent with those types

2531929
getter	setter
finally you can create a read-only property by giving it a getter but no setter like this

2531934
background-color	font-size
however there are differences between the ie way and the standard way for example the ie element.currentstyle property expect that you access the ccs property names composed of two or more words in camelcase maxheight fontsize backgroundcolor etc the standard way expects the properties with the words separated with dashes max-height font-size background-color etc

2531946
jboss	glassfish
to answer your question more directly though just look into the difference between a servlet container like tomcat and a full java ee application server like glassfish or jboss

2531990
oncreate	onstart
however oncreate will indeed be called and your application can call onstart from there

2531997
udp	tcp
in the end at the levels where java will operate there s either udp or tcp

2531997
udp	tcp
if you can deal with udp s limitations you ll find it faster and if you can t then any lightweight tcp wrapper of which http is one is just about the same

2532058
portrait	landscape
how to rotate the screen to landscape or portrait by programmable way

2532114

2532187
rss	feed
a is the url a valid rss feed

2532188
jar	manifest.mf
however you can add a class-path deploy.jar attribute to your manifest.mf and require that your jar be run with -xbootclasspath a myjar.jar

2532192
fflush	gets
it can be related to some kind of buffer that only gets fflush ie sends data when

2532275
ssl	https
this will usually happen when you are sourcing some of your page via ssl using the https protocol and some of it from regular http protocol most likely images or script or css files

2532328
post	get
in the pdf page i can use post to get the detail

2532339

cgi fastcgi and scgi are language agnostic

2532477
fastcgi	scgi
flup is another way to run with wsgi for any webserver that can speak fastcgi scgi or ajp

2532495
int	boolean
i have some configuration blocks that i read from a file int boolean floats and

2532495
getter	setter
the fact is that i have many such config parameters 15 or so and writing getter and setter seems an unnecessary overhead

2532503
public	protected
it sounds like you just need to make these members protected - that way they can be accessed by derived classes but are not public

2532508
fastcgi	scgi
fastcgi scgi and ajp run the web app as a separate process daemon and pass messages between the web server and it

2532513
folder	directory
earlier when i installed the application in a new virtual directory report was not getting shown then i ve copied aspnet_client folder in my newly created web application root and the report was then made visible

2532536
merb	ruby-on-rails
mod_fastcgi was usually the option for ruby-on-rails merb and other ruby based web frameworks but they are superseeded by mod_rails and mod_rack which are esource-friendly

2532564
int	chars
i ve written chars counter c extension to python looks like 300x faster than collections.counter and 150x faster than collections.default int

2532693
opengl-es	glreadpixels
but before calling it we need to call glreadpixels with gl_depth_component and that is not possible in opengl-es

2532703
post	put
make sure ie isn t caching the response from your request put this before your post calls run

2532704

matlab	simulink
is there anything i can do with code in matlab for digital image processing that i can t do with simulink s digital image processing toolbox or vice versa

2532712
jobs	cron
cron jobs will run with a much reduced environment

2532727
getter	setter
this is probably overkill but it illustrates how you should create getter setter in python and achieve the functionality you want

2532754
jsf	seam
since seam is built on jsf it has large number of ui component libraries to pick from

2532783
stdio	fflush
so if you are going to use stdio in both the parent and child then you should fflush before forking to ensure that there is no buffered data

2532783
stdout	fflush	stdout	stderr	stdout	stdio	stderr	fflush	stdio	fflush
in particular avoid printing the error to stdout or stderr using any stdio function write is ok and then call _exit or _exit rather than calling exit or just returning which will fflush any buffered output

2532816
width	height
but i have no idea how to store values of each square in mysql when each user can have area with different width or height

2532842
accessor	properties
maybe just restrict your design to a single class with your critical accessor and another more generic named properties method ie

2532858
put	get
when you put everything in one grid with span columns and or rows - you would get a hard to manage layout

2532893
int	boolean
generally speaking basic int and boolean types are usually value types and everything else is up in the air -- some languages make strings values and others treat them as references etc

2532971
comparator	comparable
the way to sort things according to some order is to create a comparator which knows which of any two things are first according to the order or to let the thing itself implement the comparable interface so you do not need the comparator

2532998
multiplying	add
i would like to be able to seamlessly add and multiplying polynomials and regular numbers but i can t make change-class accept a number

2533006
domxpath	domdocument
if you want to use xpath to find specific elements nodes either simplexmlelement xpath or domxpath which you would use with domdocument as pointed out by cletus you have to register the namespace first

2533044
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
a decision was made to remove mono support from the main sharpdevelop application since only support for compiling with mono was provided and monodevelop can now run on windows

2533044
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
note that mono support in sharpdevelop does not provide any integrated debugging with mono s debugger and there is no gtk# designer compared with monodevelop

2533062
getter	setter
the getter and setter among many other useful functions are generated for you similar to a struct

2533095
rsa	aes
the standard python library implementing common ciphers like aes and rsa is pycrypto

2533140
hamcrest	lambdaj
in his last release lambdaj implements it with a smart use of closure and hamcrest matcher

2533187
hamcrest	lambdaj
if you find the native java switch construct is too much limiting give a glance to the lambdaj switcher that allows to declaratively switch on any object by matching them with some hamcrest matchers

2533190
hamcrest	lambdaj
if you find the native java switch construct is too much limiting give a glance to the lambdaj switcher that allows to declaratively switch on any object by matching them with some hamcrest matchers

2533272
for-loop	arrays
just do a regular for-loop from 0 to the size of the arrays

2533274
codeigniter	cakephp
the most popular php frameworks cakephp symphony codeigniter etc. all have routing code in them which you might be able to use or might serve as inspiration

2533277
post	get
even back as far as netscape 2 you have always been able to transfer information to any third-party site through simple get and post requests caused by interfaces as simple as form.submit new image or setting window.location

2533279
apache	nginx
if you use nginx as a proxy server in front of apache you can use its memcached module to serve cached html output directly from memcached

folder	directory
when i try some other directory it says the directory has no tools folder so i ve searched for a tools folder but none of those found of 15 or 20 appear to be android

2533361
public	protected
since you make the names public in the derived class anyway so derived classes of derived will be able to access them you could make them protected in the base-class too and omit the friend declaration

2533375
copying	overwrite
copying the given pointer s data psrc to that char arrat cbuff overwrite the stack frame s data which will result in a possible exploit

2533377
accelerometer	gyroscope
i managed to get the quaternion through the accelerometer but i cant figure out how to do it with the gyroscope

2533388
width	height
how can we tesselate a rectangle recursively into rectangles such that their aspect-ratios max height width width height approach 1 as close as possible

2533392
subtract	add
checking hasattr c __eq__ would be misleading as it might erroneously catch a per-instance attribute __eq__ defined in c itself which would not act as a special method note that in the specific case of __eq__ you ll always see a true result from hasattr because ancestor class object defines it and inheritance can only ever add attributes never subtract any

2533400
int	chars	range	minimum	16-bit	64bit
the requirements in the standard just give a minimum range for the type -- 8 bits for chars 16-bit for short and int 32 bits for long and in c99 64bit for long long and every type in that list must have at least as large a range as the preceding type

2533441

this response uses simple one-character namespace prefixes for most things such as s for soap envelope a for ws-addressing o for ws-security etc

2533974
wsse	ws-security
upon receipt of my response message the java client and wss4j seem to want to look up elements by their own internal xml aliases such as wsa for ws-addressing and wsse for ws-security extensions

2533979
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
use a for-loop structure opposed to a while to loops over each element of the arrays

2534020
for-loop	loops
the whole point of this was to set up a clean foreach loops for use in my program not to use that ugly for-loop

2534045
post	get
that post explains how to get all pids running on a windows machine you d have to compare the output of the cmd call with your pid instead of printing it

2534073
public	protected
i ve always wondered on the topic of public protected and private properties

2534073
getter	setter
i should note here that using public vars is not in my habit i adhere to the principles of oop by utilizing getter and setter

2534091
getter	setter
therefore you d create a public setter getter with some logic check if something is null or any other calculations instead of accessing the private variable directly and always having to handle that logic in your code

2534092
postgresql	mysql
other searches include using keys and indexes which might lead you to postgresql for it s rock solid acid compliance or mysql with innodb

2534095
public	protected
the whole point is to use private and protected to prevent exposing internal details of your class so that other classes only have access to the public interfaces provided by your class

2534105
getter	setter
note properties in smalltalk are simply getter and setter methods.

2534111
width	height
you don t actually need to specify its height and width in the include as that s already defined in the imported layout file

2534127
exponent	modulo
i m trying to port a piece of java code into .net that takes a base64 encoded string converts it to a byte array and then uses it to make a x.509 certificate to get the modulo exponent for rsa encryption

if i m guessing right what you get back is an unsigned integer of the form 0xaarrggbb so

2534139
pull	push
option 1 pull push

2534164
tcpclient	networkstream
as i m sure you re aware you send and receive data via the tcpclient using its underlying networkstream object

2534186
getter	setter
i m going to assume you mean instance variables since you mention getter setter

2534316
lisp	smalltalk
those languages should include ones that have vastly different assumptions about how people express problems say for example the set smalltalk perl c lisp java

2534316
emacs	textmate
perl people tend to like vi or emacs ruby people tend to like textmate java people tend to like eclipse or intellij

2534342
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
when you set up your uitabbarcontroller you should add uinavigationcontroller rather than your uiviewcontroller subclasses

2534481
width	height
this gives me a form that can only be 200 width but the default 0 for height seems not to work

2534484
firefox	safari
firefox and safari also offer scrollbylines and ie has doscroll but the scrolltop property is cross-browser and simpler to use

2534487

2534563
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari i get this correct output

2534582
simplexmlrpcserver	xmlrpclib	simplexmlrpcserver	socketserver
you can use straight sockets in which case you can use socketserver or you can rely on an existing protocol like http or xml-rpc in which case you will find ready to use library packages with plenty of examples xmlrpclib and simplexmlrpcserver

2534612
int	boolean
interlocked is limited to simple operations on int long and boolean and such

2534623
min	max

when i subsequently do subtraction addition and comparisons between these dates i have to keep the gmt offset around and everything gets worse if the phone switches locale settings from when the date was parsed to when the date is displayed.

2534825
junit	testng
the idea is to create two executions of the maven-surefire-plugin one for junit one for testng

2534825
junit	testng
you can disable one of testng or junit per execution by specifying nonexisting junitartifactname or testngartifactname

2534840
free	malloc
undefined outcome plus malloc doesn t call constructors and free doesn t call destructors

2534851

2534883
jar	.war
i am not bundling any jar files into my .war file deployed to jetty

2534944
distance	mercator
for example in a mercator projections segments far away from the equator represent less actual distance than segments near the equator of equal length

2534963
phong	shading
also please keep in mind that opengl s phong shading does not follow the phong shading model strictly because the normals are calculated per vertex and then interpolated inside the triangles they are not calculated per point on the surface

2534993
equals	compareto
with the way i designed the compareto method is that the result will be that they are equals

2534996
sorting	filtering
filtering and sorting paging are the easiest and if an autocomplete textbox or paged list grid can achieve the desired result go for that

2535012
submit	submission
you can do javascript validation by using the submit button to call a javascript function instead of submission the form

2535077
google-chrome	firefox
the library should handle web sites that use javascript ajax and it should return the correct html as if i were viewing the source from within firefox google-chrome

2535119

works with both junit and testng

2535132
pop-up	dialog
i d like to validate the format of email address entered and pop-up an alert dialog if the format isn t correct

2535143

you can use eclipse to compare jar war files

2535143
jar	war
i m using indigo it seems eclipse only support jar comparison hence i have to rename the war extension to jar to get eclipse to do the structural comparison

2535165
try-catch	exception-handling
the only way to deal with this is to wrap all of the activity in a try-catch block and save any exception-handling that occurred which is exactly what the backgroundworker does

2535186
width	height

is there any possible way to create a slider that will create a range similar to what is done with one handle using min max only instead of min max starting the range from say 50 on a scale from 1-100

2539601
range	min
only instead of the range going from the min going off of where the handle is and allowing the user to slide either left or right of that fixed starting point to create the range

2539604
slideup	slidedown
i thought i was getting close - i can get the sub-menu to slidedown but when i hover over it i ve had to mouseout on the parent li triggering a slideup

2539645
toggleclass	each
i have a bunch of div s with an anchor in each that when clicked expands the the div s width using toggleclass

2539666
put	get
it handles everything internally avoiding useless locks on the map and saving you a lot of work you won t have to care about synchronizations on get and put

2539679
addclass	removeclass
and for performance sake just use addclass and removeclass instead of toggleclass

2539682
uiview	subviews
i just want to draw it to another uiview s bitmap the same way as it appears when adding as subviews

2539689
google-chrome	firefox
running php debug session in netbeans always opens as a new tab in browser i use google-chrome and firefox

2539718
interpolation	splines
the control points of the bã zier splines can be determined by linearly interpolation between the control points of the b-spline in an appropriate way

2539803
ready	each
each developer is changing schema by creating upgrade procedures this is how we have rebuild and upgrade ready at the same time

2539826
tcplistener	tcpclient
you could look into the socket class or the simpler tcpclient and tcplistener

2539834
apache	nginx
anyone have a clue why this would work under linux with nginx and not under macos with apache

2539842
innodb	myisam
innodb can store actual data in its buffer pool unlike myisam - so try setting this value innodb_buffer_pool_size to be large enough to accomodate your data

2539868
post	put
there s a link there to a post i put on the metro java.net forums that was helpful to me

2539901
filtering	grouping
the type of products should still flow through and be accessible and the regular grouping filtering shouldn t mutate the type that is flowing through the extension methods

2539978
width	height
i need to be able to store the current height and width of a div at any point in time

2539981
accessor	properties
first implement a static accessor properties on a class called myoperationcontext

2539994
width	height
if you are using a control you might try setting the height and width

2540000
apache	nginx
nginx uses epoll or other multiplexing techniques select for its handling multiple clients i.e it does not spawn a new thread for every request unlike apache

2540059
dot-product	transpose
i d have to transpose each array to nx1 and that s pretty lame since i d be doing it for every dot-product calculation

2540073
put	get
this design is pretty nice because the threads will no longer have to compete for a lock to update data and since the map is confined to a single thread you can simply use a plain hashmap to do get put etc

2540101
put	get
imagine building the table of contents toc then clicking on each heading subheading to get a separate window where you put the content

2540146
getter	setter
however the name property in the iidentity interface is read-only the iidentity interface specifies a getter but not a setter for the name property

2540181
superclass	subclassing
now subclassing of a can override getmember to make the superclass use a specific implementation of isomeinterface

2540208
httphandler	httpmodule
it is possible to write httphandler or httpmodule which give you more flexibility without requiring asp.net mvc

2540215
libs	buildpath
i am not sure what you mean with creating a wrapper module and why you would like to do it but normally you just drop the libs the jar files in a project folder which is covered by the project s buildpath aka classpath or to manually add the jar files to the project s buildpath

2540233
sorting	filtering
now however i need to parse the entire dataset ie all entities and all their attributes in order to provide a sorting filtering algorithm based on the attributes

2540244
post	put
so using put in a form method would generate invalid html and i m reasonably sure the browser will execute a post instead of a put anyway at least that s what ff 3.6 did when i tried to change the form method to put

2540244
post	get
if you want to get information out of the url just change the form method to be get instead of post

2540251
button	checkbox
when i have a set of either checkbox or radio button i often need to have an other choice

2540274
16-bit	64bit
the bios is usually not used once the kernel is loaded and depends on a 16-bit execution environment as opposed to the 32- or 64bit protected mode environment that a modern kernel operates in

2540296
apache	nginx
i found out that the cause of my problem was not the proxy between nginx and apache but rather was an issue with apache itself

2540306
getter	setter
properties in java a property of a class is something that is accesible via getter setter method setxxx getxxx property xxx tipically but not necessarily corresponds to a private field

2540326
getter	setter
it seems that setting and getting the visible property is asymmetric the setter seems to place a flag in the control but the getter to return a calculated value which depends on the visibility of the outer elements and the visibility of the control itself

2540367
jobs	cron
you may use cron scheduled jobs

2540393
free	malloc
i am thinking of replacing new delete with malloc free and use mallopt to tune the way the memory is being released to the system

2540438
put	get
wsdl does exist on server side and client does read it when i put wrong url for wsdl i get an error

2540492
onfocus	onblur
add handlers to the control for focus events or better override the methods for onfocus onblur

2540561
realloc	malloc
using malloc realloc will not help this

2540598
children	parent
so basically it might load the dependencies parent children etc which is definitely not desirable

2540608
webclient	httpwebrequest
you re looking for the webclient class and perhaps httpwebrequest

2540625
nant	cruisecontrol
i m not complaining about nant ivy or cruisecontrol at all as they ve been brilliant in helping our team of developers become more sure of the quality of their code but it just seems strange that these tools are very popular yet we re all re-inventing the ci-wheel

2540710
hide	show
if you re simply trying to hide some type of functionality you could mask the application with something very simple like an app that showed a slide show

2540722
extjs	ext.net
then in the partial view note these are coolite ext.net controls which generate extjs code

2540779
profiling	debugging
it s worth noting that the vm will execute more slowly with profiling enabled the interpreter has overhead on every method call and return and it s running in the slower debugging interpreter while native code continues to run at full speed so you have to be careful when drawing conclusions

2540782
getter	setter
the main usage scenario would be the one you describe a property with a public getter but private setter

2540804
post	get
first a h commandbutton fires a post request not a get request

2540884
postgresql	mysql
i m more of a ms-sql postgresql guy but i m working on a mysql project

2540916
ironruby	ironpython
the dlr currently supports ironpython and ironruby plus a number of other language implementations can be found on codeplex

2540929
onfocus	onblur
of course there s no need to have a counterpart as the onblur took care of it the counterpart of onfocus

2540967
listadapter	listactivity
i m writing unit tests for a listactivity in android that uses a handler to update a listadapter

2541009
inherited	properties
my end goal is to create a container that is reusable but inherited all properties methods that i ve specified throughout the chain

2541019
post	get
you can make this query a little bit more efficient by running a maintenance procedure that would get rid of the overlapping ranges on a timely basis like described in the post and rewriting the query like this

2541032
firefox	safari
to find out where particular element inherits its style from open firebug firefox or web inspector safari select the element and you will see list of its styles and their origins

2541095
invokerequired	begininvoke
although i recommend using invoke or begininvoke after calling invokerequired of course you can prevent the cross-thread exception altogether by calling this from your form or usercontrol

2541109
put	get
get them to start their work and put their results on the queue

2541117
stdout	stderr
if you want stderr instead of stdout rather than stderr and stdout you can do the following

2541117
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr 2 to stdout 1

2541166
getter	setter
an initialize method uses reflection to find the object and property and stores the property getter as an and the property setter as an

2541189
short	base
in short i used it when i have to program in .net but need access to a c++ code base

2541206
getter	setter
you could obtain delegates directly representing the getter and setter method

2541240
post	put	post	get	put	get
the only reason why you should be putting a verb force_delete into the uri is if you would need to overload get post methods in an environment where put delete methods are not available

2541275
free	malloc
we affectivly just call malloc free on the objects we want to create

2541296
hash	md5
if an attacker had sql injection in your application then they could obtain the md5 hash and the user name and login immediately without having to break the md5 hash

2541350
post	get
i messed around with your code some but didn t get a full answer but figured i d post what i have anyway

2541353
gridview	repeater
i got a list of customers i thought i would list in a gridview or a repeater with customer html it gone have paging

2541362
realloc	malloc
if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the

2541362
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call

2541362
free	realloc
to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

2541369
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
calloc malloc or realloc function

2541369
free	realloc
by a call to the free or realloc

2541392
width	height
how do i make this a certain width and height in a new window when the user clicks on it

2541450
aggregate-functions	sum
but this is where the aggregate-functions sum count average etc... come into play select id playername sum score from table group by playername

2541480
equals	gethashcode
so i disabled my implementation of equals gethashcode and it worked just fine

2541483
sorting	filtering
in addition to providing fields and filtering for locations it also offers basic proximity filtering and sorting features

2541495
hash	md5
the attacker could use this vulnerability to obtain your extremely weak md5 hash crack it and then login

2541507
dictionary	map
the include template tag can take a variable containing the template to include so you could loop through a sequence containing the various sub-templates and include them in turn maybe using a dictionary to map friendly names to template filenames

2541546
ant	maven
when i need the libs i retrieve them using maven or ivy ant tasks

2541556
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
most browsers ie9 google-chrome safari use h.264 though currently firefox only supports ogg when using the video tag

2541599
fflush	gets
when a command like play pause or seek is called while the videodisplay is unresponsive it gets put on a queue how do i fflush this queue so the most recent command is the only command processed

2541638
uiview	subviews
it s rigged so the subviews change colour but they change colour when they are not even touching and when they do touch the wrong uiview are changing colour

2541668
portrait	landscape
for example the teapot jumps 180deg as the device viewing angle crosses the horizon and it also rotates spuriously if you tilt the device from portrait into landscape

2541690
maven	cargo
i m not sure how you access jetty configuration in cargo but in the normal jetty maven plugin you would do something like

2541698
cldc	midp
i know that blackberry and nokia provide their own api s that go above and beyond what is specified in midp cldc or any of the jsrs for java me

2541746
superclass	subclassing
referring to a subclassing from a superclass is not a good idea

2541784
inherited	subclassing
it s interesting that no-one has mentioned one of key benefits of delegation - it s preferable to subclassing when you realise that inherited is not a magic bullet and usually creates more problems than it solves

2541787
hash	salt
if you want them to be really secure you could salt them with the user s id and then sha1 hash them base64 encode the result and then use that as the value

2541817
prepare	execute
b stored procedures cannot execute prepare statements from concatenated strings using so called dynamic sql statements nor can it return results with more than one distinct row

2541853
for-loop	loops
how can i use that many labels and goto s inside a for-loop without causing an infinite loops

2541879
awt	swing
that s not even a good idea in awt let alone swing

2541879
awt	swing
other than get all the awt swing stuff on the right thread part of the fix should be to get the listener check state to see if it should execute its body rather than attempting to remove and add the listener

2541883
libs	buildpath
if this is done correctly then eclipse will automatically include the server s libs the server is actually a concrete implementation of under each the servlet api in the project s buildpath

2541887
folder	directory
it creates a new directory in the beginning and moves 10 files into that directory then creates a new folder again and moves another 10 files into that directory and so on

2541892
ostringstream	std
just use std ostringstream so you don t have to manage the char

2541926
opera	firefox
firefox and opera will not support h.264 unless the war is lost but might or might not afterwards using gstreamer with directshow quicktime providing the nonfree codecs

2541926
mp3	ogg
1 system codecs gstreamer probably free codecs ogg good chance of many non free codecs including h.264 mp3 either bought from fluendo or packaged with non free linux cd computer or installed by user possibly slightly illegal but common easy little chance of punishment

2541926
opera	firefox
5 in mobile firefox fennec planning to use gstreamer i think might use it everywhere ala opera later on

2541964
inherited	subclassing
is there a way to generate accessor methods for the subclassing as shown in the inherited mapping above project task etc... without doing it manually

2541967
httphandler	httpmodule
but after reading about them i m still no closer to an understanding of what problems i would solve with an httphandler or httpmodule

2542023
super	abstract
of course one could imagine super interesting behavior that takes all sorts of abstract parameters but requires a ton of information to be able to call it

2542082
n-gram	words
if you do not use a library that does it for you you can optimize queries by looking up the most globally infrequent characters or words or n-gram first in your indexes

2542084
post	put
hey guys i was scanning my site for security and i noticed that it was possible for non users to send requests and post information so i decided to put login checks on all information post

2542087
for-loop	loops
if this test precedes loops it will prevent execution from reaching the for-loop if filesraw is empty

2542100
folder	directory
question is how do use a basic rescursivedirectoryiterator to display folder and then run the filteriterator to only show the php files in those directory

2542118
salt	md5
every bridge that i did made me choose the main sign-in app based on the password encryption since if you have a script that has md5 passwords encrypted and another vbulletin you want to connect to you d surely go with the main script as the main sign in due to vbulletin s salt password encryption

2542133
hide	show
i m working on a small problem where i m trying to show hide a panel based on two criteria

2542137
draggable	droppable
but i have a problem dragging to a droppable that is smaller than the draggable

2542153
mouseleave	mouseenter
i d bind the image source to a property of the code behind and capture the mouseenter and mouseleave events to change this property

2542157
superclass	subclassing
fine but these are all subclassing of a common class so if i leave their superclass as non-abstract i should be happy so long as i can get its manager to return objects of the proper class

2542283
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in google-chrome but fails to execute properly in firefox

2542348
rss	feed
i am pretty sure it has to do with the xmlns but i need this code to work with both this style and normal style rss feed no xmlns

2542367
goto	break
i have seen goto used to break out of nested loops

2542369
inherited	properties
all user defined properties are enumerable including the properties inherited from prototype

2542372
superclass	subclassing
this sort of extends itself type parameter is used to let the superclass refer to the subclassing in places like method parameters and return types even though no actual specific subclassing is available when the superclass is compiled

2542374
affinity	processors
you can t set processors affinity for specific threads

2542376
google-chrome	firefox
as wesgarrison commented console isn t always present in firefox like it is in google-chrome and you ll get an console is undefined error

boost	stl
stl and boost can fill in gaps

2542443
nsstring	nsdata
the array holds nsstring nsdata and cgpoint values

2542486
base-class	derived-class
yes passing a derived-class instance to a function that takes a base-class reference is ok

2542486
public	protected
your example compiles for me though and doesn t look like it should produce that error -- an inaccessible base class generally refers to something that was extended via protected or private inheritance rather than public inheritance

2542510
submit	submission
i checked the entire form post and unfortunately the submitted fields are identical to the perl script processing the form submission no matter which submit button is clicked so the perl script can t differentiate which action to perform based on which submit button is pushed

2542576
post	get
this is all well and good for the get request but upon post the value is going to be which when you assign to that decimal gets unhappy very quickly and ends up shoving a 0 in there

2542576
client-side	server-side
i d much rather this be done server-side than client-side

2542583
cobertura	emma
yes coverage tools like cobertura or emma

2542610
children	parent
when i kill the parent daemonic process not a worker with a ctrl-c or sigterm etc. the children don t die

2542627
openssl	libcrypto
openssl comes with a libcrypto library which is commonly used to perform standalone encryption outside of an ssl context

2542685
g++	gcc
you re compiling a .cpp c++ program by invoking gcc instead of g++ .

2542721
777	tmp
i ve set 777 permissions on app tmp

2542722
hide	show
do not show preview of videocontrol hide make it s size as zero ...

2542747
super	self
since my class decorator creates another subclass a decorated class seems to prevent the use of super when it changes the classname passed to super classname self

2542779
superclass	subclassing
just wanted to confirm that i m not headed for future trouble by using self in the superclass phonenumber and using that to execute class methods on subclassing from the parent

2542791
postgresql	mysql
all the sql solutions out there and in particular mysql and postgresql are solid and documented for performance usage quirks

2542794
implements	extends
public class swingcapture extends panel implements actionlistener

2542810
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome seems to like them all but safari firefox and ie all have problems with various icons

2542817
inherited	subclassing
for instance instead of a decorator to replace your class with a subclassing introducing some methods perhaps you want a mixin class and to use multiple inherited to create the final class

2542857
width	height
the image is the same width height as the canvas

2542867
sharepoint	cqwp
it has has the cqwp which enables you to build custom interfaces which perform well in sharepoint

2542874
cldc	midp
i am using cldc 1.0 and midp 2.0

2542893
post	put
if i can put together something concise which reproduces the issue i will post

2542902
int	double
it s generic so it supports int double strings etc

2542904
int	chars
chars is an ordinal type like int and the compiler only knows how to add them in the most basic of ways

2542930
oursql	mysql-python
i hear oursql is nicer the mysql-python

2542945
folder	directory
go to spring installation directory and include all of jars in the following folder

2542952
coalesce	isnull
edit according to omg ponies coalesce could be used instead of isnull to make it work across sql server mysql oracle etc

2542966
folder	directory
i just downloaded fckeditor and dropped the folder into my root directory but i don t know how to install the fckeditor into my forms

2543037
folder	directory
heroku s file system is read-only but you can use the tmp and log directory from within your application folder

2543075
width	height
create a dynamic bubble that expands on height and width depending on the amount of text in the bubble

2543075
width	height
in a so article they described utilizing the measurestring function to figure out the exact width or height so dynamic changes in the .cs to the width and height can be accomplished

2543107
put	get
if you put the inline function s definition into a .cpp file and it if it is called from some other .cpp file you ll get an unresolved external error c++ faq lite from the linker

2543150
getter	setter	public	protected
the members are protected but there are public getter setter so they re essentially public

2543175
cairngorm	flex
i m using flex with cairngorm framework

2543223
jar	war
instead of sepearate jar s for each project i built a single war directly with all the classes of all my projects

2543236
opera	google-chrome
opera and webkit based browsers google-chrome winsafari seem to fail

2543238
getter	setter
apart from type compile-time type safety do the type specific getter setter have any dis advantages or is it ok to use getobject setobject everywhere

2543256
superclass	subclassing
so any late-bound reference to that name like the one you have in its super subclassagain call will of course get the subclassing that s masquerading by that name -- that subclassing s superclass is of course the real subclassagain whence the infinite recursion

2543256
base-class	subclassing
you can reproduce the same problem very simply without decoration just by having any subclassing usurp its base-class s name

2543262
versioning	upgrade
if you have upgrade your opensolaris zpool to a newer versioning for example to take advantage of deduplication you won t be able to do it

2543268
keydown	keyup
as for handling ctrl-z one of the key event handlers keypress keydown or keyup is what you are looking for

2543296
rss	feed
however it seems that adding an rss feed to outlook for the url elmah.axd rss or elmah.axd digestrss bypasses the authentication

2543296
rss	feed
what s the point of securing the handler if someone can guess the rss url and subscribe to a feed of the error log

2543335
mp3	flac	mp3	wav	wav	flac
it s pretty easy to find libraries to tag mp3 files with id3 tags but i m more interested in lossless codecs like wav and possibly flac

2543370
ubuntu	linux
but i d also like to know for ubuntu linux

2543419
flac	ogg	flac	speex	speex	ogg
assembly to read and write ogg tags vorbis flac and speex

2543446
actualheight	actualwidth
on the textblock you will find the properties actualwidth and actualheight

2543507
rdf	owl
to put it more precisely is there any product that leverages semantic technologies esp rdf owl sparql and is delivering functionality performance maintainability which would not have been possible with the existing no-semantic technologies

2543536
translation	localization
best practice for localization in silverlight is to use resource files holding the translation keywords

2543537
profiling	benchmarking
if so benchmarking the code with some real data and profiling the routine to work out where the time is going

2543556
yourkit	jprofiler
most profilers like yourkit and jprofiler support eclipse integration

2543563
profiler	visualvm
personally i would use visualvm or netbeans profiler if possible

2543569
resharper	justcode
refactor your code use a tool like resharper justcode etc to tidy it up a bit

2543581
windows-ce	windows-mobile
i am looking for any idea to protect my programs windows-ce and windows-mobile

2543584
httphandler	httpcontext
i am using httpcontext object implemented in httphandler child to download a file when i have non-ascii characters in file name it looks weird in ie whereas it looks fine in firefox

2543585
rdf	owl
rdf sparql itself is interesting because it gives you pretty rich querying right off the bat but when you add an owl ontology in it gets even better as it means that you can answer richer queries that ask questions closer to what the user â and their employer â really wants while allowing the service providers to express what they re offering more clearly too

2543637
kerberos	ntlm
httpclient does not support kerberos ntlm authentication for proxies etc..

2543643
put	get
for the stream cipher you would get the same number of bits out that you put in - so the binary logarithm of your input alphabet size would make sense

2543657
filtering	grouping
i would consider logging to a different medium like a database table that enables filtering and grouping log data

2543676
post	get
i also want to use the authorisation they have provided to get basic user details profile pic name etc and post status updates

2543738
oncreate	onstart
in your oncreate or onstart or what not access the stored object by calling getlastnonconfigurationinstance

2543739
post	get
to fetch the data you can use the httpwebrequest class this is an example i have to hand but it may be slightly overdone for your needs and you need to make sure you re doing the right thing - i suspect the above to be a get rather than a post

2543788
post	get
i want to get a list of post ordered by the date of the latest comment

2543826
subobject	instances
creating an instances of a root object which then creates subobject etc. is a good way to bootstrap your object graph

2543835
freebsd	linux	openbsd	linux	openbsd	freebsd
this code prints out 1 as well on openbsd and freebsd and gives a segmentation fault on linux

2543835
x86	64bit
the article assumes linux on x86 but it looks like you re using windows and your system could be 64bit although you can switch gcc to 32-bit with -m32

2543841
postgresql	mysql
- n-grams bigrams trigrams can do a lot see for example all the options in postgresql internal search compared to mysql or mssql

2543864
jobs	cron
to automate this you can use the magento cron jobs

2543866
getattr	setattr
since classes are themselves objects you can access their attributes using setattr and its cousins hasattr and getattr

2543877
switching	screens
in addition it would be great if a control screens or even an entire project can switching skin theme for example one theme for intranet and one theme for internet

2543885
post	put	post	get	put	get
when i test my controllers the rest methods get post put delete give me an undefined method error

on the other hand myisam has support for full-text search which innodb doesn t support but you can get around that by building your own search capability using lucene or some other library

2548576
memset	memcmp	memcpy	memcmp	memcpy	memmove	memcpy	memset	memmove	memcmp	memmove	memset
there may also be hidden calls to memcpy memmove memset and memcmp which are in the libc so you may have to provide your own versions which is not hard at least as long as you are not too picky about performance

2548717
innodb	myisam
with some appropriate triggers on the innodb table you could update the myisam copy relatively easy

2548739
put	get
unless there is a pressing reason not to i would extend map and use put and get instead of setvalue and getvalue

2548768
gridview	repeater
if you have a nested repeater or gridview too i m sure you need to alter mark brackett s answer to look like this or else you ll get a run-time error about not being able to find a control with the name of rpt

2548770
put	get	simplecursoradapter	autocompletetextview
i was using a simplecursoradapter to bind to the view but i discovered that there was no way i could get the id of the autocompletetextview from an onitemclicklistener which i needed to put additional information from the selected row in a variable depending on which autocompletetextview it was from

2548770
simplecursoradapter	autocompletetextview
so i subclassed simplecursoradapter and added an int to the constructor to identify which autocompletetextview the adapter was from and i was able to access this from the view passed into onitemclick

2549075
fadein	fadeout
i tried looking into jquery.support for the jquery ones but i find myself running into conceptual problems with it for fadein fadeout i think i should test for .support.opacity but that would be false in ie whereas ie6+ could still fairly render the fades

2549089
width	height
we ve tried a number of different things and the closest we ve come is hooking into the child control s sizechanged event and explicitly setting the scatterviewitem s width and height but this approach still has issues

2549112
children	parent
but if you think that you will often be working with the parent and children together in the same transaction and you want to save yourself some typing consider using cascade persist merge save-update

2549128

the top level site collection spsite is a container in which you have your root web spweb and subsites spwebs under spwebs - it takes a while to get used to the names

2549670
spweb	spsite
therefore a subsite will be any site spweb under the top level web site in a site collection spsite

filtering	grouping
i ve been asked to filtering this result by removing two specific grouping

2549917
filtering	grouping
it seems trivial but i can t seem to come up with a solid solution for storing the specific grouping i want to filtering out

2549917
filtering	grouping
my idea is to just create an array containing references to the two grouping i need to filtering out

2549917
filtering	grouping
my concern is that in the future they may ask to filtering out more grouping and maybe an array may not be a good idea

2549932

it has some pretty slick mechanisms for get put and ajax calls

2550445
dbvisualizer	toad
that means either scripting the query to include a line break or using another tool like toad dbvisualizer sql lob editor or some other third-party tool

2550464
cpu	processors
in general int is supposed to map a machine register size of the target cpu architecture s machine so that loading storing and operating on the int type data should translate directly into operations that use the target processors s native registers

2550464
subtraction	addition
there may also be a performance penalty associated with using longs caused by either wait states to load the 32 bits in multiple reads across a 16 bit data bus or caused by implementing long operations addition subtraction etc in software if the native hardware doesn t support such operations in hardware

2550481
punctuation	words
string will lead to boundary problems with the first and last words in the string or strings where the target words have punctuation or are hyphenated

run them all through a min-heap of size 100 for each input number k replace the current min m with max k m

2550655
floating-point	fixed-point
there is likely to be a significant difference in real-world speed between fixed-point and floating-point math but the theoretical best-case throughput of the alu vs fpu is completely irrelevant

2550655
floating-point	integer
instead the number of integer and floating-point registers real registers not register names on your architecture which are not otherwise used by your computation for-loop control the number of elements of each type which fit in a cache line optimizations possible considering the different semantics for integer vs

2550661
addslashes	multibyte
all i need to do is inject something like 0xbf27 and addslashes modifies this to become 0xbf5c27 a valid multibyte character followed by a single quote

2550661
addslashes	multibyte
this type of attack is possible with any character encoding where there is a valid multibyte character that ends in 0x5c because addslashes can be tricked into creating a valid multibyte character instead of escaping the single quote that follows

2550702
post	get
is there a way to get routedata to use a post parameter as a fall back value

a quick fix is to change your nhibernate mappings to use a bag instead of a set

2551284
fast-forward	merge	pull	push
yes after remote repository rejected push as non fast-forward you need to pull from remote repository this would do a merge which means that you might need to resolve merge conflict -- don t forget to commit merge conflict resolution in that case and then push again

2551284
fast-forward	merge
pull would fast-forward which means that there wouldn t be created any new merge commit

int	double
in java all primitive types int double etc. are saved directly local variables of this type are released in this moment

2551657
int	double
i want to test if a number double x is an int power of 10

hide	show
edit to show the one you click and hide the rest at the same time

2551813
goto	break
install the add-in alter all error-handling to on error goto 0 so that it will definitely break immediately on error then run the add-in and progressively comment out all xl2002 + commands as they are encountered choosing paths where variables default to false if an if command is encountered

2551833
hash	salt
generally speaking hashing only password is not very secure a random salt has to be appended to the password so that same passwords will produce different hash values

2551833
hash	salt
with that client will have to generate salt preferably using cryptographically secure algorithm compute hash of a resulting sting using compliant implementation of a well-known hashing algorithm and then send three pieces of information back to the server

2551852
rational-numbers	fractions
although not exactly an answer to your question i think we should mention here rational class suitable for keeping rational-numbers without the loss implied with storage of float-point numbers in form of fractions

2552050
qspinbox	qpushbutton
the main window contains two qcheckboxes a qspinbox and a qpushbutton

2552087
division	multiplication
there might be a more generic solution but in this case i d use the fact that division is the same as multiplication by the inverse x c

2552096
google-chrome	firefox
hopefully the majority of methods and events are implemented on modern browsers such as google-chrome and firefox latest versions of course

2552101

rdf	owl
whether rdf which can also be serialised in xml can be considered to be an ontology language is contentious rdf unlike owl does not give you access to the whole apparatus of first order description logic but allows you to construct things more akin to controlled vocabularies taxonomies etc...rather than formal ontologies

2552794
traceroute	packets
while it s hard to say without any additional information the best bet would be to install some packets sniffer â probably wireshark www.wireshark.org â and compare the icmp packets â what goes on the wire with your traceroute and what does the system usr bin traceroute or windows system32 tracert send

2552838
rdf	owl
firstly an as has been pointed out before owl can be serialised in rdf

2552838
rdf	owl
secondly owl adds ontological capability to rdf which on its own only provides extremely limited capability for formal knownledge representation by providing the apparatus to define the components of your triple using formal computable first order description logic

2552838
rdf	owl
in effect this means that you can use an owl ontology as a schema for rdf which does not formally require schemata

if you use inheritance it means your multiplying and divide functions would have to be virtual which in the case of something as simple as multiplication or division would probably add significant overhead

2554203
getter	setter
and add the requisite instance variable getter setter on your marketresearchactionbean

2554205
button	checkbox
it seems like the validation should be attached to the checkbox not the button

2554212
button	checkbox	client-side	server-side
i think it would work if you enabled disabled the button on the checkbox server-side event rather than client side since the associated client-side validation code will be generated to run for validationgroup of the button

there is no on mouseover in winforms afaik there are mousehover and mousemove events but if you change image on those it will not change back so the mouseenter + mouseleave are what you are looking for i think

2554426
put	get
i would guess that the problem is that 42 isn t divisible by 4 and so they get out of alignment if you put several of these structs back to back allocate memory for several of them determining the size with sizeof

2554455
rss	feed
i am using xampp and was wondering if i can code my site to include rss feed

2554560
jstl	taglib
for the remnant of jstl tags only the functions taglib is useful in jsf all the other taglib are superflous in a jsf environment since it either provides the same functionality out of the box jstl core and format taglib or it simply doesn t suit in the mvc ideology jstl sql and xml taglib

you can create a rss feed and test it locally no problem

those who keep telling the poor guy to just use tcp ignore that there are good reasons why a reliable udp implementation would be used over tcp - and it s not datagram semantics which dead easy to layer on top of tcp

2555254
memcached	apc
the first is a opcode cache or memory cache such as apc eaccelerator xcache or memcached

2555321
comparator	comparable
you can use that and it will either use natural ordering node implements comparable or a comparator supplied in the constructor if you don t want that code inside your node class

2555325
comparator	comparable
if your node class already implements comparable you don t even need to define a new comparator as that order will be used by default

2555332
width	height
you ll run into issues obtaining correct width height with webkit browsers when it s set explicitly vs

2555332

but if you have an intranet scenario - your company s lan environment - and you have .net clients calling your wcf service there s no reason at all not to use nettcp

2555674
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
you can also include svn path git path mercurial path or bazaar path in the pip requirements

2555688
int	double
my guess is that 2 in case2 is casting 5 + 6 to int and causing round of division to 5 then casted again to double and converted to 5.0

2555695
post	put	post	get	put	get
all data is access changed via standard http verbs get post put delete

2556056
vbscript	jscript
your task can be easily scripted using windows script host languages -- vbscript or jscript

2556056
vbscript	jscript
as for the timestamp the problem is that neither vbscript nor jscript have built-in functions that would format the date in the format you need so you will have to write the code for doing this yourself

2556061
pop-up	dialog
when i do the above though and click on the hyperlink an annoying blank window pop-up with my download dialog box behind it

2556245
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
so for example 1 salt hash is md5

2556251
inherited	properties
value inherited requires a properties getter to do something

2556251
inherited	properties
the fact that properties values can be either local or inherited means that instead of values being stored in fields they re stored as dictionary entries

2556262
jar	war
i have a custom tag packaged into a library jar that is included in my web apps war file

2556454
cart	oscommerce
what s a good shopping cart possibly free i know there oscommerce xcart etc but what s a good one

2556464

the reasoning behind this was that each class knows what kind of input it needs so it makes sense to me to have it know how to ask for it given an ostream through which to ask and an istream to collect the input from

2557257
easymock	jmock
you could even go wild and write your mocks using jmock or easymock

memset	malloc	memcpy	memmove	memcpy	memset	memcpy	malloc	memmove	memset	memmove	malloc
in creating your own memory management system now that you have learned what memset does and doesn t hopefully already knowing enough of the low level stuff that you know the difference between memcpy and memmove your next step is to learn about alignment and about the guarantees that malloc fulfills but your code doesn t

2558818
free	malloc
the call to free will put the memory block that had been allocated by malloc back onto data structures that the c runtime maintains for the heap in this case something that might be called the free-list

maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml
the configuration of maven projects in eclipse is derived by m2e from the metadata contained in the poms so if you have two projects projecta and projectb and you want to have projectb as dependency of projecta you need to declare projectb as such in the pom.xml of projecta to add a dependency

in my opinion operation between repository can be done just by hg push and hg pull the other commands like hg update hg import just work between a working-copy and its repository

2559264

pop-up	dialog
you might be able as you say to query the iframe s status somehow but i wouldn t know a defined way to do this there will be no onload event because no document will be loaded - once the browser receives the information to expect a file download it will pop-up the save as dialog and leave the iframe s context completely

the component to be removed only on a real uninstall - not upgrade repairs modifies

2559422

all files are scaled to a4 format and saved in tiff so there is no change to detect orientation by height width parameters

2559525
portrait	landscape
obviously there are 4 possible fax orientation portrait landscape x 2 kinds of rotations

i have a spinner view that s populated through a simplecursoradapter

2559641
getter	setter
i recently read that getter setter are evil and i have to say it makes sense yet when i started learning oop one of the first things i learned was encapsulate your fields so i learned to create class give it some fields create getter setter for them and create constructor where i initialize these fields

2559641
getter	setter
and every time some other class needs to manipulate this object or for instance display it i pass it the object and it manipulate it using getter setter

2559661
getter	setter
i haven t yet read the full article but afaiu the basic point is that one should not unnecessarily publish class fields via mindlessly added or generated getter and setter

2559661
getter	setter
you ll do it you eliminate the vast majority of getter setter methods in

2559695
getter	setter
allen holub made a big splash with why getter and setter methods are evil back in 2003

2559696
getter	setter
encapsulate your fields so i learned to create class give it some fields create getter setter

2559696
getter	setter
clearly fussy getter and setter aren t essential

2559696
getter	setter
python folks use properties sometimes to create a getter and setter functions that look like a simple attribute

2559696
getter	setter
private methods explicit getter and setter etc

2559696
getter	setter
as we say use the source luke and we re all adults here. we re all able to see the source we don t need to be fussy about piling on getter and setter to provide yet more hints as to how the api works

as ffmpeg is supporting amr encoder decoder its giving error

2559746
width	height
error while opening encoder for output stream #0.0 - maybe incorrect parameters such as bit_rate rate width or height

2559755
getter	setter
if you have getter and setter you don t have encapsulation

2559755
getter	setter
this has quite a complicated internal representation yet has no getter or setter and only one element of the representation is probably exposed simply by returning its value size

2559809
getter	setter
adding different getter and setter methods for concrete implementations will pollute the client code that uses these entities like lots of dynamic_casts to call required getter and setter methods

2559809
getter	setter
therefore getter and setter methods may remain where they are but you should protected client code

2559856
post	get
- notice http and i click a login link there it shows a small html div with login form like a litebox .now as i am on a non ssl page http the data which i post does not get encrypted and posted to the process action

2560583
listener	eventhandler
so if you re dispatching your custom event in the project class that contains the _zoom mc and projectappear has a reference to both project and to _board then inside projectappear you can add an event listener to project for the custom event myproject.addeventlistener mycustomevent eventhandler etc.... and in the eventhandler function which will have a reference to both _board and project since it s in projectappear you can do whatever you need to with _board

if the .hgignore file is in your user profile directory userprofile .hgignore then edit your mercurial.ini which should also be in your user profile folder to have this

2564304
disk	ram
fstat should always be very fast since the kernel should already have the data you re asking for in ram as it needs to access it for the file to be in the open state and the kernel won t have to go through the trouble of traversing the path of the filename to see if each component is in ram or on disk and possibly reading in a directory from disk but likely not having to only to discover that it has the data that you are asking for in ram

2564312

int	double
ieee 754 double cannot represent 64-bit int exactly

2565295
postgresql	informix
i have done a similar thing but i migrated informix database to postgresql

2565295
postgresql	informix
while postgresql pl postgresql and informix spl are very different this part was the hardest and i was able to automatically convert only function prototypes

2565311
post	get
i d suggest to use post redirect get pattern

2565318
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
free will mark the memory once held in front as free so another malloc realloc call may use it

2565338
children	parent
usually this error occurs when the said element is already attached to an existing parent and somewhere in your code you re attempting to re-parent it ie via just straight add when you in turn must remove the child from the parent first then add it to the children etc

2565351
mvp	presenter
in mvp i d write this as iview.activatefield nameconstant which the presenter or pm would invoke

2565366
spaces	delimiter
one way to think about the problem is to consider the spaces as what it is a delimiter

2565448
x86	64bit
completion key is not a pointer - it is a number of type ulong_ptr which just means an integer the size of a pointer so it is 32-bits on x86 and 64bit on x64

2565470
width	height
as well as singlespacing mentioned previously to reduce the height of the table a useful way to reduce the width of the table is to add before the command and take out all the vertical lines between columns

2565477
macports	homebrew
if so you might be getting some funkiness as a result of using this other quasi-different environment--i ran in to all kinds of issues like this after upgrading to 10.6 with macports and as a result switched to using rvm for my ruby upgrading management and have been using homebrew for a macports replacement

2565494
memset	calloc
this means that using calloc or memset 0 is not a portable initialization of pointers

2565535
strtol	atoi
no matter what your problem with getting atoi to work is you should rather use strtol

2565535
int	chars
-- function int atoi const chars string

2565583
crossover	mutation
this is the exact kind of problem specialized crossover and mutation methods have been applied for ga based solutions to tsp problems

2565609
abbr	pre
pre a abbr acronym address cite

2565719
direct3d	gdi
you always may use gdi render your text in the hdc copy it to the direct3d dynamic texture and use shader to replace background to transparency by color key for example

2565719
directwrite	direct2d
but if you do not need support of windows xp you may try to use direct2d with directwrite and directx10 i didn t try 11

2565719
direct3d	direct2d
i tried them and they shown good results you only should avoid often switching between direct2d and direct3d contexts because it may seriously degrade performance

2565736
strcpy	strncpy
for similar reasons one should use strncpy in place of strcpy and strncat in place of strcat

2565736
ostringstream	getline	ostringstream	std	cout	cin
personally i use the c++ iostreams library std cin std cout the and operators std getline std istringstream std ostringstream etc. so i do not typically deal with that

2565736
getchar	fgetc	strtol	fgetc	strtol	getchar
if i were forced to use pure c though i would personally just use fgetc or getchar in combination with strtol strtoul etc

2565742
strcpy	strncpy
some people would claim that strcpy and strcat should be avoided in favor of strncpy and strncat

2565744
strcpy	strncpy
use strncpy instead and not strcpy for example

2565764
getter	setter
do i need getter and setter if i m depending on garbage collection

2565769
getter	setter
note the setter and getter above correspond to elements declared in your schema

2565794
int	chars
well if you interpret an int as a chars in c you ll get that ascii chars as long as it s in range

2565797
put	get
in general to see what s going on with your layout you can put in your preamble and then stick layout in your document to get a diagram and listing of geometry settings

2565800
readonly	temporary
naturally if you re needing the readonly immutable feature of tuples that is a fair argument but given the op question this should ve been done with lists instead -- note how there is extra code to either pull the tuple apart and put the resulting one together and or the need to temporary convert to a list and back

2565819
getter	setter
property getter and setter is a mean of encapsulation and ivar is an implementation detail

2565820
int	boolean
and if setting non-object values like int boolean etc i do not have to release the old value right assuming non-gc environment

2565831
strcpy	strncpy
there are several problems encountered when strncpy and strncat are used as safe versions of strcpy and strcat

2565861
prng	random
to work around this you can pick a initial value for c that is not constant based of the secret key by just asking the prng after init with seed for a random byte

2565865
post	get	pull	push
read-only operations like pull and clone use get requests only but write operations like push use post

2565915
inherited	properties
the compiler can then verify that whatever t is being passed in it will inherited from event and contain the datetime properties

2565963
qpushbutton	qwidget
so what i would like to know is why is it that i can change the background color of a widget if i simply create a qwidget object or a subclass of qpushbutton but not when i create a subclass of qwidget

2565979

i am creating an application in which when app launches the edittextfield getfocus automatically and the keyboard pop-up.i want to hide the keyboard by default and show when edittextfield get focus

2566010
integer	unsigned	128bit	64bit
i have a 128bit unsigned integer a and a 64bit unsigned integer b

2566010
128bit	64bit
however it appears to me that the suggested algorithms would be quite slow - wouldn t the fastest way to perform a 128bit by 64bit division be to leverage the processor s native support for 64bit by 32-bit division

2566023
post	get
if you load that page without cookies you get a post form

2566023
post	get
perhaps you should send that post data first get the cookies and then use those cookies for the rest of the session

2566057
vim	notepad++	komodo	notepad++
i ve integrated this rule to every editor i use notepad++ komodo vi vim visual studio 2005 in order to have a visual guideline showing this limit

2566210
equals	tostring
case classes mean i get tostring and equals for free.

2566254
width	height
you d have to be careful with the width height parameters and the css you apply

2566288
strcpy	strncpy
it is probably worth adding again that strncpy is not the general-purpose replacement for strcpy that it s name might suggest

2566290
width	height
it is not fixing the width and height and spread until the all text appears

2566299
width	height
you need to specify the width and height in px

2566303
int	boolean
and if setting non-object values like int boolean etc i do not have to release the old value right assuming non-gc environment

2566410
google-chrome	firefox
it is same in firefox and also google-chrome

2566510
trie	tree
you should use a trie aka a prefix tree to build a tree-like structure that allows you to easily walk through your strings in an ordered manner by comparing their prefixes

2566510
trie	tree
you can build the trie as a tree of directories on your file system obviously not the one which the data is coming from

2566528
remoteview	appwidgetprovider
in your appwidgetprovider when you create your remoteview instance to do an update you pass in a layout id to the constructor

2566566
width	height
if it is you could simply store width and height of the area tile length and an array of integers representing the vertex height

2566570
division	multiplication
you can use the division version of russian peasant multiplication

2566580
width	height
try using the window.resizeto width height function

2566592
int	chars
what we need is but i found a shorter way of converting each chars to string which is to concat something else to it in this case an int 0 hence

2566626
folder	directory
for netbackup the binaries that analyze the directory in clients perform some type of listing that timeouts by the enormous quantity of files in every folder about one million per folder sap work directory

i m interested in the benefits of having an established framework to perform orm but i m curious as to the performance costs of using it against standard xml serializable and deserialization

2567180
actionscript	mxml
the problem is that the mxml component is being created before the actionscript is run

2567184
google-chrome	firefox
nevertheless you might try using speed tracer in google-chrome or firebug in firefox though it doesn t have quite as detailed timing information to see what s taking the time

2567197
button	checkbox
when i use the report button i get a screen with a feedback field and a checkbox for include system data

2567209
width	height
it s width and height are increased by way too much

2567221
profiling	benchmarking
once you have designed a class whose interface you d like to use you can experiment with very different implementation approaches and benchmarking them on a workload that s representative of your usage pattern so you can find out what s best for you assuming table manipulation and lookup are a big part of your application s runtime of course -- to find out profiling your app

2567221
profiling	benchmarking
and by now i have evolved it independently of the actual application-level parts but based on profiling and benchmarking thereof to completely different implementations currently based on numpy

2567221
profiling	benchmarking
once you have the code working then comes the right time for profiling benchmarking and -- just perhaps -- internal optimization of the implementation

2567279
versioning	upgrade
our clients are all using some versioning of the product but not all use the same versioning and they will not all be upgrade at the same time

2567283
stdout	stderr
in dos or 1 is stdout and 2 is stderr

2567326
put	get
just for example if you re designing a program that will get data from one database or some source anyway massage it as needed and then put the result into another chances are that you re going to start by thinking about database schemas data flow and data encoding formatting probably in about that order

2567327
versioning	upgrade
then you could just change the ssis package their job calls when they upgrade to the new versioning

2567332
dynamicmethod	reflection.emit
get the dynamicmethod s methodbuilder and use reflection.emit to add the opcodes for incrementing the field

2567340
stdout	stderr
if your script is invoked with 2 1 at the end backticks invocation will return stdout stderr

2567342
hex	binary
since the hexadecimal representation can encode any arbitrary binary values it might be possible to shrink the string by compressing them before taking the hex values

2567384
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
in any case you could use objectinputstream and objectoutputstream to pass directly objects between clients and server

2567403
opera	firefox
it works in firefox but nothing else - no webkit ie opera

2567414
serializable	deserialization
these hl7 cda files are xml files with a defined xml schema so i used xsd.exe to generate .net classes for xml serializable and deserialization

2567414
serializable	deserialization
i tried implementing ixmlserializable on the strucdocparagraph class so that i could control the deserialization and serializable of the content but it s rather complex since there are so many classes involved and i didn t come to a solution yet because i don t know if the effort pays off

2567430

2567447
google-chrome	safari
both run modified webkit the base of google-chrome and safari based browsers

2567451
next	except
this puts the i th item of indices at the very end shifting all following items of indices one to the left and indicates that the next time we come to this item of cycles we ll be swapping the new i th item of indices from the left with the n - i th one from the right -- that would be the i th one again except of course for the fact that there will be a

2567451
for-loop	loops
but now we haven t broken off the for-loop so we continue by decrementing the next -to-last in this case the first -- which gives a minor event one swap in the indices and we break the inner loops again

2567461

2567860
move	drag
other than that you just have to hide the panel again when the drag and drop is complete or move out of the datagridview

2567870

in particular if you can tell me if my theory is correct about providing a client-side app that communicates with server-side web services or if i m totally going in the wrong direction

2567957
inherited	properties
now this properties is inherited by jobview and activityview but if i need reference to ijobviewpresenter object in these derived classes then i need to type cast ibasepresenter properties to ijobviewpresenter or iactivitypresenter which i want to avoid or create jobviewpresenter and activityviewpresenter on derived classes as shown above

min	max
if you want your new min to be 0 and your new max to be 255 then that equation would stretch the contrast accordingly

2568207
min	max
the original_min and original_max do not have to be the actual min and max of the entire image the could be the min and max of a subsection of the image if you want to enhance a particular area and don t mind clipping values above or below your new_min new_max

2568207
range	max	range	min	min	max
i suppose if you already know your range and so forth you could incorporate that formula into a 4x4 matrix to achieve your goal but only after you ve done a pass to find the min and max of the original image

2568592
folder	directory
the problem is not that the filesystem is not able to store so many files in a directory but that if you want to access that directory using windows explorer it will take forever so if you will ever need to access manually to that folder you should segment it for example with a directory per each 2-3 first letters numbers of the name or even a deeper structure

2568655
google-chrome	firefox
also please note that this occurs in firefox but not google-chrome

2568655

disk	ram
if there is any cardinal rule to optimizing scalability cost it is that you want enough ram to fit everything you need to serve on a regular basis because this will always get you more throughput than disk access no matter how clever you try to be about it

2568909
disk	ram
well i don t have a lot of experience at extreme scales but if you have any disk io contention then you definitely need more ram

can some one tell me how the chrome s linux beta version carry out automatic version updation using debian package manager

2569063
debian	linux
i am currently checking out the postinst script present in the debian control package and i can see chrome uses pgp publish subscribe model for getting automated version updates in linux

2569098
hide	show
true to show system files false to hide them

2569105
versioning	upgrade
first upgrade to the newest versioning of the snmp library if there is one

2569119
put	get
i m sure i can put together some kind of convoluted logic to track changes to the friendsfoods table intercept submitchanges calls etc to try and get this to work the way i want but is there a nice clean way to remove a many-to-many relationship with linq-to-sql

2569138
implements	extends
both post and postonepointone will implements the ipost interface they are not extends an abstract class because that inheritance breaks the wsdl though i suppose there may be a way around that via some fancy xml serialization tricks

2569147
versioning	upgrade
most of the rest of that script takes care of the multiple versioning of repositories they maintain allowing the user to disable it without getting pissed off at you and gracefully handling an os upgrade that disables third-party repos

2569181
versioning	upgrade
you ll forget you did upgrade the versioning and bam changes are gone

2569184
tabcontrol	tabitem
this style s automatically applied to whatever container element the control generates for its items - so if the itemscontrol you re using is a listbox it will apply it to the listboxitem and if it s a tabcontrol it ll get applied to the tabitem and so on

2569185
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
currently i m only testing firefox 3.6 opera 10.10 and safari 4.0.3

2569185
firefox	safari
i ve started with a fairly simple test and can confirm no memory leaks in firefox and safari

2569185
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari reloading the page does not use any further memory and all memory is returned when the window tab is closed

2569185
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari and very possibly other browsers if there s no window.onunload handler then memory is only reclaimed when the window is closed

2569191
width	height
i am currently using formattedtext to determine the width and height of my richtextbox but the measurements it is providing me with are too small--specifically two characters in width too small

2569193
put	get
the catch is that to measure the impact you need to look at it differently - instead of how much time does a single query to fetch an image takes ask yourself how much time does a series of put a reasonable number here queries to get the same set of images takes

2569194
rss	feed
if you re part of the etherpad open source community you might want to subscribe to the rss feed for questions tagged etherpad just in case this catches on

2569273
mockito	easymock	easymock	powermockito
you can use a mock library like mockito or easymock +classpath to create a mock file object newer libs have classloader extensions that let you mock concrete classes like file or can cooperate with something like powermockito see blog and have a mock generated for the constructor call and throw the appropriate exception when called

2569330
goto	break
however break are there for flow control they are much clearer as to what they do than goto so i would recommend using them

2569384
put	get
if i then put it as an array ie i then get a different error message

2569388
fflush	gets
the content-length header only gets set if the entire response is buffered if you never fflush or if you set it yourself

2569441
typeerror	attributeerror
the exceptions thrown are typically typeerror you used an invalid operation and attributeerror you tried to access an inexistent member methods are members too

2569457
late-binding	early-binding
i can t remember if vb5 actually supports early-binding iunknown -based objects or if supports only late-binding idispatch

2569471
width	height
the informations include the height and width of the picture and the rgb values of every pixel

2569489
width	height
well i try to make important common mouse targets as large as possible without looking bad something about 20 pixels assuming 96 dpi height and as much width as needed to accomodate labels

2569503
hash	md5
right now i m using md5 which doesn t generate case-sensitive hash

2569525
pascal	delphi
the reason is that delphi or more specifically turbo pascal originally didn t have the notion of exit break continue or assert

2569531
dictionary	map
key value an associative array also associative container map mapping dictionary finite map and in query-processing an index or index file is an abstract data type composed of a collection of unique keys and a collection of values where each key is associated with one value or set of values

2569546
cldc	midp
in my experience ibm s j9 is the best - i ve used it to support midp cdc apps but the profile configuration combinations supported include midp and personal profile and both cldc and cdc foundation

2569604
put	get
try get netbeans_midp_components_basic.jar off your friend s pc under and put it in your own install in the same path

2569609
width	height
i should be able to query the data structure for what rectangles are at point x y or what rectangles intersect rectangle x y width height

2569647
haskell	scheme
for what it s worth the arbitrary precision integers in ghc haskell and gnu guile scheme are both implemented using gmp and the fastest implementation of the pidigits benchmark on the language shootout is based on gmp

2569648
hibernate	gilead
right so i am working with hibernate gilead and gwt to persist my data on users and files of a website

2569650
lwjgl	jogl
i imagine that other languages like clojure jython could also handle this request -- either through lwjgl or jogl

2569655
width	height
edit the idea here is that every object will have a different width and height so the array i use to represent that object will be unique to the object but once that array is defined preferably in the constructor it will not change

2569655
width	height
and the values of width and height for a particular object are known at compile time

2569671
width	height
in that case an array with dimensions matching the height and width of your display might suffice with each element in the array being a presumably short list of the rectangles on that pixel

2569678
hash	md5
another idea i ve had is that it is not the direct result of cryptencrypt but a result of the rasessionid in the md5 hash

2569684
submit	submission
how can create simple php search engine submission tool which allows that to submit the site url to multiple search engines such as hl dqq and also or any other other search engines

2569695
fflush	gets
a standard mutex won t work since i run the risk of having the main thread grab the mutex before the data gets fflush to the database

2569697
exif	xmp
that s backing up exif makernotes iptc xmp etc whether at the beginning or end of the file

2569728
folder	directory
i point coverstory to the objects-normal directory in my builds folder and it complains that there s nothing there for it to read

2569754
range	minimum
it manages large memory blocks efficiently particularly at the 4k virtual memory page size and 64k virtual memory address range minimum sizes

2569763
client-side	server-side
i m wondering about this in the context of both server-side and client-side data validation

2569767
config	ini
i have googled and combed php ini and apache config but i cannot find what that directive setting might be

2569789
portrait	landscape
0 when vertical portrait + -90 when horizontal landscape both of which are obtained from the device gravity vector components

2569792
put	get
the simplest way to do that imho is to get rid of the standard title bar in the element in the manifest and put your own title bar at the top of the activity

2569794
put	get
when you get the file read put it into a normal class and just bind to the class or use the list of items you have to do custom stuff with the combobox

2569865
passenger	thin
tune a production deployment passenger thin apache etc

2569890
vbscript	jscript
you could also choose to use vbscript or jscript rather than perl and you wouldn t need to worry about installing any additional software

2569895
post	get
i know that i can use request.form.get variable to get post variables and in my handlers for url variables but that s as much as the documentation will tell me

2569915
google-chrome	firefox
yeah this works in firefox and google-chrome but for some reason wont work in ie 8

2569915
google-chrome	firefox
does anybody know why this works in google-chrome and firefox but not ie8

2569951
post	put
put recent_posts_by_user for view name recent post by user for description and node for view type

2569962
terminate	timeout
mysql terminate a connection after 8 hour timeout

2569977
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome - launches special firefox profile with elevated security privileges to bypass javascript security errors

2570001
stdout	stderr
i have a native dll which outputs via stdout stderr

2570001
stdout	stderr
i have a c# console application which calls this dll and outputs binary data to a parent c# application which started the c# console exe processing stdout stderr

2570022
poe	anyevent
if you want to do event-driven programming take a look at one of the cpan event modules such as poe coro or anyevent before you invent your own thing

2570033
bazaar	git
first thing get to know a version control system subversion git bazaar mercurial are some examples

2570038
goto	break
however it allows using labels and using break or continue with label instead of goto

2570051
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome works fine but in ie7 sometimes returns the value into the label sometimes not

2570074
int	double
loop through the int in the range of those two int s like you re doing with your floats. for each one find the cube root and square root and store them in double

2570107
filesystems	ntfs
the paper goes into plenty of detail on the topic of storing blobs in the filesystems ntfs vs

2570112
fputs	gets
and when i run it in xcode i get an exc_bad_access when it gets to the first fputs

2570118
setinterval	settimeout
and setinterval is like settimeout except it repeats a code repeatedly

2570141
google-chrome	firefox
i have some code here which works perfectly in firefox but not in google-chrome or ie

2570150
disk	ram
of course you can also store the various data elements in a db table disk or ram between views.

2570154
google-chrome	firefox
i think google-chrome and firefox interpret it differently when you assign both a left and right property

2570170
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox google-chrome ie 8

2570199
put	get
i would use a single file to get and put the serialized string

2570200
vbo	pbo
if this is a one-time operation though i d go with copying it over to a pbo and then binding into gl_array_buffer and then just using it as a vbo

2570223
free	malloc
in c++ using delete to free memory obtained with malloc doesn t necessarily cause a program to blow up

2570223
free	malloc
should a warning or perhaps even an assertion failure should be produced if delete is used to free memory obtained using malloc

2570224
free	malloc
in c++ using delete to free memory obtained with malloc doesn t necessarily cause a program to blow up

2570224
free	malloc
do you guys think a warning or perhaps even an assertion failure should be produced if delete is used to free memory obtained using malloc

2570230
folder	directory
i use the nshomedirectory function to get the app s home folder and write to the documents directory within that

2570265
int	double
the first class is called measuredparams and it s got 40+ numeric fields height weight waistsize wristsize - some int but mostly double

2570270
innodb	myisam
inserting into a blob is 2x to 8x faster on myisam than on innodb

2570270
hex	binary
using a hex coded string bin2hex into a x ... uses more memory on average than using an escaped binary string mysql_real_escape_string on the raw data

2570270
innodb	myisam
- this seems true for both myisam and innodb

2570270
innodb	myisam
the binary string is faster on myisam but the hex-coded data is faster on innodb

2570298
getter	setter
fortunately the .net client library has been updated with a getter and setter for this parameter although the methods are undocumented in the .net developer s guide

2570341
width	height
this will be something like pixel size min height width 2

2570375
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can watch them for the mouseenter event and if no mouseleave event fires within x milliseconds show your tooltip

2570375
mouseleave	mouseenter
it also provides hover which is just a convenience means of hooking up mouseenter and mouseleave handlers. although this means you re hooking up a lot of event handlers since mouseenter and mouseleave don t bubble mdash

2570375
mouseover	mouseout
you may well be better off tracking mouseover mouseout at the document level and handling the complexities that arise since they do bubble

2570394
easymock	jmock
if it is just for a sake of unit-test developers should apply dependency inject pattern in their coding and take advantages from mocking tools such as easymock or jmock to circumvent dependencies

2570415
gridview	onclientclick	onclicklistener	ontouch
i want to replace the onclicklistener and the onclientclick method with their touch equivalents touchlistener and ontouch so that when i touch an element in the gridview the image of the element changes and a double touch on the same element takes it back to the orginal state

2570440
post	get
so for instance you can simulate post or get request

2570489
apache	nginx
if not are there some standard headers to pass in that will accomplish that in common web servers i m thinking nginx or apache

2570495
freemarker	velocity
put the constants into a properties object then create an xml file template using velocity freemarker or an equivalent java compatible templating language that expands the properties values into the xml

2570496
folder	directory
which pulls down the directory structure properly and adds the folder foo src mylib which is a local mercurial repository

2570542
subtract	add
add subtract a random number to the lat lng values stored with each user and add a translucent circle around the icon

2570549
rubygems	bundler
rails hosting on shared hosts is already a minefield but throwing in rails 3 in all its pre-release goodness including bundler reinventing the rubygems workflow is a recipe for pulling your hair out

2570550
action-filter	onactionexecuting
write a custom action-filter override onactionexecuting and apply the filter to all your controllers

2570552
free	malloc
why new delete is slower than malloc free

2570554
free	malloc
new and delete are dealing with construction destruction for which part of their work is the effectively calling malloc and free - malloc and free are raw memory allocation deallocation

2570566
free	malloc
if you use them to allocate plain old data such that the constructor destructor are trivial they are unlikely to differ at all significantly in speed from malloc free

2570566
free	malloc
really all they do aside from calling on to malloc free is execute type s constructor destructor multiple times for arrays

2570593
free	malloc
if the constructors and destructors are empty like for built-ins new and delete shouldn t be slower than malloc and free are

2570593
free	malloc
if they are it s often due to the fact that common implementations call malloc free under the hood so they are a wrapper around them

2570614
free	malloc
the compiler could certainly associate a bit of data with each pointer saying allocated with new or allocated with malloc or unknown and when it found a free or a delete if the allocation didn t match it could issue a warning

2570640
subtract	add
so it wouldn t be too hard for me to brute-force the damn thing by simply checking the precedence within the array if the symbol is smaller than the next symbol in the exampe xiv if i is smaller than v in which case it would be because i have ordered them in the array then i could make it subtract the value instead of add

2570649
subtract	add
moving to the left add the values as long as they increase or remain the same and subtract when they decrease

2570702
free	malloc
in c++ using delete to free memory obtained with malloc doesn t necessarily cause a program to blow up

2570702
free	malloc
although some compiler allocate memory for new using malloc free doesn t call destructors

2570702
free	malloc
do you guys think a warning or perhaps even an assertion failure should be produced if delete is used to free memory obtained using malloc

2570709
int	chars
the simplest way of doing this when your weights are relatively small int such as in your example is to build a long string containing all the chars in the appropriate weights and choose a chars at random from it

2570718
google-chrome	firefox
now it still works fine in firefox but in recent versions of google-chrome i believe since 4 it throws this error

2570718
google-chrome	firefox
the above works in firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 3 but in google-chrome 5 it throws the above error.

2570718
google-chrome	firefox
then it works in firefox all versions and google-chrome 3 but not google-chrome 5 i don t have google-chrome 4 so i m not shure about that specific version and don t know if it s even possible to download a specific google-chrome version

2570744
google-chrome	firefox
i tried your test pages and they work fine with google-chrome 4.1.249.1045 on windows and firefox 3.6.3 and ie7 after fixing the issue below

2570750
inherited	properties
you have abstract baseviewmodel which contain for example properties title description keywords ... and all other view model classes inherited from baseviewmodel

2570780
webkit	gecko
to create a screenshot from a web page you need to have an interface to a layout engine like gecko or webkit

2570797
postgresql	mysql
there are various experimental linq to sql and linq to entity framework providers for other databases like mysql and postgresql - in my experience they are so immature it is not worth using for anything serious

2570804
pull	push
when you re ready to expose your changes to the rest of the world you ask them to pull from you or you push it to some main git repo

2570821
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
my solution should work for the focs firefox opera google-chrome safaries ex ie browsers

2570882
children	parent
fork will create a new process where the global variables will be separate between the parent and children

2570890
int	double
suppose that you have a binary file that contains numbers whos type is either int or double

2570890
int	double
the string is composed of the letters i for int and d for double in the order of the types of the subsequent numbers

2570890
int	double
for example the string iddiiddd indicated that the file contains eight values as follows one int followed by two double followed by two int followed by three double

2570893
mockito	jmock
the api classes such as httpservletrequest servletconfig etc are prime targets for using a mocking framework of your choice jmock mockito etc since they re all interfaces

2570915
int	chars
if the chars is an i use readint to read in an int

2570934
ceil	floor
i do not want to use ceil and floor

2570960
inherited	subclassing
abstract classes are useful when you need a class for the purpose of inherited and polymorphism but it makes no sense to instantiate the class itself only its subclassing

2570960
superclass	subclassing
they are commonly used when you want to define a template for a group of subclassing that share some common implementation code but you also want to guarantee that the objects of the superclass cannot be created

2570960
abstract-class	superclass
abstract-class also have the added benefit in polymorphismâ allowing you to use the abstract superclass s type as a method argument or a return type

2570962
cfstring	nsstring
i know that nsstring and cfstring are toll-bridge they can convert in such a way

2570967
junit	testng
jax-ws web services are annotated pojos so you can unit test them in isolation using a regular unit testing framework junit testng and mocks

2570970
folder	directory
you should move the user s folder outside of capistrano s releases directory

2570978
google-chrome	firefox
i ve developed a ajax-enhanced website which has been running fine in ie google-chrome and firefox for a year or so

2570978
google-chrome	firefox
but now i m experiencing this error myself not in firefox though but in google-chrome

2570978
google-chrome	firefox
or does some security setting in firefox google-chrome that prevent some asynchronous updatepanel callbacks

2571035
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have a strange problem working with html css in different browsers firefox 3.6 and webkit browsers google-chrome safari

2571035
google-chrome	firefox
now the problem is that in firefox using firebug i can see that the computed width for the first element is 26.5667px while in google-chrome using google-chrome s developer tools the computed width for the same element is exactly 27px

2571037
qtimer	qmainwindow
the first process the server launches a gui derived from qmainwindow which listens for messages from the clients using repeat fire qtimer s and asynchronous mpi receive calls updates the gui depending on what messages it receives and sends a reply to every message

2571044
folder	directory
all these files are loaded dynamically into index.php it reads all folder inside templates directory and then includes every template.php file

2571068
integer	unsigned
iâ d go with either nsuinteger as the idiomatic general unsigned integer type in cocoa or uint8_t if size matters

2571075
getter	setter
you want to encapsulate object but your member fields is not encapsulated well make them private and add setter and getter methods

2571087
shadowing	named
as gabe said f# interactive uses shadowing of values when you enter a function with a named that already exists for more info on shadowing see for example this so question

2571088
uiview	uiwindow
also you don t need a delegate for drawing a uiview into a uiwindow

2571164
put	get
now after i ve changed the style on the page i want to get the new background color using the following code which i put after the call

2571168
std	ostream
this means that you must implement some sort of null stream class - see implementing a no-op std ostream

2571178
uiview	calayer
if this is to be drawn to the screen you ll need to locate your drawing code within the -drawrect method of a uiview or â drawincontext of a calayer

2571178
uiview	calayer
to update its contents you d need to call -setneedsdisplay on the uiview or calayer

2571235
versioning	upgrade
the minuses and pluses it s a bit of work to start with but with this you ll have all the ground work done to handle upgrade automatically later on to do so just add an upgradescript section to your xml an attribute called versioning for each upgrade script and simply compare it against the versioning of the db you have save in the registry

2571240
width	height
you might want to rename x and y to width and height though or something similar

2571335
keydown	keyup
however the noncharacter keys do raise the keydown and keyup events

2571368
accessor	properties
i want the attribute on the properties set accessor to catch some type of exception and then deal with this in some custom way or even just swallow it

2571379
oncreate	setcontentview
i had to do that in oncreate before calling setcontentview on the activity

2571401
lisp	scheme
i know that lisp and scheme programmers usually say that eval should be avoided unless strictly necessary

2571411
mongoid	mongomapper
i was trying mongomapper but i think i ll go with mongoid because after quick reading docs it seems to me somewhat easier

2571421
int	double
instead of looking for duplicates for each item which is o n 2 or zipping which is n 2 in memory use map double int

2571426
google-chrome	firefox
button you will notice that the sign in panel fieldset#login-controls is shown improperly compare with firefox or google-chrome

2571549
cos	sin
so i may want to write a macro that based on the first parameter uses either sin or cos

2571549
cos	sin
foo 3 4 does sin 4 and foo 1 4 does cos 4

2571555
terminate	timeout
further if the timeout occurs you should probably aim to terminate the child process

2571562
put	get
if the client was a winforms app i could simply put and the current frame on the screen would automatically get updated

2571579
post	get
i am trying to get some form data from post method

2571606
prepare	execute
execute stmt using lower_limit at line 1 prepare stmt from select from images as i where i.on_id 1 and i.on_type profile order by i.updated_at limit

2571632
maven	pom.xml
the odd part is that jdo2-api-2.3-ec.jar is in the datanucleus maven repository that is declared in the pom.xml of the plugin and maven has checked this repository as we can see in the trace

2571636
postgresql	mysql
i haven t used mysql much but in postgresql if the number of records is small in the table it can decide not to use the index

2571643
width	height
i see that they are squeezed such that the height is more than the width

2571689
serializable	deserialization
you can override the serializable and deserialization methods to add custom information

2571764
cassini	iis
i m using cassini not iis with vs2010

2571780
folder	directory
i need to return a full directory name from inside a specified directory that contains .default in the folder name

2571780
post	get
i also looked at this post windows batch file get folders #39

2571789
subtraction	addition
you should also support basic vector operations like addition subtraction and dot product

2571819
children	parent
so if there are no children then the parent row is not returned in the result set

2571823
return-value-optimization	nrvo
i guess what you re looking for is return-value-optimization return-value-optimization and nrvo named return-value-optimization

2571840
octal	decimal
how can i convert decimal to octal in python2.6 for 1 to 100000

2571876
post	put
i ve put together some example code and uploaded it here i hope that linking to one s blog post isn t considered terrible form - a brief search of the internet didn t seem to suggest it was .

2571877
hide	show
in this you d have all those pages be user controls which you progrmattically hide or show

2571944
calloc	malloc
if not then what other objective is achieved using malloc and calloc

2571977
mouse	keyboard
what you need to do is implement custom look and feel that defines ui delegates generating gwt widgets and on the gwt side capture the mouse and keyboard events on the client and feed them to the swing event queue

2571980
free	malloc
malloc still has the advantage that the memory can be deallocated with free exactly when you want it to be -- so you can usefully return a malloc ed array as your function s result and the caller will free it when done with it

2571980
free	malloc
of course style-guides that constrain malloc and free to happen within the same function would give up on this crucial difference

2571980
realloc	malloc
there are others though such as the ability to realloc a malloc -ed array if you need to change its size which also doesn t apply to runtime-sized arrays

2571981
calloc	malloc
it certainly reduces the need for calloc and malloc by using the compiler for variable allocations

2571981
calloc	malloc
you might still use calloc and malloc where you need to support older compilers or in situations where you want to allocate more dynamic data structures

2571995
cairngorm	puremvc	cairngorm	flex
that s why there is cairngorm puremvc and many other frameworks on top of flex

2572005
google-chrome	firefox
the only solution i can see is that suggested by ole above namely to look at the code from google-chrome and firefox and work out how they encode the cache

some libraries introduces too many abstractions forcing you to put in more effort to get around it or forcing you to do things in a certain way and i think that s bad

2572483
short	base
i would like to change it so that it uses the short description as the description in google base

2572489
boost	allocator
if you don t need your allocator to call a constructor you can also use boost pool which i think may deallocate faster because it doesn t have to call deconstructors at all and just deleted the chunk of memory in one free

2572490
xna	spritebatch
i ve not used xna for a long time but shouldn t spritebatch be lowercase or have another name otherwise you ll be referencing the actual class spritebatch and not the instance

2572813
rss	feed
i have a shared site in sharepoint and have some rss feed webpart in it so now everytime my site opens up it shows this popup

2572836
for-loop	loops
i would love to be clever and tell you how to do this with no for loops but the overhead on a for-loop here is small and the code is probably clearer if you keep your for-loop

2572862
super	self
i assume that if it were truly important for self to be set equal to super then apple would not have the method be commented out by default

2572862
super	self
on the other hand if i do need to do some customization in that method why do i need to set self super

2572871
getter	setter
contain getter and setter

2572871
getter	setter
secondly if getter and setter are defined in an interface they don t really define complete behavior other that one is for read and one is for write wrt a property. you can have complex behavior behind setter and getter but they can only be implemented in the actual classes

2572871
getter	setter
with that into consideration there is nothing wrong - syntactically and semantically - with having setter and getter in interfaces

2572871
getter	setter
if your application is well-modeled and the problem requires that you have an interface defining setter and getter why not

2572871
getter	setter
now if we look at getter and setter from the point of view of implementing classes compliant with the javabeans specs then you do not need to define interfaces for them

2572871
getter	setter
but if you have things that require setter and getter like a bean might and which is also required to be plugged at compile-type not at run-time like a bean might and for which multiple implementations might exist then yeah this would call for an interface defining getter and setter

2572919
queue	fifo
lifo is easily represented by a stack fifo is a queue and i ve used a not-very-optimized-but-probably-adequate circular buffer implementation using a and index pointer to approximate a round-robin access pattern

the range of parameters is 0 for no intensity and 1 for max intensity of red green and blue

2573059
int	chars
if you mean that you want to convert the chars 0 to the int 0 and 1 to 1 et cetera than the simplest way to do this is probably the following

2573083
allocator	stl
the stl generic allocator is the best for the huge variety of circumstances and if you want a new allocator you will need to profile and understand your specific requirements

2573113
subclass	accessor
the example code i linked to describes how to create accessor in your nsmanagedobject subclass that will convert the image back and forth between a uiimage and binary data

2573212
int	double
my guess is that the reason for this slowdown is due to the conversion between the javascript double and the internal unsigned 8bit int used by the canvaspixelarray

2573251

this is not quite a js solution but can i recommend using the imacros plugin works with firefox google-chrome and ie for this

2573361
put	get
i can obviously get it to work if i put it in the a class tag but that s the problem

2573366
portrait	landscape
this uiview should support both landscape and portrait modes

2573366
portrait	landscape
but the problem is that for it to work i also need to shrink the two boxes as one changes from portrait to landscape because otherwise they would overlap

2573381
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2573432
int	double
typedef void foo int double

2573442

disk	ram
how do i find duplicates using 512 mb ram and infinite disk space

2573706
vb.net	vb6
for vb6 if there is any chance it will be converted to vb.net using call means the syntax doesn t change

2573707
inherited	subclassing
if you want to use inherited in conjunction with the singleton pattern you should put the inheritable state and behaviour into an abstract base class and define the singletons as final subclassing

2573708
sorting	grouping
the second or final pass requires sorting the records within a grouping of possible matches same length same hash code s same first x bytes

what are detached persistent and transient objects in hibernate

2573767
int	double
where i j k t are unsigned int and high low are double

2573767
floor	math.h
is there any reason i would actually want to use math.h floor functions over just a simple int typecast

2573778
ceil	floor
so for positive numbers the result of casting a floating-point value to an integral type is equivalent to calling floor but for negative number is is equivalent to calling ceil

2573787
integer	unsigned
actually casting a negative real number â -1 to unsigned integer is implementation-defined or undefined behavior

2573787
int	double
also floor returns a double so i + floor ... will be performed as a floating point operation instead of an int operation

2573791
sdl	devil
i use sdl and opengl and i recomend you to use the lib devil to load images

2573832
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested the following code in ie8 firefox google-chrome and it is working we just need to add the doctype correctly

when you get it back before you put it into the database you escape it using mysql_real_escape_string to make sure you do not suffer an sql injection attack

2574195
qtextedit	qtextcursor
the methods in qt4 do not have an argument which allows you to set a selection id nor can i find any other function in the qtextcursor or qtextedit which looks like it might allow me to do so

2574207
jdom	dom4j	jdom	xom	dom4j	xom
if you want a dom api that s easier to live with try xom jdom or dom4j

2574274

2574357
hash	md5
however the examples of some phrases and their md5 hash in that wiki article are very nice

2574392
converter	multibinding
i have the following xaml that does all that it is supposed to except that the multibinding on the fontsize fails on retrieving the users i see dependencyproperty.unsetdata when i set a breakpoint in the converter

2574412
hash	md5
md5 is a hash algorithm it produces a signature of the input text such that changing any letter in the input will have significant unpredictable impact on the signature

2574415
hash	md5
it can be arbitrarily long md5 hash for 2gb iso files are routinely created just like hash for strings a dozen characters long for passwords

2574438
std	ostream
it is simply a global instance of class std ostream a class which can also be instantiated normally if and when you need it

2574559
qtextedit	qtextcursor
to graphically visualise all the various selections separate qtextcursor objects instead of calling the settextcursor method for the qtextedit widget for each of the selections i change the background color of each of those sections of text by calling the setcharformat method for each of those qtextcursor objects

2574565
autofac	castle-windsor
autofac has interception capabilities which rely on castle dynamicproxy library same that castle-windsor uses

2574631
createelement	each
i ve also passed it to each createelement for my additional element names

2574642
free	malloc
on a related issue with malloc i understand that the memory needs to be deallocated free after the variable array z1 has been used

2574727
n-gram	words
if the above method is too simple you can increase its complexity by counting n-gram groups of words or even grammatical structure by first tagging the part-of-speech lots of spam is usually random garbage populated with keywords where non-spam usually makes some sense

2574742
width	height
i would have a prepared big image 32x320 pixels and defined starting position x y 0 32 and width height 32 32 and would want the script to show second 32x32 pixel part of main image

2574781
udp	tcp
if not you ll probably want to use udp or tcp

2574781
udp	tcp
few protocols these days design individual packets though many do send very specific data structures across the wire using tcp or less commonly udp

2574792
treemap	treeset
java has two built-in classes treemap and treeset providing red black trees

2574827
put	get
i don t really understand the purpose of the get and put functions here

2574827
put	get
so my question is what is the purpose of get and put in general

2574866
udp	rtp
first of all are you about to implement an enhanced transport protocol like rtp on top of udp or an application protocol like http smtp

2574962
nsstatusbar	nsstatusitem
items in the menu bar are nsstatusitem and the part of the menu bar in which they live is an nsstatusbar

2575016
getattr	setattr
well for that you could use python s getattr and setattr instead as you would on any python object

2575035
put	get
however more generally that won t apply and then get and put are convenient plumbing pieces whose meaning is perhaps clearer than writing the inner function directly

2575058
put	get
but if i put aaa bbb ccc when i print i only get ccc it cuts the previous off

2575065
getter	setter
i have a simple class getter setter and nothing more

2575111
google-chrome	safari
but then it was not working for the google-chrome and safari browsers stretching worked but the hight of the pictures was only 2 mm

quick example of mouseout and mouseleave

2575365
mouseout	mouseleave
what looks like a much more in depth look at the difference between mouseout and mouseleave

2575368
client-side	server-side
you are correct in thinking that keeping two versions of your objects feels wrong -- the whole idea of gwt is that you can share your server-side objects on the client-side and if you start divorcing the two you re not taking full advantage of gwt

2575399
superclass	subclassing
as other have said this is not advisable but here s a contrived example that does what you re looking for--the superclass calls an overridden method which uses an argument that was passed to the subclassing s constructor

2575401
lisp	smalltalk
if lisp isn t your cup of tea a variety of smalltalk environments are worth mentioning

2575427
super	extends
if you use super instead of extends allowing you to pass a it s the other way around

2575461
int	double
you still can add double and int objects in a list with or without

2575472
cpu	hyperthreading
it s on a intel cpu with hyperthreading that is returning the wrong number

2575523
int	double
some cursory research states that bitwise operators in javascript are inherently slow because internally it appears that javascript will cast all of its double values into signed 32-bit int to do the bitwise operations see here for more on this. because of this i can t do a direct port of the java random number generator and i need to get the same numeric results as java.util.random

2575538
hide	show
i d like to hide some of these events from the month view like a summary with a visual que that there are more on this day than can be show

2575561
division	multiplication
bear in mind that a bit shift is directly equivalent to a multiplication or division by a power of 2

2575599
cpu	hyperthreading
an intel hyperthreading core is treated by windows as a muti-core cpu

2575633
hide	show
it is commented to death but in general you give it a container id in which your elements to show hide are and then some hide-all-then-show-one-of-them is done in the select element s onchange

2575642
getter	setter
we use a lot of getter setter so i wrote the following template

2575651
mp3	wav
i am looking at apple s auriotouch example for the iphone and i would like to play an mp3 or wav instead of using the built in mic

2575663
serializable	deserialization
everything works good so far i can send and recieve objects and i use some serializable deserialization code

2575689
uiview	calayer
i have a uiview that contains a number of calayer subclasses

2575690
udp	tcp
the difference between tcp and udp is that the former takes care of sequencing of data and retransmission of dropped packets plus a flow control slow reader slows down fast writer while the latter doesn t

2575690
udp	tcp
i agree that playing with udp and low-level protocol state machines is a lot of fun but it has been done already and decades of research went into tuning tcp performance

2575695
stdout	stderr
i encountered much the same problem and eventually decided to use threads to gather up all the data on a sub-process s stdout and stderr and put it onto a thread-safe queue which which the main thread can read in a blocking fashion without having to worry about the threading going on behind the scenes

2575698
stdout	stderr
i have a script that calls a filter program with system and replaces the file in the buffer with its output but there doesn t seem to be a way to detect if the lines returned by system where written to stdout or to stderr

2575713
google-chrome	firefox
is it possible to hinder a script element in dom from running using userscripts content scripts or similar in google-chrome or firefox

2575731
int	chars
is there anyway to get the chars array into an int

2575731
int	chars
public void chars chars ch int start int

2575762
des	aes
now a days the symmetric encryption algorithm which des is of choice is aes which is like the spiritual successor to des

2575762
hash	md5
adobe essentially destroyed all the protection of aes in their pdf s by using an md5 hash of the users password as the key

2575762
hash	salt
essentially what this does is cryptographically securely hash your password with a supplied salt more on this in a bit a number of times supplied by the user

2575762
hash	salt
rather than taking a direct hash of your password a salt adds extra information to your input password creating a unique hash

2575762
rsa	aes
this aes session key is encrypted using the public rsa key

2575762
rsa	aes
the server decrypts the data using it s private rsa key and keeps the aes session key

2575803
stdout	stderr
you can use python to distinguish between stdout and stderr

2575814
listview	gridview
note that here lv is your listview not your gridview

2575839
width	height
for me the solution of setting the width height to zero and style to none didn t work out as it still showed a tiny window with an annoying shadow of what seems to be the border around a 0x0 window tested on windows 7

2575877
jstl	taglib
whenever you need to write some raw java code inside a jsp file which can t be replaced reasonably by taglib jstl and so on or el then the particular java code belongs in any way in a real java class like a servlet filter javabean etcetera

2575885
lxml	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup or lxml

when you hide the one button first and then show the other there s maybe a little gap which creates the flicker

2575979
fiddler	charles
there s charles which is very powerful and fiddler which is free

2575995
hide	show
now i want it so at first only the first div is showing and the others are hidden but i have asp loop that generates clickable links for the various divs pages and clicking on any given link will show that div and hide all the others

2575996
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
you should throw a nullpointerexception or an illegalargumentexception if filename is null

nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
there s a good debate on which to use in the question illegalargumentexception or nullpointerexception for a null parameter

2576002
haskell	sml
ml haskell scala f# sml and other languages can easily figure out the type from equivalent expressions in their own language mainly because they were designed with type-inference in mind from the very start

2576002
haskell	sml
by contrast ml haskell f# and sml support type inference so well because they have these sorts of restrictions you can t call methods before they re declared the first method call to inferred functions determines the type compilation order has an impact on type inference etc

2576007

udp	tcp
after studying tcp udp difference all week i just can t decide which to use

2576077
udp	tcp
the only other solution i came up with is to use udp and if there seems to be too great of loss of packets switch to tcp client-side

2576095
persistent	transient	instances	transient
a new instances of a a persistent class which is not associated with a session has no representation in the database and no identifier value is considered transient by hibernate

2576095
persistent	transient	instances	transient
you can make a transient instances persistent by associating it with a session

2576100
udp	tcp
if you can t lose data and you use udp you are reinventing tcp at least a significant fraction of it

2576102
udp	tcp
udp is simpler protocol than tcp and you can still simulate features of tcp using udp

2576102
udp	tcp
however i d firstly just use both udp and tcp check their behavior in a real environment and only then decide to reimplement tcp in terms of udp in the exact way you need

2576112
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mspec	nunit	mspec
does anyone know if it s possible to use mspec with mbunit instead of nunit

2576127
int	chars
my guess from your use of x is that content is encoding your hexademical number as an array of int and not an array of chars

2576136
udp	tcp
therefore tcp by definition is the right answer over udp

2576136
udp	tcp
the only other solution i came up with is to use udp and if there seems to be too great of loss of packets switch to tcp client-side

2576139
udp	tcp
start with the simplest setup i m guessing tcp for bulk data transfer and udp for non-reliable sensor data test measure find bottlenecks re-factor

2576196
lisp	scheme
another good resources is sicp which is specific to scheme a lisp dialect and available in full here

2576202
sorting	filtering
though you might end up writing a few lines of code here and there to implement a few extra features so that it matches the functionality of excel you know things like filtering sorting automatic value recalculation persistence printing etc. but it is a free one

2576213
division	addition
in your case you need two operations addition and division

google-chrome	safari
the following seems to work but i d like to avoid printing errors to the console at least safari and google-chrome do when accessing location.href on the parent frame

2576413
fgets	strcmp
however the real problem why strcmp doesn t return 0 is you have to trim the string read from fgets which in most cases includes a newline character

2576420
cpython	ironpython
the syntax and feature set are controlled strictly by the first two numbers -- every is claiming to implement the same syntax and feature set in terms of language definition not of aspects the language-reference manual explicitly leaves up to the implementation for example both jython and ironpython have buh mean a unicode string literal while cpython has it mean a byte string literal

2576424

i have this scenario that i m testing flat file debatching for debatching i need to set maxoccur properties of the schema to 1 but for batch processing it should be instead of creating a two different schemas i want just to create a base schema and inherited from it and then change the maxoccur properties in the derived schema

2576613
memcpy	memmove
the similar function memcpy does not have reliable semantics if the areas to be copied overlap whereas memmove does

i am using a query with aggregate-functions sum to generate the sum of each product

2576795
x86	64bit
msvc s implementation of a 64bit modulo on 32-bit x86 is some hairy loop filled assembly vc crt src intel llrem.asm for the brave so i d personally go with that

2576798
stdout	stderr
in tomcat unrecovered exceptions are usually logged to the stderr and that usually doesn t end up in the same logfile as the stdout

2576961
postgresql	mysql
why is this marked mysql and postgresql

2576975
mouseup	mousedown
another idea is to track clicks myself with mousedown mouseup which seems pretty primitive and probably belongs in a framework rather than my application

2576979
filesystems	ntfs

jmock easymock are tools to help achieve unit-testing your class

2577035
jmock	guice	easymock	jmock	easymock	guice
in the context of unit-testing guice is overlapped with jmock easymock

2577035
jmock	guice	easymock	jmock	easymock	guice
guice forces users to pollute their code with all kind of annotations such as inject to achieve the same result as jmock easymock

2577035

for the height and width

2578091
direct3d	directx
i was hoping to be able to implement a vertexbuffer interface much like the the directx one but it looks like in direct3d you have an array of structures and in opengl you need a separate array for each element which makes finding a common abstraction quite hard to make efficient

2578122
mouseout	mouseup	mouseout	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
mousedown mouseup is indeed the only way you can get notified of middle button interaction so detecting a down-then-up event without intervening mouseout event is more or less the best you can do

2578375
int	chars
a few tidbits that should help when you call a function with a string the string is split into multiple arguments the positional parameters named where n are int starting at 1 on the chars in the variable which defaults to spaces tabs and newlines

2578377
for-loop	loops	children	parent
i d start with get_categories and wp_list_categories the function while it may not be perfect for your needs is very flexible and guess that you d have to use a for-loop to go through the parent categories with a nested loops to handle the children as your pseudo-code suggests

2578442
qplaintextedit	qwidget
it s probably just qwidget not qplaintextedit

2578477

2578794
icmp	udp
the udp stack on the remote machine will likely be sending a icmp port unreachable error if there s no socket open on the port that you are sending to

2578794
icmp	udp
the problem with these icmp port unreachable errors is that they re reported via the winsock code by failing a pending udp recv recvfrom call

2578794
icmp	udp
the icmp port unreachable error isn t delivered reliably so you can t know for sure that you will get an error if you try and send udp data to a client that has gone away

2578816
imageview	listadapter

2580985
division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
most compilers will go even further than reducing division by powers of 2 into shifts - they ll often convert integer division by a constant into a series of multiplication shift and addition instructions to get the result instead of using the cpu s built-in divide instruction if there even is one

2580985
division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication

2581011
wordpress	joomla
does anyone know some plugin for either joomla drupal or wordpress that can do the simple purpose above

2581013
getter	setter
jaxb should then use the getter setter method pairs to inject retrieve the data rather than the fields and because setaddress adds the value to the set field that should work as you expect

2581061
ready	each
the only other approach i could think of is that each task runner makes a tcp connection to the server and registers it s interest then when a new task is ready the web app chooses a task runner and pushes the task down to that task runner to process

2581072
disk	ram
i ve tried searching around but all of the results i ve been able to find seem pretty fiddly to set up manually setting up a high-priority cpu-bound task on the same cpu core as the target app or running a background process that rapidly interrupts and resumes the target app and i don t know if the end result is actually a good representation of running on a slower computer with its slower cpu slower ram slower disk i o...

2581085
getter	setter
you should never put any logic in your dependency property getter and setter except for the getvalue and setvalue calls

2581107
icollection	iqueryable
when looking at it this way it makes sense to have icollection instead of iqueryable on your domain object s relationships

2581160
put	get
so you can put in extra helper methods testa and testb which won t get run unless you explicitly call them

2581180

and when drawrect is called i resize the background image view to be the correct height and width

2581567
post	get
but the most important part is that a script being hosted from cannot read data from but it can send data via post and get

2581587
inherited	properties
the purpose of the new operator is to create an object the this value inside the constructor setting the right internal properties to build the prototype chain and implement inherited you can see the details in the operation

2581592
put	get
in general dependencies should get written to disk or put in a database first

2581597
int	chars
why is it defined as a signed chars which could cause unexpected behaviour if a value greater than 1 byte in length is assigned to it rather than as an int as c does much less margin for error a zero value is false a non-zero value is true

2581597
int	chars
the only reason i can think of is the objective-c designers micro-optimising storage because the chars will use less memory than the int

2581605
ftp	smb
otroslogviewer user vfsfilesystems and can load logs from remote server ftp sftp smb http

2581625
int	chars
when you re printing the results your chars s are being extended to int s

2581629
width	height
it s a more general operation that works with two matrices also vectors are matrices iff the width of the first is equal to the height of the second but in this way you consider one of your arrays as trasposed to a column vector

2581636
put	get
better in my opinion to put a few read-only public properties in the class so that mappers can get access to the attributes they need

2581640
onclick	onchange
instead of a separate onclick for each option try an onchange on the select

2581658
quicksort	mergesort
when doing extreme optimizations you will likely find that in certain very special edge cases old and slow bubble sort may win over a glorified quicksort or mergesort

2581665
instances	transient
when i want to create a new instances of the object i lose my transient information

2581688

2581746
content-disposition	content-type
this forces any file to be downloadable by setting the content-disposition and content-type headers

2581768
versioning	upgrade
or maybe you want to find out all the people who bought product y before the latest versioning came out so you can send them a reminder to upgrade or whatever again you have to plan that ahead with a nosql database but it s trivial with a relational database

2581818
put	get
i guess you could put all the information as you go in the session but could you get into memory issues if a lot of people are using your app and going through the flow at the same time

2581822

i am not able to figure out which options to give to getsockopt to figure out whether the socket is udp or tcp

2582000
filtering	grouping
if you want all null values for synthid to be in their own grouping then i would probably filtering the first list and then do a concatenation

2582028
melt	reshape
you can easily achieve this by using melt in the reshape package

2582032
int	double
double has range more than a 64-bit int but its precision is less dues to its representation since double is 64-bit as well it can t fit more actual values

2582032
int	double
note how max int can fit into a double without loss of precision and boost intmax_t 64-bit in this case cannot

2582053
udp	tcp
sock_dgram or sock_stream should be for udp or tcp respectively

2582079

persistent	transient
the semantics of transient are precisely that the data is not persistent

2582228
persistent	transient
decide to persistent the transient field

2582228
persistent	transient
it doesn t really seem to be transient if you need it after merging the class into the persistent context

2582228
persistent	transient
maintain the value of the transient field outside of the persistent object

2582228
persistent	transient
one final thing the main use case i ve found for transient fields on domain classes is to demarcate derived fields fields that can be recalculated based on the persistent fields of the class

2582309
bindparam	bindvalue
i want to also mention that i have tried using bindvalue in place of bindparam and the data for the data variable will still not save

2582322
std	ostream
the problem was that std ostream is not copyable

2582353
recvfrom	datagram
udp socket is able to receive datagram from multiple clients with the recvfrom function

2582370

the only way i can think of is to do a standard loop and iterate several times but this limits me if a file or folder is several folder deep ... i can do this using n loops but that will only take me n directory deep

2582436
equals	tostring
you should probably override hashcode equals and tostring as well

2582450
int	double
c types are much faster than python types adding to c int or double can be done in a single clock cycle but less safe they are not arbitrarily sized and may silently overflow

2582518
post	get
you re setting values in the http header not get or post parameters in the http request

2582551
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately i am not able to get this working in firefox google-chrome

rss	feed
a simple rss feed would be enough but it doesnt seem to exist in facebook

2582646

i have two model classes written in straight ruby that currently simply connect get or put what they need and then disconnect

2582847
post	put
you could try put post simple json your data in elasticsearch and see how fast it is

2583203
hash	salt
but should you store the salt unique for each user next to the hash password+salt in the database

2583204
width	height
you can do it with a fixed width positioned in center and with negative margins with half of the width and half of the height

2583226
getter	setter
that is you assume that external libraries work properly and generated getter setter methods if your language supports those do not have to be tested either

2583230
hash	salt
even if an attacker gains access to a database it s not that easy to work out the real passwords from the salt especially if you don t have the code and don t know how the password is hash

2583244
hash	salt
salt is used to increase the time that an attacker would have to spend to find a password matching the hash stored in database

2583276

tcpclient	networkstream
the read write portions of the tcpclient are thread safe as explained in the documentation for the networkstream class which is what the tcpclient uses for its actual io

2583388
for-loop	loops
while the benefits and shortcomings of this can be discussed to eternity the bottom line is that java is really sparse in syntactic sugar in fact only syntactic sugar in java i can think of is the enhanced for-loop and even then internally jvm knows only of while loops anyway

2583400
nunit	mstest
i seem to have missed something - in this step through it talks through downloading nunit and changing the original mstest reference to nunit

2583416
udp	tcp
there are many choices http tcp udp jms xmlrpc rmi corba c rpc or flash-drives carried by post pigeons

2583420
nunit	mstest
adding the reference to nunit is fine but you need to make sure that the attributes you put on the class and test methods are those of nunit and not mstest

2583502
put	get
and as you can see now you can get rid off that strange second if you put inside the loop

2583596
jboss	glassfish
if you plan to do some ejb3 3.1 development as well have a look at glassfish or jboss

2583604
post	get
depending on how the remote site is set up you could use a simple post there is an open data table for that 1 or you could create your own small custom data table and use 2 to send whatever headers including cookie you need over one or more get post requests

2583645
put	get
if you want to put all in the db then i would add a unique sequence number to all records in the in-between table lets call it seqid then still perform a query but instead of getting whole rows only get the sequence number

having a variable public or having a variable private with public getter and setter is not the same even the getter and the setter doesn t make any transformation to the variable

2583858
getter	setter
getter and setter are made to do some kind of operation on the variable when this is set or it is get like caching or constraints check

2583858
getter	setter
a public getter or setter could be overwritten in a subclass specializing its behavior

2583858

getter	setter
you are very right it s better to have the variable private and have public getter setter

2583892
getter	setter
this relates to what is called representation independance that fact that if external access happen through getter setter you can change the internal representation of the object without major glitches

2583909
gif	png
its very easy to use gdiplus to load a variety of image formats including jpeg gif animated png and so on

2583915
getter	setter
in most langauages like you say the recommendation is to encapsulate all fields with a property setter getter

2583915
getter	setter
then you may argue that getter setter are not required

2583915
getter	setter
pre-auto-implemented properties one would have had to write getter setter which may be considered overkill for a private inner class

2583969
serializable	deserialization
so the serializable and deserialization work correct now but i don t know if there are any other side effects

2583974
getter	setter
the usual reflex for a programmer is to set all fields in a class as private and offer an interface formed of a series of getter and setter to manipulate them

2583974
public	protected
the public protected and default none access specifier are needed in some cases

2583994
ceil	floor
if you expand the algorithm to use a different rounding function for each term rather than the same rounding function for all you can generate the other named modes _ ceil ceil floor ceil ceil ceil _ where _ means don t care will generate ionian but you will also generate many other modes that can t result in a natural scale

3des	aes
symmetric encryption systems aes or 3des are much more efficient and they come with chaining modes which allow them to process input messages of arbitrary length

2584297
rsa	aes
thus it is customary to use an hybrid system in which a big message is symmetrically encrypted with aes using a symmetric key which is an arbitrary short sequence of random bytes and have that key encrypted with rsa

2584297
ssl	https
another well-known protocol meant for encrypting network traffic is ssl now standardized under the name of tls and often used in combination with http as the famous https protocol

2584346
mouseover	mouseout
hover is basically an encapsulation of mouseover and mouseout event and it is tied to one element

you might have to add the bom to the nsdata object not the nsstring

2585244
daemon	cron
the job looks like it wants to run as i get the following email from the cron daemon when it completes

2585294

unix	bsd
my guess is that the vast majority of desktop users run the hotspot jvm from oracle s jre jdk or one of its forks soylatte on osx icedtea or openjdk on unix bsd linux and they don t fiddle with the commandline options so they will probably get the c1 compiler with the default 1500 jit threshold

2585608
jquery	simplemodal
i m planning to use the jquery simplemodal for login and registration on my project site

2585670
ostream	istream

but when i resize it until the horizontal scrollbar is activated the content of the hidden div will be shown at the end of the page when the tooltip is activated

2585948
pascal	delphi
in our case we detect the buggy vpn driver and swap out move and fillchar with the delphi 7 versions replace inttostr with a pascal version int64-version uses the fpu and since we re using fastmm we disable its custom fixed size move routines too since they re even more susceptible than system.move

google-chrome	firefox
i m using a tooltip that works in firefox google-chrome and ie7-8 but in ie6 it doesn t appear

2586059
keydown	keyup
there should exist a keyup-event as well and by using both keydown and keyup you can achieve the effect you re looking for

2586059
keydown	keyup
one would be to let your keydown event initiate a repeating action and let keyup cancel it

2586224
regasm	gacutil
i sometimes need to compile on the command line when i write simple stuff and also to use gacutil and regasm

2586466
children	parent
that is there is no way to make the parent aware of the methods of the children

2586480
maven	pom.xml

2586534
google-chrome	firefox
you can also use any dom inspection tools like ie8 s development tools google-chrome developer tools or firefox add-on firebug to see the actual css applied to the google map control and see which rules come from where

2586558
ubuntu	linux
some modern linux systems at least ubuntu have deprecated prelinking their internal linking systems are efficient in remapping libraries on-the-fly or they provide some other mechanism to allow libraries to load without conflicts

2586578
post	get
i want to know few things about the get and post in terms of jquery

2586578
post	get
i am not using either get or post in this method

2586578
post	get
either get or post while send and getting the data in php webapps

2586578
post	get
the code that i use first works fine even though i do not use any post or get methods

2586592
implements	extends
i am thinking of either extends defaultdatadescriptor or create a class which implements itreedatadescriptor

2586593
pull	push
this means that pull and push operations are automatically done with the main branch

2586600
put	get
2 if the __getattr__ hook didn t thrill you there s another option that i know of albiet with its own caveats and we ll get to those put the deprecated functions definitions inside __init__ and hide them with a custom __dir__

2586605
post	get
the differences between get and post is that using the get method parameters are sent as part of the url whereas with post parameters are sent in the body of the request

2586627
post	get
all data you send to a server from a browser in the normal case will be via http verbs request methods almost always get or post although there are others

2586627
post	get
jquery ajax methods can use get or post depending on what you tell them to do

2586628
textarea	textbox
is going to fail because text is not a property of html inputs or textarea which is how asp.net textbox are rendered

2586639
post	get
in terms of vocabulary the purists say that get should get information and post should post it

2586646
ready	each
when they are ready to crop the coordinates of each corner can be sent via ajax to the server

2586669
implements	extends
then we have abstractlist an abstract class implements list which provides implementation of almost everything a fully-fledged list needs - to create your own list implementation all you have to do is extends abstractlist and fill in a few methods

2586675
folder	directory
so instead of pasting them into the directory via explorer use visual studio to paste the files into the folder

2586730
hide	show
how can jquery be used to change a class of an image to show and ensure that all other images in that same div are set to a class of hide

2586749
ubuntu	linux
i would like to optimise this as far as possible at minimum inconvenience to end users who will probably use it as an uncompiled collection of python scripts and will be using windows mac and mainly ubuntu linux

2586759
folder	directory
for example if you want to create a folder whose name matches one of your id values as a sub folder under the directory where your database is stored you could use this code

2586787
unsigned	short
also comp_t is said to be floating-point value consisting of a 3-bit base-8 exponent and a 13-bit mantissa but i think u_int16_t is just a unsigned short int

2586814
qtextedit	qtextdocument
basically qtextedit allows you to read and edit qtextdocument object that is essentially what you want to serialize and deserialize

2586814
serializable	deserialization
implementing serializable deserialization of qtextdocument should not be way to complicated because all the building blocks of qtextdocument are serializable

2586851
rss	feed
can t an rss feed do the job for you

2586874
client-side	server-side
this question mixes client-side scripting with server-side parsing

2586912
nunit	mspec
i ve seen mspec used with nunit on some blogs and discussions

2586912
nunit	mspec
in fact most of the examples on the web that i ve seen demonstrate mspec with some kind of nunit dependancy or integration

2586912
nunit	mspec
my team is attempting to use mspec without nunit on a new asp.net mvc2 project

2586912
nunit	mspec
are there benefits to using mspec with nunit

2587093
post	get
i ll update my post once i get more information

2587163
hash	salt
i could instead send a random number or one-way hash of their e-mail address plus random salt

2587172
junit	powermockito
yes this works by using the powermockito rule available if you use junit 4.7+

2587176
folder	directory
i looked a bit more at that project and see that there is a folder directory under it that has the source code with the function you are referencing

2587189
jstl	taglib
your example is not mvc at all but a good starting point is the javaserver pages taglib jstl

2587194
virtualbox	bootcamp
also with bootcamp you have to reboot the machine to switch between windows and os x so virtualbox is the way to go

2587238
hide	show
i d like to load all the forms in one go so clicking through the buttons essentially hide show the relevant forms

2587250
post	get
i ve read in other post that the search controller should use get but i think it makes more sense to use post because of the large number of search params

2587250
post	get
this article talks about using binding instead of request.form to get at the post data

2587259
getter	setter
if you want to call predefined methods to do something in the get or set implement the property getter setter to call those methods

i have spent the whole day trying to make a script which on submit hide the form and show hidden with animated progress bar

2587269
opera	firefox
finally my script works in internet explorer firefox opera but.

2587297
nunit	mspec
mspec does not depend in any way on nunit or xunit

2587297
nunit	mspec
what you can do although it s neither required nor do i see any benefit in doing it is to use nunit s assertion library assert.istrue et al. together with mspec

2587299
post	get
for the get vs post question i m still struggling with that general question myself but i do have an opinion on your specific use of it

2587299
post	get
now i may be way off with my get vs post opinion here but i think there will be a lot of agreement on the class vs formcollection opinion

2587301
qgroupbox	qtextedit
for example if the names of your qgroupbox qlabel and qtextedit are group label and edit you can use

2587314
width	height
x y width and height however mean different things for different shapes

2587331
division	addition
in particular note the last line in addition this implementation quarters this amount. i take that to mean that the division by four is in fact entirely arbitrary

2587376
switching	screens
if the users are spending a majority of their time on one screens and don t commonly want to switching to the other screens the tabbar may be a bit of overkill

2587419
int	boolean
when you pass a lambda to sort you need to return an int not a boolean

width	height
self.fvidscale_cap.set_property caps gst.caps_from_string video x-raw-yuv width 256 height 192

2587440
puts	gets
maybe use a sleep function after puts and gets to give the transaction time to finish and see if that makes a difference

2587450
redhat	fedora
my system is a centos system so i imagine it is probably either ferencing the default fontconfig.properties.src file or the fontconfig.fedora.properties.src file since centos and fedora are both derived from redhat

2587489
prepare	execute
you have no error checking on the prepare execute calls so there s no way to tell if either spit out an error

2587518
background-color	transparency
would i just make a background-color transparency

2587520
int	boolean
you cannot use an int in place of a boolean expression in a conditional is not legal

2587528
submit	submission
by submission it to a timer you can submit it to a new thread and not do the thread management yourself

2587549
client-side	server-side
so this is actually done server-side rather than client-side

2587557
pop-up	dialog
as security restriction every time you want to save a file it pop-up the save as dialog box asking the user where to save it

2587569
mxml	haxe
for this simple application i would suggest using haxe since it is free and easy to use for simple swfs no mucking about with mxml etc

2587576
put	get
it s inside a bigger array i need to get the first and second hef attribute seperatly so that i can put one href as a link and another with a

2587615
implements	extends
public class myview extends myapp implements viewswitcher.viewfactory

2587622
min	max
the reason for the error is that you can not use aggregate ie min max count... functions in the where clause - only in the having clause can you do this

2587691
implements	extends
create a custom class mypanel that extends htmlpanel and implements hasclickhandlers

2587699
public	protected
also you might consider following the proper .net event pattern of making the event public calling a protected virtual method name onwhateveryoureventisnamed and in that method invoking the event with this and a new event args

2587702
post	put
i put his post here because i know you always active so please don t consider this a bad question and share me your opinions

2587751
min	max
i m looking for an algorithm to find bounding box max min points of a closed quadratic bezier curve in cartesian axis

2587770
getter	setter
however it s a good idea not to add any listeners unnecessarily and it s also a good idea to keep any sort of business logic out of getter setter but that s strictly for the sake of code legibility

2587789
folder	directory
assuming your server has mod_rewrite enabled you should be able to put this inside a .htaccess file in the root folder of your site inside a directory or virtualhost section

2587821
border-color	background-color	background-color	transparency
to answer the question as posed you can only set background-color and border-color to the transparency value

rss	feed
check if the page has a rss representation and pick the article text from the rss feed instead

2587890
mockups	balsamiq
balsamiq mockups for xwiki is the closest thing i ve seen

2587921
post	put
see this post and put a check for the object types before

2587923
profiling	instrumentation
if you enable full profiling of the application by line the instrumentation performed by aqtime will be so heavy and the data collected so much it will slow down your application a lot

2587941
post	put
i found i could use add_action loop_start interceptme to put something at the top before post or a single post but it still left the sidebar on the right

2587950
post	get
the difference is that one is accessed when a post is performed the other is accessed when a get is performed

2588118
vb.net	vb6
when i try to run the vb6 app in debug mode i get could not find endpoint element with name nettcpbinding_icomportmanager and contract icomportmanager in the servicemodel client configuration section. using a dummy vb.net client app with the same wcf dll works fine

i have 2 canvases one uses html attributes width and height to size it the other uses css

2588202
visualvm	yourkit
for profiling you can use visualvm yourkit etc

2588205
min	max
if you just want a axis-aligned bounding box i think you need to find the min and max of each x y for each control point of all the segments

2588208
super	abstract
you cannot use an interface to enforce a constructor you should probably use a common abstract super class with the desired constructor

2588278
getter	setter
the getter and setter map the nid field to the id field

2588297
jobs	cron
i believe path alias also can be created in cron jobs but i m not quite sure

2588319
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
use existing core exceptions where appropriate argumentexception invalidoperationexception etc

2588378
stateless	stateful
we started a discussion about stateful or stateless webservices for this approach

2588404
width	height
it seems that the width and height attributes determine the width or height of the canvas s coordinate system whereas the css properties just determine the size of the box in which it will be shown

2588404
width	height
the canvas element has two attributes to control the size of the element s bitmap width and height

2588404
width	height
the width attribute defaults to 300 and the height attribute defaults to 150

2588425
hide	show
or would i have to write an action that show hide the popover myself behavior that s being done behind the scenes presumably by the split view controller now

2588457
post	get
if so i would send the data to delete via post instead of get so that it can t be navigated to directly

2588470
pull	push
pull push to remote git

2588533
for-loop	if-statement
can t go much simpler that one for-loop and no if-statement

2588551
exponent	modulo
to give just a very rough estimate on the speed of this montgomerys reduction i have an old benchmark that performs a modular exponentiation with 64-bit modulo and exponent in 1600 ns on a 2.4ghz core 2

2588642
ienumerable	iqueryable
that s why a repository should be an iqueryable and ienumerable

2588712
16-bit	64bit
i can t test anything to complete my post because i believe that command.com runs in 16-bit mode and 64bit versions of windows on which i m running don t support that mode anymore so no more command.com for me

2588751
folder	directory
it may map to a different folder in other languages but as long as you get the directory from the environment variable and not hard-code it then it doesn t really make a difference

2588856
ubuntu	linux
go get virtual box and create an ubuntu or fedora image or whatever other flavor of linux you may prefer and use that for development

2588858
maven	pom.xml
i have a stable opensource library and was wondering how and if i can publish my lib to maven official repositories so people can include it in their pom.xml files and get the dependency downloaded automatically

2588865
public	protected
another option is to create a public or protected constructor in base that will take the parameters and populate the vector directly

2588890
powerpc	i386
so if you are using the apple-supplied python on 10.6 distutils will supply -arch i386 -arch powerpc -arch x86_64 the three archs that it was built with

2588925
imagemagick	mogrify
you can use mogrify from imagemagick and floodfill to fill the countries with color

2588927
oembed	feed
i m using the jquery oembed plugin to display videos from a vimeo feed

2588945
multiplying	add
then to take the intersection of two vectors you multiplying the terms and to take the union you add the terms

2588966
mouse	keyboard
i know that you can write javascript and do it yourself but do any keyboard keys shortcuts already exist without using the mouse

2588974
public	protected
if you want the container in the base class to remain private you might consider adding a public or protected function in base to allow the derived class to add a range

2588974
public	protected
and as zdan suggested this functionality could be part of public or protected constructor for base if that makes more sense which is likely

2588997
udp	tcp
instead you can use udp and implement your own scheme for verification of data that is less stringent than tcp

2589032
integer	fractions
if you want an idea to get you started off the cuff i d suggest calculating the minutes in your input range remembering that a tdatetime value is a floating point where the integral value is the number of days and the fractions part is a portion of a day then incrementing thru the range and for each integer step day subtract the appropriate number of minutes for that day from the total based on your rules and the start end-time of the first last days in the range when those days are encountered in the range intervening days being of course complete 24 hour periods

2589050
put	get
key-value systems basically support get put and delete operations based on a primary key

2589070
ostream	istream
should i open - write - close every time i want to write to ostream and thus to the ftp and can i then expect a reply hasbytesavailable event on istream

2589107
inherited	subclassing
enums are good for a fixed set of options - in your case you want the flexibility of inherited so just use subclassing directly

2589129
calloc	malloc
short answer change your innermost malloc to a calloc

2589142
uilabel	uibutton
i have a nib with a uiview that contains some uilabel uibutton etc

2589193
post	get
if you post some code you could get a bit clearer answer

2589223
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	webkit	gecko
this handles webkit safari google-chrome etc gecko firefox and khtml konqueror

2589257
width	height
for example if the aspect ratio width height of the screen is larger than the aspect ratio of the image then it s too wide - so scale the width of the image but keep the height the same size as the viewport

2589267
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
if you have wsdl use the svcutil.exe tool or the wsdl.exe tool to generate proxy classes and dtos for the xml messages being sent and received on the wire

2589282
min	max
an example being a list of ints and a struct containting two ints min and max for selection purposes

2589282
min	max
there selection would be based upon b a- min b a- max

2589325
sorting	filtering
actually if the task really is about users finding files of a particular size range sorting or filtering the list by file size by default or as a user option is probably the best solution

2589333
post	get
here is an msdn article on this and to get managed call-stacks i have few post

2589375
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tested firefox 3.6 msie 7 safari 4 google-chrome 4 and opera 10 and they all do in fact support creating cookies via third party javascript even when third party cookies are disabled

2589378
put	get
in this case you can probably get away with because it looks like the filter on the id column will limit you to one record but generally what you need to do instead is put a full-text index on the name column and write the query like this

2589391
wikitext	mediawiki
i wrote some code to do this a few years back but it never got released because parsing mediawiki wikitext semantically is basically impossible

2589391
wikitext	mediawiki
the problem is that mediawiki allows you to freely intermingle wikitext constructs with html constructs and the official parser in mediawiki works by progressively transforming the wikitext into html mostly using a horrifically complex set of regular expression substitutions

2589391
wikitext	mediawiki
basically it s my opinion that mediawiki wikitext is unsuitable for any purpose besides being translated into html and if you want to parse anything out of it you re probably best off using a piece of code that translates it to html and then parsing that html

2589427
width	height
you need to define width and height in order for overflow to work otherwise it would just expand

2589462
cpu	processors
although the same opcode was chosen deliberately and as far as the processors state is concerned they make no difference the execution time - and the exact internal implementation - can differ on a ht pause vs non-ht nop cpu

2589542
httphandler	httpmodule
i want to resolve whatever from inside non-page contexts such as global.asax httpapplication httpmodule httphandler etc

2589543
wordpress	joomla
joomla drupal and wordpress all come with so many out of the box features you d have to strip out - look for something that starts fairly simple

2589555
google-chrome	firefox
of course i think google-chrome s developer tools and firebug web developer for firefox are tremendously helpful as well...each tool has it s area that it helps with

2589572
builtin	isinstance
the isinstance builtin is the preferred way if you really must but even better is to remember python s motto it s easier to ask forgiveness than permission

2589579
post	get
1.in this query how do i get the posting_id value of the post

2589593
vim	textmate
i often work in eclipse but recently switched to textmate which is in my opinion the best text editor out there barring perhaps vim or something like that but i find the learning curve too steep to jump into that quite yet

2589611
post	get
1.in this query how do i get the posting_id value of the post

2589660
hash	md5
normally with http-html requests cookies would store a md5 hash representing a session id

2589662
post	get
but per alex s post you don t need to manipulate the date string to get the sort order right...so lose the .split -

2589675
children	parent
when adding a child object to the parent children collection using the code below i can t get the id of the persisted child until i commit the transaction

2589697
width	height
i have a flash movie height 151px width 228 this is placed within a table cell

2589726
many-to-many	one-to-many
i am having trouble working out how to correctly cache one-to-many or many-to-many relationships in nhibernate

2589730
vbscript	jscript
if you need your code to be a service but to be activated every hour the easiest approach would be to make your service a com object and have a simple task scheduled every hour that invokes a jscript vbscript that creates your com object and calls simple method on it

2589746
children	parent
i m looking for a generic dao implementation in hibernate that includes parent child relationship management adding removing getting children setting parent etc

2589792
action-filter	onactionexecuting
all you have to do is access the actionexecutingcontext of an overloaded onactionexecuting method and make identity public instead of private so your action-filter can access it

2589853
jar	war
i m guessing that if i put them in my ruby apps lib folder they would be copied to web-inf lib and all would be well however it seems odd to have 2 copies of the jar in the war file is that what i am meant to do

2589858
chunked	transfer-encoding
server gives responses with transfer-encoding chunked here sample response

2589862
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
pick up its output with firebug for firefox or the built-in consoles in the developer tools in safari and google-chrome ie no help as usual

2589899
inherited	properties
however your class would need to inherited from qobject use the q_object macro and register the properties for all that to work.

2589931
profiling	benchmarking
of course only benchmarking and profiling will tell you if that s actually going to be a benefit for your particular situation

2589948
move	drag
after the drag and drop of the child form is completed the artifacts stay around generally but i ve found that setting focus to a different application s window and then refocusing back on to my application window that it is redrawn and all is good again until the child forms are move once again

2589960
width	margin
the fixed width keeps the text from filling the window and the margin 0 auto centers the h1 tag itself

2590000
strdup	malloc	strcpy	strdup	strcpy	malloc
strdup is basically a shortcut that does a malloc and a strcpy and you don t have to worry about the size of addr upfront

2590061
post	get
another way to do it which could be cleaner would be to get the url that jquery post to from the form s action attribute

2590075
integer	unsigned
it doesn t matter whether you declare your column as integer unsigned integer bigint or whatever

2590155
int	double
the type of a unix timestamp is an int and you are reading data as a double

2590163
int	chars
these files require a lot of bit-shifting and such to read flags so i am wondering that when i reference some of the memory if it is faster to read 4 bytes at once as an int or 1 byte as a chars

2590185
int	chars
if you are working with inherently chars data then it s going to be faster to keep it that way than to read everything as int and bit shift things around

2590195
getter	setter
i want to learn from the user of setter and getter this- constructors and so on..

2590209
uilabel	uibutton
also you d better not add a uibutton on the top of a uilabel

2590230
uiview	subviews
make both of them subviews of a uiview

2590281
post	put
the relevant specification for put and post is rfc 2616 â 9.5ff

put	get
i am planning to get the list of station and put them in an xml file in sdcard and provide that in a listview so that when one item is get selected that station will start playing.the xml file should be updated if any new station is added

2590421
width	height
i would not recommend setting the width and height to 100 because that s not the standard behaviour of message boxes

2590421
width	height
you should set them to a width and height of a maximum of 50 of your application

2590488
postgresql	mysql
mysql was bought by oracle and in my private opinion there are better open source alternatives like postgresql

2590523
keydown	keyup
have you tried registrering the keydown event for setting the flag and then the keyup event for unsetting the flag

2590526
keydown	keyup
instead of using the keyup event you should take the keydown event

2590633
ready	each
each client waits on the waithandle for its response to be ready

2590646
width	height
you ll just have to calculate your cell height based upon the label width

2590705
ant	maven
but the other part of the equation is that java build tools like ant and maven are capable of only compiling classes that have changed and their tree of dependent classes

2590740
testcase	fixture
if that doesn t work you may need to dump the production data copy it locally and use it as a fixture for the testcase you are using

int	chars
how do i convert an int to a chars and also back from chars to int

2590858
response.redirect	redirecttoaction
2 you can use response.redirect in mvc but you may prefer to use redirecttoaction as it will help with your routing if you ever come to change it

2590897
int	chars
likewise you can convert the chars a to the int 1 as follows

2590983
move	drag
when a user drag an item i change the items opacity to 50 and physically move the item in an observablecollection in my viewmodel depending on where the user wants it

2590983

invokelater	invokeandwait
note 2 when i replace invokeandwait with invokelater the tree doesn t get updated

2591776
for-loop	loops
normally we don t need the row count because we use a while loops to iterate through the result set instead of a for-loop

2591804
for-loop	loops
while there s not a numeric for-loop you can use a character string as a loops variable.

2591817

2592005
hash	salt
checks if user exists in database if it does then retrieve the salt for that user hash the password and salt would this be done on the client or server side

2592005
hash	salt
however if they have the database and know how to combine the salt and the hash it becomes that much easier to do a brute force attack

ironruby	ironpython
ironruby and ironpython cover those two languages

2593773
codeigniter	kohana
the question is do you want to work with someone else code and try to figure out how to dig inside and extend so it can fit your needs or you want to go with a light framework like kohana or maybe codeigniter my personal favorite and drive your own car although you might need to invent some of the wheels

2593982
jstl	taglib
attempt 1 should work if you installed jstl and declared the taglib the right way and declared the web.xml to be at least servlet 2.4

2593982

ienumerable	ilist
there is some code that i m trying to convert from ilist to ienumerable

2595051
mp3	wav
you would be best off streaming as mp3 since pcm wav is very inefficient

2595078
hide	show
this creates an infinite loop of show hide calls as the smaller div slides in and out of where the cursor is pointing

2595082
javassist	cglib
it uses javassist to effectively dynamically generate sub-classed implementations of your objects although i think it can be configured to use cglib too

2595158
hide	show
this only queues a hide animation if it s visible visible and only queues a show animation if it s not hidden preventing the queue loop behavior you have now

2595229

2595325
put	get
in addition on a gui app like wpf or win form app the only thread that can change the gui elements is the main thread gui thread so you should use begininvoke using this thread and put there a callback to change the gui otherwise you get an invalid operation exception

2595332
switching	screens
i guess it was having to re-draw the toggle switching every time the screens was re-drawn

2595332

width	height
after working with the .net gdi+ rectangle object i ve noticed that if i create a rectangle that is x 0 y 0 width 100 height 100 the right and bottom properties are set to 100 100

2595761
width	height
fwiw the documentation does say the right is computed by x + width and the bottom is y + height but is that correct

pop-up	dialog
my problem is i d like to implement that dialog when the user attempts to close the browser rather than display the ugly little pop-up box

2595942
implements	extends
much code is shared between clients but there are also many differences which i implements by subclassing controllers and views to overload or extends existing features or introduce new ones

2595991
jar	war
assuming you are using an older ant distribution that lacks the war task use the jar task which war inherits from

if this happens to others i bet their libc is buffering their stdout stderr before sending the data to the os

2596021
google-chrome	firefox
cutting to the chase here it shows that google-chrome and firefox when set to remember the login-information for a specific website send these information with every single post back

2596021
google-chrome	firefox
ergo my timer with a tick every 30 second had its call back parameters extended with the user s login preferences when having set google-chrome or firefox to remember your latest login and password

2596021
google-chrome	firefox
this allows my site to support the login-preference memory in google-chrome and firefox

2596035
width	height
it is simplest to pass in double.positiveinfinity for the width and height because it allows your usercontrol to choose its own width and height

2596035
width	height
if you explicitly set the width height it doesn t matter much but this way your usercontrol has the option of using wpf s layout system to automatically grow when necessary if the data is larger than expected

2596035
margin	height
note that all the layout is done by wpf s layout given the usercontrol size and the specified height and margin

2596044
margin	text-indent
1 tweaking text-indent margin padding etc

2596044
width	font-size
because it would be dependent on font-size default white-space width etc

2596047
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
often it s good to use multiples of 1024 and 8192 has been shown as a good sweet spot for most applications and the reason the java s bufferedinputstream and bufferedoutputstream use that value for the default buffer sizes

2596071
expression-blend	silverlight
with silverlight it looks like if i want a drag and drop approach to build my interface i would need expression-blend to do that

2596081
google-chrome	firefox
the reason why firefox performed the binding and raised the onload event on the 1st snippet and the others didn t might be because the firefox google-chrome its user interface itself is written and automated using javascript - that s why it s so flexible and easy to write extensions on it

2596110
min	max
edit you can t group by aliases of group columns min max count etc but using aliases of functions concat you can

2596131
ienumerable	icollection
alternatively you could also use either icollection or ienumerable since they are also both interfaces implemented by the generic dictionary collection

2596228
children	parent
how can i make this jquery script close all previously opened children when entering a new parent

2596228
children	parent
at the moment it traverses thru all the tree structure fine but switching from one parent to another does not close the previous children but rather only the each individual parent elements as a user browses

2596228
children	parent
i assume my problem is jquery isn t closing the children between each new parent so i need to make a call but i m a bit lost on how to do that

2596235

2596293
getter	setter
create an additional surrogate property of string type with a getter and setter that reads or updates the actual property

2596295
chunked	transfer-encoding
since the content length of a gzipped response is unpredictable and it s potentially expensive and slow to compress it fully in memory first then calculate the length and then stream the gzipped response from memory the average webserver will send them in chunks using transfer-encoding chunked without a content-length header

2596295
chunked	transfer-encoding
you have to determine the transfer-encoding response header and if it equals to chunked then you have to parse it as a chunked stream

2596314
post	put
i m redirecting you to a previous post where you put a link to this topic i made sooner this day highlight text except html tags

2596329

2596364
awt	swing
also think of the awt swing event-dispatcher thread

2596396
hash	salt
the dynamic salt is plenty - the main purpose of a salt is to prevent rainbow-table attacks if the hash are ever acquired by a malicious party and the reason for dynamic salt is to further prevent special-case rainbow table generation from breaking all passwords simultaneously

2596396
hash	salt
aside from that though it can t hurt to salt regardless of whether or not the library has salting built in though unless you re passing it more info than just the item to be hash it doesn t really have anything to use as a dynamic salt so chances are it doesn t salt for you if it s not already obvious that it does

2596438
width	height
the above code basically detects a single tap on a small image width 18 and height 36

2596452
width	height
even if the text size is far larger than the width or height of the textview

2596457

i don t know why browsers favor their cached input field values over what is returned from the post yet give an honest representation of what is retrieved from a get

2597195
post	get
this might actually be what they d expect though and i generally like post then redirect to get as it prevents potentially damaging re-posting

2597232
int	chars
byte pointers chars s than word pointers int s

2597302
opencv	emgucv
it also seems it s the opencv project is my best bet so far i ll try and use it with this other project opencvdotnet or emgucv

2597369
avr	microcontroller
i have what i hope is a simple question pertaining to the avr microcontroller

2597374
queue	fifo
since you have only one worker thread and the queue is used in a fifo manner tasks will be executed in order

2597374
implements	extends
note many people will argue that you should not extends a threadpoolexecutor but instead say you implements executorservice and have your class contain a threadpoolexecutor which you delegate to aka composition

2597388
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
though i have been able to do it in ie and firefox but its not working for opera and google-chrome

2597388
opera	google-chrome
can anyone suggest how may i be able to achieve the same in opera and google-chrome

2597399
opera	firefox
this works as expected in webkit browsers and opera but it seems like firefox doesn t update the background-color in css immediately after a mouseout event occurs so the current background-color doesn t get drawn if a mouseout occurs and it isn t followed up by another event that calls the draw routine

2597399
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
it works just fine in opera google-chrome and safari

2597419
min	max
heap structure can be built in o n time there is min heap and max heap

2597419
min	max
just by building the heap you find the min and max

2597486
audiotrack	audiorecord
i ve noticed that the c++ classes underlying the audiotrack and audiorecord apis in android both have a latency method that is not exposed via jni

2597486
audiotrack	audiorecord
as far as i can see the latency method in audiorecord still does not take into account the hardware latency they have a todo comment for that but the latency method in audiotrack does add in the hardware latency

2597520
width	height
it works but i have some try call editor event handler catch stuff in callee page because not every editor provides these functions and some attributes editor width height for instance that are loaded as variables declared in javascript

2597544
dependencyobject	observablecollection
another way of achieving this would be that you implement a new xxxviewmodel class that derives from dependencyobject and you put this one in the observablecollection

2597558
ant	maven	scons	autotools
you can use gnu make optionally with autotools ant maven cmake or scons among many

2597558
debian	linux
once you have the basic build working you can package your program as a .deb and or .rpm so it can be easily installable by users of major gnu linux distributions debian and red hat

2597584
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the content of viewa that u would be setting in viewdidload method of the viewcontroller of viewa can be set in viewwillappear

2597588
google-chrome	firefox
this application run well in firefox 3+ google-chrome and ie8

try loading a local file that is blank or has a loading graphic when you hide it rather than just loading new content when you show it

2597691
set	bag
a multiset or bag is a set that can have duplicate values and on which you can do set operations intersection difference etc

2597716
serializable	deserialization
you basically can create an object and use that as the basis for your input or output values and soap will handle the creation of a schema for serializable and deserialization for you automatically

2597749
disk	ram
for example for a good 64-bit machine 64 gb of ram about bytes and a couple of tb of disk usable as swap space for virtual memory about bytes

2597749
disk	ram
i think it s more practical to put it this way especially on a 64-bit machine with decent amounts of ram and disk upper bounds of long integers are way bigger than anything you ll ever compute

2597750
vbscript	jscript
note that the abive is achieved without com purely via one registry setting and a file containing a blob of script javascript jscript vbscript etc. the script jscript vbscript may in turn work with com objects should your menu action logic reside in such an object

2597832
mouseover	mouseout
i am using javascript mouseover and mouseout events when i move my mouse very quickly the events are not triggered

2597863

2597863
hash	md5
md5 hash object 01806220

2597893
int	double
assuming you re sure the result will be convertible to int you can parse it as double and cast to int

2597899
int	double
you can parse the string as a double and later cast the double to int

2597899
int	double
however casting from double to int is subject to precision lost or even int overflow

2597942
subtraction	addition
this algorithm uses o 1 storage with the temp variable which could be eliminated using the addition subtraction swap technique i m not very good at runtime analysis but i believe this is still o n even though we re performing many swaps

2597973
post	get
is get not post

2598036
width	height
taglib doesn t contain any information on component s attributes id width height title and ide cannot therefore check my syntax nor can it suggest attributes while i m typing

2598049
mouseover	mousemove
javascript won t try to interpolate between frames. meaning yes if you move your mouse fast enough one mousemove event will fire on one side of your object and the next mousemove will fire on the other side so mouseover and out never get fired and you re none the wiser

2598057
post	put
actions that don t seem to quite fit the rest model i m not sure whether put or post is the most appropriate method

2598057
post	put
so we could put post to

2598142
zlib	quazip
however there is an open source qt library called quazip which uses zlib comes with qt and provides just that

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i need second part other browsers google-chrome and safari grabbing address bar but firefox is urgently

2598424
equals	compareto
compareto should return -1 when this is less than o 0 when they are equals and 1 when this is greater than o

2598429
accessor	properties
you can have the object implement all of its properties in terms of that dictionaryâ that is have the object own a dictionary and have its accessor retrieve values from and store values in that dictionary by sending it objectforkey and setobject forkey messages

2598483
cos	sin
the proper way of doing this would be using sin cos to generate the x and y coordinates for a semi-circle as stated in your question

2598486
division	modulo
i would like to define some kind of safe division and modulo function one that would return some predefined value when attempting to divide by zero

2598487
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
with ms.net you are fixed with key areas like os and web server but with mono you can choose almost any linux or unix distribution and you have more web servers which can run mono web apps like apache nginx lighttpd compared to dominant iis on windows

2598487
postgresql	mysql
also databases like mysql postgresql or nosql stuff runs better and are more supported on linux machines

2598514
gwt	cssresource
in order for gwt to report any css errors misspelled missing class names you need to be including your csss in your gwt project via cssresource check out the docs for usage examples etc

2598527
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it behaves perfectly in ie firefox safari but google-chrome seems to reload hang for a second when setting location.hash

2598569
boost	stl
p.s. i don t prefer a big switch sweat and also i know boost is capable of everything i would prefer a stl solution

2598573
put	http-post
what you actually want to do is to read the value of hour in case of page-submission via http-post and put it there as default value

2598577
jboss	glassfish
eclipse java ee has a lot of server adapters allowing development against many different application servers like jboss glassfish and websphere

2598580
gtk	gdk
ideally using only gtk gdk nothing x11-specific

2598590
folder	directory
as the checkout information is stored in the file system is there any reason that you cant mount the ftp directory as a local folder or just browse to the ftp url and use tortoise on it

2598609
equals	compareto
hence you may want to consider overriding equals and hashcode to make them consistent with compareto

2598611
google-chrome	firefox
works perfect in ie firefox google-chrome

2598614
versioning	upgrade
when we upgrade a library it would be useful to quickly find out which projects have a dependency on the library and might need to use the new versioning

2598614
nexus	artifactory
a hudson plugin nexus artifactory etc

2598725
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in other words it s implemented by safari google-chrome firefox and internet explorer on the client side and apache or iis on the server side

2598728
tolower	toupper
the problem is that tolower toupper are fundamentally broken for many locales

2598752

anthony green did a blog series on coming up with an instruction set porting binutils gcc newlib and so on as well as setting up sim and qemu to emulate a machine with this new instruction set

2598758
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
for reasons beyond my control i am limited to a ui that uses dropdownlistfor text fields checkbox radiobuttons only - no fancy special ui controls

2598776
accessor	properties
then define the set accessor for the properties as internal

2598855
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
look up the documentation for nsurlconnection and nsurlrequest and also nsmutableurlrequest

2598882
std	ostream
i would expect that c++ std ostream behaviour is consistent with the c i o printf

2598884
post	get
somebody has written a helpful blog post about how to get started -

2598995
hide	show
it doesn t hide show at all your script isn t touching it anywhere

2599008
filesystems	fat
as your other zip operations work i assume that writing is not a problem and you have enough disk space quota and are not writing files bigger than 2gb on a fat filesystems

2599014
integer	unsigned
i spent hours seeking whether timestamps should be unsigned integer or int8 whether int8 is 8-digits or 8-bytes and what is the name of that esoteric 6-byte int

2599014
integer	unsigned
what i missed was that unsigned int8 tinyint and the like are all a syntactic sugar synonyms for integer type which is always signed long long and the lengths given are for internal disk storage only are adjusted automatically and transparently to fit any value on least number of bits and are totally invisible and inaccessible from the api side

2599020
firefox	safari
i developed some javascript enhanced pages that run fine on recent firefox and safari

2599033
uiview	calayer
so i replaced the uiview by calayer

2599076
draggable	droppable
i then use jstree to make the menu items draggable and droppable

2599085
hide	show
form is show by .showdialog method in response to click event of button same event handler sets to hide the form

2599087
jar	war
web application to executable jar instead of war

2599105
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to get this thing to work in ie any version - works in firefox opera safari google-chrome ...

2599115
jar	war
if you have a war you can use the embedded mode of the winstone servlet container to get a stand-alone executable jar

2599134
inherited	properties
your best bet is to recursively loop through all controls on the page looking for all controls that inherited from the basevalidator class and then set their enabled properties to false

2599142
keydown	keyup
try triggering the jquery keydown keyup event manually

2599150
tiff	png
those images are png but could just as easily have been tiff

2599196
isapi	iirf
web server a public on the internet iirf ionic s isapi rewrite filter current version installed

2599240
filtering	grouping
you could add another state grouping for filteredstates with the members unfiltered and filtering

2599256
wtl	atl
it s a bit confusing what ui framework you are using as you tagged your question with visual c++ which would suggest mfc atl wtl or win32 but you also tagged it with .net and the methods and properties you are mentioning suggest winforms

2599256
hide	show
if you are using winforms the easiest way would be to create several panel instances on your your form that contain the groups of controls you currently have on the different forms and just show hide the right panel depending on which button was pressed and what is the previous visible panel

2599270
division	multiplication
as a general rule division is slow and multiplication is faster and bit shifting is faster yet

2599270
128bit	64bit
to determine if this would be faster than the brute force as there will be many more multiplies since we will be using 32-bit registers to simulate 64bit and 128bit numbers profile it

2599272
mamp	wamp
you do not need a domain to get started with the development simply install wamp for windows or mamp if your apple freak like me these programs act as self contained mini servers very useful for development

2599272
mamp	wamp
then i d suggest trying it all out using html for starters just so you get used to the wamp mamp sever before heading over to for a brilliant set of tutorials on php

2599273
rss	feed
i have been working on creating an rss reader app for the iphone which allows me to view rss from an external feed

2599273

irix	linux
the construct has worked since 2004 on irix and now when porting it actually do work on linux gcc too

2599352
put	get
my only idea is to put some changeable element to first cell of each row so it must be able to set get my values for each row but can t find yet any examples of it .

2599388
width	height
getting element size position width height of elements is sometimes elm.style.pixelheight width in ie rather than elm.offsetheight width but neither is reliable in ie especially in quirks mode and sometimes one gives a better result than the other

2599388
opera	safari
key event code differences key event codes vary wildly though if you look at quirksmode or javascript madness it s hardly specific to ie safari and opera are different again

2599388
keydown	mouseup	keydown	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
note just returning false in keydown keypress mousedown mouseup click and reset will also prevent default

2599396

then you could access the data for sorting an filtering via a typed model

2599410
min	max
i would like someone to explain to me this concept keeping in mind the example below if i wanted to get the min and max values of sequence i would do the following

2599435
rss	feed
there is a built in rss feed to push out to your users notices when your site is updated

2599443
rss	feed
i ve been given a requirement to impliment some google tracking on an rss feed

2599443
rss	feed
currently we track when users click the rss link but they also seem to want to track access to the rss feed outside of that link

2599454
rss	feed
it depends how the login in implemented on the server hosting the rss feed

2599464
min	max
max min and index slicing they all do different things

2599464
min	max
in your list the order may not be sorted like your example so using slicing will not get the max min for you in those cases

2599464
min	max
if you want to get max min values just use max min functions

2599469
chunked	transfer-encoding
this can be caused by that the client has automatically set the transfer-encoding chunked header because the content-length header has not been set before writing the request body

2599531
scipy	scikits
i also couldn t find one in the time series scikit one of the libraries in the scipy scikits domain-specific modules not included in the standard scipy distribution but it s worth checking again

2599641
vsto	add-in
vsto can only be used to build add-in worksheets for excel not to build standalone application

2599641
vsto	add-in
i found a worksheet and a workbook class in the vsto namespace but as far as i understand it these always refer to the cs classes for sheets and workbook which you implement when defining an excel add-in or a workbook extension

2599648
super	implements
you can not assign to subtype from super type but you can implements a copy constructor then you could do the same thing like this

2599654
hash	md5
hash like md5 or sha1 are well-mixed meaning that every bit in the output has a 50 chance of flipping if you change one bit in the input

2599658
multiplying	multiplication
i know i could do the matrix multiplication myself but i m not really interested in doing so as i m very sure that someone already solved this problem so please no links to books or other guides on how to multiplying matrices

2599682
versioning	upgrade
a new dal layer is in progress but for a new major versioning and for so many users it will be at least 2 years before every user is upgrade others might stay on the old versioning indefinitely for whatever reason

2599746
google-chrome	firefox
yes you can simply use firebug for firefox or google-chrome or you can use something like jsbin

2599796
public	protected
you must rework your control to return object instead of the bad type and do typecasting if you must keep it public otherwise protected should be fine

2599833
put	get
according to soma s website if you wait until the launch then you can get a special discount price - this should put the uk upgrade at around â 270

2599855
expression-blend	silverlight
if i remove them manually and instead set the references to ie this c program files x86 microsoft sdks expression-blend 3 interactivity libraries silverlight microsoft.expression.interactions.dll everything works

for logon you want to store an iterated salt hash of the password not the password itself

2600115
pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt	hash	hmac	hash	salt	hmac	pbkdf2
pbkdf2 - a function from the pkcs#5 spec that uses hmac with a hash function and random salt to iterate over a password many times

2600122
stdout	stderr
error connecting stdout and stderr 127.0.0.1 10001

2600131
rcurl	libcurl
the google analytics api site has an example on how to retrieve analytics data using libcurl so supposedly you should be able to modify the examples and use rcurl to retrieve the data

2600171
width	height
if your polygons are all fixed width or height and evenly spaced an easy way to implement this with no code is to use a clipping geometry and transform its width or height by a factor of n to cause it to show only n polygons

2600183
inherited	properties
i have a situation that i am looking at where certain css properties will not be inherited

2600183

theirs does and is optimized for int and double as is the case in trove but not in the standard java case which uses objects with considerable overhead

2600579
inherited	properties
obviously the object has inherited the db and result properties of the parent database class

2600579

2600677
post	get
there s a lot of code in this project so far so i will only post the first page s that should get served

2600747
many-to-many	one-to-many
you have to map many-to-many with additional data relationships as two one-to-many relationships

2600794
portrait	landscape
i have an tabbar app that i would like to be in landscape and portrait

2600830

2600861
int	boolean
having said that if you are really unsure about this you could use an int value instead of the boolean and use the interlockedexchange function to write to the variable

2600872
hide	show
without javascript this would fire a http request to the servlet which loads the mail identified by 1 forwards the request to a jsp which hide the message list in the view and show the mail in the view

2600964
onclick	onchange
the right thing to do would be to use onchange instead but unfortunately that doesn t fire at a useful time in ie so onclick is what we re left with

2601066
post	get
the easiest way i have found to get past the problem is to just post to a different url and redirect back

2601081

2601090
qmainwindow	qframe
the qmainwindow has a qframe class that lists a collection of objects

2601136
ostringstream	std
you d probably want to do just one or the other so you d use std istringstream or std ostringstream

2601136
std	ostream	cout	cin	ostream	istream
the beauty of them is that they are also std istream and std ostream s respectively so you can use them as you d use std cin or std cout which are hopefully familiar to you

2601526
superclass	subclassing
i have a subclassing that calls a method from a superclass

2601526
superclass	subclassing
the method in the superclass uses a method that is defined in the superclass as abstract not really abstract but implemented in the subclassing

2601526
superclass	subclassing
if i took off the abstract method from the superclass and just leave the implementation in the subclassing it does not recognize the method and i get subroutine abstract method not found error

2601542
google-chrome	firefox
my wild guess would be that the service is returning you an error message when the request is sent by firefox and google-chrome due to differences in how the browsers make the request

2601542
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
so i wonder if jquery.ajax is not using the new xdomainrequest on ie8 instead of the xmlhttprequest

would it be sufficient to simply compare the width of the jpg image to its height and if width height treat as landscape

2601653
portrait	landscape
i have done this in c# before although i can t remember the implementation details now but i remember it wasn t particularly difficult a couple of lines of code only for a website i worked on which required uploaded jpgs to be displayed within a frame such as you might hang on your wall and we needed to know whether to add the landscape or portrait version of the frame

2601687
portrait	landscape
a lot of digital cameras now have sensors within them to detect if the picture was taken in landscape or portrait mode

2601687
portrait	landscape
in addition to portrait landscape info you can also extract usually the model make of camera lens settings time date etc

2601761
google-chrome	safari
ie safari google-chrome

2601773
put	get
if the function does nothing it still loads the page if i put a dialog box to show it fired it was a lot of clicks eventually i either get a big red x in the data grid view area or it loads fine depending on the page i get a x for pre-production but the other two loads fine the message box still shows up hundreds of times when you select them first

because we wanted to grouping all filtering input together

2602050
udp	tcp
a lot of topics come up with servers that would help you identify if your language can address things like udp tcp threading queues security etc

2602090
superclass	subclassing
just be careful when you do that because if foo isn t a subclassing of superclass then you ll get a runtime cast exception

2602113
int	chars
is there a reason you are opposed to using wrapper classes like chars or int

2602209

using inherited you can create a carwithtag class that extends the car class without polluting the car class with unneeded properties

2602325
turbogears	repoze.who	pylons	turbogears	pylons	repoze.who
now if you consider that turbogears 2.0 is built on pylons and uses repoze.who for authentication it would seem in that light that repoze.who is pretty popular and could conceivably be the generally accepted way of doing things according to turbogears

2602344
opera	google-chrome
also i don t want to load the page through a proxy with ajax and switching to google-chrome opera is not an option either

2602358

width	height
android or not a bitmaps in memory aren t compressed so they are going to take bits per pixel width height with a bit of variation depending on the pixel format

2602412
public	protected
in this case you might have to define stuffholder and have it extend eventdispatcher as a class and have getstuff as a public protected function

2602467
portrait	landscape
then during an orientation change portrait - landscape the uiimageview in the detailviewcontroller should automatically flip with the rest of the viewcontroller giving you what you are looking for

2602493
httpconnection	downloading
downloading the image using httpconnection maybe

2602502
public	protected
in is unaware of any namespaces currently opened including private and protected in your case and will only look within the public namespace

2603066
strncmp	strcmp
see the man page for strcmp and strncmp

2603126
post	get
you may want to tackle this problem by issuing a server-side redirect to a get request when the post request responds

stdout	stderr
warning this will deadlock if the child process generates enough output to a stdout or stderr pipe such that it blocks waiting for the os pipe buffer to accept more data

2603383
google-chrome	firefox
and since both firefox and google-chrome are open source you can just go and check the source

2603465
width	height
the plugin could also accept arguments for width height a different url and more data to pass through

2603465
pop-up	dialog
as a result if i click cancel to the print dialog box it ll pop-up again and again until the window loads

2603469

codeigniter	pyrocms
why both integrating wordpress and codeigniter when you could just use pyrocms and have your entire site running a single codeigniter codebase

2603931
min	max
then you get the limits min and max of the axes

2603949
width	margin
one way to get rid of problems on ie6 is using the imperfections of ie6 you know that width 100 in ie6 contains the padding and margin too so u shoulding worry but i do agree with above answer new browsers dont see both so you should consider dropping one of them

2603949
width	height
as for min- and max- the only way i was able to do that is with jquery u can always use the getboundingclientrect dom javascript that works only on ie to determine the height and width if u dont want to use jquery

2603952
post	get
i ve taken the code from kennytm s post and incorporated it into the payback function this could be adapted to create the array in the initwithcoder function and then send it through like the original code but for now - this will get you a result

2603984
width	height
it seems to be tailored towards inline navigational unordered lists completely overwriting the height and width set for the articles and or the sections in the css

2604011
innodb	myisam
i m specifically looking for innodb and myisam support

2604030
vb.net	vb6
about 1 3 of the way down someone explains that it uses double because the vb.net functions were implemented to work exactly the same as vb6

2604044
min	max
it s nearly identical code and logic to the above python except for one change c++ stdlib s heap functions work with the max value instead of the min so no need for the negation

2604071
fadein	fadeout
you can also find replacement fadein fadeout and fadeto methods that deal with this issue here

2604143
width	height
it s possible to get window width or height while resizing it

2604200

2604240
folder	directory
you need to open properties for that new folder and select appropriate directory for defaultlocation property

2604253
int	double
do you want the result as an int or a double

2604253
cos	floor
for example if you want to get the cosine of the value you should just use floor as cos takes a double

2604260
int	double
when you get the floor of double that int double may or mayn t be representable in a variable of type int

2604271
subtract	addition	subtract	add	multiplying	addition	multiplying	modulo	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add	addition	modulo
in addition to standard add subtract multiplying divide and comparisons i also need a power and modulo function as well

2604271
128bit	64bit
if not 128bit is there a 64bit option available

2604278
ceil	floor
as arak pointed out the number returned by floor or ceil may not fit within the range of int

2604289
inherited	properties
our way for doing this uses inherited properties sheets

2604289
inherited	properties
each inherited the master properties sheet use view properties manager on vs toolbar

2604289
inherited	properties
you now have to inherited each build properties sheet into the respective properties settings of the project

2604289
inherited	properties
for example 32bit release build properties sheet has to be inherited by the 32bit release properties settings

2604302
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseover and mouseout events fire when entering a child element using mouseenter and mouseleave doesn t do this eliminating the flicker caused by removing and adding the span

2604302
mouseover	mouseenter
the mouseenter event differs from mouseover in the way it handles event bubbling

2604308
cgpoint	cgrect
cgrect cgpoint etc

2604308
free	malloc
however if you do allocate them on the heap then you will need to use malloc free to manage them yourself

2604314
gridview	objectdatasource
there s an objectdatasource attached to the gridview .

2604329
fgets	fread
it s like fgets or fread compared to file_get_contents

2604335

2604396
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2604398
ubuntu	linux

because unlike unchecked-exception runtimeexception error and their subclasses you are required to catch them

2604521
rss	feed
i created a library that leverages the syndicationfeed classes in .net and allows you to read and write media rss feed

2604542
post	get
some scripts accept both get and post indiscriminately

2604544
hex	binary	int	chars
my solution would be to take the string convert it to a chars array and then convert the int values of the chars array into binary or hex through the integer.tobinarystring or integer.tohexstring or integer.tooctalstring if you would like

2604544
hex	binary
just replace binary string with hex and the function will do the same thing

2604580
min	max
for example you may need to create a bidirectional map data structure which you can implement by composing two unidirectional map data structures or you may need to create a stack that keeps track of a variety of statistics such as min max mean by using an existing stack data structure with an element type that contains the value as well as these various statistics

2604666
haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml	ocaml	sml

http 1.1 has a few commands get put post delete and a few others

2604916
post	get
take note that you re looking for parameters in get or post requests as such

2604924
toolbar	tabs
in other words if you have 5 different tabs that require their own toolbar create 5 usercontrols that contain a toolbar and load the correct one into the region when the user clicks on the tab

2604931
post	get
the url is being accessed by the client app and it sends post get data

2604942
put	get
as long as i put sleep b w sending command the calc.exe get it right

2604964
hex	binary
the logic i wish to achieve is scan through a binary file until the hex code ffd8 continue reading until ffd9 and only save what was between them discards the junk before and after but include ffd8 and ffd9 as the saved part of the file

2604972
directx	gdi
wpf is nice because it is based on directx no you don t need to know directx at all and will use the gpu and not gdi objects like traditional other ui platforms from microsoft

2604978
free	malloc
i have done the single-malloc trick for 2d arrays simply because of the mental exercise and the added convenience of a single malloc single free and it works beautifully just make sure to get a well-aligned memory chunk

2605026
children	parent
in my app you can hide an item and its children just by setting the parent element s visibility column to 0

2605040
apache	nginx
i had both apache and nginx with passenger installed and working fine on the same arch linux machine serving a rails app

2605040
apache	nginx
once with apache running and listening on port 80 i started nginx listening on the same port and got an expected error about the port being already bound

2605040
apache	nginx
i stopped apache and nginx restarted nginx and started getting bad gateway errors whenever i tried to access the rails app under nginx

2605060
post	get
what data are you sending in post or get i would recommend look thru the post get messages in firebug net panel in that page there are many hidden values which i think are time dependent and changes on each page load and may be valid once so load page get those values and send them with post messages see these

2605070
post	get
you can do this with post or get variables

2605087
versioning	upgrade
so if they in the future releases a new versioning i just put application in the new system folder and its upgrade right

2605103
children	parent
alternatively you can store references to children in the parent with

2605125
stdout	stderr
now if for some reason you want to completely ignore stdout or stderr and never see it again you can define your own file-like classes that simply discard the objects

for-loop	arrays
in both scenarios i m just writing to arrays in the sense that for any given iteration in the for-loop i m writing each arrays sequentially from the first element to the last element

2605485
width	height
try adding a div with desired width height and content inside the infowindow using infowindow.setcontent method

2605496
calloc	malloc
assuming the total amount of memory being initialized in your two examples is the same allocating the memory with calloc might be faster than allocating the memory with malloc and then zeroing them out in a separate step especially if in the malloc case you zero the elements individually by iterating over them in a loop

2605496
calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
a malloc followed by a memset will likely be about as fast as calloc

2605499
post	get
if you have no control over the variables that are sent you may try using _server raw_http_post_data to get the original post request data before parsed then you can use the parse_str function to parse that string

2605502
inherited	subclassing
if you do need to allow uncontrolled inherited you re not willing to bet that subclassing will have very particular needs then you need to go for the full pattern

2605552
firefox	safari
my question is is this correct way and does it work in ie7 8 firefox safari

2605577
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
on my webpage when i press command link its opening a new page perfectly on ie7 firefox 3 google-chrome safari 4.0.4 but after this none of the parent page s command buttons are not working this happens only in safari.i am using jsf 1.2 mojara

2605605
width	height
i m not using it for an outlook newsletter but it should still work for that because it adds on the height and width attributes to the img tags

2605605
width	height
after dragging the control points to resize it just open the image properties and click ok and it will add the width and height attributes in again

2605646
versioning	upgrade
this seems to say that you can upgrade from any competing product or any existing versioning of visual studio even a trial one

2605646
versioning	upgrade
it doesn t explicitly mention the express edition but you could always install the trial versioning and upgrade that instead

2605678
int	chars	unsigned	short
the tricky thing is that the i should pass a 2 byte array for fid and int for len even though in c# fid is an unsigned short and len is an unsigned chars

2605681
typedef	struct
i have seen source codes always having a typedef for a structure and using the same everywhere instead of using the structure name as struct sname etc directly

2605686
typedef	struct
in the above typedef both entry entryp are defined apart from struct _entry

2605706
stdout	fflush
after your first printf call fflush stdout

2605708
int	chars
a chars is 1 byte an int is typically 4 bytes

2605715
int	chars
so for chars pointer it increments by 1 and for int by 4

2605720
mouseup	mousedown
i have tried live search from and i an struck in i need to get on mouseup and mousedown function for this code and i as i am new to ajax .

2605735
google-chrome	firefox
when preloading on testing server on mac i get io errorerror event- load never completed on firefox and google-chrome

2605747
maven	pom.xml	folder	directory
do you know if a parameter can be specified in the pom.xml to instruct maven to include empty directory in the generated target test-classes folder

2605753
ilist	icollection
seems to me you want that to be either a ilist or icollection

2605777
subtract	add
just add them all up and subtract the total you would expect if only 1001 numbers were used from that

2605786
subtract	add
if you know that we have the exact numbers 1-1000 you can add up the results and subtract 500500 sum 1 1000 from the total

2605808
capitalize	capitalization
in addition to alex s answer i note you seem to be using capitalization inconsistently - some first letters are capitalize and others aren t

2605808
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
bear in mind that while windows is not case-insensitive most platforms are case-sensitive - so if you weren t strict about using the same capitalization for the same name everywhere when you deploy you will get a lot of 404s in place of expected files

2605813
mouse	keyboard
jquery also has great hooks to fire javascript handlers in response to keyboard and mouse events

2605897
postgresql	mysql
i personally prefer postgresql over mysql and find it very scalable even with millions or even billions of rows when setup correctly

2605935
mouseleave	mouseenter
the toggle is fired on the mouseenter and mouseleave event thus creating the effect of the div to fold out on mouseenter and fold in on mouseleave

2605957
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you re going to use both mouseenter and mouseleave i d suggest using the hover function

2605959
children	parent
although you can only call so many of those in a day - so you may need to somehow keep track of which parent objects have their children updating and then process that offline

2605964
mouseover	mouseout
you can use the more common mouseover mouseout events to get a hover event that doesn t fire on internal mouse movements

2605964
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouse is over the element at page load time or the mouseleave the browser which can allow the mouse to leave the bounds of the element without firing a mouseout

2605964
hide	show
have separate function for over which show the content and out which hide it

2605974
mouse	keyboard
it works most of the time if nobody touches the screen mouse keyboard

2605980
google-chrome	firefox
for instance this works on ie firefox and google-chrome at least probably others

2606030
flexunit	cairngorm
does anyone know if it is possible to test remote procedure calls in cairngorm commands with flexunit 4

2606093
multiplying	add
every time you add a complex tool with byte-code generation you multiplying complexity

2606106
ant	maven
1 ant based and 2 the other maven based that consumes the jars of the other project via archiva

2606118
disk	ram
more bytes means more pages on disk and in sql server ram and thus more disk i o and more work for sql server

2606152
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris	irix	linux	solaris	irix
although it is not a posix standard interface the dladdr function is available on many systems including linux solaris darwin mac os x freebsd hp-ux and irix

2606176
versioning	upgrade
the main reason to upgrade to visual studio 2010 is the .net framework s new versioning 4.0 and all the accompanying tools you can use

2606176
versioning	upgrade
if you don t need this new versioning now you can delay the upgrade that s a reason

2606180
powerpc	i386
i am building for powerpc i386 and x86_64

2606182
postgresql	mysql
we support h2 mysql postgresql in our environment and i would prefer a solution which can be driven via jpa and reverse engineering ddl tools from hibernate

2606201
daemons	systemd
my eventual objective is to have several such processes running perhaps daemonized using the systemd daemons pear class and i would like to be able to manage them from some governing process also a php script

2606209
post	put
but it may be funny or not a crazy idea or not but could work before dumping rendered contents to user maybe you could extract text values excluding form values post them to google or bing translator and put back translated values

2606214
int	chars
given a string and an int n return a string made of n repetitions of the last n chars of the string

2606228
imperative	declarative
the common language runtime clr is designed as an intermediate language based on imperative programming ip but this has obvious implications when dealing with declarative programming dp

2606233
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
i want to know which sites can give me information on the list of javascript functions that are supported by ie firefox opera safari

2606258
integer	unsigned
cast conv hex_val 16 10 as unsigned integer

2606292
move	drag
or could she drag the header footer to move on

2606470
onresume	onpause
activity is paused is written in the onpause method and activity is resuming in the onresume method of the activity

2606471
setinterval	settimeout
you might also prefer to use setinterval to avoid the repeated settimeout calls

2606539
strcpy	strncpy
for doing string concatenation i ve been doing basic strcpy strncpy of char buffers

2606542
post	get
i get the saved value fine but my model doesn t update on post

2606542
post	get
i get the list and it post the selected value back but does not pre-select the currently selected item in my model on the view

2606545
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox it s perfect and google-chrome it runs it once

2606557
strcpy	strncpy
if you only want to concatenate use strncpy don t use strcpy since it s more efficient

2606601
printf	strcpy	printf	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
all printf functions check formatting and expand its corresponding argument thus it is slower than a simple strcpy strncpy which only copy a given number of bytes from linear memory

2606601
memcpy	strncpy
stick to strncpy memcpy when only need to copy a block of linear memory

2606609
strcpy	strncpy
strcpy strncpy etc only copies strings from one memory location to another

2606609
printf	strcpy	printf	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
if as per your logic strcpy strncpy is already working for you no need to jump to printf

2606617
free	malloc
in fact for complex applications the performance of garbage collection is competitive with manual storage management based on malloc free

2606617
free	malloc
in this paper zorn describes how he modified some large heap intensive applications to use a conservative garbage collector instead of malloc and free

2606627
printf	strncpy
for most purposes i doubt the difference between using strncpy and printf is measurable

2606627
printf	strncpy
if there s any formatting involved i tend to stick to only printf rather than mixing in strncpy as well

2606652
public	protected
it s distinct from public protected and private

2606654
typedef	struct
a non-typedefed struct name in c requires struct to be prepended everywhere the type name is used so most people use typedef to create a new name for the type that does not need to have the struct keyword prepended all the time

2606654
typedef	struct
in all honesty the need to typedef to create new names for struct is a relic and it s a shame that c99 didn t follow c++ s lead and remove it

2606685
int	chars	int	double
according to this page decimal data type visual basic you need to suffix decimal literal values with the uppercase chars d otherwise the compiler will try to compile it as an appropriate but different numeric type like int long double etc

2606761
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works nicely in ie google-chrome and safari but not in firefox or opera

2606774
hide	show
if it has show the ul or hide otherwise here is the prototype in php

2606804
typedef	struct
i actually don t use typedef for struct

2606845
width	height
that s because a span is an inline element by nature and won t accept arbitrary width nor height values

2606855
width	height
i developed an application which consists of uipickerview....it displays as default size in height of the uipickerview.i want to display the uipickerview as 320x480 size iphone simulator size ..so the whole screen has the picker view without using transorm property because it will stretched the whole view....its not looking good...even with selection indicator also stretched...i need not stretchable picker view..but need to show the picker view with the whole screen..we can control the width of the uipickerview..but how can we control the height of the uipickerview...

2606861
width	height
the span element being an inline element cannot take a width and a height

2606961
trac	bugzilla
in general people use what is called software configuration management software which usually includes a version control system like subversion mercurial git visual sourcesafe et cetera and a project management suite such as trac bugzilla google code sourceforge and the like

2606985
mp3	wav
looking for a program lib preferably in .net that can take a sound file mp3 wav etc and generate a sound wave image from it similar to image below

2607008
google-chrome	firefox
with google-chrome 4 and firefox is working fine

2607010
ubuntu	linux
spec linux ubuntu

2607029
memset	calloc
the calloc and memset approaches should be about the same and maybe slightly faster than zeroing it yourself

2607084
n-gram	words
it is generally implemented by doing statistical analysis of words and n-gram multi-word sequences against the metadata of the search engine s inverted-file index structures and query logs

2607138
spaces	delimiter
that will use arrays for storing arguments so it will handle even calls like spaces delimiter string and string with

2607199
.htaccess	httpd.conf
in your httpd.conf or a .htaccess put

2607314
google-chrome	firefox
in ie using sth like data.firstchild returns xml header and in firefox and google-chrome using data.firstchild returns root element.

2607316
floating-point	integer
the expression returns false in javascript but fortunately integer arithmetic in floating-point is exact so decimal representation errors can be avoided by scaling

2607316
floating-point	integer
as a practical example to avoid floating-point problems where accuracy is paramount it is recommended 1 to handle money as an integer representing the number of cents 2550 cents instead of 25.50 dollars

2607352
bellman-ford	dijkstra
however it s arguable whether this is really dijkstra or a bellman-ford with a priority queue

2607361
put	get
after actually considering chewing through my own wrists and dreaming of ips all night long + brute force googling trying anything i could get my digital fingers on i managed to put something together that actually works

2607367
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

2607376
firefox	safari
they re based on prototype but the core issue isn t watch out for any methods labels identifiers which ie considers reserved words but firefox or safari will tolerate

2607383
ironruby	ironpython
dynamically typed languages like ironpython and ironruby use dynamic language runtime which implements dynamic method calls etc

2607411
lisp	scheme
ruby lisp scheme scala clojure python perl php c# via mono .

2607426
lisp	scheme
perl php scheme lisp lolcode

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tell that to people who write javascript and want it to work on ie6 ie7 firefox google-chrome safari etc

2607512
hide	show
just show and hide that

2607583
post	get
since i just created an account to make my first stack overflow post to get an answer for this burning question

2607629
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that in my firefox 3.6 or google-chrome they just don t work together

2607631
width	height
i am catching the resize event and changing the height and width

2607698
textview	imageview
each item has inside a textview and two imageview

2607698
textview	imageview
for the whole item i can show the context menu after a long press but my problem is that the imageview changes as well when i am pressing the textview for example

2607698
children	parent
i think that all the children of a view are affected by an event in the parent but i am not sure

2607703
public	protected
i learnt today that java also has another access level which is implied if you don t specify public protected private

2607704
cairngorm	mate
as i search on internet people are using a lot different framework cairngorm to mate

2607727
udp	tcp
you can encapsulate udp in tcp of course but you d have to handle the udp part in userspace

2607727
udp	tcp
you can either use udp and send a discrete chunk as a datagram or you can but structs into tcp data and let them go as a stream

2607744
udp	tcp
tcp and udp are protocols from the same layer and they have functions that make sense only to them

2607744
udp	tcp
you could send udp header+data inside tcp packets but doesn t make sense at all

2607783
cdr	cons
all three calls to cons use functions to get their cdr

2607811
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari moz i generate see spans 1 2 3 4 ... etc

2607839
nsstring	nsdata
your problem is most likely a naming collision caused by using data as a property name because otherwise the code looks fine and both nsstring and nsdata should serialize easily

2607880
tomahawk	trinidad
i want to use inputlistofvalues component from trinidad in my application which also uses tomahawk

2607880
tomahawk	trinidad
so i wonder if i can use tomahawk and trinidad together

2607990
width	height
ie i m interested in writing my own widget that takes for instance height width

2608073
min	max
what is less commonly realised is if you give the mean value assuming your min and max averaged out give something approximating the actual mean you ll only hit that deadline 50 of the time

2608073
min	max
3 x max + 1 x min 4

2608073
min	max
personally i d give him somewhere around 2 x max + 1 x min 3 and have the rest as contingency

2608214
put	get
if your best dev quits and you have to put someone new on the project extend the deadline becasue that person has to have time to get up to speed you may have to eat the hours though the client may not agree to pay for that time

2608275
umbraco	dotnetnuke
cms projects like dotnetnuke which is vb or umbraco which is c# would be good learning tools

2608297
uilabel	uibutton
so find cars by must be just uilabel or uibutton put in specific view s point

2608302
put	get
without knowing anything about what you re trying to solve it s hard to say with any confidence but typically one wants to do things with what one has put into a list and to do anything meaningful with things once they re just object you ll need to examine their type and get reflective to kind of break away from language basics

2608304
width	height
gwt actually doesn t parse the width and height strings it just passes it to browsers dom and then the browser evaluates it appropriately

2608387
ubuntu	debian
sometimes php can be set up with different php.inis depending on how php is invoked -- i believe debian and ubuntu do this specifically

2608429
boost	stl
boost serialization also already knows how to serialize all stl containers

2608443
hide	show
i would like to allow each row the ability to show hide extra information

2608443
hide	show
or is there a way to only load an employees extra details when the show hide button is click

2608448
google-chrome	firefox
the code works absolutely fine on google-chrome and mozilla firefox

2608462
freemarker	velocity
i know that it is possible to do this with a java date object inside a velocity freemarker template something like but i would like to do this with datetool or freemarker core

2608482
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
if you still want the sliding animation but don t want the uinavigationbar you could use a uinavigationcontroller but hide the navigation bar with the setnavigationbarhidden animated method

2608497
qdockwidget	qwidget
i think you can use qdockwidget settitlebarwidget qwidget widget

2608516
mvp	presenter
im creating a lot of ui dynamically on the ui thread and binding to presenter mvp pattern which often start worker threads before the ui has first show

2608541
exponent	modulo
for rsa encryption i am using pear class crypt_rsa- encrypting with the public key which is a modulo exponent pair i get from working encryption system in .net.

2608594
pull	push
our security team allows us to pull from the build server but does not allow the build server to push

2608620
inherited	properties
i have say 10 different objects that inherited one object.they have different amount and type of class members but all of them have one properties in common - visible

2608638
public	protected
public and protected members are part of your classes exported api

2608651
for-loop	loops
my best guess is the for-loop is executed n times its nested while loops q times making nq and the final while loops also q times resulting in o nq +q which is linear

2608683
post	get
i still have more to wade through but your post sparked the idea for the solution to get around the name conflicts

2608695
clearance	devise
you must develop your own authentication plugin or use an open source one like devise authlogic or clearance

2608717
put	get
i thought i should get rid of album_id publisher_id and artist_id in songs table and put them in intermediate tables like this

2608720
config	ini
but you can also use a config ini file or a xml file

2608736
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
so my appcontroler is a nsobject witch contains a uiwindow and a uiviewcontroller myviewcontroller

2608776
children	parent
if i search again for that string value in the parent xml then i may find 2 occurrences or many more if the parent has other children that contain an occurrence of that string

2608840
division	modulo
this linear index can be calculated into the 2-dim index by using modulo and division

2608887
kerberos	ntlm
i see a lot of links on google that say switch to kerberos but my server seems to only be accepting ntlm not negotiate as it would say if it was looking for kerberos so that is unfortunately not an option

2608892
getter	setter
i ve also seen that properties simply create getter setter functions on compile

2608902
requiredfieldvalidator	checkboxlist
since asp.net s checkboxlist control does not allow itself to be validated with one of the standard validation controls requiredfieldvalidator i would like to create a usercontrol that i can use in my project whenever i need a checkbox list that requires one or more boxes to be checked

2608916
draggable	droppable
i have an application where there are a number of droppable divs that accept only a single draggable

2608916
draggable	droppable
i do this by setting the accept option on all my droppable s to a function that check for a valid draggable and if it is already occupied

2608916
draggable	droppable
thus if a user tries to drop a draggable on a droppable that is already occupied the draggable reverts

2608916
draggable	droppable
what i would like to do is provide additional feedback when a user drops a draggable on top of an occupied droppable

2608954
onmouseover	onclick
ok so that s the bit you d change to say onclick instead of onmouseover

2608978
public	protected
as in this case why choose private members over package public or protected ones

2608999
post	get
to get real help i assume you ll need to post a repro project somewhere

2609047
post	get
how can i post the term to the search script instead of get

2609053
bash	zsh
i ve tried this in both bash and zsh and get the same results in both.

2609088
post	get
you ll need to supply a function as the source for the plugin and have your function do the ajax post to the server to get the matching data

2609146
equals	compareto
this errors means that you re not overriding equals in foreignkeyconstraint and thus inheriting the equals from object so the following is not true from the javadoc of compareto

2609152
equals	compareto
i believe the basis of the warning is that as stated in the definition strange things can happen if you override compareto and not equals

2609155
equals	compareto
generally the value of compareto should return zero if and only if equals returns true

2609155
equals	compareto
it implements equality checks by invoking compareto and a compareto implementation that is inconsistent with equals makes the treeset violate the contract of the set interface which might lead to program malfunction

2609160
equals	compareto
it s telling you that there s the potential for compareto and equals to disagree

2609160
equals	compareto
so you ll potentially find yourself in a situation where compareto states that two objects are the same because tablename and fkfieldname match but equals states they are different because they re different instances

2609160
equals	compareto
there are a few java apis that depend on compareto and equals being consistant

2609182
qtabwidget	qsplitter
but some widgets are more like a layout manager than a widget such as qsplitter and qtabwidget

2609182
qtabwidget	qsplitter
like qsplitter qtabwidget has some behaviors which make a single layout not only unnecessary but not useful

2609248
ienumerable	ilist
i would strongly suggest using non-generic ilist or if that fails some generic lists don t implement it ienumerable since and invoke the add manually

2609268
innodb	myisam
my current database design uses myisam mainly as the storage engine i wonder if its possible to split some of the tables into myisam and some into innodb in the same database

2609276
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic
it works in jboss and weblogic and should work in glassfish but haven t tried it

2609276
folder	directory
in you war directory create a web-inf classes folder and configure your ide to write the class files in this directory

2609310
innodb	myisam
i have myisam and innodb table and i use replication over 7 slaves never had a problem

2609315
division	modulo
i know the modulo calculates the remainder of a division

2609315
primes	modulus
i know i can use the modulus operator to see whether a number is even or odd and primes or composite but that s about it

2609399
put	get
as for testing things get an old dot-matrix printer and put it in hex dump mode if you really want the nitty-gritty

2609408
debian	linux
debian linux lenny

2609420
division	modulo
any time you have division and want to express the remainder other than in decimal the modulo is appropriate

2609420
division	modulo
also if you re ever in a situation where you may be accruing rounding errors modulo division is good

2609426
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	binary
i ve seen binary and hex used quite often but never octal

2609449
integer	fractions	division	modulo
modulo is also very useful if for some crazy reason you need to do integer division and get a decimal out and you can t convert the integer into a number that supports decimal division or if you need to return a fractions instead of a decimal

2609449
division	modulo
another case where modulo division is useful is if you are increasing or decreasing a number and you want to contain the number to a certain range of number but when you get to the top or bottom you don t want to just stop

2609482
mouseover	mouseout
i have image sprites that use jquery to set the bg position on mouseover and mouseout events

2609538
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	binary
one of the main reasons octal used to be more frequently used was that it is easier to convert between octal and binary in your head than hex to binary you only have to remember the binary representation of the 8 octal digits 0-7

2609538
hex	binary
however hex began to win out as word sizes that are multiples of 8-bit bytes began to win out and the need to read and enter data in binary became unecessary with console text ui and later gui debuggers

2609577
width	height
the aim is to a have a container div with a fixed height and width and have the html content within that div automatically scroll vertically continuously

2609587
gravatar	akismet
you can check for gravatar akismet or some other comment related plugins creating issues for u

2609591
put	get
i d put both copies of the content you can just .clone it to get the other copy in a container and scroll that that way you don t have to worry about moving two elements

2609641
memset	calloc
doing a memset or bzero that are called by calloc anyway is a good way to invalidate huge portion of your cache

2609656

2609891
int	boolean
as you can see each column in the ruby oo world represents a mix of types -- string string boolean int

2609902
int	chars
first the byte is converted to an int via widening primitive conversion and then the resulting int is converted to a chars by narrowing primitive conversion

2609910
width	height
since they are components and have a concrete height width the form would then know it needed to scroll and would do so accordingly provided that autoscroll was set

width	height
in reality there s a good chance that we re dealing with a truncated triangle -- but the formula for that is also well known 1 2a 1 b + 1 2a 2 b where the a s are the height of the right and left sides and b is the width

2610108
onresume	onpause
activity provides the getcallingactivity method that you could add to logs in onpause and onresume as suggested before

it is relatively easy for you to develop your own gadget that display your rss feed with more items

2610240
gridview	repeater	gridview	objectdatasource	gridview	sqldatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource
presuming web forms you would have a data control such as a gridview or repeater bound to a datasource such as sqldatasource or objectdatasource etc

2610263

when they post the form i get names of the item_type in the item_type_id parameter and i want to find the correct item_type and set the id to that

2610285
width	height
i would like to change the height and width attributes in the image tag if it is greater than 200x200

2610307
width	height
if you know that it s a jpeg you can just pull the first few bytes and parse the width height from the image header

2610334
rss	feed
handing out bookmarks to the rss feed same problem--no one will look at them

2610381
rss	feed
the rss atom idea is not bad -- it works on some projects when all developpers use rss frequently it only means one more feed in their aggregator

2610387
post	get
edit when you post you should get an array of values in php prefer index

2610465
g++	gcc
it s likely that since support for them exists in gcc to support c99 it was relatively straightforward to add support for them to g++

2610477
pull	push
as far as i know branches are as with everything else created locally without your control so if anyone decides to use a branch that branch will also show up in your main repository after a pull push

2610477
pull	push
projectname-main is cloned once being worked on and synchronized by doing a pull +merge and push back to the server regularly

if the feature is ready for -main we pull -featuredescription into our local -main merge the changes pull -main from server merge again and push -main back to the server

2610502
filtering	grouping
haven t tested it so the grouping may not be what you want and the comparisons may be reversed but something like that should filtering

2610506
width	height
the friction here is that it cannot possibly decide if the width height pixels it read from the image file is a problem because there isn t enough storage available for the bitmap

2610532
hide	show	slideup	slidedown
i would use slidedown to show and slideup to hide instead of slidetoggle

2610532
hide	show
toggling is only useful when the same call can either hide or show

2610533
many-to-many	one-to-many
to me there is some kind of mismatch between your physical model and the mapping of your entities the physical model implements a many-to-many relation with a join table while the mapping declares a one-to-many relation

2610537
width	height
the solution is to not use height and width at all

2610555
vim	emacs
most clojure users use emacs or to a lesser extent vim

2610579
filtering	grouping
our main requirement is to be able to search filtering grouping sort all of these projects by metadata in sharepoint

when i add the loop to multiplying it across the stage it just blinks while continuing to animate

2610810
sudo	chgrp
sudo chgrp uucp var lock

2610872
put	get
if you are trying to get all of the content from inside show_style and put it inside the fancy box i believe this is how you would do that

2610911
children	parent
if doing in the constructor for the worker class does not solve your problem and trying to catch signals in the parent ie sigterm sigint doesn t work you may have to try the opposite solution - instead of having the parent kill the children you can have the children commit suicide when the parent dies

2610929
inherited	properties
i ended up changing the inherited hierarchy such that all of our view models inherited from a base class that contains page content and other meta data as opposed to being an aggregate properties named data

2610932
jar	war
package ejb ejb or ejb3 ejb3 or jar jar or par par or rar rar or war war

2610978

2611138
google-chrome	firefox
worked perfectly fine on firefox and google-chrome

2611138
google-chrome	firefox
however in google-chrome or firefox even if only 15-16 characters are displayed initially when the drop down arrow is clicked upon it show the entire name however long it may be

2611138
google-chrome	firefox
ffor google-chrome or firefox shows 123456789 and when it is dropped down it show the full name as 123456789abcdefghijkl

2611145
multiplying	add
assuming both ints are non-negative and int1 goes on the left and int2 goes on the right you need to figure out how many digits long int2 is multiplying int1 by 10 a bunch of times and then add them

2611158
google-chrome	firefox
it validates at jsonlint.com but neither google-chrome nor firefox s native json parse functions will properly parse it

2611187
children	parent
because the code does not wait for its children and it does not ignore sigchld signals the process accumulates zombies - processes that would be cleaned up if only their parent waited for them

2611208
google-chrome	firefox
you problem comes from an escaping problem when defining literals in firefox or google-chrome

2611208
google-chrome	firefox
so jsonlint.com is right and firefox is right and google-chrome is right also

2611247
post	get
you are using a get where you should have used a post

2611345
google-chrome	firefox
okay i m being a tad lazy -and optimistic - but having tested this in both firefox and google-chrome albeit only on ubuntu 9.10 the theory -at least- is sound

2611374
int	boolean
i m sure there are introductory books and web sites out there but a pretty efficient way of learning it is actually to get the intel references and then try to do simple stuff like int math and boolean logic in your favorite high-level language and then look what the resulting binary code is

2611391
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
install vmware fusion or parallels or virtualbox for running the windows os

2611391
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
virtualbox is free but parallels vmware promise windows app that blend in with my mac windows

unless you really need to have a linear history of your old releases imo the most practical thing to do is to simply move those versioned folder under your tags or maybe branches directory and make sure that releases are tagged correctly from now on

2611418
csv	tsv
if n is specified or if there s only one table it should parse the table and spit it to stdout as csv or tsv

2611604
for-loop	while-loop
the difference in for-loop and while-loop

2611615
min	max	min	median	median	max
you would use a min-max-median heap to find the min max and median in constant time and take linear time to build the heap

2611615
min	max
deletemedian replaces the root with either the min of the max-min heap or the max of the min-max heap whichever maintains the balance

2611618
submit	submission
before submission we have a javascript functions that saves the action in a hidden action input and then performs the submit

2611635
range	max	range	min	min	max
that being said if it s not good enough you could create an array with max bucket value - min bucket value range elements and have each element in this array reference the appropriate bucket

2611640
cos	sin
sin phi cos phi

2611654
spaces	linefeed
as a carriage return linefeed and how many ever spaces for the indentation

2611924
webkit	gecko
it s not gecko but webkit based

2611956
bmp	png
you can use bufferedimage to construct images or the utilities in javax.imageio if your image is already in some common format png jpeg bmp

put	get
that knowledge base article gives a workaround that may work in your case too - put the expression to evaluate in a worksheet and then get the value from that like this

2612038
client-side	server-side
it does require a little bit more code client-side to handle the ajax calls and population of the dropdown but the server-side code would be pretty much the same for both methods same queries same retrieval loops just different output methods

2612054
int	boolean
it has an array of n boolean where n is the largest int you are checking and each element in the array represents one int

2612061

weka	libsvm
to learn one-class svms in weka use the libsvm wrapper if you re using v3.6

2612335
powerpc	i386
this can be particularly important on os x where pythons come in various flavors including some with various combinations of multi-architecture executables -arch i386 -arch powerpc -arch x86_64 -arch ppc64 and with support for multiple os x versions the current python.org os x installers are compatible with os x 10.4 through 10.6

it takes more cpu cycles for a processors to read a 16-bit word on an odd address or a 32-bit dword on an address not divisible by 4 so structures add pad bytes to make structure members fall on natural boundaries

2612863
apache	nginx
the problem is your sites mysite staticmedia is being passed to apache and not served by nginx itself

2612865
gtk	gdk
so you have to call glib.thread.init and gdk.threads.init at the beginning of your program bracket your call to application.run with gdk.threads.enter and gdk.threads.leave and also make sure any gtk and gdk calls in background threads not gtk signal handlers are between gdk.threads.enter and gdk.threads.leave

it crashes in both firefox and google-chrome because bar doesn t exist in the first alert

2613014
google-chrome	firefox
it seems as if you create a variable inside a with -statement most browsers tested on google-chrome or firefox will make that variable exist outside that scope also it s just set to undefined

2613047
initializer	class-method
if you create a class that contains only class variables and class-method then you can use it without the initializer

2613069
explode	implode
reference implode array_unique explode

2613086
post	get
the problem is that the scrollrecttovisible doesn t post a notification to the uiscrollviewdelegate when it s done scrolling - so the code responsible for loading adjacent pages never get s called when using the uipagecontrol

2613087
put	get
in x86 assembly the mov instruction is used to get data from ram and put it in one of the cpu s registers where you can manipulate it

register for onmousedown onmousemove onmouseup events

2613149
firefox	safari
here s my implementation so-far works in recent firefox safari

2613149
width	height
however the bounding box approach breaks down then the transparent rectangle is rotated cw or ccw as the resulting bounding box no longer properly represents the proper width and height

2613158
put	get
the problem is that when i put the code for email in cart.php i get errors

2613186
put	get
changing the directory for location where package will be created under package publish web settings doesn t seem to have an effect - even if you get clever and try to put it outside the project root with ....

delimiter is a spaces

2613218
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
supported image types png jpg gif bmp

2613230
boyer-moore	rabin-karp
you might also want to check out other algorithms such as boyer-moore rabin-karp and even the naive algorithm as there are situations inputs in which one is better than the others

2613283
ddms	adb
first you should use adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse to examine the java stack trace associated with the application has stopped unexpectedly so you can see what went wrong

2613298
websphere	ibm
ibm provides the xms libraries for websphere mq

2613319
submit	submission
to the submission though i only get the submit button data

2613330
apache	nginx
i would like to use a single .htaccess -file in apache or a single rule using nginx so i easyli can change web server without changing my code

2613373
apache	nginx
the better way would be to use nginx in front of apache and to serve static media

2613380
portrait	landscape
either using the left master view in landscape and using the popover in the portrait orientation

2613480
public	protected
depending on the access level would be protected or public in .net you can use something like

2613501
superclass	subclassing
of course quite often it is useful for b s implementation of a method to invoke a s implementation on the same object generally because the subclassing is wrapping extra behavior around the superclass s basic definition

2613505
filtering	grouping
xml web services will allow you to hook directly into sharepoint using sharepoint s native web services you can then create a data view web part which will enable you to view collate filtering and grouping list items

2613515
implements	extends
the way i chose to implements user login is through a base userawarecontroller class that all controllers extends

2613534
getter	setter
and just set the property directly don t bother with the pseudo getter setter stuff

2613534
getter	setter
if you really need a getter setter code it for that specific use

2613566
typedef	struct
a final note typedef ing struct the way you are doing it is a c-ism in c++ the following is sufficient

2613567
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
1 how should i correctly do the flip transition from within the uiviewcontroller in the uinavigationcontroller to a new uiviewcontroller and subsequently from the new uiviewcontroller and back to the original uiviewcontroller residing on the uinavigationcontroller stack

2613579
maven	pom.xml
since maven 2.0.9 maven uses the order of dependencies in the pom.xml to build the classpath so you can manipulate it

2613596
subclass	abstract-class
if i just override the field in the subclass the operation is done on the value of the field in the abstract-class

2613596
subclass	abstract-class
i m open to any solution that would ensure that the operation will be done during the instantiation of the subclass ie putting the operation in a method called by each subclass in the constructor is not a valid solution because someone might extend the abstract-class and forget to call the method

2613604
getter	setter
how about abstract getter setter for field

2613663
superclass	subclassing
you can t do this in the constructor since the superclass is going to be initialized before anything in the subclassing

2613663
public	protected
make sure your base class has a public protected constructor also for this code

2613704
post	get
i would assume that any request received by a server would appear to be the same ie http post get and that you would need to look at the referer but that may just give you the browser details

2613727
jar	war
now when i created war for my projects these changes was not reflected in the output war file the jar in lib folder of war has still the old code

2613731
public	protected	superclass	subclassing
make the constructor protected and offer no default constructor and subclassing implementers are forced to supply a value in their constructors - which can be public and pass a constant value to the superclass making the parameter invisible to users of the subclassing

2613739
vlan	packets
you can probably use an ioctl to get the mtu and if it is ethernet you can usually get the maximum packets size by subtracting the size of the hardware header from that which is 14 for ethernet with no vlan

2613744
superclass	subclassing
since the subclassing portion of your object isn t initialized until after the superclass constructor has returned there s really no other clean way of doing it

2613744
superclass	subclassing
this does not do what you d expect it to since the initializers and constructors of subclassing run after those of the superclass

2613750
implements	extends
huffy should instead extends bicycle and implements an interface so the methods of brandnames can be used

2613779
postgresql	mysql
since you re using php i recommend you use the pdo database layer with mysql or postgresql

2613782

2614274
portrait	landscape
i have conditional code that should only work in portrait and if the device is in landscape i need to do something else

2614282
dictionary	map
this way you can map both classes and dictionary normally and still access your dictionary as

2614283
width	height
this is because the xaml you posted says that the rich text box s maxheight and maxwidth will be the height width of the canvas

2614284

what i mean is is it inefficient for the browser search engine optimisation or any other important factors if programmatically my float right ed sidebar appears in the markup before the main content div which is set to float left

2614525
webmock	vcr
i m working with the auther of webmock a library that provides similar functionality to fakeweb to get vcr to work with webmock as well so that users of vcr could use either fakeweb or webmock as the http stubbing library

realloc	malloc
realloc takes a pointer previously malloc d and changes the size of the underlying memory block

2614663
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
free gives the memory back previously allocated with malloc calloc or realloc

2614740
mouseleave	mouseenter
the shorthand works for things like or something but for this you need to use the mouseenter and mouseleave events directly the same events .hover actually binds to

2614742
mouseleave	mouseenter
make sure you are using jquery 1.4 or later and according to the docs you need to use mouseenter and mouseleave rather than hover

2614757
implements	extends
it is possible for a class to implements multiple interfaces while it may extends only one class

2614757
inherited	subclassing
if however you want to provide any implementation in your template class then it is likely that you are best off just creating a class that has any commonalities that its subclassing have and just use plain old inherited

2614764
hex	binary
how do i create an unmodified hex dump of a binary file in linux using bash

2614798
bash	zsh

gentoo	linux
working with latest apache-tomcat on a gentoo linux server

2614884
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
comparatively that s a tremendous amount of inline code even if you leave out the animation portion it s messy think mouseenter mouseleave not mouseover mouseout ...the former which .hover uses is more complicated

cvs	svn
so repo-wide merges don t cause the same disruptions as they would be in svn cvs where one repo often contains many unrelated modules which need to have separate merge histories.

2615034
cvs	svn
cvs svn allows different files in the working directory to come from different revisions while dvcs es usually have one revision for the entire wc always even if a file is be reverted to an earlier version it will show as modified in status as it is different from the file in the checked out revision

the other that comes to mind it textwrangler which is a simplified version of the more popular bbedit

2615587
textwrangler	bbedit
i use bbedit and textwrangler is great although neither is strictly html

2616067
getter	setter
edit i missed the fact that the function expression is trying to make variable capturing to handle the getter setter creation inside the loop but the looping variable i needs to be passed as an argument in order to do it and since the function expression is there context the outer this should be preserved

2616067
inherited	properties
i would also recommend to use an inside the for...in loop to avoid iterating over user extended properties inherited from object.prototype

accessor	properties
properties create the accessor for you

2616581
getter	setter
i thought hey there s no getter setter for the xypoint object

2616581
width	height
i thinks its because origin is a pointer already and whats happening under the hood with width and height is that there is going te be created a pointer to them

2616586
mouse	keyboard
ideally i would like to control my movement by using the keyboard to move and the mouse to look around like you usually do in fps-games

2616596
accessor	properties
you can think of a properties declaration as being equivalent to declaring two accessor methods

2616603
width	height
the above interface will create simple accessor methods for width and height that can be called from other objects as or - these two are analogous

2616603
accessor	properties
but you would still want to declare a properties for it to generate accessor methods

2616611
getter	setter
getter and setter are mostly useful if you need to access an instance variable from another class or you re using bindings to get set them

2616611
width	height
so my guess would be that you need this functionality for the width and height but not for the origin

2616611
getter	setter
note that the getter setter do not make pointers out of the integers as you stated might be the reason

2616611
getter	setter
ints are ints and getter setter do not change that

2616643
boost	stl
i ve checked boost and stl and neither have an exact implementation

2616649
folder	directory
as soon i created the zip file in the directory somewhere other than directory in application folder everything worked fine

2616656
width	height
simply setting a child s width and height and expecting the layout to know it s supposed to respect your new values is no good what you need is some way to tell the layout node the values you d like to respect

2616695
free	malloc
they interpose versions of malloc and free that records the calls to alloc and free before then calling the actual system alloc and free functions to perform the memory management

2616709
qmainwindow	qwidget
the mymainwindowclass inherits from qmainwindow and the other from qwidget

2616766
srt	subtitle
i want to parse srt subtitle

2616811
subtraction	modulo
the usual way to handle this is do to a modulo subtraction

2616814
equals	tostring
for example if you add a new field data would automatically include that field in the equals hashcode and tostring methods

2616827
maven	pom.xml
for git i do a separate clone for each workspace as the maven support in eclipse does not pick up changes in the pom.xml hierarchy like a new project easily

2616836
getter	setter
there is both a getter and a setter collectively referred to as accessors created for origin in the rectangle class

2616836
accessor	properties	getter	setter
declaring getter and setter using properties and then implementing them using synthesize is only one way of declaring and creating accessor and is there for a convenience if you have lots of properties to declare in the class interface

2616836
getter	setter
due to the dynamically-bound nature of objective-c method calls you don t even have to declare the getter and setter methods in the interface although it is generally best practice to do so if you are advertising them as publicly available to other classes

2616843
versioning	upgrade
i ve upgrade an asp.net web application to the latest build of fluent nhibernate 1.0.0.636 and the newest versioning of nhibernate v2.1.2.4000

2616851
utf8-decode	percent-encoding
but these utf8-decode words are themselves also encoded with the percent-encoding since uris cannot contain any other characters except those in ascii

2616864
maven	pom.xml
the maven help plugin which is mandatory to debug a pom.xml

2616871
maven	pom.xml
the maven dependency plugin is another mandatory plugin to debug clean understand a pom.xml and how you get some dependency transitively

2616876
redhat	fedora
another use would be the open source version is used to build a base for and get free development done that they can transfer to a closed enterprise version see redhat fedora and above comment about support + training

2616914
post	get
anything that has an active effect like a removal should be a form with not a form or link that causes get and the server-side script that does the removing should only accept post requests

2616923
ostringstream	std	cout	cin
also in c++ the iostreams library std cin std cout std fstream std ostringstream std istringstream etc. are preferred over c file objects

2616927
children	parent
as a side note the children can t have a higher z-index than their parent so everything inside .codbg is -1 behind the page then you need to fix the tab images the problem is not that they re behind the background it s that they re transparent and look darker on top of a darker background

2616937
children	parent
for example if you have an aggregator pom that is also the parent for the projects that it aggregates and the children and parent versions get out of sync this mojo can help fix the versions of the child modules

2616941
typedef	struct
both can be aliased namespace with and struct with typedef mylong name space lilstruct

2616949
uiview	caanimation
so you ve to determine what exactly your animation is in terms of color alpha transform animations and create manual animation maybe you ll have to use caanimation instead of uiview beginanimations context

2616966
int	boolean
public boolean onkeyup int keycode keyevent event

2616966
int	boolean	keyevent	onkeydown
public boolean onkeydown int keycode keyevent event

2616976
spoofing	traffic
people can always sniff http traffic and spoofing it

2616977
cout	cin
when using c++ you should use the std cin and std cout streams for console input and output

2617014
children	parent
windows doesn t maintain a strict parent process heirarchy like unix does - it records the pid of the parent when a process is created but when this process goes away it isn t updated because a process does not track its children so you can t update it

2617036
maven	cargo
maven cargo plugin to start and stop your web container

2617053
integer	unsigned	public	protected
that means in c# you cannot have any public or protected method or parameter that is a unsigned integer

2617073
ant	maven
after hudson succesfully check out the source you can let it running a modified ant script to build the source and deploy it to your local remote maven repository

2617151
strtod	strtok	fgets	strtol	fgets	strtok	fgets	strtod	strtol	strtok	strtol	strtod
the better option is to use fgets to read input as text tokenize with strtok or similar and then use strtol or strtod to convert tokens to numerical values

2617155
vsto	add-in
i am developing a simple outlook 2003 add-in using vsto 2008

2617221
post	get
here is a post about why get is not supported for json

2617297
rss	feed
im using wordpress im also creating posts via xmlrpc based on an rss feed that is added to periodically

2617297
rss	feed
what i want is to read all post titles compare those against the rss feed then only post to wordpress where the post titles dont exist

2617297
post	get
this gets all titles from published post i then need to do the same to get the draft post

2617298
awt	swing
swing supplanted it entirely eleven years ago building on top of it to correct flaws in the awt 1.0 design

2617303
marshalbyrefobject	reflection.emit
however there are some ways to implement similar functionality such as using reflection.emit to generate assemblies and types on demand uing realproxy to create proxy objects for interfaces and marshalbyrefobject objects

2617305
implements	extends
second if you want to extends existing object by implements some behavior and related properties in a new module - you won t have a single reference for all occasions

2617338
system.configuration	system.web
if that doesn t work add references to system.web and system.configuration then try this

2617347
tiff	png
if you want to use alpha use png or tiff instead

2617348
persistent	transient
fast data access to users is best achieved by having the data locally be it transient kept in a bean or persistent a local database

2617367
for-loop	loops
since in the other class i already have a loops for-loop shown above that simulates 6 times the s2 stack

2617410
for-loop	loops
minor nitpick your for-loop is actually encoding 11 items and not 10 like you make think from a brief look at loops count

2617416
content-disposition	content-type
there is a text plain content-type part instead of content-disposition attachment

2617421
public	protected
otherwise when the public dispose is called explicitly it calls the protected dispose true and also gc.suppressfinalize this to prevent the finalizer from running because there is nothing to dispose of anymore

2617500
public	protected
to make it more clear private and protected functions are not directly testable unless you will create a public function to call it

2617500
public	protected
so i end up converting some private and protected functions to public functions just to be able to test them

2617507
comparator	comparable
i have tried various methods to make this work - implemented equals and hashcode for the custom object comprising the list - implemented the comparable interface for the custom object - implemented the comparator interface for the custom object .

2617515
post	get
get the query string get cookie get request url get post data

2617518

now i need to do the same for a textbox in an asp.net app but apparently neither invokerequired nor begininvoke exist for textbox in a web.ui

2617604
pop-up	dialog
i read many comment that the application need to pop-up dialog for user to decide to extend their permission

2617615
rcurl	libcurl
however requesting the data google chrome or from rcurl the libcurl add-in for r yields an essentially instantaneous response which is what i would expect

2617635
qobject	qwidget
the quote is although qobject is reentrant the gui classes notably qwidget and all its subclasses are not reentrant

2617642
jdom	dom4j
you could use something like jdom or dom4j

2617682
scrollable	panels
i m scrolling some panels which contain some youtube clips using jquery tools scrollable

2617735
hide	show
i am encountering an odd behavior using jquery to show hide a menu

2617735
hide	show
when you roll onto the revealed menu however show hide starts pulsing and does so a second or so even after the mouse clears the area

2617812
hide	show
i ve never had the best luck adjusting the show hide time

2617815
caliburn	prism
should i use a framework instead like prism or caliburn

2617933
temporary	tablespace
note be careful here if the table is a really big table you may need to declare a temporary tablespace for it to work in.

2617970
put	get
what should i put in my .emacs file so that i get the cpp-face-dark-list instead of cpp-face-light-list

2617980
jstl	taglib
the trick to getting this to work with standard jstl fmt taglib was to set up an interceptor that replaced the httpservletrequest s resource with our own

2618020
width	height
since hd seems to be .5625 ratio 16 9 i m thinking that i can just decide on a height and multiply it by the ratio to get the proper width each time plus 23px for youtube bar

2618027
put	get
yes you have to pay a subscription to the apple iphone developer programme to get access to a provisioning profile to enable you to put an app you have built onto your iphone ipod

2618028
erd	diagram
also a foreign key relationship is visible on an entity relationship diagram erd while a check constraint will never be

2618129
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
the long answer the sql-syntax isn t in the spec because it s entirely defined by sqlite the db-engine used by both safari and google-chrome the two browsers to support webdb with opera probably following soon ish and ms and mozilla refusing to follow just because of the fact that such a spec would be too dependant of the evolution of an external component

2618145
for-loop	arrays
how about an arrays of strings that you use a for-loop over checking membership with string.equals

2618147
post	get
what s puzzling to me is that - whilst i know post will never work in the browser - i thought by setting the auth headers in the httprequest object and still making a get request that would all go fine

2618189
emacs	aquamacs
i am using emacs from the shell not aquamacs on a mac laptop however whenever i try to scroll up and down it doesn t scroll the file

ord	chr
but all quines i know store their source code in a string and then replace a special character in it using something like chr and ord

2618258
google-chrome	firefox
although they are nonstandard like x-html-replace content-type they are supported by a majority of the non-ie browsers out there google-chrome firefox

2618263
width	height
so take that 20 and multiply it by the width the height and the number of bytes per pixel and you have something that takes up possibly megabytes

2618264
xna	spritebatch
and using custom shaders with the spritebatch class is oh so much easier in xna 4.0

2618264

2618292
pthreads	fork
on pthreads platforms the desired effect could be achieved by fork ing

2618307
listview	gridview
a listview does not handle presentation it delegates this to its view property which is usually a gridview

2618311
3-tier	n-tier
not every solution needs to be 3-tier or n-tier but it is still important to understand the distinction

2618364
post	put
any post put or delete requests will be handled by apache as usual so you can wire up your application tier however you usually would

2618399
background-color	font-size
it sets the color and the background-color then the style textbox1 gets applied and it overwrites the background-color and adds font-size to

2618399
background-color	font-size
so in the end you end with the color from generictextbox the background-color and font-size from textbox1

2618415
innodb	myisam
if you need to move from myisam to innodb to get the fk functionality you need to consider the tradeoffs in performance between the two engines

2618466
cvs	svn
i want to cut the svn cvs recods in pieces and then put in to database

2618471
nstextview	nstextstorage
this is a pretty classic example of a model-view-controller architecture the nstextview is the view and the nstextstorage is the model

2618499
postgresql	mysql
i want to know whether its possible with databases technology independent but would be interested to hear whether its possible with oracle mysql and postgresql to point to specific rows instead of executing my query again

2618559
slideup	slidedown
i m trying to make a sliding panel using .animate function because i want it to slide left right jquery allow slideup and slidedown but no other directions

2618579
width	height
when you copy the embed code paste it into a text editor and you ll see it contains width and height parameters in two places

2618581
cpu	affinity
in order to make an ideal environment for the lock-free code we will even set the cpu affinity of the producer and the consumer thread by using the utility class from here

2618589
clang	llvm
the clang project provides new front-ends for c c++ objective c on top of the llvm backend

2618604
vbulletin	phpbb
writing your own forum is so complicated that the quality of your own software will be much lower than of something like phpbb or vbulletin

2618613
fortran	ada
gcc is a suite of compilers with front ends for c c++ fortran ada java etc. and back-ends for more processors than i d care to think about

2618634
hide	show
you cannot show hide a browser action nor you can trigger a popup to open

it should hopefully work in google-chrome ffx safari and ie

2618730
int	chars
i m trying to pass a 2d int array and a 1d chars array by reference

2618736
int	chars
int send_all int sock unsigned chars buffer int len

2618738
keydown	keyup
the problem i did have was with it was that i had to get it to run on both keydown and keyup for it to work successfully

2618741
int	chars
typically a function taking a 2d array of int s and a 1d array of chars would be declared as

2618796
int	chars
assuming that you wanted an array of int and an array of chars the variant with pointers-to-array instead of references-to-array might look as follows

2618803
oncreate	setcontentview
the reason initial application activity extended tabactivity but layout xml with tabhost widget was not loaded via setcontentview in oncreate scope it was scheduled to load via runnable a little bit later

2618822
subtract	add
as you see we simply add and subtract the necessary number of bytes from the stack pointer leaving the old data where it was

2618858
srp	principles
you ll have to balance sensible reuse and the single responsibility principles srp

2618861
wav	riff
if it helps at all here is a good article on the riff wav file format

2618864
post	get
to get a better answer say which language you are using and preferably also post your source code

2618888
for-loop	loops
for-loop sets a variable to the snapshot length at the beginning of loops instead of checking textnodes.snapshotlength at the beginning of every loops

2618911
portrait	landscape
this should be simple enough the details of how to handle portrait to landscape orientation change are provided here

2618915
portrait	landscape
i have opengl only view that displays in portrait and landscape mode using projection matrix view s transformation is identity all the time

2618915
portrait	landscape
when i change from landscape to portrait landscape is the initial state view s frame is set to 0 20 320 460 and stays like this

2618915
portrait	landscape
initialy view is full screen i change it to 0 0 300 480 landscape with status bar and it works then it doesn t work when i try to chenge it for the second time portrait with status bar

2618957
int	boolean
to begin with a simple example if you attempt to subclass many of actionscript s primitive datatypes int uint number string boolean etc you get the following compiler error

2618957
inherited	properties
in this dialect functions are used as classes of a sort well prototypes and the ability for functions to have properties added at runtime is part of the power of prototypal inherited

2618959
firefox	safari
this works fine in safari but firefox 3.6.3 reports the file to be not well-formed

2618983
portrait	landscape
switch to previous layout orientation for example portrait landscape

2618983
portrait	landscape
switch to next layout orientation for example portrait landscape

2619002
firefox	safari
the code works fine on safari but fails on firefox 3.6.3

2619002
content-length	content-type
the http status is ok 200 the content-type is properly application json and the content-length of 2126 gzip d implies data came back

2619010
post	get
i want to be able to let a user get to a password protected wordpress page without needing to type the password so when they go to the page the password is submitted by a post url on page load

2619016
keyevent	keyrelease
responding to the keypressed or keyrelease event is fine for setting the focus to the text field but i need to then repeat the keyevent somehow so that whatever was typed is actually entered

2619019
post	get
for example if you had a page that took a get variable such as an attacker could post an image on your site like this

2619025
antivirus	norton
norton antivirus 2010

2619038
codeigniter	kohana
i haven t used any well-known frameworks or object relational mappers but i ve heard that codeigniter kohana and doctrine are a few good ones

2619047
inherited	subclassing
the hook method inherited if defined gets called whenever a subclassing is created

2619056
post	get
that code is only looking at the post variables not the get variables in the url

2619056
post	get
the request global contains both the post and the get variables which is what you want

2619056
post	get
the problem is those parameters are in the get array not the post array

2619078
post	get
using post over get gets you nothing tangible as far as security is concerned

2619082
udp	tcp
oh how i wish tcp was packet-based like udp is

2619094
google-chrome	firefox
the html often contains named anchors which work fine in ie google-chrome but in firefox it reopens the entire page within the iframe

2619134
post	get
i have been able to get the silverlight app to successfully do the post assuming everything goes good

2619140
getter	setter
you have to use a getter setter

2619183
button	checkbox
from the perspective of http both radio button and checkbox sets are pretty much the same thing except that selecting a radio button deselects all others in the group

2619185
getter	setter
xmlserializer requires a public getter and setter for every serialized property this is very annoying and can lead to some sub-optimal designs

2619206
pull	push
you may need to git pull origin before you git push origin master

2619235
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
further the row cannot be deselected by calling deselectrowatindexpath animated on self.tableview in viewwillappear or viewdidappear in the first controller

2619240
free	malloc
i would suggest in that case to use malloc to allocate the string inside the function but make sure whenever you call the function you free the return value eventually

2619245
boost	stl
note this method is roughly 2-4 times faster than the standard library routines and rougly 120+ times faster than stl based implementations stringstream boost lexical_cast etc for string to integer conversion - depending on compiler used of course

2619247
button	checkbox
i noticed that if you wrap a radio button or checkbox in a label the whole thing becomes clickable even without a for id pair in fact it seems to ignore this because i screwed it up

2619247
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i tested it in firefox google-chrome and opera and ie8 does anyone know if it works in older browsers like ie6

2619270
int	chars
int give_me_a_string chars buffer int buffersize

2619270
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2619308
children	parent
the former selects all descendant para elements that are the first para children of their parent

2619313
put	get
get the sources put them under version control in a distinct project patch them rebuild the patched library and include this information in the version something like x.y.z-patched deploy it to a repository you could use svn for this a la google code 1 declare the repository in your pom and update the dependency to point on your patched version

2619331
directx	gdi
it seems you can draw to the desktop background using the gdi as i believe the wxsnow program does and i ve seen something similar to what i want done by vlc media player under windows xp with its directx wallpaper mode interestingly i can t seem to get this option enabled on my system

2619354
post	get
it s not too hard web server capable of answering get post requests is a typical school project but there will be years of bug fighting if you mean it seriously or

2619355
lisp	smalltalk
then it talks about many programming languages and concepts that come from them and are interesting including lisp which is a basis for clojure ml a basis for microsoft s f# but also simula and smalltalk two fundamental oo languages and c++ with java practical oo languages with quite different approach

2619367
affinity	processors
you might be able to set the processors affinity temporarily to only run on one processors until you find the problem

2619367
cpu	processors	cpu	affinity	affinity	processors
for windows xp vista 7 access affinity by opening the windows task manager ctl+alt+del or right-click on task bar select processes tab right-click the application process you wish to isolate then select set affinity. inside the processors affinity dialog un-check the cpu cores you do not need to use

2619374
free	malloc
a common extension which is present on mac os x linux solaris and others is that if the first argument is null then getcwd will allocate a buffer for you using malloc -- you would then free this using free when you are done with it

2619386
ssl	https
https requires that you setup iis with a proper ssl certificate and add a https binding to your site

2619399
width	margin
because of the width margin i ve set for each you should get 4 per row

2619399
put	get
if you need spacers just put in blank divs to get the content on the right row column

2619426
allocator	stl
of course stl could be allocator from the heap as well

2619450
post	get
another post there suggests that you could possibly do this with the background of an explorer window - if you could get the handle of the window that constitutes it

2619450
directx	gdi
if this is the only route and directx doesn t expose the bitmap handles and i don t think they would then for each frame you would have to create a new gdi bitmap which would slow things down quite a bit

2619493
post	put	post	get	put	get

sebesta explains well concepts of programming languages starting with konrad zuse s plankalkã¼l continuing with the first real programming languages like fortran lisp cobol algol basic and on to c c++ java and ada

2619558
folder	directory
in this case you may also want to consider enabling the copy to output directory option see below which will copy the chosen files to the output folder

2619566
serializable	deserialization
serialversionuid can be any long that provides a unique signature to your object for serializable and deserialization

2619579
stdout	stderr
perhaps try capturing stderr as well as stdout

2619601
ispconfig	cpanel
maybe you could look into some free cpanel alternatives like ispconfig or ehcp

2619605
profiler	vtune
use a performance profiler that can hook into cpu events such as vtune

2619644
post	put	post	get	put	get
i used netbeans to create the resources of restful service with mysql and now i can now use get and post put to list and add modify data entities in the mysql server

2619705
post	get
can t seem to get it to work keeps deleting the actual post not the comment log shows that i keep sending delete request to postscontroller

2619723
btrieve	dsn
once you ve got a client installed on the linux machine you can create an odbc dsn or use the btrieve api to access the data

2619735
int	chars
i have game data that is stored in chars string format in a plist but which needs to be in int id format when it is loaded

2619756
cpu	processors
however this doesn t effectively create a 16ghz processors exactly as a single-thread single-process program running at 100 cpu would only be able to use one

2619761
filewriter	bufferedwriter
so you layer bufferedwriter on top of filewriter

2619782
getter	setter
then i have a contact class that basically just has getter and setter or public properties

2619816
int	double
you can t call sqrt with an int as its parameter because sqrt takes a float double or long double

2619830
free	malloc
i tried dynamically allocating memory to the strings and copying them the standard way but the only way that worked was using malloc and free which i hear is discouraged in c++

2619836
pdfsharp	itextsharp
i have used itextsharp and pdfsharp

2619859
free	malloc
the right way to do this is to use malloc free or new delete

2619859
free	malloc
you re using a c function so you re already guilty of the same crime as you would be using malloc free

2619874
put	get
i have put several links from typing api design in google and on the first page get these that look pretty good

2619880

2620130
implements	extends
mappers can be implements as a collection of static functions or as an object - however the collection is less flexible if you want to extends or alter the behaviour for any reason such as mocking for unit testing

2620130
getter	setter
the model itself should simply be a collection of data either stored as public properties or preferably with appropriate setter and getter please don t just define a get set function pair for every variable or you might as well just leave them public along with other methods that operate on the data

2620267
dlsym	dlopen
there is no way that i know of to determine which executables may reference the function using dynamic loading dlopen dlsym dlcose

2621031
ienumerable	icomparer
ienumerable of t is covariant so there s a conversion from ienumerable of string to ienumerable of object and icomparer of t is contravariant so there s a conversion from icomparer of object to icomparer of string for example

2621113
many-to-one	one-to-many
i think my definition here must have been causing sqlalchemy to be confused about the many-to-one vs one-to-many relationship

how can i tell sinatra to leave my web server apache alone to server index.html file if there is an index.html file in a subdirectory of public folder when url is pointing to that directory without the file name

2621488
getter	setter
a property is a wrapper around a getter and setter method and i want to create a delegate to a property getter method

versioning	upgrade
which is upgrade versioning of

2621513
gif	png
i need to find all image files from directory gif png jpg jpeg

2621527
getter	setter
since it isn t possible to explicitly address a getter or setter in normal code without reflection that is i don t think that there is a way to do what you want

2621548
pop-up	dialog
my suspicion is that perhaps a self test has failed and maybe i just called exit forgetting to pop-up a dialog explaining why

2621640
telerik	radwindow
i have a telerik radwindow that allows our users to upload files

2621647
width	height
it looks like you need to increase width and height accordingly

2621679
srp	principles
the single responsibility principles srp is furthermore notoriously subjective and entirely dependent on the level of abstraction of the observer

2621686
innodb	myisam
you should increase your innodb_buffer_pool_size if your table is innodb and sort_buffer_size if your table is myisam

2621688
width	height
the reason for the image not showing up was that i didnt mentioned the height width constraints

2621702
portrait	landscape
almost all changes on the device orientation triggers the shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation method but this method is not called when the device is put on portrait after coming from any landscape orientation

width	height
i m able to change the width height of the grid using this so why won t it work when i use grid.rendertransform .translatetransform.x as such

2621784
ant	maven
this could be wrapped in a maven plugin or for simpler integration used with the maven antrun plugin and the pre-bundled ant task

2621837
ready	each
what i can add to the workflow you mention is each developer should not create a feature branch only a current dev branch because the truth is the developer often doesn t know what exactly his her branch will produce one feature several because it ended up being too complex a feature none because not ready in time for release another feature because the original one had morphed .

2621879
cvs	svn
it s not a traditional way of working and is designed to be peer driven rather than hierarchical like svn cvs

2621925

yes it s a bad idea because you should put all your score weights in a table and perform a join to get the result

2622082
128bit	64bit
the same will happen with 64bit to 128bit

2622087
post	get
you can also pass it as variables creating a new urlvariables object store that data with in it and pass it to urlrequest data and send it either per post or get the latter of which implies appending the parameters to the url whereas the former allows sending them in the request body

2622125
mef	prism
i wouldn t be surprised to see unity and prism evolve to make greater use of mef to deliver their various patterns

2622145
jsf	seam
3 seam isn t a web framework it is more like an application stack that makes jsf ejb3 and hibernate all play better together so it shouldn t hurt that you have seam annotations in your ejbs

2622199
128bit	64bit
with 128bit you d need twice as much storage registers ram caches etc. compared to 64bit for common data types - with all the drawback that might have - more ram needed to store data more data to transmit slower wider buses might requires more physical space perhaps more power etc

2622210
qstackedwidget	qwidget
i have a subclass of qstackedwidget and inside that a subclass of qwidget

well actually you should set the width and height on the inner or outer control of the border not on the border itself

2622340
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
but if i try and pass one of my own custom class objects as a parameter then i get an argumentexception exception and it is not either an argumentoutofrangeexception or argumentnullexception

2622409
inherited	properties
but this would be ugly if basic has a lot of properties and also you only need one object as someextension already inherited basic

2622459
int	double
however 5 3 will return an int not a double

2622473
onresume	onpause

2622494
youtube	vimeo
flash video via sites like youtube and vimeo is definitely the way to go

2622501

the general solution is to create accessor methods for the properties and then use them everywhere including inside that class except in its init and dealloc methods

2622808
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox however do support cross-domain requests via the w3c cors spec cross origin resource sharing however the remote host has to enable it

google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari everything looks fine and the datepicker drops down and displays correctly

2622867
google-chrome	safari
i am somewhat uncertain that this is due to our css but because google-chrome and safari work fine i think it might be a problem with ext-js itself

2622895
superclass	subclassing
to my knowledge this doesn t break liskov s substitution principle as an instance of a subclassing can do all the things that an instance of a superclass can do

2622897
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome this works fine

2622898
postgresql	mysql
if they re not and you must use an abstraction layer to your database something like a custom db- escape which in your mysql architecture maps to mysql_real_escape_string and in your postgresql architecture maps to a respective method for postgresql i don t know which that would be off-hand sorry i haven t worked with postgresql

2622920
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
very common i know but i want to make it work in eeeevery browsers at least safari firefox google-chrome and most important ie7+ ie6 not necessary...

2 - can we somehow modify dj to run only on the first 15 days of the month with without using cron and then just stop and exit once all the jobs in the queue for the day are over don t want it to ping the db every time for a new job...whatever the jobs will be in the queue when dj starts that will be all

2623362
min	max
to answer the second part of your question ie having a table of components i would say that you can t do it with different panels except if you start setting the individual min pref and max sizes of components and panels which is highly unadvised

i have a good understanding of linear interpolation but i found it difficult to grasp the complexity of the maths of splines

2623619
interpolation	splines
just remember that unlike linear interpolation where you only need two points to start with catmull-rom splines interpolation uses an extra point at either end

2623619

2624015
dao	facade
there is the spring validator but i am not sure this is the best place for this for one i am wary of this method as validation is tied to the web tier but also that means i would need to make the dao calls in the validator for validation but i would need to call the dao s in the facade layer again when the command - entity translation occurs

2624061

there is no way to configure the native amf serializable deserialization from the flash player to give you warnings if remoteclass or any other metadata is set or not

2625600
postgresql	mysql
i d like to avoid doing anything that will break mysql postgresql and sql server support so extending the oracle10gdialect appears to be the most promising of the workarounds mentioned in hhh-1961

2625600
postgresql	mysql
what is the best workaround for this problem that won t break our compatibility with mysql postgresql and sql server

2625632
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox

2625650
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in firefox google-chrome and even ie7

2625688
cpython	ironpython
there is a comment down below in this blog post that hints at the reason why it was so easy dispense with a gil for ironpython or jython it is that cpython uses reference counting whereas the other 2 vms have garbage collectors

2625732
youtube	vimeo
i know other api s authentication methods like in vimeo and youtube will allow you to specify a next parameter which is the equivalent of the post-authorize redirect url and it can be set at run time

2625746

the height and width of a queried rectangle are typically about 10x10-20x20

2625873
draggable	droppable
i m using jquery ui and jquery draggable all my draggable use jquery clone helper and appends the draggable to droppable

2625873
draggable	droppable
the position is not relative to the droppable which makes the draggable drop to random places

2625873
draggable	droppable
overall the droppable and draggable integration is not tight

2625917
fadein	hide	hide	show
your question confuses me a bit because .toggle is basically a show hide toggle but you have fadein

2625939
lisp	scheme
the usual thing to do with a symbol for a scheme or indeed any lisp interpreter is to look it up in some sort of environment

2625941
fadein	fadeout
so if you want an element to fadein and fadeout every other click have a toggle control 2 functions the fadein and the fadeout

2625948
int	double
because a double is higher it will merge the int into the 0.0

2625948

the same way can be done for converting from int double float to string

2625976
spaces	delimiter
is there a linux utility or a bash command i can use to sort a spaces delimiter string of numbers

2625992
hide	show
i ve been trying to create some simple jquery that on click will remove the hide class from it s child ul but at the same time check that no other ul s with class of tier_2 are show aka the other s have the hide class

2625999
spaces	delimiter
tr translates the spaces delimiting the numbers into carriage returns because sort uses carriage returns as delimiter ie it is for sorting lines of text

2626023
mouseover	mouseout
use cleartimeout on mouseover event and use settimeout again on mouseout event

2626037
implements	extends
on the syntax level java was influenced by smalltalk while c# tried to stay closer to c c++ eg compare java s extends and implements with c# s notation and took a vague inspiration from vb on those concepts that weren t mappable to c c++ example property syntax

2626037
awt	swing
c# relies on the .net framework which was built on microsoft s experience with the visual studio family of products and thus is significantly windows-oriented while java s class library was built iirc from scratch and heavily evolved over time on these swing days does anyone remember awt

2626053
hide	show
you can use the show and hide jquery functions or toggle

2626053
addclass	removeclass	hide	removeclass
if i am wrong and you really do need your hide class you can use addclass and removeclass functions

2626055
ftp	smb
speaks http https tls ftp ipv6 understands smb

2626055
fastcgi	scgi
supports scgi and fastcgi and can thus be used to run elf binaries or scripts

2626097
maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml
however there is a maven plugin for eclipse called m2e which will read a pom.xml and construct a classpath out of jars it finds in the local repository and any remote repositories you ve configured

2626097
maven	pom.xml
it behaves largely like maven does in terms of finding the latest version for a given jar if you ve specified a version range in your pom.xml

2626131
accessor	properties
the only problem is that buttons properties does not have a set accessor and is defined like so

2626139
children	parent
in some circumstances if you validate the children objects before the parent object then the errors on the children objects will get reset before the object is sent to the jsp.

2626151
fgets	fread
each webpage uses fopen fgets fread to read common data like navigation bars from files

2626151
fgets	fread
would each call to fopen fgets fread interefere with each other if various people are browsing the same page

2626185
stateless	stateful
exchanges are generally stateless in the amqp model though there have been some recent experiments in stateful exchanges now that there s both a system for managing rabbitmq plugins and for providing new experimental exchange types

2626205
firefox	safari
the rollovers works pretty well on firefox but in explorer the larger images show up under the central div and in safari they don t seem to work at all

2626213

2626269
post	put
i put a blog post together a few years ago on how to do it disassembling .net - appendix a

2626302
firefox	safari
my suspicion is that ie is swapping out the image for the last it finds firefox is using the first and safari is saying screw this

2626315
uicontrol	uibutton
uibutton inherits its target action methods from uicontrol

2626323
sorting	filtering
sorting arrows dont appear but are clickable and filtering are wildy off

2626339
prepare	execute
the caveat here though is that the difference between a prepare statement and a non-prepared one becomes negligible as the computation time to execute the query and fetch the data becomes large

2626348
getter	setter
maybe writing setter getter public static methods to change variables is best way

2626379
pop-up	dialog
but when user click delete button jqgrid will pop-up a delete dialog to ask user if they wanna delete or cancel how can i check if user choose cancel before i really submit data deletion to the server

2626387
uiview	subviews
when zooming those subviews are not resized which is actually what we are aiming for but the problem is that the uiview frame origin is moved across the scroll view in some rather weird way

2626389
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox returns a single image and some other browsers google-chrome presumably safari returns an array of images and then the function doesn t work as expected

2626483
put	get
when i run the app in the simulator it shows the way i want - basically spinning the entire time until the selected tab loads the data from the server - but when i put the app onto my phone i only get a split-second of the spinner before it disappears

2626525
ddms	adb
i m not sure about inside of netbeans but you can use adb logcat or ddms to examine the logs which will contain...well...something

reading around it seems that althrough it s possible to mix heavyweight awt and lightweight swing components some problems seem to be unavoidable

2626704
actionscript	mxml
i have done some work with mxml projects using the flex sdk but never any actionscript programming

2626743
awt	swing
if it is in awt or swing then you putting it in an applet is just a packaging issue

hmm since you are in c++ it sounds like you are looking for stl allocator and or placement new

2626756
rss	feed
i am saving a reference to an rss feed in mongodb each feed has an ever growing list of entries

2626757
pop-up	dialog
currently internet explorer pop-up the open save cancel dialog box with no option to automatically open the file

2626757
google-chrome	firefox
i have accomplished this in both google-chrome and firefox by choosing automatically open files of this type from now on

2626763
post	get
use post instead of get

2626775
cos	sin
another thing you may want to keep in mind for the future the math functions cos sin expect the angle in radians whereas the .rotation property is in degrees so you must convert before using

2626782
punctuation	words
you could further extend this to look for links that have words after them but no punctuation

2626804
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you should request your data reload as early as possible such as in viewdidload or viewwillappear depending on your reuse or otherwise of view controllers

2626827

2626903
folder	directory
when people talk about creating a directory structure do they mean the folder you make within the solution explorer folder you actually find inside of a .sln file or do they mean setting up and creating folder that reside in the same folder as your .sln file or your compiled application .exe

2626911
folder	directory
visual studio directory aren t just virtual folder though they can contain filter rules so when you add a file to your project it will automatically get added to the correct filtered folder

i m not a fan of how this works in visual studio i don t get why they don t just put files in physical folders

2626937
yacc	bison
i m not exactly sure of the yacc bison parsing algorithm and when it prefers shifting over reducing however i know that bison supports lr 1 parsing which means it has a lookahead token

2626947
int	double
converting from to is just like converting from double to int - it has to happen in full view of the compiler you can t hide that conversion behind the compiler s back

2626962
implements	extends
since you don t want to implements zend_db_table_abstract you could extends your current model to on __construct preform the zend_registry get db and then store it to

2626982
free	malloc
if str was pointing to a block of memory allocated by malloc and you ve called free on that memory - then accessing isn t allowed after that point

2626989
int	chars
there are many ways to do this but yes it involves generating a random int using java.util.random.nextint and then using that to map to a chars

2627130
daemon	cron
now should i have a cron job that does rake ultrasphinx index regularly or will the daemon take care of indexing whenever a new object is created

2627197

2627212
rdf	owl
it has been built to simplify the use of fundamental semantic web technologies rdf and owl under microsoftâ s .net platform

2627223
int	double
i suspect that the first parameter is correct because it is cast to a double during the function call and that the others are interpreted as int s and then the bits are stuffed into a double

2627315
google-chrome	firefox
this behavior is reproducible in firefox and google-chrome

2627359
jtable	jlayeredpane
can we add a jtable to a jlayeredpane in java

it shows wvga and fwvga in mdpi for large screens and hdpi for normal

2627462
screens	hdpi
moreover there are two screens resolutions for hdpi 480 800 and

2627533
keydown	keyup
the best you can do is a keydown or keyup event on the usercontrol

2627533
keydown	keyup
however any control which marks a keydown or keyup event as handled will prevent the usercontrol from receiving that event and thereby making the menu s response to such direct keyboard access appear patchy and inconsistent

2627533
keydown	keyup
bottom line is if you must have this feature you could probably deliver it reasonably well with keyup or keydown event handling but you need to test the ui rigorously to see if there are any circumstances where it doesn t work

2627539
post	get
change form method from post struts default setting to get

2627539
post	get
send a get before post action executing

2627539

2627539
post	get
detecting if post was sent with zero content-length you may get it from header properties hash structure with your framework

2627542

while using a full framework like django pylons or turbogears is nice you could also check out the more light-weight approaches

2627937

2628017
jar	manifest.mf
manifest.mf from the jar file

2628025
stdout	stderr
for this type of application stdout and stderr print to the console that you launched them from creating a new console if necessary

2628025
stdout	stderr
you can still write to stdout and stderr but they don t go anywhere

2628025
stdout	stderr
one trick for subsystem windows applications is that even though there s no console you can still pipe stdout and stderr

2628030
post	get
i am still looking into how this works but i thought i would post this to get you looking into that

2628045
google-chrome	firefox
the solution mentioned earlier works in google-chrome but not in firefox for whatever reason i am quite sure it was working some time ago

2628239
free	malloc
most compilers will just invoke the underlying malloc free or similar when new delete is invoked

2628275
int	chars
my two cents sizeof int + sizeof chars may not be equal to sizeof foo because of structure elements padding so allocated deallocated memory block size is sizeof foo

2628288
cvs	svn
i d like to make them change from cvs to svn mercurial or git might be even better however i can t really recommand using a system i don t know well and switching to svn will already be a great step forward

2628293
folder	directory
at a guess i could either have the service write its log file in a logs folder at the top level of the site or i could leave it where it is and set up a virtual directory to point to it

2628314
pascal	delphi
are languages like c and pascal faster than object oriented languages like c++ and delphi

2628314
pascal	delphi
for example it s quite possible to create a pascal application which runs faster when compiled with delphi rather than an old turbo pascal compiler

equals	gethashcode
you need to implement iequatable or override equals and gethashcode

2629182

opera	safari
it s definitely not pretty but i m not sure why its not working for safari opera and ie

2632063

comparator	comparable
treeset doesn t require its type parameter to be comparable because it can take an external comparator for comparing non- comparable values

2632426
comparator	comparable
if the type would have to be comparable you couldn t create a treeset with a non-comparable type and a comparator which you can as it is now

2632426
comparator	comparable
one way to fix this while still being type-safe would have been to have two classes one with a comparable type parameter and one with a non-comparable type parameter and no default constructor only the constructor that takes a comparator but i suppose the java devs didn t want to introduce two classes that basically did the same thing though one could easily be implemented as a wrapper around the other

2632433
comparator	comparable
you can pass the set a comparator object explicitly in which case the element type does not need to be a comparable

2632451

i have a context loader class which loads an xml file with info on which components to show or hide on a page

but like ignacio sai gnome and kde can hook up to your server and live edit files like that

2632936
hash	md5
encode the information then store the md5 hash

2632944
disk	ram
this is not only on disk mind you - the pages are loaded into sql server s ram in their entirety - so by potentially bloating up your clustering key you d incur performance penalties due to the larger number of pages on disk and in ram that your non-clustered indices would need

2632953
hide	show
i m trying to emit some jquery and other javascript that will hide and show webparts on a page

2633008

my thoughts where a salt md5 hash of the mac address or device phone number but i can t figure out how to access either of those using the python apis within ase

2633094
stdout	fflush
it seems that process wmic.exe is never finished and i suppose it s stdout is never fflush so you don t receive anything throught qprocess readall

2633099
stdout	stderr
you might also convert your disp ... statements to fprintf stderr ... i think stderr is handled differently from stdout on octave

2633103
ready	each
your problem is that is being evaluated in the document ready functions context you can use the .each function to iterate over each .help

2633104
width	height
i was able to replicate the problem by puting the width and height in as a string rather and in integer in one of my ui dialogs so i would suggest checking that

2633117

which grid columns to show hide

2633129
width	height
if i create a popup that is sized 50 width and 100 height everything works fine but if i try to create a full screen popup sized to 100 width and height it ends up displaying at 100 width and 75 height.

2633129
width	height
note the width and height are actually being expressed in pixels in code i m using percent to make the situation a little more understandable.

2633129
width	height
if you run this the bottom 25 of the popup is missing if you change the width of the popup to 500 then it will go full height

2633167
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

we have windows that we create and sometimes we create new windows as children of existing windows using the constructor that takes a parent argument

2633254
mouse	keyboard
on mouse and keyboard events most likely not

2633283
for-loop	loops
i could use a while loops or check if i 2 0 but i was wondering if there wasn t a way to do it with the for-loop

2633344
button	checkbox
since it s html you can use button text areas checkbox etc to show information to the user and get input from them and use css to style it all

2633344

anything you can express in vbscript or jscript javascript and want an html css front on is a good candidate for an hta

2633646
hide	show
i need a script that will preform a simple show hide preferably with a nice sliding in and out on a list

note that for builds that don t require debugging remote client code you may use maven or ant integration which is much simpler

2633701
button	checkbox
in adobe pdfs you have the checkbox concept and the radio button concept

2633823
min	max

2633851
tinyurl	goo.gl	tinyurl	bit.ly	goo.gl	bit.ly
i know short urls such as bit.ly tinyurl goo.gl etc use the 302 redirection method to redirect you to another site

mvp	presenter
in the gwt mvp pattern events are sent from presenter the an app controller catches them and update the browser history

2633863
fseek	ftell
so a solution might be to use ftell and then fseek to get it to correct position

2633870
feedback	review
i would probably implement this by having a feedback or review model and your user model would have one-to-many feedback review and the feedback review would have a one-to-one relationship with the user who created it

2633876
feof	fread
i m not clear but if you re interested in knowing before you read the byte if eof has been reached put your feof test before the fread rather than after it

2633900

i don t have much experience with pyopengl or pyglet but i m wondering if there is a faster library for doing pixel manipulation in or if there is a faster method in pygame for doing pixel manupilation

2634118
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
i have a uipopovercontroller that shows a uiviewcontroller with a uitableview in its view

so the rule of thumb is store everything row obviously prevent sql injection and treat everything as tainted no matter where it comes from the database user forms rss feed flat files xml etc

2634197
children	parent
finding children too siblings are children of parent except the current category so they are easy too

2634267
inherited	properties
uipickerview inherited from uiview so you should be able to just toggle its hidden properties

2634313
comparator	comparable
conceivably some sorting algorithm can additionally specify that they can take hints from the magnitude but i m not sure how practical that would be for comparison-based sorting since we really need only to know if or which is really what comparable and comparator are oop abstractions of

2634323
filtering	grouping
you need to wrap the expression that selects the a in parenthesis to grouping them in a node-set then apply the predicate filtering on position

2634326

2634397
getter	setter
in general it s better to go through the property getter and setter whenever possible unless there is a specific reason not to

2634397
getter	setter
the reason it s good to use the property getter and setter even in the implementing class itself when if you need to change the implementation of the getter setter in the future such as adding needed side effects your code will already be in a good position to honor the new getter setter semantics

2634410
google-chrome	firefox
opening this page in firefox and google-chrome alerts old which is the expected behavior

to be clear my actual question is which properties should nested ul elements inherited from ol elements that enclose them

2634637
inherited	properties
as the right pane suggests nested ul elements do inherited properties from ol elements but the browser s default values of list-style-type and list-style-position override those specified by its parent

pascal	delphi
but i am still confused my impession about oo languages is they have performance overhead because their libraries are bloated.if you write in c++ using blitz++ library it will run faster if not as fast as c but normal libraries available for c++ make c++ slower than c same applies for pascal and delphi if you use delphi7 instead of delphi 2010 to compile your program it will run faster cuz delphi 2010 units are heavier warning i havent compared delphi 7 to 2010 nor have i compared c++ to c its just my impression created by reading on line forums and language vs language debate you people might think i am crazy but i d prefer a program even as minor as text editor to run with perfection even if my programs were to run on a supercomputer i would still like to optimize the hell out of my code may be i have obsessive compulsive personality disorder

public	protected
the public private protected keywords are not meant for security but rather for encapsulation

2635795
public	protected
you design your class by separating the implementation where the private protected members are used - those actually used to implement the functionality from the interface where you expose the public members - which users of the class -other objects- will access call and thus you are later able to change the private parts without changing the interface

button	checkbox
how do i disable the backspace button when input checkbox are focused on in jquery

2639035
children	parent
a good thing with qt is that you can use the parent-children mechanism so that the children will be deleted when the parent is deleted

2639035
children	parent
as i never delete the parent view i need to handle this myself as the children might need to be deleted from different times when the view is shown

2639042
multiplying	multiplication
another very useful property of those matrices is that if you have two coordinate frames linked and defined by some rotation and translation if you multiplying the two matrices together then you just need to multiplying your transformation target by the product of that multiplication

2639077
free	malloc
since you assigned some malloc storage to it there needs to be a corresponding free

2639150
mdpi	hdpi
the way to solve this is to use the mdpi hdpi and so forth folders

2639150
screens	mdpi
so to finally answer your specific question if you have an image placed in your mdpi folder it will be exactly the same size regardless of the screens resolution as long as they are all the same density

2639150
mdpi	hdpi
in that case android won t look in your mdpi folder for the image - it will go to the hdpi folder and if it can t find it there it will take the default drawable folder

2639223
integer	unsigned
when you take the absolute value the result you get is 1 whereas the actual difference between the two numbers is 0xffffffff interpreted as an unsigned integer uint_max

2639223
integer	unsigned
the difference between two signed integers is always representable as an unsigned integer

2639223
integer	unsigned
to get this value with 2s complement hardware you just subtract the smaller input from the larger and interpret the result as an unsigned integer

2639230
int	double
here we want a pointer rather than an int or a double changed so we pass a reference to a pointer

2639245
pascal	delphi
both delphi and the latest free pascal versions implement widestrings as bstr - a string data type that is used by com

2639245
pascal	delphi
widestrings are allocated and freed by windows not by delphi or free pascal memory manager

2639245
pascal	delphi
delphi and free pascal seems to return the string-type result differently

2639324
boost	stl
is there anything in boost to extract meaningful messages out of the fstream s implementation cross platform and cross stl implementation

2639346
innodb	myisam
if you definitely want to use the inbuilt mysql full-text search you could cut down the myisam table so that it just contains the text data you want to search and the primary key - and then retrieve the proper data from the normal innodb tables once you know the pkey

getter	setter
based on the context of how this array is created in used you may want to consider using an array of a wrapper class where your setter accepts a float and getter returns an int

2639870
rss	feed
you could use the magpie library which converts rss feed into arrays making it easy to foreach the data and then just wrap it up with whatever html you want

2639872
rss	feed
well its not clear to me if youre looking for a library to ease the parsing and conversion of the rss to html out put or if youre looking for a standalone module you can just throw a number of feed at and let it do all the conversion output internally

2639875
gif	png
you ll need to stick to png or gif

2639884

some of the code will work and then you can type the errors into google or if you get stuck post specific questions to so

2640199
tostring	string.format
string.format calls tostring on arguments internally so no benefit there

2640225

gdi	direct2d
comparing direct2d and gdi

2640564

nsstring	nsobject
is there a way to fetch the current reference count for an nsobject nsstring

2640600
hash	salt
in terms of cryptographic hash and the choice to use a salt or not you may be interested in reading don t hash secrets

2640600

in my experience inherited works with uibinder as long as your subclassing ui.xml file defines all the ui field of its superclass

2641035
inherited	properties
if you want to control the width in the containing template you can use an inherited attached properties

2641056
rss	feed
assuming you are constructing the link by parsing an rss feed i would open a new window and display the news item within an iframe on your site

2641056
rss	feed
if the rss feed looks like this for example

rss	feed
it displays an outer frame of your website with a link somewhere to return and in the center displays the url from the rss feed which was passed as a parameter

2641065
versioning	upgrade
if you always have the latest versioning you are exposing yourself to being hit by productivity consuming errors security updates are a different category to feature updates but still if you are running desktop software you can isolate your security exposure and decide your own reasons to upgrade

2641132
button	checkbox
added what i would like to do here is trigger an ajax call whenever the user clicks a toggle button checkbox but to improve responsiveness i want to toggle the button state immediately and only untoggle it if the ajax call fails

firefox google-chrome safari all have prioritized faster javascript execution in recent versions whereas ie may show performance in ie9 i hope they do myself. also realize this slideshow will run slow in mobile devices etc

2641219
accessor	properties
the easiest way i can think of would be to type marcy as dynamic instead of object and just call the accessor which if i remember correctly is actually represented as a properties on the .net side

2641233
concurrenthashmap	blockingqueue
if you re concerned about performance then i actually think it might be better if you use the blockingqueue or a concurrenthashmap

2641250
superclass	subclassing
you can map this with annotations and or xml mappings and have a single list hibernate supports polymorphic queries you can query on the accessory superclass and get a list of subclassing

2641264
implements	extends
all you need to do is extends the class implements onupdate and then call run to start the animation

2641282
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
i would write the long to a bytearrayoutputstream wrapped in a dataoutputstream and then retrieve the raw bytes although this will always give you your data in big endian byte order most significant byte first

2641316
integer	unsigned
imagine we have a 4 bit unsigned integer

2641339
webclient	httpwebrequest
when i did this i did it using httpwebrequest however per you can subclass webclient and override the getwebrequest method to make it support cookies

2641339
webclient	httpwebrequest
edit elaboration requested i can only elaborate how to do it using httpwebrequest i have not done it using webclient

2641358
webclient	webrequest
you have some basic support and gotta admit that at least the api is designed that is really hard to do stupid stuff it forces you to use async programming so no more one-thread-per-client non-sense but i d bet you ll miss the .net sugar utilities webrequest webclient etc

2641379
maven	pom.xml
the pom.xml is still set to war but after cleaning the project i am now getting classnotfoundexceptions for libraries that are being included as maven dependencies

you should also check for eof as well as newline - and that requires an int not a chars to hold the value from getchar

2641462
drawstring	drawrectangle
the .net graphics methods for this drawrectangle and drawstring can have the drawing coordinates specified in floating point

2641477
maven	m2e
can you also confirm that you have the maven wtp integration for wtp installed this is improbable but maybe you installed the latest version of m2e without this extra and somehow things were working until you updated the project configuration

2641478
portrait	landscape
the user will spend most of their time immersed in fullscreen content in both portrait and landscape

2641501
inherited	properties
or it can also be compared to a properties getter which by design executes some code in order to return a value while yet having the interface form that comes across more like a variable but also has polymorphic behavior that can be swapped out whether by inherited or by swapping out the function pointer that would evaluate and return a value at runtime based on compile-time or environmental characteristics

2641517
children	parent
in other words a two-level hierarchy where the first child is on the same line as the parent but subsequent children on lines following distinguished from being a parent by a two-space prefix t above represents a literal tab in the text

2641580

2641881
free	malloc
not embedding malloc or free inside will also help avoid memory leaks

2641899
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
consequently a function should not free any of its parameters and should only free objects that it itself allocates with malloc calloc

folder	directory
if i have a directory with files and folder with files and folder in them and so on is there any way to delete all the files and folder without all the strenuous command typing

2642165
super	implements
i m not super duper concerned with this particular implementation it probably has bugs -- i m going to spend some time looking at shared_ptr s innards before using something like this in production code -- i m just concerned if in general there is a specific reason reusable reference counting goodies always seem to be implements using inheritance rather than composition

2642169
folder	directory
would remove everything folder files in the current directory

2642170
versioning	upgrade

hide	show
in order to use this feature you have to activate tex-fold-mode which will activate the auto-reveal feature and the necessary commands to hide and show macros and environments

2642244
hide	show
once the mode is active there are several commands available to hide and show macros environments and comments.

2642251
email	dkim
having spf and dkim in place will certainly help matters and will help build reputation over time but if email sent from your domain ip did or do get classified as users by junk or you do other things that seem fishy to the providers like sending too many email to their domain per unit time no amount of effort on your end can overcome that

2642263
int	boolean
not really an answer but i think your code would be simpler if you used a boolean instead of an int something like

2642265

a popular mechanism is to at purchase ask for the user s name and then give him a license key that s derived from a cryptographic hash md5 sum of the user s name or some variation on it

2642375

hash	salt
so how can i hash passwords with some salt in postgresql

2647173
pbkdf2	hash
an application should hash its passwords using key derivation function like bcrypt or pbkdf2

2647173
hash	md5
keep in mind sha0 sha1 md4 and md5 are very broken and should never be used for password hash

2647173
hash	salt
this salt should be protected because the hash cannot be broken until the salt is recovered

2647173
hash	salt
if you are storing the salt in the database then it can be obtained along with the password hash using sql injection

2647195
children	parent
this query will return all parent with or withour children and return nulls in the columns for those parent that do not have any children

typedef	struct
using the typedef keyword you can add a name for the variable to the type namespace so that you do not have to use the struct keyword in your declarations

2647817
typedef	struct
the example you gave combined the typedef declaration with the struct definition but used different names for the struct in the type namespace and the struct namespace

2647817
typedef	typename
first prefixing a statement which looks exactly like a variable declaration with typedef defines a typename instead of a variable with the name specified

2647817
typedef	struct
defining a struct or class or union or enum automatically adds the name you used if any to the namespace which typedef adds names to

2647817

if you re looking for some direction on architecture and best practices i d highly recommend checking out a popular php framework like codeigniter or kohana

2648272
for-loop	loops
if you wanted to loops over specifically using a for-loop and output the corresponding message you could do

2648311
std	ostream	ostream	istream
also in the header you should write std istream instead of just istream same for ostream etc

2648346
sorting	filtering
the easiest way to do this while still preserving most of the functionality of a date field including sorting and filtering is by using an integer in the format of yyyymmdd

getter	setter
of course this only applies to languages where getter setter are the norm but is not directed at any specific language

2648540
fullcalendar	datejs
if my main plugin detects that any of the plugins datejs ui datepicker or fullcalendar are loaded then it would load a simple wrapper extension for it that would provide the required parse and format functions

2648549
getter	setter	mutators	setter	mutators	getter
if you didn t use them both the accessor and mutators getter and setter would have the same name

boost	stl
it seems to me that being familiar with the stl and boost leads to use of dependency injection quite a bit

2648607
prepare	execute
and the prepare statement is execute -- working on those data

2648621
implements	extends
you will need to implements your own class that extends abstractstatushandler

2648662
serializable	deserialization
the problem apparently is that you ve serializable a class of type a and try to deserialize it or cast it after deserialization to type b a different type

2648670
getter	setter
the automatic grouping of getter and setter when all functions are listed in their alphabetical order greatly helps to distinguish between simple data access and advanced functinality

2648720
jar	war
actually a war web application archive file is a jar file

2648720
jar	.war
every servlet container accept jar packed application with .war extension

i can easily calculate the width of the squares in the grid by ie 100 n but i am having issues calculating the height

2648733
width	height
how can i make the squares in my grid be square versus rectangular when the height and width constraints of my grid are dynamic and not square

2648745
fgets	fread
you could use fgets fread etc

2648771
google-chrome	firefox
i m almost certain that this is an html 5 feature it s supported on google-chrome and firefox 3.5 and was wondering if somebody knew how is the browser feature called

2648775
put	get
i put matlab to work code below and found when either a or b is negative you get zero

2648775
range	min
otherwise you get b so the answer is b min a b if a and b are positive though strictly speaking the answer should be none of the above because there are no range restrictions on either variable

2648781
put	get
file will get the contents of a file and put it into an array

2648818
post	get
to get all post that belongs to a single user you can add this line to the user s model

2648853
folder	directory
i m aware of the kb article regarding this error in streets tips but mappoint 2010 runs fine on its own and as i said the app runs fine from within vs or when run from a non-protected folder if i do an x-copy of the files to my user s directory it runs fine

2648854
ilist	icollection
earlier i was having a similar problem where i was trying to implicitly cast inventory from an ilist to an icollection

2648861
hide	show
i understand that the technique tends to be show all rows filter the set show hide that filtered set

2648887
ienumerable	ilist
and even then it only works with ienumerable and not ilist

2648917
inherited	properties
in the first approach when you instantiate your next view controller you could set an array properties to inherited from the current soon-to-be previous or parent view controller

2648917
inherited	properties
with this approach if you rearrange your view controllers or insert new view controllers into your vc hierarchy you wouldn t need to debug child view controller properties inherited from parent view controllers because a reference is always available from the app delegate

2648920
width	height
you can animate width and height of an invisible clear object very easily

2648932
children	parent
each tag can have children parent but only the children are saved

2648935
submit	submission
i d like to do this so submission the form automatically closes the lights out messagebox rather than app users seeing what happens in the iframe after they submit the form

2648939
for-loop	loops
if you want to loops through you d have to use each or a for-loop

2648974
post	get
however a datatype of script will turn a cross-domain post into a get as per the documentation

2648987
passenger	unicorn
by decoupling that it lets the myriad ruby frameworks rails sinatra ramaze etc target a single interface and the myriad app servers mongrel apache with passenger unicorn etc do the same

2649051
ssl	https
ftps ftp over ssl tls - it s equivalent of https which in simple terms means it s encrypted version of the ordinary ftp protocol

2649054
children	parent
usually an element can only have one parent but multiple children - ie it s a foreignkey from child to parent

2649054
children	parent
the way you have it each element can have multiple parent and multiple children so i don t see how a hierarchical relationship is possible

2649056
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
i m curious as to the procedure for writing browser plugins for browsers like google-chrome safari and opera

2649096
getter	setter
what are setter and getter

2649096
getter	setter
what is the point of a setter and getter

2649102
client-side	server-side
alternately if the json serializer on the server supports a replacer parameter as crockford s and ecmascript 5th edition s do you could supply a replacer that formatted the date into a string server-side and handle it there since you said you don t want to parse the date client-side although the jquery tag suggested to me maybe you did

2649114
getter	setter
a getter setter is used to hide a private field from the publicity you can avoid direct access to a field

2649117
getter	setter
getter setter separate interface getter setter functions from implementation how the data is actually stored

2649124
jboss	weblogic
your configuration may be different because you are using weblogic rather than jboss

2649139
scheme	prolog	lisp	scheme	lisp	prolog
include one language that supports class abstractions like java or c++ one that supports functional abstraction like lisp or ml one that supports syntactic abstraction like lisp one that supports declarative specifications like prolog or c++ templates one that supports coroutines like icon or scheme and one that supports parallelism like sisal

2649143
getter	setter
getter and setter allow you to control how data members of an object can be accessed or changed

2649163
maya	blender
works with blender but collada support is coming so that should open it up to xsi maya and max

2649170
pdcurses	ncurses
i d recommend looking at pdcurses which is a windows-compatible replacement of ncurses

2649189
width	height
the font sizes are adjusted so that the height is scaled down for longer lines of text such that each line has equal width

2649205
webclient	webrequest
you may consider using webrequest webclient classes

2649267
vsts	tfs
most of the other main features of vsts relate to tfs and team explorer which i believe are independent of projects solutions

2649302
lemmatization	stemming
i am guessing stemming lemmatization would help as well

2649322
bufferedreader	ioexception
i am trying to ensure that a file i have open with bufferedreader is closed when i catch an ioexception but it appears as if my bufferedreader object is out of scope in the catch block

2649324
int	chars
why could not you just use 1 byte int value to store ascii chars

2649324
int	chars
if you call printf you apecify the datatype in the call so you could say to printf that the int represents ascii chars

2649333
put	get
when does the 5 get transferred into aglobal by the loader and how does it know to put 5 in aglobal

2649338
put	get
it doesn t seem to matter what i put in the command string the commands all work manually but get permission denied errors when executed via system

2649347
getter	setter
public accessors getter and setter make sometimes sense

2649370
stdout	fflush
or you can use fflush to fflush the stdout

2649407
many-to-many	one-to-many
tags and posts are a many-to-many association not one-to-many

2649420
apache	nginx
i have been following these instructions for setting up a django production server with postgres apache nginx and memcache

2649443
int	chars
there is was no 1-byte int type other than chars and signed and unsigned variants thereof

2649479
pull	push
then i just push pull to the appropriate remote it s a bit messy but it works

2649482
int	chars
the chars type can be though of as just another numerical type just like int short and long

2649482
unsigned	short
char is just the numeric type that holds a single singed unsigned byte the same as short is the numeric type that holds a signed 16 bit word

2649482
int	chars
1 byte int chars

2649483
int	chars
the chars type is a one byte int in c actually not quite true- it s an integral type large enough to hold any chars from the basic chars set but its size is implementation dependent. note that you can have both signed chars and unsigned chars something that doesn t make a lot of sense if you re talking about a data type that only holds chars

2649483
int	chars
but the one byte int is called chars in c because that s the most common use for it again see disclaimer above.

2649492
do-while	break
this is called an unlabeled break statement and its purpose is to terminate while for and do-while loops

2649503
put	get
another way that i ve used in the past to get a few people to beta test my apps is have them put the apk file on the phone s sd card

2649512
post	put
basically it says a single request does not support transactions and it doesn t make sense to support them since only one entity and cud operation is involved in a single post put delete request

2649512
post	put
using batch requests a whole bundle of post put delete requests being sent in one step from client to the server

2649523
int	chars
in c chars is an 1 byte int and that is also used to store a chars

2649523
int	chars
a chars is just a 1 byte int in c

2649536
daemons	systemd
this is a good case for using a database especially if you can architect the systemd such that there is a data collection daemons that manages the continuous communication with the embedded device

2649579
for-loop	loops
before this block of code is a for-loop that goes through each message in the box and after it is loops that just goes through parts for each imap structure

2649598
hide	show
obviously the show hide is targeting the id selector but i can t help but wonder about that period in the control s name

2649627
integer	unsigned
otherwise if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned integer

2649627
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand

2649627
integer	unsigned
then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

2649627
integer	unsigned
if the type of the operand with signed integer type can represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned

2649627
integer	unsigned
integer type then the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the operand with signed integer type

2649627
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed

2649627
integer	unsigned
for the bolded rule to be applied it would seem to imply you need to have have an unsigned integer type who s rank is less than the signed integer type and the signed integer type cannot hold all the values of the unsigned integer type

2649631
hibernate	gilead
i am using gwt for the ui and hibernate with gilead to connect to a mysql database backend

2649634
folder	directory
i was able to find dxerr.h in the folder and the path is also being included in the vc++ directory tab in the options window

2649664
min	max
a ui box that displays random number between min and max value for 2 seconds then shows blank for 2 seconds then shows another random numer for 2 seconds then shows blank for 10 seonds and then repeats the cycle infitely until form closed

2649735
g++	gcc
under gcc g++ i have compiled a static .a call it some_static_lib.a library

2649766
activemq	rabbitmq
if you have tons and tons of data and you need aggregate tables you should look into offloading statistics collection and perhaps the database queries themselves to a queue like rabbitmq or activemq

2649771
lxml	beautifulsoup
use a html parser such as lxml or beautifulsoup

2649791
multiplying	add
strength reduction add instead of multiplying

2649803
int	chars
in this case i m using a chars and int but if i use long and long long int c99 then i get similar behaviour

2649830
serializable	deserialization
if anyone can look into this for me as i ve no experience with serializable or deserialization i d be very grateful

2649843
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
the total space that an element takes up is the height width + padding + border + margin

2649876
int	chars	unsigned	short
however let me observe that if what you want to use is an unsigned 8 bit int just use s uint8_t already and its 16 32 64bit companions and keep away from all the chars s short s and int s in this world

2649895
post	put
i will post code if somebody could narrow down what code to put

2649917
post	get
when you know that just use c# to post the same values and you ll get the same sheet back

2649931
jar	war
you can deploy a jar file into a war file or you can deploy a jar file into the classpath of the server or still yet you can deploy a jar file into lib folders of most servers

2649935
adam	adlds
if all you re trying to achieve is some quick and easy connectivity to an ad adam adlds instance for relatively simple operations it might be worth sticking with that namespace - otherwise i would strongly recommend you invest the time to learn the protocols namespace

2649940
swt	swing	cpython	ironpython
two more options somewhat more out of the box would include leaving cpython behind and leveraging ironpython which runs on the .net runtime and hence has access to windows.forms or to be really obtuse gtk# via mono and jython which runs on the jvm and can leverage either the quite messy swing which has some native windows widget support or swt which supports native windows widgets

2649945
int	chars	int	double
simple types bool byte chars short int long float and double

2649957
wxpython	pyqt
yes you can use pyqt or pyside another qt binding or wxpython

2649966
linefeed	delimiter
i m guessing that to fix this i need to write some other line-delimiting character into the end of the stream instead of cr linefeed that the mainframe will recognize as a record delimiter

2649999
linefeed	delimiter
i actually had the exact same problem and i fixed it by using just linefeed as the delimiter

2650021
folder	directory
the actual implementation of auth is actually kept in the kohana_auth class which is located in the kohana folder which part of the module directory structure

2650021
folder	directory
to extend the auth module add your own functionality you simply place an auth.php file in the classes folder of your application directory

2650041
zlib	libpng
i have installed the gnuwin32 set of utilities including libpng and zlib

2650073
pycrypto	crypto++
i see that supports both c++ and python but would using crypto++ and pycrypto be simpler for a newbie that just wants to get something up and running for the time being

2650073
crypto++	keyczar
or should i use keyczar for python and crypto++ for the c++ end

2650092
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
browsers like netscape-based browsers google-chrome safari and opera uses npapi plugin system you can learn how to write npapi plugins in and

folder	directory
i m trying to use the directory_map source directory false function to scan through user uploaded folder files

2650134
accessor	properties
this way the properties s accessor which you create with synthesize will handle calling retain for you

2650157
spaces	delimiter
the only work around i could see and this is kind of sketchy is if the username were to be typed as a single entry with a string first last delimiter by a spaces in place of the username

2650197
ant	maven
another alternative to ant is a product called maven

2650197
ant	maven
both ant and maven do the same thing but in quite different ways

2650197
ant	maven
lookup ant and maven for more details

2650247
dlsym	dlopen
but also write some initialization that calls dlopen on the original library and dlsym to get the function pointer to the original oldfunc

2650253
dlsym	dlopen
from there you want to look at the dlopen and dlsym calls to get at the actual functions in the original library

2650305

jboss	geronimo	jboss	glassfish	jboss	jonas	glassfish	geronimo	geronimo	jonas
if you re looking for a java ee server you basically have two options glassfish or jboss geronimo or jonas just have too small communities and i m not aware of serious references for them - which doesn t mean there aren t any - i wouldn t pick them

2650377
width	height
you may also want to control width and height use a different profile from the default one etc -- the command-line arguments let you do all that

2650394
post	get
if youre still having problems post back here and well help you get through it

2650415
cvs	svn
project-wise it would be best to store these changes in separate folders as in a svn or cvs repository

2650423
jar	war
packaging into jar war ejb-jar ear

2650423
ant	maven
so as you can see compiling is only a small part of the build and the best practice is to fully automate all the steps with tools like maven or ant and to run the build continuously which is known as continuous integration

2650458
getter	setter
i have a simple boolean object with a getter and a setter

2650474
post	put
i put my servers ip address in and used port 3306 whihch post should be used

2650506
hide	show
simply put the view should concern itself with the ui details show hide enable disable ui elements and leave all business logic processing to the controller

2650525
uiview	subviews
note tableview2 is actually a subviews of the parent uiview as opposed to the parent being a uitableview

2650574
innodb	myisam
then you ll have to change your storage engine for innodb myisam tables do not support transactions technically you won t get an error but a rollback won t rollback anything

visible programs can even be controlled by java.awt.robot keyboard mouse

2650749
integer	unsigned
method calcular paquete as cantidaddebytes as integer as unsigned small integer

2650760
children	parent
if you want all the children of the parent container to set their own opacity regardless of the parent you can just set the alpha channel of the parent panel s background instead of setting opacity to get a slightly transparent background without impacting the child elements

2650760
children	parent
however if you want all the children except one to adhere to the parent s opacity that is a little more complicated

2650778
pull	push
you need to run bzr rm --keep in all locations manually before updating them with pull push

2650820
strcpy	strtok
allocates exactly one char for storage into which you are then copying more than one - strcpy needs to put at a bare minimum the null terminator but in your case also the results of your strtok as well

2650820
free	malloc
the reason it may work on a different system is that some implementations of malloc will allocate at a certain resolution a multiple of 16 bytes no matter what actual value you ask for so you may have some free space there at the end of your buffer

2650837
post	get
using tokens in conjunction with the post redirect get design pattern seems to be the best available solution

2650852
solaris	bsd
solaris linux bsd

2650852

on solaris and bsd you can consider using dtrace as a general application monitoring tool

2650885
ppm	pbm	ppm	pgm	pbm	pgm
emacs has built in support for xbm and pbm pgm ppm images

2650885
gif	png	tiff	png
emacs is compiled to recognize jpeg png gif and tiff images also but displaying these image types require external dlls which are not bundled with emacs

2650885
gif	png	tiff	png
those dlls for the various image formats are as far as i know - xpm xpm4.dll png libpng13.dll zlib1.dll jpeg jpeg62.dll tiff libtiff3.dll and gif giflib4.dll

2650913
button	checkbox
i was wondering if there is a way to be able to get the flexibility of a checkbox check uncheck in addition to disabling or enabling the other checkbox when one of them is checked or unchecked instead of using three radio button

2650913
button	checkbox
using a checkbox as radio button was just a thought

2650933
free	malloc
besides klatchko s correct point that the standard does not provide for it real malloc free implementations often allocate more space then you ask for

2650945
button	checkbox
you should not use checkbox as radio button or vice-versa this is inconsistent with the user s mental model so it confuses people

2650958
post	put	post	get	put	get
or you can structure your controller tests so that the code in my_method is exercised as part of a controller action that can be called by one of the standard http verbs get post put delete

2650958
post	get
ultimately it has to be possible to reach any code that your controller uses by setting up tests with get post etc because otherwise rails couldn t do it and your app wouldn t work

2650970
gif	png
i did the same thing for jpeg62.dll and giflib4.dll and now my emacs supports jpg gif and png files

2651057
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
if you re planning to upgrade anyway this might be a good opportunity to simply back up your data uninstall your current tfs and install the 2010 versioning -- the upgrade scenario is delightfully simple

2651057
versioning	upgrade
you can perform an in-place upgrade by doing an upgrade on the same hardware that was running the earlier versioning of team foundation server

2651057
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
when you use this path you must uninstall the previous versioning of team foundation server install team foundation server 2010 and then run the upgrade wizard

2651066
cos	sin
but with a flipping of cos and sin i was able to get it to work

2651091
post	get
if i change the get to a post everything works fine

2651137
public	protected
so can i consider a protected internal member as a public member in the same assembly

2651137
public	protected
see i am able to access protected internal in a non deriving class...so its working as public in same assembly..what do you say

2651141
width	height
assuming furthermore that a pixel is relative to mm equally in length as in width that means monitor is 1080 1920 th times as height as it is with

2651141
width	height
and since w and h are known from the resolution setting you can now calculate the screen s width and height in inches cm mm as well

2651246
folder	directory
be sure to unzip in the root folder so it creates the directory structure correctly and replaces the deployment manifest .application in the root folder that points to the right version

the container environment is centos linux system

2651264
maven	m2e
that way of adding dependencies is better managed by maven with m2e

2651288
disk	ram
since it s mainly an in-memory store you will need enough physical ram to store 90 2gb but not all of this needs to be in one vm or one machine obviously. coherence also has persistence configuration to save and load cache data from disk but i am not sure of the file format probably some coherence-specific thing

2651297
x86	64bit
a typical use cases in the x86 world is the translation of 16bit real mode code to 32 or 64bit protected mode code to not to be forced to emulate a cpu in real mode

2651334
post	put
a side question how did you manage to put the contents of the terminal into your post without making screenshots

2651384
google-chrome	safari
you could tr to target webkit broswers only in your css to separate the behaviours of ie and google-chrome safari ius a webkit browser too

2651384
google-chrome	safari
then use setup the properties that work for ie in the ie css and the properties that work for google-chrome safari in the normal css

2651384
google-chrome	firefox
note that even between firefox and google-chrome there are a few differences in how they interpret css

2651419
onclick	onsubmit
i ve tried adding onclick alerts to the submitt button and onsubmit alerts to the form elements and i can verify that the submit button is being triggered and that the form does get submitted

2651445

an important note is that jsonp works only with get methods and not post

2651830
qscrollarea	qframe
qframe qscrollarea etc

2651832
vim	emacs
if bandwidth is too narrow or you don t manage the linux box you could access via ssh or telnet and work in console mode with emacs vim gdb and all that stuff

2651836
temp	tmp
for the directory itself you can either get the dirname of the filename generated by the above functions or in windows you can get the environmental variable temp and on unix-likes you can either get the variable tmpdir or use tmp if tmpdir is not set

2651849
webrat	cucumber
update unless i m mistaken capybara has more or less superseded webrat and generally the there s an opinion that cucumber level tests should exercise the actual user interface and not the api that interface interacts with

2651889
bazaar	git
winmerge version 2.12.4 already includes a filter but at least in my installation the filters for subversion git and bazaar were commented out

2651903
button	checkbox
styling checkbox and radio button with css and javascript

2652033
folder	directory
that way the tests are obtained when the code for the project is checked out and you don t have the test projects folder polluting the directory structure at the project level

2652054
put	get
the most likely candidate would probably a combination of locate to find the position of the and then a pair of substr calls to get the portions before and after then using concat to put them back together

2652056
unix	bsd
for unix linux bsd variants you have codesourcery s free toolchains and the gcc toolchain from gnuarm.com

2652082
apache	nginx
in this particular project we re using django and nginx or apache

2652083
implements	extends
in c# i think dictionary extends or at least implements a collection

2652118
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
this is not a problem for addition and multiplication but it would be a problem for subtraction and division for example

2652139
telerik	radwindow
i have two user controls that contain the telerik radwindow

2652238
filesystems	fat
there s a limit on 512 entries in the root directory of fat filesystems

2652238
filesystems	fat
this limit comes about because the root directory lives in a particular place on fat filesystems

2652259
min	max
then you can left join on this and convert to dates based on number of days between min and max

2652535
addition	multiplication
in addition your computations might be cheaper since you apply your algorithm for fewer digits depending on how expensive multiplication is in base 3

2652547
division	multiplication
it s just as fast as going the opposite direction if not faster given that division generally takes longer than multiplication

2652588
division	multiplication
even simpler and probably even faster because multiplication is faster than division is dav s answer which is the most natural algorithm.

2652597
ssl	https
upload the file using ssl tls with https or a socket + sslstream and let the server require the client to present an x.509 client certificate

width	height
also add height and width of your image

2652667
websphere	ibm
i m pretty new to websphere application development and i m missing the source attachment for all the classes in the packages in my ibm rational application developer setup

2652719

now there s two months between those dates but generally adacore seems to and understandably upgrade their pro versioning before migrating the upgrade into their gpl versioning

2652758
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
it can use the getelementbyid and getelementsbytagname methods to quickly get elements for a specific id and for a specific tag name

2652882
google-chrome	firefox
that s a standard html5 feature only supported by google-chrome 4+ and firefox 3.6+ so far

2652898
mvp	presenter
actually my scenario has mvp pattern.now most of the interaction between presenter and view in most forms is the same - user clicks add a new row is added with some default values for the entity to show in the grid n some other common stuff

2653088
hash	md5
this example simple takes a hash of the filename in this case md5 just because you re probably familiar with it

2653088
hash	md5
the sscanf just gets the first character of the hash and turns it into a number between 0 and 15 since md5 returns a hexadecimal number

2653137
gridview	rowdatabound
what i m trying to do is handling a sort of rowadded or rowdatabound like in aspx gridview event

2653139
uiview	subviews	uiview	uiwindow
but when i put removefromsuperview after animation block the animation never shows because removefromsuperview removes the uiview from uiwindow before the animation plays - how can i delay removefromsuperview so the animation plays first and then subviews is removed

2653175
yslow	pagespeed
pagespeed and yslow run in the browser and do not only measure loading of one url but also of all resources linked on that url in addition to import and url directives in css files and javascript resources lazy loaded while the dom is loading

2653184
rss	feed
this can happen in quite a few circumstances for example when calling url site with set or when using request redirect or when generating an rss feed using the feed helper

2653208
mouse	keyboard
but a view essentially has mouse and keyboard events as input and drawn pixels as output

2653236
teamsite	interwoven
i see in the book the definitive guide to interwoven teamsite mention of objects for the interwoven livesite product

2653236
teamsite	interwoven
as it stands now from my limited understanding it appears that the least path of resistance is deploying interwoven s livesite with the existing teamsite implementation so content can be both consumed and rendered via rss .

2653236
teamsite	interwoven
so the question is does anyone out there have experience with a soap or restful api approach to interwoven s teamsite

2653247
min	max
if you only want one you need to decide which one and do that in the code you could use a top 1 with an order by you could use max you could use min etc depending on what your real requirement for the data is

2653272
serializable	deserialization
system.servicemodel.web and the class is datacontractjsonserializer for json serializable and deserialization on windows phone 7 - sorry about the inaccurate reply i have corrected after a comment posted here

2653279
snmp	mib
so is it mandatory to provide mib with snmp agent

2653288
nsstring	nsdata
note hasheddata is nsdata not nsstring

2653332
mvp	presenter
unlike the presenter in mvp a viewmodel does not need a reference to a view

2653377
put	get
you should be able to get around this by updating the security policy but it s generally better to not put your libs into the tomcat container which i assume you are doing

2653388
cvs	svn
in the past i ve used the value of date -u + y m d h m s as we were using cvs not svn

2653502

i need whole text in cell to be visible so how can i limit cells width only by visible range and make it expand in height

2653555
g++	gcc
does g++ any version but gcc 4.1.2 is most interesting have any options that would

2653564
width	height
2 dimensions of your cube again vector of 3 floats describing height width and depth of cube

2653564
direct3d	directx
directx direct3d documentation has lots of info this kind of stuff if this is what are you looking for

2653582
google-chrome	firefox
you may also find it handy to use firefox or google-chrome as you can edit bits of css live this means you can very quickly see if you the differences of overflow auto or overflow scroll for example

2653590
for-loop	loops
not exactly the code so i don t really need suggestions about refactoring but my problem is this - with this code i get a compiler error for the first - variable arrayindex hides a variable in an enclosing block. as far as i can tell arrayindex is local to the first for-loop and shouldn t exist by the time we reach the second loops

2653609
remoteview	appwidgetprovider
so in your appwidgetprovider class whenever you are updating your appwidget you need to create a remoteview object build up all the view settings for your appwidget using that object and then make one call to appwidgetmanager.updateappwidget when you are done

2653639
srp	principles
make sure the gateway classes conform to srp and the other solid principles

2653668
width	height
i have some internal calculations i need to run based on the height and width of the custom control

2653668
width	height
how to i programatically determine the height and width of a given cell

2653672
datalist	repeater
if you use asp .net web forms then you can look at listview datalist and repeater controls

2653713
division	multiplication
hopefully everyone knows that division is a big time sink even compared to a multiplication

2653795
g++	gcc
i don t think such option feature exists in gcc g++

2653798
gridview	rowdatabound
you should be using the gridview s rowcreated or rowdatabound events to modify information

2653801
rss	feed
the data is going into an rss 2.0 feed using the some standard rss attributes as well as some custom defined google attributes

2653887
snmp	mib
a mib allows a snmp client to interpret the information returned by the agent by giving it a readable name rather than just the oid correctly displaying data in the desired format etc.

2653910
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this work fine in firefox and ie but in safari and google-chrome the buttons end up in the same spot causing them all to display sub menus when you hover over the first button

2653914
puts	gets
case 2 the member puts in an area city county etc. and gets a list of members in that area

2653914
post	get
search post code + radius 5miles 10miles etc and get a set of applicable post codes to then join onto the membership records in the database

2653923
webchromeclient	webviewclient
basically i m retrieving the web view from the xml and setting it a webviewclient and a webchromeclient

2653930

or you could use the isdir field if you only want files in the directory not folder

2653930
folder	directory
for a list of folder in the directory excluding

2653949
awt	swing	webkit	gecko
i d like to have gecko webkit or another webbrowser embedded in java as a swing awt control

2654021
mouseup	mousedown
is there a way to draw an inset border on mousedown and raised on mouseup

2654063
textview	imageview
all i m trying to do is open a very simple application that is supposed to do nothing but display an imageview above a textview

2654068
vpn	lan
if the file is on your lan or vpn you can use a unc path

2654103
google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie7 mode and firefox google-chrome etc

2654134
mouseup	mousedown
you can use images instead of drawing the whole close button it would be much easier to use for example imagine you have 3 states for the button mouseup mousedown pressed which must be declared as an enum and in the event handlers of your custom control just need to change the enum to mousedown mouseup or pressed

2654155
sudo	passwd
if you want to only allow people with a passwd to run a program then the secure way is to create a new user account that owns the program and have a script that uses sudo to run the program as that user - it will prompt for the users passwd in a secure way

2654168
pop-up	dialog
just wondering if i could install something like that then if an uncaught exception is thrown i could pop-up a dialog for the user and ask if they want to mail a dump of the exception to me

2654181
decoder	encoder
the commons codec library provides a base64 encoder decoder for you to use

2654192
versioning	upgrade
if you can t upgrade to the latest versioning the blog post sifr 3 and ie8 1.bottom js error has a possible fix

2654206
vim	emacs
there s always emacs or vim i lean towards vim but that s just my opinion

2654256
pop-up	dialog
pop-up a dialog for the user and ask

2654266
versioning	upgrade
apple released iphone sdk for mac os 10.6.x and i only have 10.5 and have no plans to upgrade so i wonder how can i trick for latest iphone sdk the versioning number that is 10.6

2654331
accessor	properties
and the technology you need to pass values around is an understanding of objective-c properties and in general accessor methods

2654335
width	height
it may be easier to figure out the height and width of your custom control rather than the cell of a datagrid

2654335
actualheight	actualwidth
your control should have access through framework element to the properties actualheight and actualwidth

2654335
width	height
also the sizedchanged event will be fired on your control every time the height and width change

2654335
width	height
i highly recommend placing this height and width logic inside of your control

2654353
put	get
vim might not know how to indent your filetype or you may have to download the filetype plugin and put it in the right folder i don t know where to get that plugin

2654398
stdout	stderr
so you might want to add flags to control whether you want to capture stdout stderr and stdin

2654414
ienumerable	iqueryable
i had a partial class for one of my entities from linq-to-sql with an iqueryable property but somehow returning an iqueryable from an entityset caused my later queries to behave in an ienumerable read linq-to-objects way even though they were acting on iqueryable types

2654478
pull	push
push pull etc is working as expected for existing repositories

2654517
extjs	mootools
so learn one or more of the big javascript libraries closure extjs mootools dojo jquery etc. but also learn how to do all of the same things that the library does without using them

2654526
post	get
i m trying to get various sizes post listing results 160x160 single.php 618x150 and for some reason the single.php one works but only half way

2654538
superclass	subclassing
a getclass in a superclass called from the subclassing will always return the class object from the subclassing which is good i think

2654619
hide	show
i implemented this jquery show hide code and everything works fine except that the box that i want to hide with slow javascript browsers ie 6 is hidden after the webpage has been loaded or at least all the js

2654624
put	get
i put this in a new class instead of using the hashtable get set methods direct because this leaves room for customization so the messagebox could be created in the get and more than 1 piece of information could be stored in the set to handle messagebox title buttontype content etc etc

2654640
post	get
for example a get request to mydomain.com foo 53 to get foo 53 or a post to mydomain.com foo to create a new foo

2654675
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
you ve got two options either 1 just use a zip library like sharpziplib or dotnetzip or 2 try to use the system.io.packaging namespace

2654698
ubuntu	linux
i have an application which runs on tomcat 6.0.20 server on linux ubuntu server

2654705
folder	directory
you could then either put the plugin packages directly into the root directory of that new project or because you don t want to change the file structure you could add the folder in the properties for the plugin flex library project in the source path tab under flex library build path

2654722
children	parent
scan that list pick up each node find its parent node in the same list binary search or dictionary lookup add it to the children collection of the parent node

2654760
width	height
the curvycorners.js is good choice to go with and as opposed to inline elements you can apply corners to block level elements only because they can have width and height

2654779
hash	salt
encrypt hash and salt passwords rather than storing them plain-text

2654779
ssl	https
use ssl https for login and any pages where sensitive data is entered

2654809
inherited	subclassing
the category would add to uiviewcontroller subclassing that import the category all the code necessary for presenting a modal ttmessagecontroller without requiring you to duplicate or use inherited

2654813
hide	show
the kicker is that it has to increase the colspan by one for each hide show

2654819
webrat	cucumber
define my own cucumber steps into which i use the webrat set_hidden_field method like this

2654833
apache	nginx
i now have nginx set up as reverse proxy to apache

apache	nginx
the static request that came in where directly delivered by nginx without having to go to apache

2654833
apache	nginx
now that i moved all the static content to another domain is there still a need to have nginx in front of apache

2654833
apache	nginx
are there any other benefits of having nginx and apache running for only dynamic content

2654845
execl	fork
you d have to fork a subprocess have the parent wait4pid on the child s pid while at the same time in the child calling execl on the file isthereanyapplesleft to make it run

2654846
integer	unsigned
c99 doesn t say much about this but you can check whether or you can use fixed size types like uint32_t 32 bits unsigned integer

2654860
width	height
each one was of size width height and each element corresponded to a pixel - i hope this makes sense

2654866
integer	unsigned
it defines types such as uint32_t for an unsigned integer of exactly 32-bits and uint_fast32_t for an unsigned integer of at least 32 bits and â œfastâ on the target machine by some definition of fast

2654946
ant	maven
here s a sample project ant and maven

2654960
memcpy	strcpy
as they are defined as const char i can not change them using strcpy memcpy .

2654961
put	get
i have put in the -g flags but when i try to find debugging symbols i get only

2654973
apache	nginx
nginx in front is the best solution in case you use apache 1.3 br

2654973
apache	nginx
nginx can easily serve thousands of conections but apache can t

2655023
apache	nginx
set up nginx as a reverse proxy in front of apache

2655043
nsstring	nsdata
forcing the nsdata to become nsstring

2655064
jtextfield	jlabel
for each of your elements jlabel jtextareas and jtextfield

2655095
width	height
and upon thinking about this some more why not iterate on the width height in nested loops and simplify things a bit

2655100
folder	directory
the web.config and any class files in app_code or compiled assemblies in the bin folder will not be able to be downloaded those directory are not mapped to virtual directory which people can download from

2655132
pull	push
i would like to have a mercurial repository on my website so that i can push pull as i make updates to it but i do not have ssh access only http or ftp

2655186
oncreate	ondestroy
and i assumed that ondestroy would always happen before a new instance of the activity was created so that the new instance in oncreate could load the state stored by the old instance

2655186
oncreate	ondestroy
one which was on its way to being destroyed onpause was called but was yet to enter onstop or ondestroy and one which was in oncreate

2655189
memcpy	strcpy
this may be beside the point but you can t change anything with neither strcpy nor memcpy

2655199
disk	ram
my machine is no slouch either core 2 duo 2 gb ram and plenty of disk space

2655209
put	get
but if i put it in the app code then the plugin doesn t magically figure out how to get at icandysettings even though i am using import in the plugin and export in candysettings

2655239
equals	gethashcode
does c# have the same issues like java with equals and gethashcode

2655252
equals	gethashcode
but if you mean that you have should if you don t want a compiler warning or possibly unexpected behavior in your code to override gethashcode when you override equals then yes

2655285
button	checkbox
even if it the popup panel were something like a list of checkbox it could be databound to the sortedlist i have ready to go and an ok cancel button combination to accept or ignore things

2655335
int	double
this isn t the source of your crasher but the g format code is for double not int

2655358
getter	setter
instead i d have to change bar to have an explicit backing field and write explicit getter and setter

2655358
getter	setter
it s almost as bad as having to write explicit getter and setter for each property

2655359
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
when running the app from the filesystem firefox opera safari and google-chrome all behave as expected

2655375
floating-point	integer
the result of the computation is likely something like 5.999999999994 as the floating-point result is not necessarily exactly an integer

2655381
int	chars
the c specification doesn t put any assumptions on the size of an int except that it must be greater or equal to the size of a short which must be greater or equal to the size of a chars

2655389
children	parent
do to several constraints i want to disallow selecting items that are next to each other basically you can t select multiple items with the same parent and parent are handled differently from children

2655437
children	parent
children should be sent sighup when the parent process dies - however

2655445
vmware	virtualbox
i think you need to do a few things first decide if you are talking about an emulation or a virtual machine like a vmware or virtualbox

2655597
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m using prototype.js for my web app and i have everything running on google-chrome safari and firefox

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
where eventtype might be dom loaded keypress etc. and it works just fine in google-chrome safari firefox

2655618
min	max
you can loop through the lines in the csv and use bash script variables to hold your min max amounts

2655621
bazaar	git
first subversion is a suboptimal choice for such a workflow try a distributed version control system like git bazaar etc

2655640
udp	tcp
it provides an abstract â event-driven â asynchronous api over various transports such as tcp ip and udp ip via java nio

2655708
implements	extends
since memoryindex is a completely separate component that doesn t extends or implements lucene s directory or indexreader i don t think there s a way you can plug this into hibernate search annotations

2655718
post	get
but not all jsp pages make get request some make post request via form

2655796
pop-up	dialog
assuming you re doing your development in visual studio you ll normally do that by opening the dialog right clicking inside the dialog box and clicking insert activex control... in the menu that pop-up

2655799
mouse	keyboard
can i somehow disable listview items navigation through keyboard arrow keys and leave navigation with mouse and in code

2655810
backtracking	greedy
so i tried this does two things 1 reduces backtracking because of the greedy match of all but a comma 2 allowed the regex optimizer to only use the alteration once on the first field

2655815
inherited	subclassing
setting your subclassing fetch mode to parallel affects table-per-class and vertical inherited hierarchies

2655815
inherited	subclassing
under parallel mode kodo issues separate selects for each subclassing in a table-per-class inherited hierarchy rather than unioning all subclassing tables together as in join mode

2655847
implements	modifiers
all operations in mongodb are atomic on a single document and we support nice update modifiers which make a lot of operations that would need a transaction easy to implements and fast

2655848
mouseover	mousemove
i want the arrow to move vertically in front of the corresponding menu image when you mouseover mousemove the whole #menu div

2655867
datediff	difference
datediff is from t-sql and calculating that date difference may depend on your platform

inline	inlining
you may want to consider inlining your accessors if you re going for speed using the inline keyword

2655944
hide	show
i have a console form hybrid application in c# and at the moment i have to rely on user32.dll to show hide the console window

2656016
put	get
i m not aware of any central list of articles but if you just need a large number of them rather than a complete list bearing in mind that any complete list will always be out of date anyway then you could probably put something together with wget to recursively follow links within wikipedia from the main page and store the urls you get

2656017
hide	show
so then the user fills this textctrls out and clicks the button to create the item and i basically want only to show the name and description and hide the hiddendescription but to do it so i can use it later

2656026
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
closing a sqlconnection should destroy any resources that the sqldatareader is using

2656026
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
you don t need to dispose the sqlconnection if you dispose a sqldatareader that was created with commandbehavior.closeconnection

2656041
hide	show
and here is an example of show and hide jquery

2656045
firefox	safari
the page loads fine in firefox and safari

2656058
addition	modulo
it uses the modulo but in addition it checks that a has been opened

2656059
profiler	visualvm
tools like visualvm or netbeans profiler do not even recognize that the application was ran

2656224
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works great in firefox ie 8 google-chrome and windows safari

2656231
mouseover	mouseout
so i put together a menu that appears on mouseover of the add row link and disappears on mouseout with a slight delay and fade in out using mootools event listeners

pop-up	dialog
by clicking on an item in the listview an address i start an intent to google maps for directions and the choice dialog pop-up for google maps web browser etc

2656266
udp	tcp
can clients using http 1.0 or older use udp sockets instead of tcp sockets

2656275
textview	imageview
inside this relativelayout you would have a textview for the string an imageview for the image and another textview for the integer

2656438
google-chrome	firefox
note both firefox and google-chrome will default most plugins to click-to-play soon with google-chrome planning to phase out npapi entirely

2656443
hide	show
i have a macro that hide or show columns based on the value in one cell

2656537
google-chrome	firefox
to invoke an alias of document.getelementbyid in firefox and google-chrome you should be doing it as follows

2656554
pop-up	dialog
the pop-up is a dialog type of theme and has flag_not_focusable and flag_not_touchable - basically it s an informational window that goes away after x seconds and is not meant to interfere or take focus over anything else

2656558
uniq	grep
i d prefer using sort uniq to something like a for-loop with grep inside but i m not sure how to do it pipes

2656592
x86	mips
a better bet might be to install spim and to learn mips assembly which is more straightforward than x86 anyways

2656615
post	get
so how can i get the response from ajax success and post to the other function

2656666
post	put
you can overwrite post http code to put or any other which you like

thus c perl python ruby and tcl are born

2656680
haskell	scheme	lua	scheme
thus haskell lua ml pascal scala and scheme are born

2656692
notepad++	scite
just so you know i use scite or notepad++ but both do not convert correctly

2656693
perl	tcl
it was originally written to support python tcl and perl but has been expanded to support ruby as well

2656834
iprincipal	iidentity
population of the iprincipal and iidentity for the current user

2656847
jstl	taglib
however that may not be the underlying cause since i had that same error when using jetty-maven-plugin and jstl taglib header in my jsp

2656847
jstl	taglib
and only javax.servlet jstl 1.2 is listed in my pom s dependencies since it now obsoletes taglib standard 1.1.2 which was a suggestion given above

2656888
submit	submission
if your page requires javascript to be enabled for them to submit the form then you could do an synchronous xmlhttprequest call before the form submission

2656896
hash	salt
if not build your own but if you do make sure you store an encrypted salt hash of your passwords and do a proper encrypted cookie please

2656901
folder	directory
i would need to know if there is a folder inside the c windows directory without knowing if there is any directory is in there

2656912
erlang	ocaml
pick a totally random language from ruby python erlang scala ocaml etc and work your way through solving each problem posited on the site

2656916
width	height
here s an alternative way to swap the width and height

2656927
rundll32	shell32.dll
my first thought was to use rundll32 to call shell32.dll s shellexecute but it look like it needs parameters that i can t type from the commandline such as a reference to the parent window

2656943
for-loop	arrays
the levels are made up of an arrays of tiles and i use a for-loop to go through each one i know it may not be the best way to do it and i may need help with that too

2656963
rss	feed
im using drupal 6.x and created an rss feed of the recent images using the views module

2656963
rss	feed
i have a feeling an rss feed might not be the best way to go about this but it s all i could come up with

2656994
set	bag
i couldn t find out the source of this problem but the fix is to avoid using set and use bag or something else i only tested it with bag instead

2657002
for-loop	loops
you will notice that if you look at the function signature for for and apply they have one critical difference a for-loop evaluates an expression while an apply loops evaluates a function

2657022
twig	smarty
there are a pretty bunch of templating engines you could use there s smarty there s twig and a lot of others

2657022
codeigniter	cakephp
you could also use a full-featured framework like zend symfony cakephp codeigniter etc

2657045
int	double
then using a double map one treemap mapping int float the other mapping float int

2657051
mvp	presenter
this particular book uses the mvp model view presenter design pattern and i know that andrew is currently working on another book that leverages the mvc model view controller design pattern

2657066

webclient	webrequest
ever since upgrading to visual studio 2010 i m running into an issue where the first web request of any type webrequest webclient etc. hangs for about 20 seconds before completing

2657129
put	get
the best way to get a handle on the .bindings file is to sort it which will put all the objects and their attributes together and make it more human-readable

2657148
stdout	stderr
syntax errors will output to stderr not stdout

2657178
ostringstream	std
i then realized that the c string i am getting from the function is destroyed when the function returns because std ostringstream is allocated on the stack

2657178
ostringstream	std
i later noticed that out of type std ostringstream was allocated with static storage

2657183
free	strdup
strdup allocates a copy of the string on the heap which you have to free manually later with free i think

2657189
128bit	64bit
in theory this should compile to just two move instructions because the vget_high and vget_low just reinterpret the 128bit q registers as two 64bit d registers

2657197
ostringstream	std
the static local variable std ostringstream out makes no sense in this case unless the std string being returned was also static which your observation is showing to be not true

2657236
boost	stl
one option you could use the boost serialization library has a capability of serializing stl vectors

2657242
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
i tried the same code on safari firefox and opera they are worked correctly

2657268
interpreted-language	compiled-language
after reading some material on this subject i m still not sure what the difference between a compiled-language and an interpreted-language is

2657276
interpreted-language	compiled-language
another way of putting it is that interpreted-language are code is translated to machine instructions step-by-step while the program is being executed while compiled-language have code has been translated before program execution

2657313
next	except
using 5 ws where 1ws does not know about the others except the next one is a business requirement

2657328
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
for addition multiplication and subtraction there s a fairly good explanation including the carry bits in the calculation and then throwing them away is far easier than figuring out the carry bits if they were thrown away originally

2657371
lisp	scheme
like other lisp but not scheme emacs lisp has separate namespaces for variables and functions it is a â lisp 2 â not a â lisp 1 â

2657388
width	height
it will work as long as the width or height of the signature control is not greater than 256

2657422
google-chrome	firefox
everything is ok in firefox google-chrome and ie8

2657427
fadein	fadeout
here is my site and i m having a hell of a tough time figuring out why in gods name my fadein fadeout and corner functions won t work in ie8

2657464
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly fine in firefox google-chrome safari

2657464
post	get
post work without question and get requests only work whenever i include query strings in the url like this

2657469
hide	show
then when the user clicks on either technology or latest the sports will hide and the one clicked will show up and so on

2657484
slideup	slidedown
for something quick and simple you can use slidetoggle or slideup slidedown

2657518
gina	winlogon
in general i wouldn t advocate writing a replacement gina or credential provider in .net as you d inject a dependency on the .net framework into the winlogon process - one slip and you could end up with a machine that refuses to boot

2657525
int	double
int totalcombination int math.pow 2.0 double vowelcount

2657547
width	height
or try this version on the assumption that the first 4 bytes are used to store the width and height of the signature 2 byte short ints for each

2657560
getter	setter
obviously the appropriate setter getter init etc for the class

2657560
getter	setter
i don t want to set each nscell using setter and getter because then i m breaking the whole model concept by storing data in the nscell instead of referencing it from the array controller

2657571
free	malloc
it s good if you want to learn really low-level details like how the memory is managed but memory management is suddenly an important consideration as in correct usage of malloc free

2657571
haskell	scheme	haskell	ocaml	lisp	scheme	ocaml	scheme
lastly you have the functional languages haskell ocaml scheme lisp clojure f# etc

2657595
apl	turing
both j and apl are creations of ken iverson turing winner .

2657604
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization of classes to xml or other media

2657608
getter	setter
mark it transient and use another getter setter to store it using a custom string representation using a seperator or

2657632
subtract	add
you cannot add or subtract 1 year to or from any february 29th - because there is no 29th february in the following or previous year

2657670
width	height
width and height being image width height

2657670
hide	show
makes sure the text doesn t show up over the image yet doesn t hide it for seo screen reader purposes

2657697
google-chrome	firefox
works perfectly with google-chrome and firefox but not with ie

2657757
google-chrome	firefox
it is aligned in google-chrome and firefox but in ie7 it looks like this

2657769
width	height
set its height and width to the full height and width not restricted to the form size but related to the table size

2657793
pull	push
pull went smoothly but as soon as i tried to push back my changes tortoisegit needed my authentication key which was not configured

2657812
post	get
following this post which i posted some time ago i now get the same error every time i try to rewire 2 web s urls

2657839
interpreted-language	compiled-language
another approach is metaprogramming if an interpreter of a language is implemented in a form of a simple translator which targets another interpreted-language it is very easy to re-target it later to some compiled-language or replace the target interpreter with a compiler

2657870
width	height
it s better to use an existing one that it s under development and first try to use it as is make sure that it handles your code and generates what you want then learn how to adjust its width to match the container automatically adjust its height to its contents put the toolbar in an external div and you ll have what you want

2657899
folder	directory
most info i ve seen online suggests keeping all my project folder in a single place as in no separate directory for python or java with each project containing it s own git repository and simply having a snippets directory containing all single-file scripts experiments that can be converted into projects at a later date

2657912
vxworks	lynxos	vxworks	qnx	lynxos	qnx
the commercial solutions mentioned are for qnx vxworks and lynxos

2657912
vxworks	qnx
vxworks supports rpc as does qnx neutrino

2657927
modula-2	oberon	modula-2	algol
in wirth programming languages line algol - pascal - modula-2 - oberon - oberon-2 each subsequent language is simpler and at the same time more powerful than the previous one

2658053
innodb	myisam
then you can experiment with maybe making the info table innodb and the files table myisam

2658056
disk	ram
if the pdfs are on disk and not in ram your disk needs to be accessed

2658081
google-chrome	firefox
i can t click the last 3 links in the following code when i use firefox or google-chrome

2658142
google-chrome	firefox
something is most likely overlapping those elements in firefox google-chrome

2658165
width	height
set display width and height display height - menu height size to contentmanager

2658165
hide	show
show hide menumanager on menu button click

2658167
struts	stripes
the stripes framework is like struts but only better

2658193
struts	stripes
stripes like struts does not really do a lot for your app

2658194
post	get
pass this in as a get or post

2658216
struts	stripes
stripes is just a better struts which isnt much

2658237
put	get
you can put any ruby code into your .irbrc file which will get evaluated whenever you run irb

2658277
onbeforeunload	onload
so that if the users browser is ie then the variable alert onbeforeunload and if it is not ie for example firefox else then alert onload

2658288
put	get
but according to stroustrup the real reason why microsoft and sun decided to get rid off multiple inheritance is that they have vested interest to do so instead of putting features in the languages they put in frameworks so that people then become tied to their platform instead of people having the same capability at a language standard level

2658338
int	double
i also have an extra vector as the target value for each instance it is of double type for regression it is of int for classification

2658376
copying	overwrite
by the way moving all characters back to overwrite the old line is like copying each character in a different position and removing them from their old position

2658393
public	protected
if we define a property as public property and in this property we have a protected getter

2658393
public	protected
if property is public what does defining a protected getter for that means

2658397
public	protected
the protected before the getter so to say overwrites the public for the getter part of the property

2658403
inherited	properties
the protected get means that this properties s getter can only be accessed from a inherited class of this class

2658470
superclass	subclassing
the usual cause of this is declaring the adoption of the protocol in a superclass and then forgetting to implement in that superclass of a subsequent subclassing

2658486
switching	screens
and the below code is activated in all screens for orientation to control the user to switching from one orientation to other mode

2658486
switching	screens
so exactly what i want i want my appliaction to be in portrait mode for all screens i dont want my appliaction will switching to other mode.it remains the same as in portrait mode after rotation to any other mode

2658513
portrait	landscape
my application is completely navigation based and my query is that navigation based application can switch to any mode i mean orientation to portrait to landscape

2658536
getter	setter
in c# you are allowed to have getter and setter with access levels see access modifiers different than the overall property

2658542
width	height
width 50px but when the content of the div is changing dynamically i want to let the height adapt to the change

2658554
graphics2d	bufferedimage
every reference to graphics2d i can find is dealing with either games or writing directly to a file but i just want a bufferedimage returned

2658573
ncover	fxcop
i also got nunit ncover and fxcop running without too many problems

2658614
actionscript	mxml
i have this problem - everytime i deploy the app to the cloud i m having to hardcode the ip address of the server into the actionscript mxml files and for certain reasons i am forced to choose a different ip everytime

2658648
free	malloc
i know the problem is in malloc and free but can t find exactly where why and how to fix it

2658677
free	malloc
when you allocate space for n char and copy a string of length n into it i think that overwrites the metadata that malloc maintains at the end of the array and this bug shows up when you call free to deallocate the memory as free does not find that meta data

2658684
hide	show
hide show divs using javascript

2658716
valgrind	memcheck
valgrind in its memcheck mode will output memory access errors with a stack trace of where in the program they occurred

2658744
int	double
on systems where an int is 32 bits a double is usually 64 bits and so can exactly represent any int

2658758
min	max	minimum	max
for an interval a min a max of non-negative integers we can compute a bitwise minimum a 0 where bits are independently set to 0 whenever that is possible within the interval

2658758
min	max
for b min b max we do the same and get b 0 and b 1

2658758
min	max
it is easy to check for a bit which values it can take for an a from a min a max

2658758
min	max
for bit n if all bits m with m n agree in a min and a max then the value is forced otherwise it can be 0 or 1

2658758
min	max
edit unfortunately this is wrong consider the case where a min a max b min b max 1 2

2658762
getter	setter
with getter setter and a piece of code to map the record fields to them you can remove this but you ll add some complexity

2658769
integer	fractions
integer . fractions

2658769
integer	fractions
if one of them must save fractions information after all it should represent a number then it means that it has less bits for the integer part

if you want to stay in pure java and work with a mathematics library you can also look into using colt which is adapted from jama although you could be better off just using jama directly

2659221
public	protected
for the classes that derive from cpoly if you want them to be able to use the members whether functions or variables then you must make them either public or protected

2659221

postgresql	mysql
in raw sql with a standard-conforming database engine postgresql sql server oracle db2 ... you can just use the sql-standard rank function -- but that s not supported in popular but non-standard engines such as mysql and sqlite and perhaps because of that django does not surface this functionality to the application

getattr	setattr
some other functions that have relatively complicated implementations more complicated than the underlying magic methods are likely to be are iter and cmp and all the attribute methods getattr setattr and delattr

2659640
int	double
things like int also access magic methods when doing coercion you can implement __int__ but do double duty as types

spotify	last.fm
you ll have to check with spotify pandora last.fm themselves and see if they have any available intents to bind like that

2659704
int	chars
i know that a chars and an int are calculated as being 8 bytes on 32 bit architectures due to alignment but i recently came across a situation where a structure with 3 shorts was reported as being 6 bytes by the sizeof operator

subtract	add
i have to build some financial data report and for making the calculation there are a lot of if then situations if it s a large client subtract 10 if it s postal code equals 10101 add 10 if the day is on a saturday make a difficult calculation etc

2659753
int	chars
i don t know where you get the idea about chars or int being calculated as 8 bytes

2659753
int	chars
no every type is calculated in accordance with its size chars as 1 int as 4 on a 32-bit platform not 8 but 4

2659753
int	chars
for this reason when the structure contains the members of the same type the total size of that structure will normally be the exact sum of the sizes of its members a structure of 3 chars s will have size 3 and the structure of two int s will have size 8

2659753
int	chars
note chars counts as 1 int as 4 and the extra 3 padding bytes between them make it 8

2659784
firefox	safari
i imagine that safari is somehow updating its cached version of the page whereas firefox isn t

2659784
firefox	safari
in this case both safari and firefox work as expected

this feature is called the bfcache and both firefox and safari have it as well as opera

2659940
g++	gcc
with either gcc or g++ just add -g to the command line

2659950
hide	show
a basic principle of oop is information hiding hide the implementation details and show only a description of the basic services to the caller

2659950
implements	extends
if the user of the interface does not need to extends any other class it can extends this abstract class otherwise it needs to implements all methods from the interface

2659979
implements	extends
in java you can only inherent extends from one class but you can implements more than one interface so sometimes you will have to use interfaces when you need that sort of multiple inheritance and when you decide not to use composition over inheritance

2659995
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
the limit is in msie and safari about 2kb in opera about 4kb and in firefox about 8kb

the variation he mentions at the end are not portable across all shells though it is not in the posix standard for the shell language and simpler shells do not support it though ksh bash and zsh all do

2660056
google-chrome	firefox
now firefox google-chrome is good with this

2660065
int	double
i understand that c will promote the int to double type as variables xn and x0 are of type double but strangely enough in a book the second expression with casting was emphasized

2660136
firefox	safari
this works as expected in firefox 3.6.3 and safari 4 but does not work in multiple ie versions

2660211
tabcontrol	tabitem
i ve created customtabitem which inherits from tabitem and i d like to use it while binding observablecollection in tabcontrol

2660211
tabcontrol	tabitem
my class extends typical tabitem and i d like to use this class in tabcontrol instead of tabitem

2660271
emacs	aquamacs
you could then setup emacs aquamacs make the remote shell call

2660276
int	double
i need to process the elements of the vector differently according to their int double etc

2660286
tabcontrol	tabitem
you will need to create a custom class derived from tabcontrol and override getitemforcontaineroverride to return your custom tabitem

2660300
inherited	subclassing
if you re not adding any new attributes to the view controller you can implement the two methods in a category on uiviewcontroller and all the subclassing will inherited it by default

2660369
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

2660416
firefox	safari
firefox and safari were behaving differently because firefox needs no-store in the cache-control header directive - no-cache is not sufficient to disable caching for the page

2660447
google-chrome	safari
warning this is compatibility code for very old versions of safari and google-chrome

2660447
google-chrome	safari
this code is now only useful if for some reason you have a need to support safari 5 and older or google-chrome 6 and older

2660447
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this should only be done when safari or google-chrome is detected since other browsers don t support drag-and-drop onto elements and can be used in combination with the html5 drop event for firefox 3.6+

2660450
post	get
i ve even gone so far as to verify this by modifying code to look like runandignorethrow and i ll still get a crash post ui shutdown

2660476
integer	unsigned
when you add 2 to an enum the result is an int or unsigned int or possibly some other integer type if the enum contains really big values which isn t allowed to be assigned back to an enum without a cast

2660512
put	get
when i put this in an extension however the real prototype doesn t get modified

everything works fine in portrait mode but turning the device to landscape produces strange visual quirkiness

2660615
codeigniter	yii
i was surprised to see that codeigniter and yii pass referencs of objects and can be accessed via the following method

2660661
getter	setter
in fact i d argue for avoiding accessing instance variables directly in methods other than accessors getter and setter -dealloc and -init.

2660678
put	get
there is no standard way to get those brackets you have to put them through the code while iterating through your array and writing them to the file

2660771
width	height
and while on the subject but with just a slight deviation i d like to download just enough bytes to determine a jpeg s width and height information

post	get
i want users to be able to make http post requests to my xml-based api though and not get bombarded with this

2660856
free	memcpy
you don t need to memcpy or free the value you just need to keep track of the pointer

2660862
width	height
for example in ff c0 00 11 08 01 de 02 d0 01de represents a height of 478 and 02d0 represents a width of 720

2660914
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
running it through firefox google-chrome safari same thing happens on all

2660955
getter	setter
the best approach to this would be to only access the instance variables through getter setter methods and override those

2660966
qmouseevent	qwidget	qtableview	qmouseevent
since qtableview is a qwidget you could also re-implement mousedoubleclickevent qmouseevent e which would tell you which button was used

very simple rss feed reader is described by travis on rails read comments you don t need to use open method

2661000
division	multiplication	division	subtract
do an integer division followed by a multiplication and subtract

2661017
kerberos	ntlm
you must use kerberos because ntlm does not allow for identity delegation since you are passing credentials from the user to the sharepoint server to the external system

2661065
treemap	treeset
googling around give me some hints about using treeset treemap

2661071
boost	allocator
you can use the boost interprocess library for some allocator which work inside shared memory

2661087
folder	directory
i m just trying to isolate the files in a directory but the -d operator keeps treating all the folder contents as files .

2661094
for-loop	loops
you can check the advanced bash scripting guide s section on loops for more examples of looping constructs besides the c-style for-loop you ve listed

2661101
int	chars
there is an incompatible types error because you are assigning arrays of strings type chars in c to arrays of pointers to int such as

2661101
int	chars
as chars are represented internally as numbers letters correspond to their ascii values c is able to convert chars to int so it attempts to treat variables x and y as arrays of pointers to chars instead of int hence the

opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m looking for a way to programatically control a browser on a mac firefox or safari or google-chrome -ium or opera but not ie using python

2661151
folder	directory
its generally good to create a virtual directory and point it to the actual physical location instead of putting all your files projects in wwwroot folder

2661155
mvp	presenter
in my opinion the correct way to do this would be to implement some sort of mvp structure in the application so that a presenter manages the view dialogbox es among other things and knows how to pass simple data to the view for it to display the presenter would handle the mapwidget data the view would take care of displaying it on the dom

2661161
rss	feed
i ve looked at the standard rss library but is there one library that will auto-detect that there is a new rss feed so i can update my database

2661161
rss	feed
what are the best practice to trigger an instruction in order to store the new rss feed

2661216
integer	fractions
fixed point generally refers to a fixed number of bits for the integer part and a fixed number of bits for the fractions part

2661216
integer	fractions
by your description i m going to guess that you have 1 bit of integer and 23 bits of fractions

2661219
post	get
i currently can get it to post the data to a new php page but it seems to be the ajax function simply remains on the current page which is great for some things just not this not redirecting to the new page

superclass	subclassing
since method lookup is done a run-time the subclassing implementation will always be used even from a pointer of the superclass type

2661340
error-handling	exception-handling
the final ingredient is a static function track getstate which simply returns a list of all currently active scopes -- this can be called from an exception-handling handler or other error-handling mechanism

2661346
selecteditem	selectedindex
did you try the selecteditem or selectedindex properties

2661390
rss	feed
searching the google for new rss feed doesn t return anything that looks useful at least not on the first page

2661390
rss	feed
auto-discovery links can open a can of worms because of duplicate content being served using different protocols rdf rss and atom so you have to determine which to use or multiple feed with alternate content listed

your question is rather confusing--ajax calls are all client-side any server-side technology can return data to the client

2661415
gif	png
for example take an image jpg png gif compress it resize it and save as png

2661432
gif	png
i think the following routine will retrieve just the image heights for jpg gif and png or return an false condition on a 404 or other image type

2661432
gif	png
unfortunately jpeg pushes its height value pretty far out in a file unlike gif or png and so i had to read the file that far out in bytes

2661432
gif	png
then with those bytes it scans for jfif png or gif in that header to let us know which file type it is

2661432
width	height
on whatever random image i find i set width in the img tag of the html and it automatically resizes the height -- but looks good only if the image is under a certain height

2661500
serializable	deserialization
if you have small volume of input output data a webrequest would be better and probably faster but if you need to pass complex objects a web service will be suitable because it will handle the serializable deserialization of these objects you won t need to parse them in your code

2661555
udp	tcp
you could make a socket connection tcp udp to a port number on a remote host

2661611
multiplying	add

it requires only 8x8 multiplication and a final division by 255 which can be approximated by simply taking the high byte of the sum

2661645
post	get
how can i get php to submit the form automatically when receiving variables at command line like for instance a specific post variable

2661668
post	get
you can write a cli script in almost any language that supports making get post requests php python bash with curl java... and perform the same call as submitting form will do.

2661671
put	get
also to make things even more entertaining after completing this report you can put it in another parent report then you will get the same report for multiple customers

2661701
children	parent
no deleting parent will delete children if you have cascading turned on

2661724
cpu	hyperthreading
7 does recognize ht hyperthreading and doesn t schedule multiple tasks to the one cpu core that is probably the only benefit 7 has over xp

put	get
marshalling an interface from one thread to another can be done by using comarshalinterthreadinterfaceinstream to put the interface into a stream move the stream to the other thread and then use cogetinterfaceandreleasestream to get the interface back from the stream

2661832
post	put
that is to put a list of threads as a property on your post class and put a list of post as a property on your threads class

2661843
multiplying	division
in this very cas you should multiplying all your values for 1000 and do a division at the end of the calculation or better resort to precise calculation extension

2661869
button	checkbox
getting the list of inputs is slightly harder since we don t want to include checkbox radio button etc

2661872
int	chars
the second part of the puzzle is that chars values are always promoted to int or rarely unsigned int when passed as part of a function s variable-length argument list

2661873
int	chars
chars alone is interpreted as an int

2661875
int	chars
chars the kind of thing that a 1 evaluates to are int but the s formatter for printf expects a pointer

2661878
int	chars
the expression yields a single chars and in expressions that is widened to an int

2661883
nstimer	nsrunloop
note that from the perspective of nsrunloop nstimer objects are not input â they are a special type and one of the things that means is that they do not cause the run loop to return when they fire. from nsrunloop class reference - so i think you block the runloop from continuing

2661913
int	chars
for example __declspec dllexport int my_function chars

2661913

i guess that one can configure gitosis or gitolite to do similar check or you can write your own upate or pre-receive hook

2662019
client-side	server-side
the reason you do not have svnadmin is that it is a server-side program not a client-side program

2662022
int	chars
use atoi to convert the chars data to int

2662030
int	chars
note that this reads the data into int timestamp low medium and high are int s a string version looks like this timestamp low medium and high are chars arrays

udp	tcp
if you really must use udp the first question to ask is what are you willing to give up with respect to tcp s guarantees

2662299
datediff	difference
generate the month difference as a divisor datediff uses end of month as the month boundary

2662383
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
by testing on the latest safari with webkit nightly google-chrome and firefox you ll find that it really doesn t matter which kind of the loop you re choosing if it s not for each or for in or even worse any derived functions built upon them

2662417
free	malloc
another solution would be to use malloc and free but that gives a level of indirection that i do not want

2662422
mouse	keyboard
this might confuse some users if they use the mouse to click instead of the arrows enter on the keyboard

2662431
rss	feed
when you are filling your model with rss feed data instead of model.create ... use

2662439
folder	directory
...as your wsgi file is in a directory called apache under your project folder

2662468
free	malloc
you can have a look at the way it s done with the stl containers but i doubt you can spare yourself malloc s and free s

2662487
decoder	encoder
i m trying to code a simple base64 encoder decoder to test my programming skill

2662495
button	checkbox
this document provides some examples of how to manipulate checkbox combo boxes and radio button

2662495
filtering	grouping
using the construct of groupname.fieldname appears to be useful to manipulate the widgets as a grouping in acrobat javascript but the fields of a grouping cannot be enumerated without enumerating all fields and filtering for the groupname and the collective value of that grouping cannot be determined without programatically inspecting the values

2662507
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
so a firefox opera google-chrome webkit user doesn t have to download all those additional hacks that make the web app work on ie

2662520
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
basically i am using uinavigationcontroller and then push uitableviewcontroller or sometime a uiviewcontroller

2662567
iprincipal	iidentity
i d suggest creating a custom iprincipal and iidentity classes which also can interact with your membership provider and set those on the thread

2662595
lxml	beautifulsoup
in my case links can be outside of a tags and be not well formed in many ways like n in the middle of link so i try to grab as much links as i can and check them later in other scripts so no beautifulsoup lxml etc

2662625
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql and sql server 2008 all have geo-spatial features either natively or via extensions which include spatial indexing and implementations of the haversine formula

2662660
free	malloc
the memory returned by getenv is not allocated by malloc and should therefore not be free by free

2662660
free	malloc
in general none of the c standard library functions that are not part of the malloc family should be free using free or in fact free at all

2662686
allocator	stl
also stl s vector allocator and deallocations are abstracted away through the use of allocator the second template argument of vector

2662710
int	chars
the int thing was a typo on my part i really meant it to be chars

2662737
pop-up	dialog
just use jquery ui dialog make it a modal pop-up and put your uploading buttons etc on the pop-up and it should just work fine

2662739

edit i think it might be related to me attaching the uiviewcontroller s view outlet to an uiwindow instance

2662769
spaces	delimiter
i have a file delimiter by spaces

2662782
width	height
now the problem is that i can t get it to scale properly in width but height is perfectly fine

2662799
onclick	onsubmit
though when one gets unexpected form submit or unexpected following links in this way unexpected because your form s onsubmit or your a s onclick has a return false

2662819
versioning	upgrade
ps - when i say upgrade i mean full install of the new versioning with full format of the hdd

2662832
put	get
you should put the awk scripts inside single quotes and use variable passing to get the shell variables into the awk script

2662861
getter	setter
if you have processing in your getter setter this method would quickly become bloated

2662863
dependency-injection	singleton
have in mind that an object can be de-facto singleton but still be obtained via dependency-injection rather than via singleton.getinstance

2662906
google-chrome	firefox
and now the code works in both firefox and webkit based browsers like google-chrome

2662908

2662974
hide	show
the code above show how i hide and show the scrollbox

2662986
uiview	subviews	uiview	uiwindow
uiwindow is a uiview so you can do something like this to get the subviews of it

2663049
children	parent
with that in mind you could use parent relationships as adam suggests and keep an incomplete count on each node which counts the number of immediate children that aren t yet complete

2663054
int	chars
so an assignment like the tries putting a pointer into a chars -sized int

2663115
next	except
and each node points to the next node except for the last node which has null for next

2663120
versioning	upgrade
when .6 came out i upgrade cassandra and thrift which threw errors in my code www dot copypastecode dot com 26760 - i was able to iron out the errors by converting the necessary types however in the versioning that compiles now only seems to read one item back im not sure if its not saving db changes or if its only reading back 1 entry

2663129
gtk	cairo
or maybe your best bet is to move to an alternate imaging library that doesn t use video memory there are a quite a few open source ones freeimage imagemagick cairo though you will have to at least get the gtk packages from mono for it to run

2663181
hash	md5
assuming you re not doing anything important like deleting an md5 or similar hash function should be plenty

2663220
ati	nvidia
the length of the returned string is empty on nvidia and ati cards but on intel cards this one returns the string no errors.

2663247
udp	tcp
i m trying to write a syslog listener and so far so good on getting it to accept incoming messages through tcp but i also want udp to function

2663431
onfocus	onblur
i tried onfocus and onblur it didnt work out

2663465
mouse	keyboard
we can intercept mouse and keyboard events on both os x windows linux we can write a component that not only looks but also behaves identically on all three platforms

2663465
mouse	keyboard
working identically on all platforms where java can give you notifications about mouse and keyboard events.

2663471
png	tga
you should also use a file format which supports an alpha channel png tga ...

2663528
getter	setter
the getter of my instance property would return the value of the static field but the setter would set itself

2663538
int	chars
c and c++ define chars as a byte the int type for which sizeof returns 1

2663538
toupper	uppercase
toupper a works as expected but toupper xc3 is a nonsensical attempt to uppercase half of a character

2663637
mp3	wmv
i m currently letting vlc stream a wmv file while it converts the file live to h264 with mp3 audio

2663746
uiview	uiwindow
uiwindow inherits from uiview so although i don t have much personal experience with this exact thing you should still be able to get it to draw to a bitmap context of some kind and then use two different uiwindows each with only an image view on a them pushing the actual pixels to their respective screens

2663746
super	implements
this is considerably easier if you only want to mirror one specific custom view and not including it s subviews because you can have that view on the device screen to capture any input and then design it in a way that you have a method to call to draw it in whatever context it s in some drawrects might work fine as is and the call that from a super special awesome custom subview on the other screen which would implements drawrect to just call the method on the actual view

2663753
savefiledialog	folderbrowserdialog
savefiledialog for a file or folderbrowserdialog for a folder

2663756
folderbrowserdialog	openfiledialog	savefiledialog	folderbrowserdialog	savefiledialog	openfiledialog
there are 3 controls folderbrowserdialog openfiledialog and savefiledialog

2663804
put	get
the problem is i always get my alert message displayed the saved value is not put into the label so somehow 0 is always true

2663809
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
this usually would require three separate allocations malloc calloc strdup... and consequently free separate releases free

2663810
.htaccess	httpd.conf
php directives can be set in apache s httpd.conf and .htaccess files and you d end up with differences even though the main php.ini files are identical

2663839
profiling	benchmarking
we recently switched some maths types vec3 vec4 matrices etc. over to use structs instead of classes and as well as being slightly quicker in benchmarking it also reduced the gc pressure we had hundreds of megabytes of vec3 allocations over a relatively short period of time discovered via the clr profiling

2663856
post	get
if you need to pass that much data use post not get

2663899
daemons	systemd
qt s signal slot systemd is very easy to use and ideal for a network daemons service boost also includes a signal slot systemd but it is harder to use and does not include an event loop

2663901
ienumerable	iqueryable
understand the difference between iqueryable and ienumerable

2663943
client-side	server-side
fundamentally sure javascript is a very powerful language and so you can do development in it server-side just like you can client-side and if you do client-side scripting as well you get some definite reuse benefits using javascript on the server

2663979
range	max
the first point in the range is when an alert will be sent to the user the second point is a max limit

2664008
octal	decimal
integer literals starting with a 0 are interpreted as octal not decimal in the same way that integer literals starting with 0x are interpreted as hexadecimal

2664009
octal	decimal
prefixing an integer with 0 makes it an octal number instead of decimal and 010100 in octal is 4160 in decimal

2664020
mouseup	mousedown
my first instinct would be to create a subclass of nstextfield and override some or all of mousedown mousedragged and mouseup to create the dragging behavior you want

2664055
background-color	font-size
the two ways have differences for example the ie element.currentstyle property expect that you access the ccs property names composed of two or more words in camelcase maxheight fontsize backgroundcolor etc the standard way expects the properties with the words separated with dashes max-height font-size background-color etc

2664064
octal	decimal	octal	binary
you may find these macros helpful to represent binary numbers with decimal or octal numbers in the form of 1 s and 0 s

2664117
hash	md5
on authentication you calc md5 of password typed by user and checking equality with your stored md5 password hash for this user

2664154
hash	salt
for example use a hash of the user s ip address and a salt provides extra security against someone stealing or sniffing the user s security cookie

2664225
g++	gcc
although it s been said that the support for c++0x new features in g++ are in experimental mode many gcc developer claimed that you can use most of the new features in your codes and get the program to work

2664229
sorting	filtering
after sorting your array you can filtering the items with duplicate num with this

what html apis are available for touch screens devices tablet pcs

2664301
division	modulo
i don t really understand how modulo division works

2664304
division	modulo
the result of a modulo division is the remainder of an integer division of the given numbers

2664308
division	modulo
modulo division is simply this divide two numbers and return the remainder only

2664331
division	modulo
modulo division gives you the remainder of a division rather than the quotient

2664335
addition	multiplication
for instance you could treat the data as base 2 16 for multiplication but base 2 32 for addition

2664361
strstr	strtok
alternatively you can take a look at strtok and strstr

2664379
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox i get 15 bars

2664383
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works fine in firefox and opera for mac but in google-chrome and safari the third level sticks or hangs as a watermark after you move the cursor away

2664391
mouse	keyboard
i want to catch any keyboard or mouse events which were designed with other applications

2664402
mouse	keyboard
you probably want to use the keyboard hook and the mouse hook to watch for mouse events

2664409
textview	imageview
something similar for your imageview which presently looks like it is going to overlap the second textview

2664435
folder	directory

2664441
ubuntu	centos
this works fine on testing servers but not the production server which is running the same thing centos and apache works on ubuntu though

2664445
pow	sqrt
i am trying to implement my own version of pow and sqrt function as my custom library doesn t have pow sqrt floating point support

2664457
pow	sqrt
fdlibm the freely distributable math library has sqrt and pow along with many other math functions

2664457
pow	sqrt
are you after source code to get it done or are you really not so much looking for pow and sqrt but actually looking for an education in floating-point algorithms programming

2664464
client-side	server-side
it sounds like that you re using client-side includes with help of html or element instead of server-side includes with help of

2664464
client-side	server-side
so to solve your particular problem just use server-side includes instead of client-side includes

2664468
superclass	subclassing
i want to utilize polymorphism on these subclassing by declaring pure virtual functions in the superclass then have the children implement those functions

2664482
cos	inverse
arccos is the inverse function of cos not the multiplicative inverse

2664490
xna	slimdx
so long as you stick with managed directx or slimdx and not one of the newer frameworks like xna then the api translates fairly directly from managed to unmanaged

2664501
post	get
i can post code here if needed but im not sure if that is necessary or possible as you may need to see all of the source code to get the right idea

2664504
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is the case for all of the following browsers ie7 safari 4 firefox 3.5 google-chrome 4.1 opera 10.51

2664522
cos	inverse
since the cos of an angle is always between -1 and +1 there is no way to compute the inverse function acos of a value outside that range or it means you passed nan to the acos function

2664535
super	implements
personally i would implements the protocol on the super class but implements the methods like this

2664588
codeigniter	cakephp
i have been developing in php since 2000 and still have a bunch of php systems in production using both codeigniter and cakephp

2664622

width	height
space width and height

2664670
accessor	properties
you should use the bracket notation properties accessor

2664706

2665244
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari this produces a cryptic error

2665246
folder	directory
any suggestions e.g adding some rules to open_base_dir and getting php to recursively copy the folder to the other domain remember it s on the same dedicated box so it just needs to traverse the directory not ftp things

2665247
public	protected
yet you may still use the private protected and public functions within the controller for additional logic

2665289
folder	directory
for instance whenever developers create a changerequest which can encompass change in 3-40 files i have to create a directory structure distributed across 32 folder

2665299
mouse	keyboard
if your application is a true win32 service then on vista and beyond the application won t receive keyboard or mouse events - to close a security hole search for shatter attack microsoft isolated all services to prevent them from interacting with the user

xna	slimdx
if you can do stuff with slimdx or xna then you should be able to transfer your skills over to unmanaged directx pretty easily

2665734
inherited	properties
these properties can be defined to inherited their value from the ancenstor

2665734
inherited	properties
you have to look in the documentation for each properties if it is inherited or not

2665734
inherited	properties
the borderbrush borderthickness and background properties are not inherited wouldn t make sense most of the time

2665734
inherited	properties
an example for an inherited properties is the datacontext properties since it makes sense for child elements to have the same data context as their parent

post	get
i m using jqgrid for a table input and setting up the url as a servlet which will deal with the get and post requests and save the rows to a java object

2666124
bazaar	svn
you could try bazaar bazaar as it supports workflows but i don t know if it is really faster or wait for svn 1.7 with wc-ng and centralized meta-data

2666794
ant	maven
do you know how to instruct my maven build to don t care about this ant task error or how to instruct ant to don t fail in the case of a missing directory

2666809

as a kernel module you completely override the linux routing mechanism and as a userland binary you simply get a duplicate as you mention in your post of each packet from the interface

2666809
packets	pcap
packets can be directed through the click graph by way of pcap filters and a variety of other mechanisms

2666841
int	chars
so why did this overflow happen when multiplying the int but not the chars

2666845
inherited	properties
your best option in my opinion is either using a uniform interface and extend it or extend the prototypes from which your objects inherited then you can use instanceof before going forward with the method call or use the somewhat cumbersome operator in order to avoid the access of nonexistent properties methods

2666860
int	chars
in the first example an int is large enough to hold the result of multiplying chars s so there is no overflow

2666875
getter	setter
and at the end of a class i have a getter and setter for it

2666875

creating a new property is possible when you have no intention to use it in a linq query so no filtering grouping and ordering based on that property but it is easy for accidentally do this and find out at runtime

2668115
winpcap	pcap.net
in order to do it using winpcap in .net you can use pcap.net

2668152
put	get

2668204
vb.net	vb6
we have a mix of both at my company however the choice to use vb.net always depends on if we are porting an existing vb6 application to .net in which case it makes sense to use vb.net since less code has to be rewritten in most cases

2668216
hide	show
next step is to show hide your div in the function you pass in

2669102
try-catch	exception-handling
catching that exception-handling can happen from the model but it is more likely to happen from another source - in which case you would probably have to extend a few libraries or be sure you are wrapping a base model parent __construct call and the session library in a try-catch block

2669128
haskell	scheme
jonathan tang s write yourself a scheme in 48 hours is another good example of writing an interpreter this time in haskell which shares many features with f#

2669135
post	get
it does have three post but i couldn t get the title message output

2669200
division	multiplication	division	exponent	multiplication	exponent
multiplication and division are well-behaved as long as you don t overflow the number of bits you can hold in the exponent

2669200
subtraction	addition	exponent	addition
addition and subtraction on the other hand require changing the representation from the normalized form to one where the exponent match

2669200
subtract	add
this is why you can get seemingly bizarre results if you add two numbers that are wildly different in magnitude or you subtract two numbers that are nearly identical

2669224
hide	show
i m building a new widget form app views widgets new.html.erb and would like to dynamically show hide the color field based on a for widget_type

2669388
jsf	wicket
you can use wicket instead of jsf if you want

2669396
subtraction	addition
delphi would almost definitely optimise that loop to execute in reverse order ie downto zero rather than from zero - delphi does this whenever it determines it is safe to do presumably because either subtraction or checking against zero is faster than addition or checking against a non-zero number

2669407
hide	show
in that iphone-specific stylesheet try including some rules to scale your text and images and show hide content until the site displays nicely on the smaller screen

2669409
int	chars
an int chars constant has type int

the virtual properties is inherited from the base class and is assumed to be present even if you don t type it out

2669719
for-loop	loops
it s easy enough to wrap this all in a for-loop however i d like to use the foreach function of the list generic to set the connection as it ll probably be faster than my implementation of calling list.item i in loops but i get some strange errors

2669723
mpmath	sympy
there is a library called mpmath python a module of sympy which provides the series support for sympy i believe it also backs sage

2669933
stdout	stderr
it is very clear what this means for stdin stdout stderr but what are the defaults for newly opened files

2669958
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
if you do not want the key associated with the data model since it is an abstraction of the view controller and might just represent the order that the array should be in to be sorted you could keep a sidecar nsmutablearray of nsnumber or if performance is really critical use a custom managed c-array with malloc calloc free next to the data model

2669975
put	get
i have got the sql correct as to select just one year if i put datevalue 01 01 2001 in both places but i am trying now to get it to grab the year data from the ms access form - another drop down named cboyear

2670869
children	parent
any complete re-ordering of a parent is somewhat expensive and thus the implementation is to try and assign - for a parent with x children - the orders which are somewhat evenly distributed between 0 and 36 10-1 so that almost no tree inserts result in a full re-ordering

2670966
inherited	properties
as msdn states the inherited flag only works when you use registerattached to create the properties

2671327
cvs	svn
if you were to choose a cvs or svn based one then the slight difference in your plugin versions shouldn t make a difference

2671327
bazaar	git
however if you were to go for one of the increasingly popular dcvs solutions such as git mercurial or bazaar then your local copy has a full copy of all of the history so you could get by with creating a local repo on a memory stick making more commits at home and then synching it when your are connected to the office or the internet depending on where you decide to host your central repo

if you do end up using a function call to get valid range recommended to keep clutter to a minimum and organization higher i d add an overload

2672489
hide	show
not everyone thinks that has value but i m a firm believer that it s the job of source control to show us not what we wished had happened but what actually happened -- every deadend and every refactor should leave an indelible trace and rebasing and other history editing techniques hide that

2672501
public	protected
so you can make a base class s protected members public or private

2672501
public	protected
or a base s public members protected or private

2672796
hex	binary
the simplest approach especially if you already can convert from binary digits to internal numeric representation and from internal numeric representation to hexadecimal digits is to go binary- internal- hex

2672796
hex	binary
this does not apply to your specific example but in many cases when converting from binary to hex you can go four digits at a time and simply lookup the corresponding hex values in a table

2672807
hex	binary
you could simply have a small hash table or other mapping converting each quadruplet of binary digits as a string assuming that s your input into the corresponding hex digit 0 to 9 a to f for the output string

2672807
hex	binary
each bunch of 4 binary digits via a hash or other form of hashing turns into the hex digit to put in that place in the output string

2672835
button	checkbox
button checkbox radio reset or

2672839
hex	binary
binary and hex are natively compatible

2672853
haskell	ocaml
whether you re in a hybrid functional oo language like f# or ocaml or in a purely functional language like haskell where side-effects are relegated to the io monad it s mostly the case that a ton of the work required to manage a gui is much more like a side effect than like a purely functional algorithm

2672896
actualheight	actualwidth
by hooking into the loaded event of each and checking actualwidth actualheight you can get the dimensions

2672933

inherited	properties
you can request the scrollbox to recalculate its scrollbar properties by calling the realign method it inherited from twincontrol

2673141
inherited	properties
it is important to use the hasownproperty method to determine whether the object has the specified properties as a direct properties and not inherited from the object s prototype chain

2673241
portrait	landscape
even in landscape mode it should be like portrait mode

2673268

2673307
linfu	spring.net
castle can be used amongst others you have the choice you can also use linfu spring.net ... to create dynamic proxies of your entities

2673307
inherited	properties
this behaviour is the reason why nhibernate wants you to create every properties as virtual by default nhibernate will create a new class using this castle or linfu ... proxy provider which inherited from your entity and it will override all the properties so that it can inject the code that is necessary to retrieve the necessary data from the db

2673568
subscript	superscript
in unicode you can only have certain characters as superscript or subscript

2673568
subscript	superscript
if you are trying to convert formatted text that could contain all kinds of characters as superscript or subscript that means they are not directly represented as unicode and it would depend a lot on the format of the text

2673600
width	height
i have some problems when i try to bind the height and width of a window to properties in my view model

2673600

2673891
put	get
i know it s pretty funky but i d figure i put it here to get feedbacks

2673946
udp	tcp
that being said qt4 does include a network module which supports udp and tcp the basis for communicating over the internet

2673951
peer	p2p
the other problem with creating p2p software is that developing it on your own you will have very few peer to test with even if you do create a bunch of virtual computers

2673969
inherited	properties
aside from the fact animating is useless before appending first in some browsers backgroundcolor properties isn t inherited from the css class until it s attached to dom

2674023
folder	directory
maybe you added a folder in your solution directory and moved the wanted file there

2674030
client-side	server-side
then you shouldn t be doing it in server-side but in client-side

2674032
hide	show
the problem i have is that the script uses string values in an array whereas i probably want to create the different hidden divs and show hide depending on the element clicked

2674032
hide	show
so you can see atm the script changed the content of item-title based on the key of the titles array what i would also like to do is show aquapanel when aqua is in focus and obviously hide all of the other elements there are more than 1 in the real example.

2674067
onclick	onchange
onclick is really the wrong event to be using here it should be onchange

2674067
onclick	onchange
however you will typically see onclick used instead because there s a bug in ie where it doesn t fire onchange until you unfocus the checkbox

2674185
google-chrome	firefox

how should i resize an image with python script so that it would automatically adjust the height ratio to the width used

2674309
mouseover	mouseenter
the mouseover event is triggered when the mouseenter an element

2674320
button	checkbox
user will check one or many checkbox and click on delete button which is actually submit button then the respective records for selected checkbox are get deleted

2674320
button	checkbox
when user selects one or more checkbox and clicks the submit button then a jquery code is get executed in which

2674320
button	checkbox
if user pressed the no button then it should unchecks the checked selected checkbox and should not submit the form

2674324

2674391
rss	feed
i m currently using regular expressions to search through rss feed to find if certain words and phrases are mentioned and would then like to extract the text on either side of the match as well

2674409
ivar	subclassing
unless you explicitly add an ivar and property to your button by subclassing uibutton and assign the view controller to it it and any other view has no access to its or any of its superviews view controller

2674454
put	get
back to your question to get a you can either put it in a literal string surrounded by single quotes like so echo my string note though that variables are not substituted in literal strings

2674484
put	get
how do i get the values from the following nested elements from the xml below i ve also put my code below

2674526
draggable	droppable
html 5.0 offers drag and drop built in but you will probably need to use draggable and droppable from the jquery ui library

2674569
elf	coff
perhaps your linker is expecting elf format instead of coff and for some reason __elf__ is not defined

2674587
activemq	rabbitmq
look toward message brokers like activemq rabbitmq zeromq

2674602
mktime	strftime
i don t know how you get those numbers 69 137 but you can use gawk s mktime and others like strftime etc

2674636
versioning	upgrade
there may be a javascript answer to this but i try to avoid that as much as possible since it sometimes leaves you open to versioning upgrade issues

2674639
fgetc	fread
it is better to either in using fgetc and parse as it comes in or read into a buffer fread and process it from there

2674659
superclass	subclassing
but what i have such a thing in a superclass and make a subclassing

2674659

multiplying	add
please note that multiplying a by 10000 b by 1000.....and e by 1 will not working since and therefore i will lose it when i add the values up

2674741
width	height
the only reason customtitleview.bounds has zero width and height is because you ve initialized it that way by using cgrectzero

2674894
firefox	safari
i have tried lots of different settings and every other browser firefox safari ie8 renders the text below the image

2674900
children	parent
then it will return the complete array of children for that given node parent

2674922
put	get
put all that database code on the server side where it belongs and use an ajax call to get that data from a server-side component

2674971

keydown	keyup
if you can pass keyeventargs to your class from a keyup or keydown event handler you have access to the keyeventargs.modifiers property

2675104
hash	salt
however the basic answer to your question is to add a random per-user salt and switch to a slower hash

2675107
hash	salt
since a rainbow table is a series of precomputed hash chains for various passwords it is easily foiled by adding a salt to the passwords

2675107
hash	salt
because hash functions usually remove much of the local correspondence between input and output that is a small change in input produces large seemingly unrelated changes in output even a small salt will be immensely effective

2675160
post	get
however gmail does a post with this information and i would like the form to be a get so that the information is in the url of the search results page

2675162
width	height
when i create the bitmapimage the pixels height and width are both 0

2675162

there is a method that returns an array with a min and max values within this range i.e 13 15 20 27 50 .

2675196
min	max
where 13 is the min and 240 is the max

2675244
width	height
i want to set some default width and manage height according to its content in a way so that neither horizontal nor vertical scroller appears

2675249

to find min and max from incoming array

2675298
google-chrome	safari
is there a similar setting or option in safari and or google-chrome

hash	salt
the recommended way to store passwords is salt + hash but because it becomes unrecoverable it is useless in your case

2675369
accessor	properties
in the case of a properties say public string dataasstring the get accessor would house the logic to encode all of the data into a string while the set accessor would decode the input value and set all of the data in the class instance

2675391
getter	setter
if your property s getter or setter are performing substantial calculations then moving them to a method is generally encouraged

2675398
getter	setter
to make things more easy to use wrap the qcombobox with a python class that offers setter and getter for the current db key and which hides the mapping

2675413
punctuation	words
1st thing i thought i d do is setup an example with a mix of scenerios i could test against its sitting with punctuation in html tags ones that we ve applied this to already in other words the script has run through this before so no need to do again

2675456
groupbox	panel
put all the textboxes where the user will enter a value inside a common container like a groupbox or panel control

2675490
apache	nginx
you can also use nginx to offload ssl processing from the apache instances

2675490
apache	nginx
nginx and haproxy live together on a heartbeat cluster and feed requests into a pool of apache boxes on the backend

2675513
udp	tcp
there are slightly more than 500 ports defined about half udp and half tcp

2675514

2675609
versioning	upgrade
we have a product that includes a reasonable database part 100 tables 500 procs functions views so we need to be able to deploy new databases of the current versioning as well as upgrade older databases up to the current versioning

2675611
bufferedreader	printwriter
i m trying to use the java commands pw.println and br.readline in matlab because i have set up a socket input_socket2 between matlab and a command-line program i want to control using java classes bufferedreader and printwriter

2675614
gentoo	linux
i m trying to update eclipse 3.5.1 on gentoo linux from the galileo discovery site and i get this error message

2675657
post	get
it was just that my framework used was sanitizing all get post requests

2675705
accessor	properties
for example if you submit an input with name test you should have the following accessor in your action form class which respect javabeans convention for properties named test

2675728
updatepanel	scriptmanager
basically i have created a custom control that uses an updatepanel and as i understand it i need to use a scriptmanagerproxy to make it work since there should only be one scriptmanager per page and is is declared in my .aspx page .so how do you use this beastie is it just a matter of adding

2675744
versioning	upgrade
support can then go get the script for any versioning and use the redgate tools to either create from scratch or upgrade

2675756
children	parent
we can store it in array format with parent in position i and its children in 2i 2i+1

2675781
catalyst	embperl
on submission the form sends the value of the search string from to a back-end script for example a perl cgi script iplemented using cgi.pm for simplicity though these days use more modern web frameworks such as perl s catalyst or templating frameworks such as embperl

2675786
postorder	inorder
you can save the inorder and pre postorder traversal of the binary tree in the file and reconstruct the tree from these traversals

2675793
pull	push
currently clients push new data to the server and pull new data from the server on 15-minute polling loop

2675793
pull	push
the server currently does not push data - the client hits the messagecount method to see if there is new data to pull

2675816
vb.net	vb6
also here is the vb6 code by cvs 2600hertz translated to vb.net

2675855
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
but in google-chrome firefox and safari content became inactive

2675913
libcurl	typhoeus
i know there are a few libcurl examples but my tries with typhoeus haven t been successful so far

2675956
min	max
in this case the max query will need to browse over only 1 record while the min query will have to browse all records from 2001 and further on

2676047
hlsl	glsl
i never used hlsl but i did use glsl a while back and i must admit it s terribly far in my head

2676072
getter	setter
actually a property is just a pointer to methods usually getter setter when they are generated by visual studio or other high level language most of the time

2676089
filtering	grouping
found out you need to set a relationship between organic grouping grouping node post and organic grouping grouping member filtering

2676107
width	height
don t use inline styles the height you re setting on the .content and .content_ie classes this makes even less sense since you re setting other style properties like width through the css

2676107
width	height
for the ie-specific declarations a better approach is to set up your styles so that you can take care of the cascade - set the base styles height width etc on the .content class and then apply a few ie specific rules like the different height

2676115
hide	show
control has a setvisible boolean method and composite inherits from control which you can use to show and hide a component

2676157
int	chars
as mentioned above k evaluates from right to left so the _ic function takes whatever is to its right and converts it to an int value this includes both single chars and chars vectors

2676193
integer	unsigned
specifically i m thinking about 24 or 32 bit unsigned integer operands

2676210
int	chars
a switch works with the byte short chars and int primitive data types

2676210
int	chars
it also works with enumerated types discussed in classes and inheritance and a few special classes that wrap certain primitive types chars byte short and int discussed in simple data objects

2676252
udp	tcp
i would possibly use a method similar to ms exchange - connection and authentication via tcp ip then notification of update s from the server to client via udp then the client recieves the udp request and downloads the update via tcp ip

2676257
ssl	https
it s a matter of configuring your web server to use https http over ssl rather than http cleartext http to serve the page

2676265
ssl	https
as to the server configuration it s unclear what server you re using so here s a tomcat-targeted example how to configure the server to use https ssl

2676295
implements	extends
implements my own trigger which extends simpletrigger and contains shared state that could run its own triggerlistener

2676307
bluetooth	usb
any way is possible bluetooth wifi or usb

2676309
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
that works on ie6 and up at least firefox and other gecko-based browsers google-chrome and other webkit-based browsers opera etc

2676312
websphere	ibm
c program files ibm websphere mq bin amqmdnet.dll

2676327
children	parent
in git a particular commit knows about its parent s but not necessarily about its children

2676372
client-side	server-side
should the server-side script return all the data from this poll and let the client-side script i m looking at jquery plugin periodicupdater script atm determine if there s a change in data or should i programme the server-side script to return only the new entries

2676392
portrait	landscape
remember also that you can use two different nibs for portrait and landscape modes

2676443
getter	setter
suppose a class has private data members but the setter and getter are in public scope

2676443
getter	setter
if you inherit from this class you can still call those setter and getter -- enabling access to the private data members in the base class

2676454
getter	setter
because the getter and setter are public -- they re callable by anyone not just derived classes

2676480
getter	setter
getter and setter do not give you complete control over private data members

2676509
getter	setter
using getter and setter like this does not really make sense in c++

2676571
yacc	bison
what you at least normally want to do is have yacc bison if you must produce a header y.tab.h by using yacc -d and include that in your lexer

2676571
yacc	bison
edit i forgot to mention one other point with a bottom-up parser like bison yacc byacc generate left recursion is generally preferred to right recursion so you d generally prefer to change this

2676656
versioning	upgrade
i m happy to compile up my own copies of what-ever versioning is best the stable versioning closest what github runs presumably 1.7.x if that is the only reliable way to proceed but if i m unlikely to experience problems pulling changes between 1.5 1.6 1.7 then i d prefer to keep to the standard repository versioning to make updates upgrade of git as painless as possible

2676661
accessor	properties
another way to do this if this makes sense for your project is to 1 in your nib file add an object controller 2 set the class of that object controller to your model class 3 in your model class create an instance variable for the slider float sliderfloatvalue 4 create accessor for the float properties readwrite assign float sliderfloatvalue

2676681
accessor	properties
the properties or indexer mycomponent.value cannot be used in this context because it lacks the get accessor

2676689
getter	setter
in our case we are deriving the value returned from the getter to get stored in the db and the setter has no functional purpose

2676724
public	protected
maybe if you make access modifiers of entity fields default or protected or public then hibernate will initialize fields directly without using setter i read something about it but i m not sure that it works

2676737
post	get
after looking at some of your other post i realize that you may not be in control of the dataset you get

2676770
for-loop	loops
have you thought about swapping out the for-loop with a foreach loops

2676805
public	protected
if later it is you can make it protected or public as needed

2676838
children	parent
if i m a parent reap any zombie children waitpid -1 null wnohang

2676882
google-chrome	firefox
it caches on firefox and ie and not so much in google-chrome or safari.

2676942
typemock	moles
both typemock and moles have the goal of isolation in mind

2676942
typemock	moles
these are the advantages in typemock i have not yet discovered with moles

2676942
ncover	partcover
support for code coverage tools ncover and partcover

2676956
rss	feed
i have a rss feed i need to display in a table its clothes from a webshop system

2676956
width	height
the images in the rss vary in width and height and i want to make a table that shows them all

2677016
mouseleave	mouseenter
you could add things like setting the interval on mouseenter and clearing it on mouseleave so it s not checking every second someone is on your page but this should give you a basic idea

2677055
mdpi	hdpi
create ldpi mdpi and hdpi versions of it this is detailed in the article linked above

2677111
puts	gets
data not such a multiple gets base64-encoded with a trailing character catenating it puts the in the middle of the string which is not a valid base64 string

2677143
hash	salt
storing the salt alongside the user data does not weaken the hash

2677188
rss	feed
there is a free toolkit for consuming rss feed that might make this easier

2677260
getter	setter
as others have mentioned if you annotate a property getter method then hibernate uses the setter when reading values from the database

2677260
getter	setter
this implies that if you annotate a getter then it needs to call a setter when reading the object from the database

2677268
rss	feed
actually it appears the issue that you re getting is because you have to be logged in to slashdot in order to get that rss feed

2677268
rss	feed
to see what i mean log out of slashdot and then reload the link you provided above - it takes you to an html page instead of the rss feed

2677297
public	protected
if you re not sure what the class s interface is you re not to interfaces or those interfaces aren t yet fully defined start with everything private and make things public protected package-private etc

2677306
coalesce	isnull
looks good to me but in this particular case you can isnull instead of coalesce

2677311
daemons	launchd	daemons	systemd
visual studio 2010 changed the help systemd to run a little daemons and launchd the systemd default web browser to view it

2677311
google-chrome	firefox
i m using firefox for my system browser but would like to use google-chrome for vs help

2677316
memset	malloc	memcpy	memset	memcpy	malloc
with the exception of run-time sized cases the typical idiomatic way to use memset as well as memcpy malloc etc. is to do

2677366
post	get
in order to pull off this attack the attacker must know the server the path to the script and all of the post get parameters but he doesn t need your password or cookie

2677379
google-chrome	safari
if you can restrict yourself to advanced browsers with html5 goodies you can do even more client-side further lightening the load on your server and enhancing scalability how much you can demand of the browser varies widely with your app of course -- if it targets iphone android or other advanced mobile phones specifically or if it s an enterprise-internal web app where the users can be made to use google-chrome or safari say you can be far more demanding than if you want millions of random users out on the open web

2677379
flask	tipfy
for the server-side part i d suggest an ultralight microframework on top of werkzeug and wsgi such as flask or if the server uses app engine tipfy there are others esp

2677379
client-side	server-side
i would not place on the client-side anything that needs security though - since all of your javascript code jquery or not can be examined and hacked easily anything you want to be safe should live server-side

2677440
userid	usergroups
it seems incredibly inefficient for me to first get the id of the supplied usergroups then get the results in userusergroup where usergroupid equals that then get all the userid from that query and then for each of those ids query the user table to grab the object corresponding to that id

2677523
chown	chmod
you should adjust the file s privileges such as chmod 700 file_name and make sure the file is owned by your web server chown apache apache file_name

2677565
google-chrome	firefox
it works in both firefox and google-chrome but not ie

2677574
versioning	upgrade
there are a lot of these jars so if we were to upgrade to a newer versioning of adf we would have to go into every application and redefine some pretty redundant dependencies

2677592
charindex	substr
basically i m using charindex to find the delimiter | and then using substr to find everything just before the delimiter

2677606
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i was hoping someone could help me figure out what to do about a browser inconsistency issue between safari google-chrome and firefox

2677606
google-chrome	firefox
here s a screenshot the one on the left is google-chrome right is firefox

2677638
jar	manifest.mf
little variation of #2 create a jar with a manifest.mf referencing all the jars using a relative path and declare a dependency on this almost empty jar with a system scope

2677678
client-side	server-side
2 if it indeed is a common practice to use the two technologies together is that only true for server-side ajax and asp.net or can client-side ajax also be used in conjunction with asp.net

2677709
post	get
ajax to me is when you actually make a server request to post or get some information with out the page refreshing ie full post back

2677736
client-side	server-side
asp.net is primarily a server-side technology stack which dynamically generates most of the client-side code

2677776
prepare	execute
you have to check for errors at each stage of the process when you connect when you prepare the statement when you bind when you execute and when you close

2677797
margin	text-align
as you can see in navbar i tried to use text-align center or margin auto but it still wont center the whole menu.

2677881
post	get
if you re trying to quickly get a grasp on the major trade-offs involved in nosql systems check out this blog post i wrote visual guide to nosql systems

2677928
post	get
and you do a get or post submit to the same page who have the form and if the user hit back in the browser the password field gets blank

2677933
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
when i am in firefox google-chrome and safari clicking on that image fires the showsomeinfo that s specified in the radio s onclick

2677951
hide	show
now the two alternative contents are each inside a and a js script decides which one to show and which one to hide

2677974
hide	show
then it gives a button the ability to show hide the video i m assuming that is the intended behavior

2677985
int	boolean
all java objects everything except primitives such as int float boolean etc... are references to the pointed-to-object

2677997
csla	.net
i generally write custom build scripts for this and when i tried this time to build a simple .net assembly which internally uses csla it started giving me linq errors

2678011
switching	screens
after you grab a page switching context to the ui thread and update the screens to show how much data you grabbed

2678023
post	get
this blog post also has quite a few useful details about how dlls get resolved as side-by-side assemblies

2678033
hash	hmac
the hmac function builds on established hash functions to use a known key to authenticate a string of text

2678045
put	get
in my lib folder i put a file with a class that should do a render_to_text with template.xml.builder but i get

2678071
maven	cargo
a cleaner solution would be to use the maven cargo plugin and this is my suggestion

2678119
disk	ram
to sum it up i expect either disk cpu or ram to be exhausted before the package slows down but instead its as if the ssis package is taking an afternoon nap

2678171
pop-up	dialog
the dialog that is asking if it s ok to update never pop-up

2678189
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have the following line of code that works fine in firefox google-chrome and safari but not in internet explorer 8

2678189
hide	show
the function simply show and hide a div on clicking the hyperlink

2678221
width	height
based on the ball position you should be able to determine if the ball collides this is based on the fact you treat the ball as a simple bounding box with a set height and width

2678230
google-chrome	firefox
does anyone know how to obtain the browser culture from firefox and google-chrome using javascript

2678249
put	get
i have to use reflection when adding them to know in which array to put each item which is not desirable and i still can t preserve the ordering as i just extract all the items on each list one by one and put them into a new object array on the property get

2678286
keydown	keyup
i am attaching handlers to the keydown and keyup events of a silverlight 3 textbox as so

2678286
keydown	keyup
when i comment out the keydown handler then the keyup will trap the event otherwise only the keydown handler is triggered

2678286
keydown	keyup
can someone explain why the keyup event handler is not firing after the keydown handler does

2678297
width	height	portrait	landscape
update it seems that desktop safari uses the width and height of the screen at the moment and gives itself an orientation of portrait or landscape based on that

2678310
children	parent
and in such situation one had to search through all the children of the most parent class that defines the member

2678331
voip	sip
i create a sip session with mjsip to an external voip provider

2678331
voip	rtp
when i diagnose the network traffic with wireshark i see a bunch of rtp traffic from my localhost behind some kind of nat to the voip provider and nothing back

2678331
voip	sip
the software linphone works using the same localhost and voip provider - though it is using a different sip stack

2678343
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseleave
unlike mouseover and mouseout the mousenter and mouseleave events won t fire when moving to or from a child so they ll behave like you want in this case

2678343
mouseleave	mouseenter
for cleanliness though i d bind .live mouseenter and .live mouseleave separately and remove the if it s much easier to look and see what s going on might be just me though

2678364
onresume	onpause
even that is not completely reliable so you can also write state to preferences when in onpause and read them in onresume

2678391
abstract-class	superclass
abstract-class - a class meant to conceptualize a common ancestor but of which actual instances are not meant to exist shape is an abstract superclass for rectangle and triangle

2678416
inherited	properties
if this is the case you should inherited from usercontrol and you would have the properties available on design time without any other addition

2678434
fixed-point	fractions
the next two steps are more dsp-specific there might be c-callable pragma s to speed up particular math operations like fractions fixed-point math

2678447
pop-up	dialog
you would never be able to do this using facebook only something that uses browser auth the browser pop-up a username pass dialog

2678489
maven	pom.xml
this means that during development use intellij s build based of the pom.xml files which is incremental and quick and only use maven stand alone for continous integration and releases

2678504
google-chrome	firefox
when i refresh the page in google-chrome or firefox everything works fine but when i refresh in ie7 i get a blank page

2678634
jpql	hql
in hibernate i want to run this jpql hql query

2678692
extjs	mootools
why does it use this library and why not jquery dojo mootools extjs etc

2678721
versioning	upgrade
you should figure out all the changes that have been done to your new database and write out a script of all the sql commands needed to upgrade the old database to the new versioning that you re using alter table a add column x etc

2678724
django	web2py
in ror or django or web2py you can describe a database as a set of classes that remaps to tables and the framework having being provided with a connection string to the desired database generates the tables fields relations and in the case of ror and web2py it also keeps it up-to-date eg removing a class drops the table adding a property to the class triggers an alter table add etc

2678727
pop-up	dialog
when the user clicks i want the real image to pop-up in a dialog

2678732
portrait	landscape
the documentation says that if i want to support both portrait and landscape i basically have two ways of doing that

2678770
int	boolean
now each of these questions poses a different but very type specific answer boolean date float int

2678811
portrait	landscape
for instance of the user is holding the device in landscape mode i have already manually rotated the ui to landscape mode and he she clicks the screen lock it will rotate the ui to portrait mode even though the user did not move the device at all

2678819
put	get
i would like to put a hashmap with id name pairs into the autocompletetextview and get the id of the clicked item

2678826
getter	setter
if you need to create any validation in the future you ll want a setter getter

2678832
getter	setter
i use getter and setter in a class if there is more logic involved that just returning this.value

2678845
getter	setter
that entirely depends on what the getter and setter are doing

2678845
getter	setter
but if they are pure javabean like getter setter then i d rather access the variable directly by either a or this.a depending on whether there s a local variable in the scope with exactly that name

2678845
getter	setter
personally i would just keep the getter and setter pure according the javabean spec and add another getter or setter with a self-explaining method name whenever i d like to do something more than just getting setting the value

2678891
cos	sin
if the cylinder of radius r 0 and height h 0 is the image of x y z r cos ï r sin ï z on ï âˆˆ 0 2ï and z âˆˆ -h 2 h 2 then simply choose ï and z randomly on these intervals

2678902
elf	dwarf
bintuls deals mostly with the executable format elf - the debugging stuff stuff is kept in the dwarf format

2678902
elf	dwarf
altogether parsing through elf and dwarf to pull out the types is pretty scary and non-trivial - though exactly what a debugger already has done

2678920
nsimage	nscell
currently i m drawing an nsimage in a custom nscell like so

2678924
voip	rtp
so the voip client ignored the corresponding rtp requests

2678937
google-chrome	firefox
i ve run the sample page on vista ie8 ie8 compatability google-chrome 4.1 and firefox 3.5.9 - if you like i can also do xp and win 7 - but so far they all appear to work in a similar fashion

2679064
integer	unsigned
i am trying to find out the maximum value for an integer signed or unsigned from a mysql database

2679076
rss	feed
this is my javascript function which grabs an rss feed via the proxy script and then spits out the 5 latest rss items from the feed along with a link to my stylesheet

2679076
rss	feed
the goal is to be able to grab the rss feed parse it to grab the titles and links and spit it out into some html on any website on the web

2679076
rss	feed
i m basically making a simple rss widget for my site s various rss feed

2679076
rss	feed
they way my site creates rss feed is that the first title is actually the rss feed title

2679106
for-loop	arrays
i want to make this output on php with a single for-loop with that arrays

2679125
src	attr
var src this attr src

2679139
google-chrome	firefox
if you re serving the page from the file system firefox and i think google-chrome will see it as originating from a different domain

2679167
setinterval	settimeout
the return values from settimeout and setinterval are completely opaque values

2679201
firefox	safari
this problem only occurs in ie as upon testing i found it was fine in firefox and safari

2679226
profiling	instrumentation
the option that you choose depends on which of the three types of profiling you use sampling instrumentation or global

2679281
draggable	droppable
edit oh i forgot to add i had to do this because it appears that sortable draggable droppable doesn t work on lists deeper than one level

2679349
apache	lighttpd
web server software that continuously run like iis apache or lighttpd can execute php scripts without ending themselves

2679358
kde	gnome	fontconfig	freetype
fontconfig is a cross-platform library for finding fonts by either direct name times roman or common aliases like serif - it s what most modern linux software like the gnome kde desktops use to find fonts and is used in conjunction with libraries like pango for text layout and freetype for font rasterizing

2679414
inherited	properties
since basepage inherited from system.web.ui.page they will get access to all of the page methods and properties as well

2679470
hide	show
i m looking for a show hide component much like the toolbox from vs2010 and eclipse s panels when something is maximized

2679539
getter	setter
don t forget the synthesize to create the setter getter

2679590
rss	feed
parse a rss news feed from wsj

2679610
post	get
i had a routine to compress the http post get request parameters into a unique signature

2679611
inherited	properties
uitextview inherited from uiscrollview so you can therefore access all of the same properties as with a uiscrollview

2679621
boost	stl
for example the following boost classes could be used to some extent where one expects an stl container

2679623
for-loop	arrays
i d do that inside of a for-loop starting at 1 and going to the end of the _files arrays

2679645
submit	submission
the easy way out is to read that function yourself and see what it does - if it just submit the form then maybe you can get around it by submission the form without clicking on anything

2679663
subtraction	add
take one off the year and add 12 to the month since there are always 12 months in a year then perform the subtraction

2679705
uiview	subviews
i instantiate my uiview instances in -viewdidload and add them as subviews to the view controller s view property

2679749
realloc	malloc
there is no standard way to ask how much memory has been allocated by malloc realloc

2679754
free	realloc
your best bet is to reallocate copy and then free the memory explicitly -- realloc is quirky

django	web2py
web2py and django are for server-side

2679782
client-side	server-side
in fact web2py contains jquery and has many plugins that combine client-side and server-side functionality and are based on jquery

2679782
django	web2py
jquery is agnostic on which server-side framework you use web2py django or other and server-side frameworks are also agnostic on which client library you use jquery prototype etc.

x86	mips
it s definitely the conventional wisdom that x86 is inferior to mips sparc and powerpc

2679906
pop-up	dialog
idea catches them and pop-up a dialog to let you change the startup memory settings and then exits when you are done

2679922
x86	y86
some assembly classes teach an ultra-simplified subset of x86 called y86 which is simplified beyond the point of not being useful for real use no shift instructions or some teach just the basic x86 instructions

2679944

below is a properties i have on my base control class most controls i created inherited from this the comments should indicate the reason for what looks like hacky code but essentially this is much more reliable than designmode on its own

2680041
subtract	add
for example most x86 integer add subtract instructions modify the flags register

2680041
subtract	add
after performing an add or subtract the next operation is often to look at the flags register to check for overflow sign bit etc

int	double
that seems like waaaay more effort than simply creating a dto with string lastname int numstudents and double combinedgpa

2680125
x86	mips
while not a fault of x86 per se x86 calling conventions weren t standardized like mips was mostly because ms-dos didn t come with any compilers leaving us with the mess of __cdecl __stdcall __fastcall etc

2680154
comparator	comparable
but this is a treemap which means you also have to care about comparisons -- whether you re using comparable objects or an external comparator you need to make sure that your comparisons are consistent are your objects mutable

2680198
submit	submission
it s important to pay attention to this detail otherwise your can really frustrate your users when they submit a form yet nothing happens and their data is lost because your code failed to detect a form submission

2680204
post	put
i put a post together on the topic and i m hoping to find a way of working around the problem but if not i think i ll be going back to a python + django combination until cold starting java requests has less of an impact

the example receives stderr separately from stdout without using a temp file

2680700
textmate	aptana	textmate	notepad++	aptana	rubymine
in more practical terms if you use mutliple os and editors such as at work i used rubymine on win xp and textmate on my macbook at home and one of our developers uses notepad++ and another aptana and we even have one who uses netbeans all of these editors interpret tabs differently - different indentation but 2 spaces are always 2 spaces

2680710

2680714
many-to-many	many-to-one
i have lazy fetch in almost every many-to-many relationship but i have a lot of many-to-one relationships between entities but this is the great advantage of jpa

2680720
illegalstateexception	illegalargumentexception	getter	setter

and i fear that you may have to specialize from qabstractitemview qabstractitemdelegate and qabstractitemmodel

2680862
treemap	treeset
sortedset look-ups for contains are log n check the javadoc but i m pretty sure treeset s underlying structure is treemap whose in turn is a red-black tree and in the worst case no loops or loop at very end it will have to do n look-ups

you are putting the combine fields functionality into the submit event handler which is fine but you don t stop the form from submission so you will never see the result of you operation on the original form

2681251
children	parent
a parent is not coded on the basis what is required by children

2681269

2681897
public	protected
i ve tried both a private and protected get accessor but the override won t compile unless the accessor is public

2681897
accessor	properties
the properties or indexer cannot be used in this context because it lacks the get accessor

2681920
datamapper	activerecord
also datamapper is much more ruby syntax friendy and features like lazy loading when doing chainable conditions like activerecord in rails 3 are there from the beginning

2681920

2682374
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome shift + refresh

2682387
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ddms	adb

2682422
routedevent	frameworkelement
what you want is to fire an icommand in your viewmodel based on a frameworkelement s routedevent

2682460

tiff	png
you may want to use sdl_image official library to load jpg png tiff etc

2682486

int	boolean
found int boolean

2682548
folder	directory
in each language directory i have two folder snippets and projects

2682731
width	height
i ve defined the height and width in the main usercontrol

2682731
width	height
i ve defined the same height and width in the outofbrowsersettings.xml file

2682753
int	chars
it s going to be a performance memory trade-off anyway because writing one int is generally faster than three chars separately

2682756
width	height
i was looking forward to new features for sl4 like ability to bind to width and height properties but it seems that such a trick still can t be done

2682759
mouse	keyboard
for example in ie the event is fired the same way with the keyboard and the mouse but in firefox to trigger the event with the keyboard you need to press enter when the item selected is the good one

2682759
onchange	onblur
the event is also fired when the select loose focus onblur - and only if onchange has not already been fired as gaby pointed out

2682773
min	max
length max - min + 1

2682773
min	max
therefore the answer is length - 1 2 plus 1 2 for even min plus 1 2 for even max

2682773
min	max
note that and the bonuses are 1 - min 2 2 and 1 - max 2 2

2682784

2682889
superclass	subclassing
as of the most current version django does not allow a subclassing to have a variable with the same name as a variable in its superclass if that variable is a field instance

2682925
hide	show
if you re not using the object tag you can show hide this div via javascript

2682928
range	minimum
the minimum number of even numbers possible in a range is equal to half of the length of the array of numbers or rangeend - rangestart

2682948
int	chars
taking your required condition with + meaning string concatenation on the rhs and int addition on the lhs the checksum of any string would be the sum of the checksums of its individual chars

2682950
uiview	subviews
override hittest withevent in uiview to always return self and it will no longer pass touch events to subviews

2682989
puts	fflush
...which calculates everything correctly puts the scrollbars where they need to be fflush right and sets them to the appropriate height

2682994
rel	attr
i put the authenticity token in the rel attr for the anchor assuming the token is unique to the product

post	get
apologies for the rather verbose and long-winded post but this problem s been perplexing me for a few weeks now so i m posting as much information as i can in order to get this resolved quickly

2683093
imperative	declarative
since c++ is not a declarative language but an imperative one you have to derive yourself a procedural implementation of that translation process before you start coding

2683136
ssl	https
to listen to a shoutcast server through ssl you would need to set up a proxy on another port that forwarded https requests to local http requests

2683138
put	get
i was going to put what i m actually getting but in doing the tests for this i ve managed to get a test program to output the text in the right format as is

the first is a checked exception while extending runtimeexception will result in an unchecked-exception

2683326
rtsp	rtmp
rtsp required or can be use rtmp

postgresql	mysql
to my experience the ones which do so are at least the postgresql 8.x and mysql 5.x jdbc drivers

2683356
int	double
if you know that there are only int longs and double can be passed as parameters then you can change method signature to

2683356
int	double
this will work for byte short int long and double

2683393
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
note the rgb ... value is the first match in the array because that is the way firefox google-chrome safari and opera return it independently of how you assign it

2683415
put	get
if you now put in you will get an error

2683464
rss	feed
if need updates from google news you can use rss feed as well

google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome

2683608
cos	sin
cos x 2 1 - sin x 2

2683613
cos	sin
when you need performance you could use a precalculated sin cos table one table will do stored as a dictionary

2683626
hash	md5
since all of these passwords are stored somewhere i wondered if there was any weakness in the hash themselves for standard hashing algorithms used to store passwords like md5

2683629
getter	setter
you re also not supposed to call setter and getter manually

2683633
getter	setter
you define foo to be a property with getter and setter

2683633
getter	setter
those getter and setter use the variable self._foo since you coded it that way

2683640
cos	sin
you d still have to calculate sin x and cos x but it d be decidedly faster if you don t need a high degree of accuracy

2683641
viewmodel	caliburn
about the messagebox service in caliburn v2 trunk shellframework module there is a question answer viewmodel abstracting the functionality of a messagebox with the advantage of letting you to design the ui for the dialog

2683643
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome

2683656
hash	salt
more importantly you would most likely salt the password so that even the same passwords do not produce the same hash

2683684
getter	setter
the difference with a property is that it s available from the outside and that getter setter methods are used

2683708
cgi-bin	ini
i am using dbxpress as the conduit to the ms sql server db and the two ini files dbxconnections.ini dbxdrivers.ini and two dll s required for the connection reside in the same folder as the executables wwwroot cgi-bin

2683737
cos	exp	cos	sin
it could and might well take longer to do it this way just because eulerâ s formula is mostly used to compute the complex exp using sin and cos â and not the other way round but there might be some theoretical optimisation possible

2683737
cos	sin
the headers in for gnu c++ 4.2 are using explicit calculations of sin and cos inside polar so it doesnâ t look too good for optimisations there unless the compiler does some magic see the -ffast-math and -mfpmath switches as written in chiâ s answer

2683801
calloc	malloc
i thought any call to malloc or calloc allocated heap space

2683801
memcpy	memmove

2683889
jsf	seam
i am using a jsf 2.0 to create a web app purely jee6 without spring seam etc.

2683908
getter	setter
note for the example you have python this is overkill there is no need to use getter and setter methods unless they are going to have business logic in them

cos	sin
if you need less precision than the built in sin and cos give you it may be an option

2683953
udp	tcp
tcp connections and udp datagrams cannot simply be passed around as they would in lower levels

2683959
packets	multicast
have you explicitly acquired the multicast lock so that you can receive the multicast packets

2683963
cos	sin
modern x86 processors have a fsincos instruction which will do exactly what you re asking - calculate sin and cos at the same time

2683963
cos	sin
a good optimizing compiler should detect code which calculates sin and cos for the same value and use the fsincos command to execute this

2683984
put	get
what could i do to get all data perhaps a backup of database as cp1257 and put it back as valid utf8

2683991
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
nullpointerexception are extensions of runtimeexception and are therefore unexpected occurances in your program flow

2683997
classcastexception	illegalstateexception
the one sentence answer i would give is that it is the result of a programming error and programming error exceptions are not checked exceptions illegalstateexception classcastexception etc.

2684002
google-chrome	firefox
everything works in firefox and google-chrome

2684002
google-chrome	firefox
i ve considered the fact that uses xhtml 1.0 strict could be causing problems but that would probably affect firefox and google-chrome right

2684002
google-chrome	firefox
my only other theory is that some random css class could be applying a weird attribute to my iframe but again i would expect that to affect firefox and google-chrome

2684046
folder	directory
if your .project and .classpath files are within the eclipse workspace you should define a linked folder to reference and or create files in directory outside your workspace

2684125
hide	show
hide the loading image after it s load it s show the image

2684148
jstl	taglib
ensure that you re declaring taglib in top of jsp files as per jstl 1.1 tlddoc click any of libs to see them

2684154
cos	sin
if you are willing to use a commercial product and are calculating a number of sin cos calculations at the same time so you can use vectored functions you should check out intel s math kernel library

2684160
hash	md5
my question really boils down to how one would combine multiple fields into one md5 or other hash value

2684182
versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade your versioning of .net to .net framework 4 and download linqpad for .net framework 4.0

if you re looking for a pcap only solution you re going to have to intercept the dns request packets examine it and assemble the proper reply before the dns server replies

2684398
getter	setter
i have a feeling i will need to implement a class and getter setter on the android side

2684408
bazaar	git
learning a version control tool git mercurial bazaar subversion... is one of the best things you can invest your time on

2684417

when the submit button is clicked i want the user to get a javascript alert to check atleast one checkbox if none are checked

2684435
retaincount	dealloc
the retaincount of the imageview is 1 in nslog im guessing that when it goes to do super dealloc that it tries to take 1 more retain count off of the imageview when it is 0 already because of the imageview release

2684455
qstandarditem	qtreewidget
i have a class that inherits qstandarditem and i put the elements in a qtreewidget

2684519
int	double
note the dangerousness of this construct when you just merely assign double to int in vb.net the double will be accidentally downsized to int

2684538
post	get
anybody know of more sophisticated programmable scanner that can call a webservice or even just do a basic post get this would eliminate the c# application and the computer to support it

2684554
stdout	stderr
perl scripts die with their messages going to stderr so you will need to capture stderr as well as stdout to see what happened

2684557
width	height
if the pictures height becomes to big for the window then the picture should resize itself according to the height and not the width

2684566
stringbuilder	printwriter
simply replace the stringbuilder with the printwriter that the servletresponse.getwriter method returns

2684600
teamcity	partcover
how do i include full partcover results with teamcity 5

2684603
min	max
i want to search out the max min of an array by simply iterating through and catching the largest

2684658
tunnel	vpn
for connectivity you will need to establish vpn tunnel of some sort between the client server and your server

2684674
min	max
may i suggest that you initialize your max and min so far variables not to infinity but to the first number in the array

2684684
keydown	keyup
i ve played around with every combination of keydown keypress and keyup reading event.keycode event.charcode and event.which but i can t find a single combination that works across all browsers

2684721
post	get
if this doesn t help you perhaps you could post more details - such as what is the data in the event args that do get called

2684749
width	height
how do i convert the height and width of the vba-userform to the same screen dimensions in the c#-winforms application

2684759
nginx	lighttpd
as the video files are static files they should be served by a more static oriented webserver like lighttpd or nginx like it s done with photos

2684859
rar	zip
and now when ever i try to restore a directory the rar zip files are copied to the system hard drive instead of extracting their contents to the hard drive

2684859
rar	zip
my alternative is to write a program that traverses the folders on the external drive and extracts files from the rar zip files

2684870
int	chars
g++ compiler complains about conversions between related types from int to enum from void to class from const chars to unsigned chars etc.

2684950
pop-up	dialog
when i call the application in a browser the ie s standard login dialog pop-up

2684964
portrait	landscape
one other thing is that the lock is just that a lock it should not force you into portrait mode if you are in landscape

2685007
mouseup	mousedown
perhaps you could implement the mousedown and mouseup events

2685007
mouseup	mousedown
on mousedown you could have it change the image to what you expect to see for the pushed in and change it back on mouseup

2685010
put	get
when you are finished with the struct you will need to remember to release the memory for the string or you will get a memory leak because again the struct is not responsible for the memory containing the string only for remembering where you put it

2685033
richfaces	trinidad
in jsf 1.1 and until recent implementations of jsf 1.2 richfaces trinidad etc the order was setpropertyactionlistener or attribute - actionlistener - action

2685033
richfaces	icefaces	richfaces	trinidad	icefaces	trinidad
in jsf 1.2 and now implemented in richfaces and trinidad not sure about icefaces the order is actionlistener - setpropertyactionlistener or attribute - action

2685153
min	max
i set up some short test containing all special cases of floats nan + -inf min max value 0 and random numbers

2685153
sorting	grouping
if you use a grouping length of 16 bits only 2 iterations you have a huge memory overhead when sorting small arrays but you can beat array.sort if it comes to arrays larger than about 100k elements even if not very much

2685221
children	parent
since the parent arguably doesn t care if it has children the event-based approach is ideal

2685221
children	parent
people are stating that the parent clearly know what children are interested in them and i simply tend to disagree with that statement

2685221
children	parent
my designs usually have the children dynamically interested in the parent and the children subscribing to the events is generally the most favorable way of doing so

2685258
google-chrome	safari
i just cannot find a reference doc for webkit google-chrome safari

2685307
implements	extends
this devx article discusses how to implements your own logging by extends the cassini source code yourself but doing so introduces other problems if it s not done properly

2685307
cassini	iis
like cassini the neokernel runs any asp.net web application that works under iis and it addresses the above problems

2685385
put	get
however i d like to get the same effect from using a bookmarklet - however when i put

and then check the properties of the image it is zero width and a garbage number for height in fact same number no matter what the image is

2685572
implements	extends
restrictions from this you can t implements extends two or more interfaces classes that would be same without the generic parameter and are different with the generic parameter

2685628

2685674
firefox	safari
this happens on multiple browsers firefox 3.5 3.6 safari internet explorer 7 8 and multiple platforms mac os 10.5 10.6 and windows xp 7

2685684
inherited	properties
i have a problem where the pages won t compile because the views can t see the model s properties which are inherited from lower level base classes

2685687
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is a little more strict than mysql about type conversion and does not let you implicitly cast convert between numbers and strings

2685782
int	double
directcast really has no business with assigning compatible primitive types int double and their lower and higher counterpart

2685789
width	height
this javascript may also add a background element that is styled to be translucent and to span the entire screen height and width and blocks interaction to the page element under it

2685857
put	get
i do understand i could put a variable is_valid false if the load fails and then check the object using a get method but i think there may be better ways

2685908
rss	feed
the laptop has a small app that simply parses the rss feed our ci server produces

2686000
width	height
i have a php script im currently using that creates thumbnails based on a max width and height

2686004
haskell	scheme
haskell has a good name-spacing scheme that means that two type classes can both have a function of the same name and a type can still implement both

2686021
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
so the typeclass num describes numeric types with addition subtraction and multiplication operators

2686021
int	double
so you could use it to sum a list of int or a list of double or a list of complex because they are all instances of num

2686021
int	double
in the sum example you can pass it a list of int or a list of double but you cannot mix double and int in the same list

2686042
dllmain	getprocaddress
there is no guarantee that dllmain of that binary will be called and therefore if you then attempt to getprocaddress into a function inside that binary results are completely unpredictable as global variables may not have been initialized

2686189
post	get
use a post instead of a get post are not cached

2686190
width	height
what i really want to do is find out where viewrenderbuffer is calling its width and height parameters from

2686190
width	height
in the code below i can see that the backing width and height are being taken from the binded viewrenderbuffer and through the renderbufferstorage call

2686190
portrait	landscape
i don t want to use the screen default 320x480 though because if i display a landscape photo on portrait view it will be stretched out and vice versa

2686213
cvs	svn
as part of migrating full cvs history to hg i ve used cvs2svn to create an svn repo in a local directory

2686248
rss	feed
i am using the following script to generate a rss feed for my site

2686298
printf	atof
i could then exchange data between the c# code and c++ code by using a null-terminated text string and the c++ methods would be simple wrappers around printf and atof functions

2686325
inherited	properties
when you replace the prototype properties with another object this object has it s own constructor properties generally inherited from other constructor or from object.prototype

2686326
nunit	mstest
my unit test background is nunit and mstest

2686335

2686478
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox but not in google-chrome nor safari

2686478
pop-up	dialog
my guess is that both don t create a pop-up dialog that asks the user whether to save or open the file

2686478
google-chrome	safari
correct me if i m wrong but i think for both google-chrome and safari it automatically downloads the file

2686478
google-chrome	safari
how do i then check if the file has been downloaded for safari google-chrome

2686479
client-side	server-side
the code you posted is a server-side call not a client-side one

2686483
post	put	post	get	put	get
i can get the blogger post url from but i can t put that in a src string because blogger s template system is weird

2686510
children	parent
so even though your sky object has mouseenabled set to false your sky and it s children still take up space and therefore still give sky s parent container a hit area to intercept mouse events

2686513
width	height
you want to work out an offset rather than a new width height so that the new sample stays in proportion then use the offset when generating the new image and give it a fixed width height so that it ll crop to a square

2686524
range	median
3 find out which bucket range the median lies

2686611
pull	push
and there are a lot of other people who had already made git pull for the branch release so i cannot use git reset + git push -f

2686628
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you are to go with the border-radius solution there is this awesome website to generate the css that will make it work for safari google-chrome firefox

2686637
client-side	server-side
be careful how you manage dependancies between client-side code and server-side code

2686637
srp	principles
make sure you consider useful design patterns and principles single responsibility principles srp interface segregation principles isp common reuse principles crp

2686656
firefox	safari
i ve tried the example on but only in safari because firefox won t load it at all and it didn t work

2686659
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
the problem occurs where you add subtract multiplying or divide before a comparison where the exponent and mantissa are adjusted

2686681
agile	greenhopper
i use greenhopper which is an agile process addon

2686717
x86	64bit
if the representation is transformed for example from 64bit memory format to 80-bit internal register format on x86 i would expect that the assertion could possibly fire in some circumstances

2686724
width	height
the problem is i m trying to get the loaded image s height and width inside the function gallery_image_load_complete

2686724
width	height
for some reason this image height and width are off it s astohugh the image hasn t fully loaded

2686729
post	get
basically you need to redirect the post request to a get request immediately after processing the action so that the result page will be delivered by a http get request

2686729
post	get
refreshing this http get request won t execute the initial http post request anymore

2686734
gif	png
gif is smaller because it s based on an colour palette of 256 colours rather than the separate rgb values for each pixel or group of pixels in jpg and png

2686744
client-side	server-side
much more powerful you get inheritance and there some good side benefits like using the same methods for server-side validation as you use for client-side

2686751
width	height
you do know that the height and width attributes tell you the size of the image object in the dom not the underlying image files themselves right

2686755
sorting	grouping
which row in the grouping do you want to use for sorting

2686755
sorting	grouping
the temporary table often writes to disk so you get an expensive disk i o as part of the grouping sorting

2686775
gif	png
jpeg is bad at that kind of thing and you ll probably find png to compress better probably better than gif too

2686802
qplaintextedit	qtextedit
how can i set different margins for each qtextblock in qtextedit qplaintextedit

2686836
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
this very simple example works on google-chrome safari and opera

2686861
gif	png
png and gif both use lossless compression but gif only works with 8 bits so it requires your image to have 256 colors or less - this often results in a grainier picture

2686882
portrait	landscape
all testing was done so far in portrait mode so i could focus on programming the main features and later on just do some adjustments for landscape

2686882
width	height
and here enters the problem in - void didrotatefrominterfaceorientation uiinterfaceorientation frominterfaceorientation i added some logging to check the sizes before proceeding but apparently the values for width and height are wrong i say wrong because at a first glance the values does not make sense to me

2686926
postgresql	mysql
mysql supports an optional serial data type presumably for compatibility with postgresql since serial is not standard ansi sql

2686926
integer	unsigned
you get the same number of distinct values whether you declare an integer signed or unsigned 2 32 for an int and 2 64 for a bigint

2686935
post	get
since you do get some of the data i would maybe start using jquery to create some type of a checksum of the form elements and values it knows about and send this aggregated checksum along with the form post

2686937
hex	binary
xxd -r then restores the binary file from the hex file

2686962
fflush	gets
the id gets assigned after the fflush

it is just slightly modified versions of the built in slidedown slideup so that they become slideright slideleft

2686970
folder	directory
okay i ve gotten past this exception by manually creating the webdriver-extension.zip file and copying it to the selenium firefox folder in my site-packages directory

2686977
portrait	landscape
it is using the default setup popover in portrait table view on the left in landscape

2686977
portrait	landscape
the problem i am seeing is that when the app starts in the simulator running in landscape mode the ui paradigm is the one intended for portrait mode master list is a popover is what loads

2687027
mdpi	hdpi
i know the android drawables website but i would like to get the correct hdpi mdpi and ldpi version preferable the original ones

2687042
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
everything works just fine in firefox safari and google-chrome

2687048
gridview	sqldatasource
i have asp gridview displaying client requests using asp sqldatasource

2687068
config	ini
use a config file such as a ini which is supported by php to specify a data directory and read from

2687088
folder	directory
you need to use a temporary directory that is within the folder hierarchy of your web application

2687108
submit	submission
pressing enter in an input field submit a form which depending on your form s action attribute may well be submission the form to the same page causing it to appear like a refresh

2687112
width	height
if your view is auto-rotating then the width height have been translated for you but when you ask for the actual dimensions of the screen you get back the actual dimensions of the screen

2687196
hash	salt
the password is hash and has a salt

2687196
hash	salt
because of the lack of documentation i do not know if the salt is append to the password and then hash how how it is created

2687199
post	get
the correct method would be to follow the prg post redirect get pattern

2687245
width	height
x + width left edge y + height bottom edge.

2687301
boost	stl
that said you may just want to use stl or boost for foreach unless you specifically want to create your own

2687302
udp	tcp
what are sources of latency in process of sending receiving tcp udp packets in linux 2.6

2687316
min	max	width	height
i removed the min and max width and height lines and changed the android layout_width height attributes to the size i wanted and everything is now working out just fine

2687377
post	get
i chose to create a custom back-end if anyone has gotten this working with signals please post code - i wasn t able to get it working that way

2687382

i want the panel being shown as active when the hosted control get focus kind like the behavior of a normal window whereas the window becomes the panel and the titlebar becomes the toolstrip

2687475
division	multiplication
don t make assumptions about byte order i don t do any bit shifting -- i assume gcc will optimize my power of two multiplication division for me

2687486
int	boolean
you could combine a bunch of boolean into a single int column and use bit masks to read the values but this seems unnecessarily complex and is something i would consider only if there was some high-end performance need for it

2687499
submit	submission
in other words when you do a form submission http post from your spring form it s then calling that submit method

2687516
pop-up	dialog
this will cause the call to _openfeeddialogiframe to actually call _openfeeddialogwindow so your feed dialog will be in a pop-up instead of in an iframe

2687641
children	parent
this way each parent can have multiple children

2687664
google-chrome	firefox

2687721
int	chars
the variable test is the string a test2 is the int 64 the chars number of and test3 is the int 97 a

2687721
int	chars
the surprise is probably that in ruby the elements of strings are int not strings or chars

2687735
int	chars
ruby 1.8 int contain chars numbers for single chars indexing

2687739
for-loop	loops
you need to wrap the contents of the for-loop in a function that takes i as a parameter then call the function in loops

2687792
min	max
doing it like the code above should solve your min max issues if you want to stick to your current method then set values like this

2687804
google-chrome	firefox
i ve been able to produce this with css3 and it works flawlessly on firefox and google-chrome

2687831

i m going to shamelessly plug my script which automates checking for valid formats automatically choosing the best quality format for a video and works on both the flash and html5 variants of youtube pages as well as vimeo

2687849
boost	stl
so i use boost shared_ptr for all the various reference-counting benefits it provides -- reference counting for starters obviously but also the ability to copy assign and therefore store in stl containers

2687926
width	height
the only problem is that if the height and width are not equal the rotated image will no longer appear at the jlabel s origin 0 0

2687926
width	height
if i have an image whose width is greater than its height rotating that image using this method and then painting it will result in the image being painted vertically above the point 0 0 and horizontally to the right of the point 0 0

2687932
sorting	filtering
i also need the column filtering sorting for the cgridview to work using ajax

we have a suite of related products written in vb6 with some c# and vb.net projects and all the source is kept in a single subversion repository

2687947
post	put
ps sometimes rest implementations use http put to create a resource and post to modify or act on an existing resource

2687953
inherited	subclassing
note that this doesn t directly support inherited -- if for example class foo maps in type2templ to template bar then you make a subclassing baz of foo but don t explicitly record in type2templ what template its instances should use you ll get the default template for baz s instances

2687957
apache	nginx
how can i avoid having a direct link to the mp3 while still serving through nginx apache

2687957
apache	nginx
how can i accomplished what i get above while still making nginx apache serve the media

2687957
apache	nginx
i use nginx for my frontend and reverse proxy back apache development server so i think if it does require some sort of mod_rewrite work i will have to find something that would work with nginx

2687961
int	chars
i ve already asked a question of converting int array to chars but it was recommended to start a new thread on this in the networking section instead

2687969
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko
starting from version 2.0 the library allows integration of microsoft internet explorer apple safari webkit and mozilla firefox gecko engines for rendering html web pages thus ensuring compliance with many internet standards html 4 css xml javascript adobe flash and others

2688004
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
of course we also support firefox safari opera and google-chrome but that s boring my testing algorithm is as follows

2688004
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
before release confirm that opera safari and google-chrome are still correct

2688053
children	parent
each object keeps track of its parent owner and children

2688071
serializable	deserialization
for example a big-endian platform might always convert to little-endian before sending and likewise convert back to big-endian when receiving. you cannot treat non-pod types as a stream of bytes such as std string so you need to write serializable functions for those to transform their data into a stream of bytes and deserialization functions to transform it back

2688083
ubuntu	linux
since i use ubuntu microsoft would need to release a linux version of their browser - and because halley s comet will return long before that happens i am staying away from ie

2688086
getter	setter
there s no const keyword as in other languages however it is possible to create a property that has a getter function to read the data but no setter function to re-write the data

2688086
getter	setter
use the fact that we chose these very names for our own getter setter and create a keyword-dictionary using the double asterisk applied to all the local definitions of that scope to pass parameters to the property function

2688098
mouse	keyboard
bunch of initialisation functions are called -- including methods where i can specify my own mouse and keyboard handlers etc

2688116
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari both support xhr2 uploads with progress events so you can do progress bars etc

2688129
width	height
btw you may have a problem with the label reporting its preferred size - you might need to override getpreferredsize and account for swapping the images width and height if rotated

2688149
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
objectoutput objout new objectoutputstream new fileoutputstream f

2688155
put	get
about the only thing i can t get working correctly is when i put a disclosure-button on my custom cell xib

2688209
typedef	struct
the old non-c++0x workaround for the missing templated typedef would be to use a templated struct with a nested typedef

2688261
daemons	systemd
the serice discovery daemons should willing to accomodate these dynamic changes in the systemd

2688267
profiling	debugging
it s sort of the de-facto standard php debugging and profiling tool

2688277
xdebug	xhprof
in addition to the excellent xdebug as mentioned by others you can also look at xhprof

2688279
put	get
you need to first start all threads in a loop put them in an array list or some similar container then join them in a separate loop to get concurrent execution of the methods

2688304
junit	easymock
still now i am using junit i came across easymock i am understanding both are for the same purpose

2688304
junit	easymock
what are the advantages does easymock has over the junit

2688349
junit	easymock
i am not sure but i think junit and easymock instead of being exclusive to each other are supposed to work in tandem together

2688349
junit	easymock
this purpose of providing mock objects in junit is served by easymock and other similar mock object creators

2688374
put	get
anything you put after response.end won t get executed because it throws a threadabortexception to stop execution of the page at that point

2688377
free	malloc
i read somewhere that it is disastrous to use free to get rid of an object not created by calling malloc is this true

2688388
button	checkbox
i don t use submit button to submit the selected checkbox indeed i use link anchor to send those values

2688411
free	malloc
only call free on addresses returned by malloc family functions

2688424
shadowing	named
shadowing is based solely on named not at all on the types of the parameters.the compiler observes that there is a function in derieved-class that hasthe correct named and it stops looking

2688427
free	malloc
malloc means removing a suitable block from the list free means adding it to the list again

2688430
free	malloc
it has to do with how malloc and free are implemented

2688430
free	malloc
one possible way to implement malloc free is to put a small header before each allocated region

2688430
free	malloc
if that string constant is in read-only memory it often is this hypothetical implementation would cause a segfault and crash either after a later malloc or when free adds the object to its freelist

2688441
getter	setter
if i have a class person with a property name and its getter get_name and setter set_name methods then after instantiating the objects and setting the property

2688446
free	malloc
it would certainly be possible for an implementation of malloc free to keep a list of the memory blocks thats been allocated and in the case the user tries to free a block that isn t in this list do nothing

2688466
calloc	malloc
it s known that calloc is different than malloc in that it initializes the memory allocated

2688466
calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
so in everyday work i regard calloc as malloc + memset

2688466
calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
my question is why is malloc + memset so much slower than calloc

2688470
free	malloc
malloc and free on a conforming hosted c implementation are built to standards

2688470
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
the standards say the behavior of calling free on a heap block that was not returned by malloc or something wrapping it calloc is undefined

2688470
free	malloc
you won t break the standard by making the behavior of free on blocks not allocated by malloc consistent and even possibly useful

2688471
versioning	upgrade
if you do not have something seriously wrong with your persistence frameworks than you should be able to upgrade the app on devices while retaining the data just by providing the users with a new versioning of the .ipa file

2688480
getter	setter
you usually want to use getter setter to get more control over what can be assigned to a property and what can t

2688480
getter	setter
in either case you should force the use of the getter setter by making the property private or protected otherwise it s pretty pointless

2688497
post	get
i m going to flesh out jason s answer i ve marked my post as a community wiki so i shouldn t get any points for this

2688500
free	calloc
because on many systems in spare processing time the os goes around setting free memory to zero on its own and marking it safe for calloc so when you call calloc it may already have free zeroed memory to give you

2688513
webkit	gecko
a possible path is to use some layout rendering engine such as webkit or gecko

2688518
mockito	easymock
you might reconsider using easymock though - most people are currently using or in the process of switching to the more advanced and more actively developed mockito inspired by easymock

2688522
calloc	malloc
the short version always use calloc instead of malloc +memset

2688522
memset	calloc
in some cases calloc will do less work because it can skip memset entirely

2688522
calloc	malloc
memory allocators like malloc and calloc are mostly there to take small allocations anything from 1 byte to 100s of kb and group them into larger pools of memory

2688522
calloc	malloc
however since the program you re asking about is allocating for a large amount of memory at once malloc and calloc will just ask for that memory directly from the kernel

2688522
memset	calloc
the standard library zeroes the ram with memset and returns from calloc

2688522
calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
this is an enormous amount of extra work and explains why calloc is faster than malloc and memset

2688522
calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
if end up using the memory anyway calloc is still faster than malloc and memset but the difference is not quite so ridiculous

2688522
free	calloc	free	memset	memset	calloc
in general the shared pool might have junk data stored in it from old memory that was used and free with free so calloc could take that memory and call memset to clear it out

2688522
memset	calloc
the calloc function is not using some special memory-aligned version of memset and that wouldn t make it much faster anyway

2688522
calloc	malloc
the performance difference here is much larger i measured more than three orders of magnitude on my system between malloc +memset and calloc

2688522
calloc	malloc
instead of looping 10 times write a program that allocates memory until malloc or calloc returns null

2688531
realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	calloc
calloc and realloc are valid object sources for free too

2688551
post	get
if you escape a value obtained from get post cookie input it will already have addslashes applied to it so passing it through mysql_real_escape_string will in fact double quote

2688552
inline	inlining
if the operations are inline and optimised well by your compiler you shouldn t usually see any difference between writing the code well using operators to make it readable and maintainable and manually inlining everything

2688552
inline	inlining
i would recommend writing the code with operators and then if you can prove you can speed it up by manually inlining duplicate the code and manually inline the second version

2688569
post	get
there are some examples of doing this using get and post in the net http documentation

2688595
jquery	curvycorners
jquery curvycorners plugin

2688595
jquery	curvycorners
so if you really want curved corners i would recommend you to go with jquery curvycorners plugin

2688617
lxml	elementtree
i m not sure why you are moving between lxml and elementtree unless you are interacting with another library that already uses elementtree

2688622
keydown	keyup
i think you are using the keyup or keydown events in those events you get actually the key what was pressed not the actual character if the user presses a or a you will get 65 as the key code

2688631
short	base
in short you can convert a pointer to a member of an accessible non-virtual base class to a pointer to a member of a derived class as long as the member isn t ambiguous

2688631
short	base
in short you can convert from a derived to a base if you can convert from a to a though you can only use the on objects that are of type d or are descended from d

2688639
trie	tree
how does trie and b+ tree compare for indexing lexicographically sorted strings on the order some billions

2688668
daemons	launchd
once i ve completed the process i ve made some adjustments to allow running it as a daemons mostly storing the standard output to a file to allow easy logging and then create a bash script that launchd a start-stop-daemon command

2688670
trie	tree
b+ tree section characteristics trie unfortunately spread all over the article

2688693
trie	tree
but if you want to get the first n children from a substree then a trie is the best choice because you simply visit less nodes than in a b+ tree scenario

2688768
phpmyadmin	adminer
if you mean by dumping creating sql code to recreate the table i d suggesting using existing tools to manage mysql such as phpmyadmin or adminer

2688789
uiview	subviews
however if i add both as subviews to the base uiview the touches only get tracked is the semitransparent uiview since its the last one added

2688789
uiview	uiwindow
i also tried to use hittest in addition to subclassing uiwindow but the base uiview needs to push pop navigation controlling ability so i don t think i can subclass uiwindow to push onto the navigation stack

2688843
width	height
but they may not be very well-formed for example the width or height attribute may be missing

2688849
fsockopen	die
die fsockopen call failed with error number

2688919
min	max
the in the regex means quantifier for a min of 3 and a max of 30 repetitions

2688919
min	max
means min of one and max of

2688938
int	chars	int	double
for information attribute arguments can only be of types bool byte chars short int long float double string system.type and enums

2688963
google-chrome	safari
also not php related but you can see the complete request header along with the responses in any webkit browser safari google-chrome via the resources-tab in the developer tool

2688976
trie	tree
finally b+ tree is admittedly more difficult to implement than a trie it s more on a red-black tree level of complexity

2689002
stdout	stderr
i could redirect the stderr and stdout output of the command to a temporary file which has a random file name then tail the file and pipe to grep for the end conditions i.e

2689076
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to drag one img and so it fires ondragenter for ie and dragover event for standard browsers on ie and firefox after the user drags it could fire ondrop event however on webkit based google-chrome and safari i need to cancel or preventdefault on the dragover event doing that so will disable the dragging

2689091
force.com	salesforce
i think ant using the salesforce force.com migration tool is the way to go for the most part

2689208
hide	show
when the user clicks the first button you can then hide it and show the disabled one making it look like the same button was disabled

2689231
post	put	post	get	put	get
rather than casting to formsauthentication simply get the cookie .aspxauth or the name specified in the web.config and send it to flash and then let flash put it as a post variable while uploading then read request.forms postvariable and create the formsauthenticationtickt as illustrated by the tutorial in the question

2689246
google-chrome	safari
webkit safari google-chrome does allow multiple backgrounds

2689349
daemon	cron
and restart the cron daemon

2689390
jobs	cron
if this is the case you may want to set up a few different cron jobs and do it in batches

2689390
rss	feed
don t scrape html when there is a json or rss feed you could use instead

2689408
int	double
compare this with for example - this is a pointer to a function that takes double as a parameter and returns int .

2689441
stdout	stderr
but i want stderr stdout redirected to a separate frame as is the feature of wx.app

2689464
profiling	debugging

2689579
min	max
cos-all-limited.1.2 an all model group must appear in a particle with min occurs max occurs 1 and that particle must be part of a pair which constitutes the content type of a complex type definition

2689598
portrait	landscape
basically the first view is portrait the second landscape the third portrait again yes i know this is less than ideal but that s the design and i ve got to implement it

2689598
portrait	landscape
if i pop the controller back to my portrait view which has an appropriate shouldautorotate... then that remains in broken landscape view until the device is returned to portrait orientation

2689628
folder	directory
i created a database with empty schema which i dropped in the root folder of the project and in properties i choosed build action embedded resources and copy to output directory copy always

2689644
sortedmap	sortedset
if on the other hand you decide to put your items into some kind of sortedset or sortedmap make sure that the votes and other fields used by the comparator stay unchanged

2689678
accessor	properties	getter	setter	mutators	setter	mutators	getter
in the second statement i ve also assumed that you have declared description and name as properties of the man class so that they can be accessed from other classes via accessor mutators a.k.a getter setter

2689687
stdout	stderr
i will update if i find a way to get rid of the spammyness by the way redirecting stdout and stderr to dev null does not help.

2689752
children	parent
which would mean the rule is applied to ul elements that are children of li elements when that parent li is hovered

2689758
inherited	properties
let s not discuss this approach itself please and want my ide to know about inherited class methods and properties

2689793
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the strangest thing with this is that it is working on ie6 7 8 google-chrome safari and firefox 3.6

2689794
vb6	vba
i see evidence in a google search that vb6 this usually includes vba has a hard limit of 254 controls in a form

2689804
getter	setter
i would recommend using properties instead of defining your own getter setter

2689821
getter	setter
why bother with getter and setter

2689827
post	put
my current idea add a list of descriptions with text - culture pairs instead of the description field and an additional subressource descriptions to the accommodation for the creating post updating put and deleting delete of new translations

2689855
hide	show
i use the onmouseover and onmouseout events to either show or hide the sub menu depending on which item is selected

2689874
children	parent
my application works fine but i would really like impose a referential integrity rule that would prohibit deletion of parent objects if they have children e.i

2689914
centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
operating system is linux ubuntu or centos if that would matter

2689916
hide	show
therefore parent.remove view2d and parent.add view3d is not really a solution and we have to call setvisible false and setvisible true on the jcomponent s that contain our 2d and 3d views in order to hide and show them

2689926
installation	upgrade
after an upgrade our confluence installation doesnt show the help tips on wiki markup a box on the right side of the edit pane which give basic informations on wiki markup

2689963
boost	stl
i m looking for some stl boost or similar container to use the same way indexes are used in databases to search for record using a query like this

2690016
implements	extends
i am trying to use my own namedhtmlselectoneradio which extends htmlselectoneradio and implements namingcontainer but i m still guessing how to inject it with facelets

2690032
stdout	stderr
when wx.app says it will redirect stdout stderr to a popup window what it means really is that it will redirect sys.stdout and sys.stderr so if you directly write to sys.stdout or sys.stderr it will be redirected to a popup window try this

2690085
width	height
img border 0 src images header.jpg width 550 height 90

2690087
hide	show
my issue is the divs with images in them will only show up until .platform hide is ran to the point that those divs won t even show up in .platform

2690105
int	double
my only thought is that perhaps they felt it better to round to the nearest millisecond rather than risk the caller truncating a double to an int

2690203
pop-up	dialog
from time to time i need to show dialog pop-up window to get a user response back cancel ok and other kinds of asynchronous user feedback while locking the background for interactivity

2690211
boost	stl
recalling that boost program_options variables_map derives from you can do perfectly legal stl map processing including an insert.

2690237
opera	firefox
this solution works with firefox opera and ie8

2690259
dictionary	map	treemap	linkedhashmap
java includes multiple map implementations such as treemap or linkedhashmap whereas python generally sticks to the single dictionary implementation

2690276
bash	zsh
it might be in bash zsh perl python or any other scripting language

2690297
post	get
the application needs to send post data to scripts and get the response

2690307
ilist	iqueryable
it is an implementation of ilist t and works by populating a private list with all results from the specified iqueryable t

2690324
folder	directory
i am trying to get the code to list all the directory in a folder change directory into that folder and get the name of the current folder

2690326
folder	directory
when you re in the ide the current directory will probably not be the project folder but your vs6 vb6 folder

2690328
rar	gzip	rar	zip
i used wireshark to determine that this is valid gzip stream also tested with zip rar and both can uncompress it

2690329
getter	setter
to use property access you can move xmlvalue to either getter or setter xmlaccessortype is not needed at all

2690332
rss	feed
you can read and created rss feed using syndiacationfeed and system.servicemodel.syndication namespace

2690337
width	height
i tried applying the cgaffinetransform on a cgsize and then get the height x width to see how much it scaled but height x width have strange values depending on the rotation found in the cgaffinetransform so .

2690347
post	get
now to get the 11th to 20th post from category 3 that is the next 10 post we ll want to use the offset parameter of query_posts

2690376
multiplying	add
multiplying the vector with a negative constant and add it to the corner and you ll obtain a position p outside the triangle

2690450
post	get
does anyone know how i can get the values i should be sending there and how i can make rails read it from http post rather than trying to find it as a cookie

2690453
public	protected
making it private isn t necessary - the decision to make it private protected or public depends on whether you want to make it available only within b within b and b s derived classes or everywhere.

2690455
haskell	ocaml
it seems in very strict fp like haskell and ocaml this is not possible

2690489
outputstream	inputstream
to the point just obtain the image as inputstream from db by resultset#getbinarystream and write it to the outputstream of the response as obtained by httpservletresponse#getoutputstream the usual java io way

2690489
folder	directory
the .. goes a step backwards in the directory structure so that you go from the folder to

2690509
vsto	add-in
i am trying to read a resource file in vsto shared add-in using the below code

2690517
translation	localization
the localization variables referenced in the error message have been translation in the firewall_no-no.wxl file

2690532
put	get
put that all together and you get a cmakelists.txt file something like this

2690673
int	double
if double this may be a int you must convert and compare this values

2690675
getter	setter
the statement actually calls the getter and not the setter of your position property

2690684
int	chars
the runtime has no idea if 4 bytes is an int a struct a pointer or a 4 chars

2690717
children	parent
from the usage perspective it would still look like a single .exe that you run only one time but behind the scenes you d have a parent process with two children

2690741
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade the plugin to versioning 1.4 and to the newest hudson server 1.355

2690744
post	get
i didn t get the feel for the binding your using from your post but i believe that these settings are common across major ones

2690760
rss	feed
i am trying to generate a full rss feed however when loading the feed in mail it just shows the title with a read more link at the bottom

2690761
subtract	add
overflow is in this case what happens when i add 1 to 9 subtract 10 from 10 add 1 to overflow overflow gets added to the next digit

2690827
google-chrome	safari
webkit safari google-chrome etc. has built-in support for css-based transitions effects and mozilla is working on adding them as well

2690894
disk	ram
is there anything i can do to speed up the query apart from adding more ram more cpu faster disk

2690935
rsa	aes
there is much information about data encryption on the internet so i m not going into details here but be sure you look for keywords like public key infrastructure rsa aes hybrid cryptosystem digital signature

2690988
x86	64bit
i don t know what your platform is but in case of x86 for example you can use 32 bit ints and hardware support for giving 64bit result of 32 bit multiplication

2691038
gmp	bigint
there are some excellent existing bigint libraries out there gmp tommath that you can just use without having to write your own from scratch

2691130
textview	imageview
i am using a listview to display my custom item layout which may contain some textview and an imageview

2691171
folder	directory
this should work as long as the src folder is set to the above directory and the apple class has the correct package declaration

2691173
division	modulo
it s probably pretty slow and beware of integer division just like built in modulo

2691187

2691202
gridview	repeater
basically we have lots of data that get rendered in html reports mostly using repeater or gridview

2691215
httpresponse	request
in your controller if the user can not delete the record associate a bad request code to your httpresponse so your onfailure function will be called and your popup displayed

2691242
memset	calloc
try using calloc instead or memset ing your buffer so that it starts out clear

2691246
width	height
i fixed in css the width and the height of the cells 40px width 25px height in my case

2691271
mallet	maxent
mallet has implementations of crfs and maxent that can probably do the job well

2691297
post	get
i have a page in which users can make post its similar to facebook i am trying to figure out how i can get it to run the php loop say every 10mins in order for the person to see new post

screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
it s my understanding that designing three unique interfaces ldpi mdpi and hdpi would be the best way to go about supporting all the potential android screens with minimal scaling distortion

2691368
mdpi	hdpi
if i create an image for the benchmark mdpi let s say my image is 300x210 just for example how to i determine what size i will need to recreate that image at ldpi hdpi

how do i create a flat file schema so that biztalk can interpret each line of data regardless of whether the line was delimiter by linefeed 0x0a or crlf 0x0d 0x0a

2692181
coalesce	nvl	coalesce	nullif	nvl	nullif
if i_relaunch can be null then you need to use some of null handling functions nvl nvl2 nullif coalesce lnnvl to be sure that you have correct result

2692215
interbase	firebird
alexdown s answer is quite right -- under 1.8 you need a one-row relation to do this like oracle s dual or the interbase firebird table

#1 above alerts true because all arrays inherited the push properties from array.prototype it refers to a function that pushes a value onto the end of the array

2692366
uitableview	reloaddata
calling uitableview reloaddata in your viewwillappear in the tableviewcontroller class is sometimes a good idea just depends on your architecture

2692369
subtraction	addition
addition subtraction is easy you do it by parts the only gotcha is taking the carry-over from the lower part to the higher part

2692369
division	multiplication
for multiplication division it s harder ie more instructions

2692666
cpu	processors
it really doesn t depend on the size of the objectâ it depends on the cpu resources it uses memory processors etc.

2692675
put	get
this is a little tricky since _##name will normally get you _name no matter what you put in

2692676
equals	gethashcode
pair implements equals and gethashcode consistently so you don t need to resort to multi-level dictionaries which are more cumbersome and probably less effective

2692770
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but does not work in ie8

2692816
haskell	ocaml
i can t speak to ocaml but i d say that the main difficulty in haskell is that deserialization requires knowing the type in advance --there s no universal way to mechanically deserialize from a format figure out what the resulting value is and go from there as is possible in languages with unsound or dynamic type systems

2692829
put	get
i am building a restful data store and leveraging conditional get and put

2692829
put	get
during a conditional put the client can include the etag from a previous get on the resource and if the current representation doesn t match the server will return the http status code of 412 precondition failed

2692857
versioning	upgrade
if any of the plugins are still under development take this opportunity to upgrade to the latest versioning both for 1.4 support and because the latest versioning likely fixes bugs etc

2692886
int	chars
you might want to reference the format table for sprintf in the future but for this particular example 02d means to print an int d taking up at least 2 chars 2 and left-padding with zeros instead of spaces 0

2692911
punctuation	words
i would basically like to figure out if a words has a punctuation mark at the end and change the color for characters before the punctuation mark

2693002
client-side	server-side
is there any python library that can keep a client-side sqlite database in sync with a server-side postgresql database

2693037
inherited	properties
the hasownproperty method should be used to avoid iterating over inherited properties

2693107
tolower	toupper
and how tolower and toupper are implemented

2693107
tolower	toupper
the issue is that tolower and toupper don t create a new object but modify existing object

2693134
.when	each
i m using qt 4.6.2 .when i compile the project using macx-g++ meaning the g++ compiler it doesn t include the stdafx.h automatically for each header

2693139
linefeed	delimiter
it sounds as if each line is a record but some lines end in linefeed and others in crlf and you need to have both as a delimiter at the same level

2693139
linefeed	delimiter
i don t know of a way to specify more than one child delimiter with the flat file schema by itself but one possible solution could be to write a custom pipeline component for the decode stage of your receive pipeline to replace the crlfs with lfs then use linefeed as the delimiter on the flat file schema

2693143
agile	metrics
agile methodologies are rather prevalent these days but i cannot seem to find much documentation on what metrics are most useful and why

2693143
agile	metrics
what metrics are best for agile and why

2693163
mouseup	mousedown
i can t comment on the prototype specifics but you could probably do this by creating an interval using setinterval that is started on mousedown and is stopped using .clearinterval on mouseup

2693172
for-loop	loops
in case 2 - since the variable is scoped only within the for-loop it cannot be accessed outside that loops

2693205
post	put	post	get	put	get
simple examples of controllers in a restful architecture suggest four actions per controller -- index create update delete -- corresponding with the get post put and delete

2693217
explode	substr
it looks like you could substr on the space then explode on the s and then be able to get each piece to work with

2693219
put	get
if your problem was that your resource contains the last-modified date and last-modified user and you had to do a get after every put then i would be more convinced of the need to twist the rules

2693227
getter	setter
for example a class with only getter and setter

2693247
mouseover	mousedown
it doesn t draw the mouseover or mousedown state and it doesn t support the indeterminate intermediate state

2693262
mouseup	mousedown
there is an event for when the mouse is down mousedown and one for when the mouse is up mouseup

2693284
post	get
it may be ok in your application to do so but consider that get post request are not the only places that data can be retrieved

2693311
uiview	subviews
i am adding a uilabel as a subviews to a uiview and sometime later i want to hide it

2693348
uiview	subviews
you can use uiview s subviews property

2693366
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning of jquery

2693367
goto	break
the statement list of a switch section typically ends in a break goto case or goto default statement but any construct that renders the end point of the statement list unreachable is permitted

2693368
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception fall into two categories those that extend runtimeexception and those that extend error

2693389
post	put	post	get	put	get
my controllers have methods get put post delete etc

2693395
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception runtimeexception are intended to deal with programming errors and other unexpected problems but should be caught and handled in the application

2693417
post	get
the database is adding it s row at the same time my post page runs it s query to get the id back i think

2693441
hide	show
i am trying to show hide a flash object based on click of button but the code is not working

2693447
extjs	mootools
you should use jquery mootools or extjs for something like this

2693448
bluetooth	usb
for what it s worth i ve noticed much bigger delays opening bluetooth virtual com ports than regular or usb ports

2693489
linefeed	delimiter
since linefeed and crlf both share the linefeed character i set the line delimiter as linefeed 0x0a

2693489
linefeed	delimiter
notice that since the linefeed and crlf delimiter have different lengths 1 and 2 characters respectively i had to do a couple more changes to the schema to ensure that both are handled correctly

2693489
linefeed	delimiter
however in order to still be able to handle the linefeed line delimiter make sure you set the allow early termination flag to true

2693516
hide	show
but i don t want to show hide the gif manually on every request too

2693526
google-chrome	firefox
results are identical in google-chrome and firefox

2693556
initializer	class-method
i collect a ton of these in my web service class and just initializer the web service class and let methods on this class call class-method on the results classes

2693556
initializer	class-method
i guess i am asking if class-method lives or are treated different on the stack and in memory than messages to initializer objects

2693564
integer	unsigned
then the compiler correctly decides i want a unsigned int there and generates an expensive call to a 16x16 bit integer multiply routine

2693564
integer	unsigned
as i read the integer promotions described in 6.3.1.1 the effect of the first line shall be as if foo and 10 were promoted to unsigned int the multiplication performed and the result stored as unsigned int in foo_u16

2693590
getter	setter
update of course if this conversion is only need for one field of one class it might be more simple to define a pair of alternative setter getter getfieldoneasstring setfieldoneasstring in your class and use in your mapping

2693606
ssl	https
generally ssl load balancing means that the client is talking to the load balancer over https and the load balancer is talking to the web server via http

2693620
int	chars
the promotion is guaranteed but the promotion is made to signed int type if the range of unsigned chars fits into the range of signed int

2693620
int	chars
if your compiler interprets it differently it could be a bug in the compiler again under the assumption that range of unsigned chars fits into the range of signed int

2693632
draggable	droppable
it gives offsets for the draggable element and the droppable element

2693632
draggable	droppable
and with a little math you can get the position of the draggable element relative to the top left corner of the droppable

2693655
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
my understanding is that since the variable is a local array the memory comes from the stack and does not need to be free and moreover since no malloc calloc realloc was used the behaviour is undefined

2693673
rss	feed
i have a pipe that filters an rss feed and removes any item that contains stopwords that i ve chosen

2693676
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
malloc calloc or realloc

2693677
hash	salt
i can hard code the seed for the key iv which is hash with sha256 with a time stamp salt and then assigned as the key or iv in php source code that s on the server so that is pretty safe

2693681
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
you can only free something you got from malloc calloc or realloc function

2693740
rmdir	mkdir
i want to use system commands like mkdir and rmdir while running a java program

2693774
int	chars
can anyone tell me why gets abc works with chars but not with int

2693790
put	get
now i like to get the content in out and put them into array

2693805
g++	gcc
ccache howtos have examples which suggest to create symlinks named gcc g++ etc and make sure they appear in path before the original gcc binaries so ccache is used instead

2693822
cout	cin
by the way since you appear to be using c++ or at least your choice of tags says so perhaps you should try std cin std cout

2693830
std	ostream	cout	cin	ostream	istream
if you are using c++ then using the c++ i o stream library std cin std cout std ostream std istream std fstream etc. is a far better way to perform input output than using these other functions

2693878
pull	push
for the sake of simplicity and interoperating with a less-capable system svn it is recommended that all git svn users clone fetch and dcommit directly from the svn server and avoid all git clone pull merge push operations between git repositories and branches

2693899
folder	directory
is this possible to write a redirect for this or do i have to place these folder in the public_html root directory

2693901
jquery	scriptaculous
if you were using either afterupdateelement in prototype scriptaculous or the result function in jquery this would be possible and a lot more straightforward

2693923
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for safari google-chrome and firefox you can use the css3 border-image

2693928
gtk	cairo
i answer myself cairo uses premultiplied color argb and gtk only it s able to manage true color rgba

2693938
filesystems	ntfs
you won t get true filesystems transactions for ntfs in xp

2694027
int	double
here sum s call to sum_helper is not a tail call because sum_helper returns a double and sum will need to convert that into an int

2694207
websphere	ibm
ibm - mqc7 websphere mq v7.0 clients

2694230
qiodevice	qdatastream
if the contents of msnlogfile are strictly text you need to pass the qiodevice text flag to open and use qiodevice readline or qiodevice readall however if it s binary data you d have to use qdatastream readrawdata and read the data back out in the correct order with correct sizes

2694237
thin	webrick
webrick apache mongrel thin etc.

2694243
width	height
this div is a fixed height but uses a scrollbar for its variable width

2694243
google-chrome	safari
the scrollbar resets perfectly fine in google-chrome safari and ie8

2694299
postgresql	mysql
in other words is mysql better or worse than postgresql to handle unicode etc

2694323
pull	push
to tell git to associate your master and the remote master branch so that when you just type git pull or git push with master checked out it ll assume you meant origin s master

2694327
children	parent
however they most certainly were present in the database and caused fk exceptions as hibernate tried to delete only the parent without first deleting its children which you ve likely also encountered with the nonnull in place

2694349
put	get
what do i put in the xslt to allow me to get that value tag to output like i need it to

2694406
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have attached mouseenter and mouseleave events to it to show a menu connected to the element using prototype

2694445
initializer	class-method
specific answer class-method are loaded at load time and are always available to your application the code overhead for loading them via a class initializer is minimal compared to the large amount of work you describe

2694511
postgresql	mysql
in my experience both mysql and postgresql handled unicode quite okay

2694574
ireport	subreports
the code in the ireport xml datasource subreports tutorial is broken

2694591
comparator	comparable
it uses the comparator or comparable instead

2694594
equals	gethashcode
the base-type is the obvious choice but i wonder if it isn t more appropriate to just override equals and gethashcode

2694598
hash	salt
you should rewrite this with mysqli or pdo and using a newer hash function as well as a salt

2694601
google-chrome	firefox
i don t have this issue in firefox 3.6.3 or google-chrome 4.1.249.1059

2694613
portrait	landscape
i have successfully implemented everything i need in terms of layout so that full landscape functionality is now supported in my app previously i primarily used portrait mode to display content

2694658
equals	compareto
the compareto method claims two instances are equals if the hash code happens to match could be a difficult error to catch without code review

2694671
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
so i figure out how high the row is going to be based on the string width and the width of the cell and then compare that with the room left on the page based on the current y position the page height and the bottom margin

2694727
put	get
i have two system.windows.media.color a and b and need to get a and put over b to simulate tranparency

even using hide show doesn t work in ie6 7

2694784
hide	show
2 you have 1 nib for your vc and just hide show elements using the hidden property of uiview and its subclasses

2694784
superclass	subclassing
there is a nib for normal mode a nib for edit mode and each mode has a vc that subclassing a common superclass

2694831
equals	gethashcode
i m interested to see how equals and gethashcode are used collectively when storing and retrieving items

2694836
folder	directory
where projectbinfiles is an item representing the files in the bin directory in the source directory and stagebin is a property representing the bin folder in the published site s directory

2694900
gitignore	hgignore
i m spoiled by gitignore and hgignore which i just copy to a repository and then use git commit -a without having to care about checking in junk

2694945
config	ini
you ll need to know where your config ini file is and load your app

2694958
inherited	subclassing
ishynum is an old-style class because it doesn t inherited object or one of its subclassing

2694959
starttls	smtps
warning mail function.mail smtps server response 530 5.7.0 must issue a starttls command first

2695006

quicksort	mergesort
to analyze quicksort and mergesort requires a decent level of what is known as mathematical sophistication

2695186
ftp	smb
smb ftp http webdav

2695200
boost	stl
the downside to precompiling is that you can only have one pre-compiled header per project so people tend to make a single precompiled.h or stdafx.h and include windows.h boost stl and everything else they need in there

2695202
width	height

at the time of writing the m2e plugin has and always has had a very nasty bug where it generates its own version of the application.xml descriptor file rather than use the one maven would otherwise create

most ide editors pale in comparison to the like of vim or emacs

2695956
vim	emacs
and of course debugger integration and project management and the like aren t going to work as well in vim or emacs because they re not full-blown ides though you can do a lot of that stuff with them

2695956
vim	emacs
but often the power of vim or emacs overshadows whatever the ide has over them

2695956
vim	emacs
of course it would be great if you could combine all of the great features of vim or emacs with a full-blown ide - and there are some attempts to do so - but there are always problems with it and even the best attempts are far from perfect

2695956
vim	emacs
so you re often still stuck with the choice of vim or emacs and the features that they bring or an ide with the features that it brings

2695956

2695956
vim	emacs

getter	setter
get and set are getter and setter for the property so when ever you call this property the value returned by return in your get is what you get
