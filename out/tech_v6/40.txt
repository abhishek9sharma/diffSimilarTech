4300017
mousemove	mousedown
if the global variable i is never used anywhere else then the value of i will always be equivalent to allpoints 0 .length inside your mousemove callback because you re creating a closure around the i variable which will be set to allpoints 0 .length by the end of the mousedown callback

4300017
mousemove	mousedown
also be aware that testest will be hoisted to the top of the mousedown callback so the value of testest inside the mousemove callback will always be the last value that was set inside the mousemove callback

4300033
jobs	cron
offline requests such as task queue tasks and cron jobs have no user as far as systems like sdc are concerned

4300087
versioning	upgrade
they are database upgrade scripts that make the required changes to the database from versioning x to versioning y

4300087
versioning	upgrade
when a customer upgrade these database scripts are run on their database to bring it up from their current versioning to the required versioning they re installing

4300132
inherited	properties
i found the answer myself for the ones that could want to know how do i resolved this issue was just decalring a grid with xaml with the column and row definitions required next i created a class inherited from button that contained the x and y properties i needed then i just created an array of this objects and programatically defined the properties size span etc i needed and positionated them with mygrid.children.add the object and then simply changed where in the grid i wanted them to display so whenever i needed to acces or change a properties for this buttons i just accessed to my array and voila

4300142
cvs	svn
i donâ t like using git itself though itâ s far better than svn or cvs but github is such an awesome site that iâ ve considered switching just to use it

4300158
hide	show
i haven t created any styles for you but what the code above does is it hide and show the foo and bar divs depending on what you click on

4300166
keydown	keyup
then you override the keydown and keyup event messages in order to capture them

4300174
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
okay so what i m trying to do is get the filename from openfiledialog savefiledialog only without the full path and dump said filename into a variable so i can use it for other things

4300179
min	max
it can be reduced to min cut problem which can be found by any max flow algorithm

4300231
google-chrome	firefox
after looking at your code for some reason i can t see it moving in google-chrome nor does it draw on firefox 4b7 but by looking at your code this line may be an issue

4300231
google-chrome	firefox
learn to use the debuggers google-chrome ie and firefox have good ones but i tend to prefer to use firebug perhaps due to experience with it

4300265
maven	cargo
imo the best way to have an ear war deployed on any application server is to use maven to build an ear and cargo maven plugin for redeploying

4300284
for-loop	loops
you need to remove the row in the catch block and change the foreach loops to a backwards for-loop to handle the removals

4300300
stdout	stderr
output has to be redirected to stderr or dev null because stdout is used for the data stream

4300338
std	ostream
- many people like to declare binary_istream binary_ostream types that can house a std ostream but being a distinct type can be used to create a separate set of serialisation routines ala

4300352
linefeed	delimiter
just remember that the row delimiter for ssis should be linefeed not crlf as binary ftp does not convert linefeed unix to crlf windows

4300355
for-loop	loops
one way you can shorten this is to use a for-loop instead of a while loops

4300382
cout	cin
this uses the deprecated header iostream.h to remove the need to explicitly find cin and cout in std

4300416
ant	ivyde
when running an ivy resolve via ivyde in eclipse which contains a packager.xml that executes a javac ant task i get the following

4300419
hide	show
then all you need to do is hide all the uls to start with apart from the root folder and use jquery to show hide the nested lists when a user clicks on the associated folder

4300467
firefox	safari
this code worked in ie firefox and safari windows7

4300479
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
and this code works fine in safari google-chrome and firefox the only exception is ie8

4300491
cvs	svn
i m interested in doing a site in drupal 7 - rather than downloading the periodic source releases i d like to grab the latest changes to drupal using a version control system be it cvs svn git etc

4300504
google-chrome	safari
running the following in the webkit console in google-chrome or safari takes 200ms

4300505
width	height
width and height must be non-negative

4300538
ocaml	scheme
could you tell me which would be a better language ocaml or scheme

4300538
ocaml	scheme
my knowledge with both scheme and ocaml is pretty basic and i find both equally challenging to work with and was unable to determine which would be a better one with respect to scalability and ease of use

4300555
ubuntu	linux
whether you are using ubuntu or fedora or any other version of linux you should not find any major effects on your ability to create php applications

4300574
width	height
you need to check your width and height

4300574
width	height
without seeing the code that calculates width and height this is all conjecture of course

4300591
int	chars
i guess what i mean is how do i access a random byte in memory cast as a chars or int that i can store in a pointer for accessing later on

4300592
width	height
edit the actual answer to this is to set the position of the right-floated div to absolute height width to 16px top and right to 0

4300632
jboss	weblogic
then there are still a number of middleware-based solutions such as websphere weblogic jboss etc

4300671
int	chars
it requires an parameter and returns the number of chars consumed from the input into that int

4300708
ocaml	sml
there aren t actually that many different syntaxes in the wild c c++ objective-c objective-c++ d go java c# ecmascript php vala and many others share a lot of syntax for example as do smalltalk self newspeak and objective-c sml ocaml and f# and so on so chances are you ll pick that up very quickly

4300710
hide	show
this way you don t need to manipulate the content of the elements just show hide them

4300712
accessor	properties
the accessibility modifier of the arp_tll.dataaccess.chromosomeaddedeventargs.newchromosome.set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer arp_tll.dataaccess.chromosomeaddedeventargs.newchromosome

4300712
accessor	properties
i have tried modifying the accessibility modifiers of the accessor and the properties but i am unable to fix the problem

4300717
accessor	properties
by default access modifiers for a properties s accessor are assigned the same access modifier as the properties itself

4300717
accessor	properties
if you choose to set an explicit access modifier for an accessor it must be more restrictive than the properties s access modifier

4300729
public	protected
in your case property_access_modifier is public so that get_accessor_modifier and set_accessor_modifier must be protected internal protected internal or private

4300786
client-side	server-side
you are talking about server-side client-side browser plugins etc

4300802
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome use the same engine but you say this only works in google-chrome so this is starting out weird

4300808
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason the download button shows up only in firefox browser but not in google-chrome or ie.

4300822
width	height
after some event triggers i want to change the customitem s height and width

4300823
superclass	subclassing
note that i didn t do anything to change the display method on the superclass but i got different display methods on the subclassing by changing the order in which i arranged the superclass

4300866
public	protected
first you have public and private protected to but i won t get into that

4300870
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this looks the the same in google-chrome safari firefox ie7 ie8 and opera

4300870
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari and firefox render both versions the same

4300870
background-image	background-color
i changed the background-image to background-color so i could see what was going on shouldn t have any effect on the rendering but ie7 is rather clever at making a mess of things so maybe not

4300905
ant	ivyde
if ivyde is not using the ant bundled with eclipse as plugin and referring to some standard installation or if you have defined a environment variable like ant_home then copy

4300931
post	put
note i had to put a dot before asp and itemtemplate for this post

4300932
cvs	svn
as drupal.org is in the process of moving from cvs to git i wouldn t recommend svn

4300941
entities	entitymanager
ejb 3 to play with jpa entities using entitymanager in session beans

4300946
min	max
to reference them you just need an i_min i_max j_min j_max and instead of running indices from 0 to n-1 run them from min to max

4300962
inline	inlining
unless your function is declared static it will have external linkage and the compiler is unlikely to consider it a candidate for inlining when it makes its own decisions about which functions to inline

4300969
mouseover	mousedown
set the formborderstyle none and then use mouseover and mousedown events to custom handle your move or look into the splitcontainer

4301014
spaces	delimiter
there are other control characters such as 0 null which are sometimes used as information delimiter but they won t be rendered as a spaces in east asian text - they won t appear as white-space

4301054
post	get
i just need a javascript to call the post and get the display_edit_form back then set it to a php var

4301061
jtextfield	jlabel
am using jlabel jtextfield and jcomponent

4301073
submit	submission
when i submit the form i wanna diable the form to be submited till the previous submission happens

4301137
getter	setter
the java bean containing the above fields and having corresponding getter and setter

4301137
getter	setter
i.e the bean s getter and setter the presence of validation annotations the ability of the dao to save the user the presence of the relevant form elements in the ui

4301142
getter	setter
normally at each point where the function is used the compiler generates cpu-specific machine code to directly call that function and for inline functions the call may be avoided and the function s affect may be optimally integrated into the caller s code which can be 10x faster for small functions such as getter and setter that simply read or write one member variable

4301150
pop-up	dialog
i have a link that when it clicked it ll open the pop-up dialog window this is done through ajax it requests to a controller name login_window

4301168
post	get
instead of detecting whether your request was an ajax request or not which can be any http verb - get post head you may wanna try and add modify routes to your routes.php for specifically handling these scenarios

4301178
implements	extends
to implements an unmodifiable collection the programmer needs only to extends this class and provide implementations for the iterator and size methods

4301211
implements	extends
and one recommendation if you plan to implements your own collection interface consider extends corresponding abstract class but not implements interface itself cause abstract classes implements methods general to the interface

4301271
integer	unsigned
indeed if anything signed integer math may be faster than unsigned integer math since unsigned integer math is required to behave predictably in case of overflow whereas unsigned math isn t

4301271
int	chars
note that in the c language chars is an odd case since all chars within the c chars set are required to translate as non-negative values so machines which use an 8-bit chars type with an ebcdic chars set are required to have chars be unsigned but an int is required to hold all values that a chars can hold so machines where both chars and int are 16 bits are required to have chars be signed

4301273
realloc	malloc
any tool to find size of memory allocated dynamically using malloc realloc

4301301
getter	setter
getter and setter - most definitely not

4301327
margin	height
in the click handler for your link use jquery s animate function to increase the height of #footer and to make the other necessary padding margin adjustments simultaneously

4301327
fadein	fadeout
set the expanded view to be display none initially and then use jquery s fadein and fadeout functions within the click handler or the animate callback to swap the visibility of the expanded and collapsed views within the footer

4301344
realloc	calloc
of course also realloc and calloc shall be implemented but memory block cannot be used by other software which expect normal malloced memory

4301344
free	malloc
another way to do this is to hash the pointer and collect memory information by hooking the malloc free functions

4301355
post	get
so my add action presents the form on get request and process it on post request

4301369
mouse	keyboard
for example i want to count number of characters entered by user when user do cut paste in editor via keyboard or mouse with context menu also

4301405
post	get
we just redesigned a web application and as a result we ve noticed a bug in chrome but it supposedly affects all webkit browsers that causes a full image js css reload after a post redirect get

4301434
factors	mean
what i mean by prime a number is to get all prime factors of the number

4301438

4301487
wordpress	joomla
you can look at joomla drupal or wordpress to achieve this

4301487

4301499
pow	sqrt
it happens for sqrt log but for others not for instance pow

4301506

4301524
disk	ram
databases are among the hardest technology to scale out so to get the most out of it make sure your database is running on a machine with loads of ram fast disk and no other responsibilities

4301547
maven	pom.xml
if you use maven you can simply add it to your pom.xml

add a call to fflush stdout

4301621
profiling	benchmarking
easier to benchmarking profiling there independently from instance creation

4301621
multiplying	division
sure that s probably compiled or jit d away but you should avoid division in performance critical code it s far slower than multiplying

4301639
portrait	landscape
each page is of width 768.0px in portrait mode and 1024.0px in landscape mode

4301653
google-chrome	firefox
i m having 6 forms each one in iframe in same page domain on-click on button save close the forms should be submitted and then the page should closed but i noticed that the first 5 forms are submitted but the last one is delayed for while and the page closed before it complete saving it .that happened just at firefox i test it over ie and google-chrome and it works good

4301728

you make your new class that extends service and implements sensoreventlistener

4301733
division	multiplication
do not use them to speed up multiplication and division

4301778
int	chars
the second is to order your fields in largest to smallest order such as all the long long types followed by the long ones then all the int short and finally chars types

4301779

use a debugging tool like firebug for firefox the developer tools in google-chrome webkit or the what s-it-called thingummy in ie and look at the applied styles for the div ul li

4301814
webclient	webrequest
instead of submitting through the form i.e form action ... ... i would like to dynamically post using webrequest or webclient class

4301837
implements	extends
looking at rakudo perl6 i wonder if there are techniques for parsing and lexical analyses that allow to alter extends the syntax of the language and that are efficient and not to hard to implements

4301959
width	height
in this class i just want to know width and height of image and do some mathematical functions to return something

4302171
subtraction	addition
that s mostly not a problem provided you re a bit careful with arithmetic other than addition subtraction and left-shift which work obviously and comparisons

4302177
inherited	properties
it s inconsistent that inherited properties type 10 shut down later than local template properties sets type 4b but then i m not sure it s reasonable to expect any particular order here

4302246
inherited	properties
perhaps you want to change the tint-color properties nonatomic retain uicolor tintcolor because uisegmentedcontrol has no background-color just because it inherited it from uiview does not mean it uses it though

4302253

4302354
draggable	droppable
i ve looked around and the most-common solution people suggest is limiting the number of active draggable and droppable

4302356
wordpress	joomla
for me there would be 3 choices if it has to be a php based cms wordpress joomla or drupal

jobs	cron
my web hosting solution is a very cheap cpanel account - i can only run php scripts in response to http requests or cron jobs at long intervals i think 10 minutes

4302601
getter	setter
i think you just want a generic method in base class and call thios method from getter or setter

4302674
public	protected
supertype s public protected and if

4302748
realloc	malloc
for an assignment i need to allocate a dynamic buffer using malloc for the inital buffer and realloc to expand that buffer if needed

realloc	malloc
modern systems with a large virtual address space will just never return from malloc or realloc apart maybe if the arguments where bogus

4303078
realloc	malloc
instead check the arguments to malloc against 0 and for realloc if both are 0 simultaneously with an assertion since then the problem is not inside malloc or realloc but the way you are calling them

4303102
for-loop	loops
1 the user enters 0 as the input for a - the for-loop is exited in the first loops itself as i would never be 0

check you computer system infromation to see whether you need an x86 32-bit or x64 64bit version of the program and then contact the software publisher

4303315
put	get
the performance penalty of finalizers is that they make your objects live for longer than they need to in the first gc cycle where they re otherwise considered eligible for collection they get put on the finalizer queue - and bumped up to the next generation just like any other object which survives a gc cycle

4303316
stdout	stderr
edit paul pointed out that output might go to stderr so my solution is to redirect output to stdout and continue hacking strings

4303318
ant	maven
if you are using maven that you should learn maven if you are using ant than just rewrite the part thaht uses these libs

show hide thumb grid is painfully slow in ie8

4304819
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
use either the sorteddictionary like codeinchaos mentioned or a sortedlist

4304819
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
you need some sort of update loop that will just look at the first index of the values property of your sortedlist or sorteddictionary o 1 operation and see if the system date is past that item s expiration date

4304819
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
whenever you add a new item to your main collection add a reference to it in this sortedlist sorteddictionary and provide the expiration date as the key to sort by

quicksort has the advantage of being completely in place so it does not require any additional storage while mergesort which is actually used by arrays.sort for object arrays and other all

4305069
quicksort	heapsort
so normaly you could use heapsort but most times quicksort is faster

4305074
flot	fusioncharts
other nice ones are flot and fusioncharts

so if there s room for upgrading upgrade to servlet 3.0 tomcat 7 glassfish 3 jboss 6 etc and you don t need a wrapper

4305256
unsigned	short
why not use the jchar since it maps directly to a unsigned short - then you can cast directly

4305315
base-class	subclassing
protected - the most obvious case - all subclassing can call the constructor irrespective of which assembly they reside in as long as the the abstract base-class itself is visible to them

4305315
inherited	subclassing	inherited	base-class	base-class	subclassing
only subclassing within the same assembly as the abstract base-class would be able to call the constructors - effectively only they would be able to inherited

4305315
public	protected
public - not useful behaves identically to protected

4305315
base-class	subclassing
only subclassing can call the constructor anyway since the base-class is abstract

4305315
public	protected	base-class	subclassing
however the internal modifier here serves no purpose - it doesn t prevent subclassing residing outside the assembly from calling the constructor assuming the abstract base-class is public since they can rely on protected access nor does it allow same-assembly types that are not subclassing from calling it the type is abstract

4305315
public	protected
public and protected internal don t accomplish anything because they appear to weaken restrictions but don t really succeed in doing so

4305342
gson	jackson
i have looked into gson and jackson but was unable to conceive a solution for myself

it may sound like an inconsequential thing however if we change something as fundamental as the directory structure of the site-packages folder it will force our team to go through a phase of international uat which will be very time-consuming

4305553
for-loop	loops
the question i really wanted to ask but i think it didn t get properly conveyed is let for example this for-loop contains 10 such xor operations loops count is 100 and the function is called 1000 times the point is high memory access..if the code is to be executed on a single core machine what are scopes for improvement

4305560

wsdualhttpbinding	basichttpbinding
i wanted to use wcf callback contracts to create a subscribe unsubscribe architecture for my services however i have recently found out that i can t use wsdualhttpbinding on windows phone 7 but only basichttpbinding

4305785
inherited	properties
a key aspect of protected members is that a class can effectively seal off inherited protected members from access by any classes other than its ancestors it would be nice if a class could both override a parent s method properties and also block child classes from accessing it but so far as i can tell there s no way of doing that without adding an extra layer of hierarchy

4305790
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
you can roll your own collection class that implements inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged

in this class i just want to know width and height of image and do some mathematical functions to return something

4306160
awt	swing
you should not use an awt component canvas in a swing application

4306164

this problem then reduces to just finding these patterns in the arrays which can be done using a simple for-loop

4306206
redmine	trac
i considered using redmine after reading this question but i d rather stay with trac if i can

4306219
hex	binary	int	chars
a big int which increments the second i have tried defining it as a chars varchar and binary but im still not getting the desired function say i try and store 0a a hex number into

4306249

4306428
folder	directory
the windows equivalent for me was to go in to the java directory and place the files in the bin and lib folder

4306501
uiview	calayer
on an iphone this isn t very different from a uiview because a uiview is then just a lightweight wrapper around a calayer

4306532
int	chars
another scenario is that in theory a pointer to int could be 2 bits smaller than a pointer to chars if an int is always 4-aligned

4306544
base	fractions
if you are trying to represent a fractions that is irrational or repeating in base 2 the sequence of bits will be rounded off at the 23rd bit

4306762
min	max
ok so if the order of the topic in wich the book will be counted doesn t matter the solution it s actually very simple you just need to do a min or max over the topic_id when you define your datasource table

4306762
min	max
you should be aware that the book is being counted only in the min or max topic it appears

4306768
filesystems	ntfs
i understand that it is the permissions issue because ntfs filesystems do not support unix permissions but how it can be that on 10.04 was everything ok

4306782
google-chrome	firefox
i made the whole development using firefox and google-chrome for testing so i knew i would have to tweak some styling because of iexplorer mostly ie6

4306795
jar	war
that repository structure is why your jar and war files end up in different folders when you do the mvn release perform which is another way of asking maven to do a mvn deploy

4306795
jar	war	ant	maven
now if you want to keep with the maven way of doing things you should write another script shell ant your choice for deployment that would get those jar and war files from the remote maven artifact repository and bundle them up the way you want and deploy it to the server s you want them installed on

4306795
jar	war
now you can change maven to sort of do what you want your are asking but you ll have to create another project module that only does bundling of the jar and war files in the way you want as an archive file tar gzip zip

4306884
filesystems	ntfs
the default mount options for ntfs filesystems probably changed between ubuntu versions

4307392
inherited	properties
my purpose is to xml-serialize excelprintcorte and save the inherited properties values and also the properties values of excelprintdocumento

4307419
versioning	upgrade
an alternative would be to run my code on typhoon app engine with a newer python but i fear google won t upgrade their python versioning for a loooong time.

4307422
versioning	upgrade
i never upgrade jre an i m almost sure that the java versioning was always 1.6.0_22

4307485
hide	show
i thought it d be simplistic to implement a show e function that takes an element e to be displayed and hide everything but e

4307488
onfocus	onblur
if you want to have considerable backwards compatibility in this regard you will need to react to the onfocus and onblur events of the input element produced by the textbox control

4307518
width	height
also the other problem is to check the height as well as the width so no numbers occur more than once ordinary sudoku rules

4307539
put	get
i have had the hierarchy for the root messages that i save into table exactly same as birth put under with exception that i do get any parent_id from twitter just msg_id. actually that is basic reason for storing tweets into database to add value into parent_id column

vbscript	jscript
problem is that checkaccess returns result as out argument and i could not find vbscript s byref equivalent in jscript

4307691
width	height
1 photoshop actions could do this but i would have to pull current height multiply by 1.333333 and then put that value in the width box of the canvas resize

4307712
teamcity	nant
you can adjust teamcity for this mostly for build and deploy automation after each commit or time-based schedule or use some simple but powerful utility like nant with predefined configurations

4307737
stdout	stderr
if i m reading your question correctly you want to capture stdout stderr into a variable within your c++

4307737
stdout	stderr
you can do this by redirecting stdout stderr into a python variable and then querying this variable into your c++

4307762
wordpress	joomla
so which of drupal joomla wordpress is the best choice if

4307771
hide	show
for example in page with 2 or more different modules if the one throw an error just hide it and show the rest

4307805
fadein	fadeout
fyi -as the comments points out the issue was not caused by the css function but by a fadeout fadein effect

4307835
width	height
i would like to write a function that destructures the resolution key into width and height symbols

4307920
post	get
i am wanting to create a custom post type called testimonials for this i am wanting to allow the administrator that chance to add a company name username and what testimonial they have given i understand i can do this by declaring a custom post-type in my functions.php file however it does not seem to work and all i get is the normal post fields can someone tell me where i am going wrong or how i would do this please

4307942
width	height
you must first destructure resolution then get width and height

4308035
webrat	cucumber
for learning rspec 2 webrat and cucumber on your own i definitely recommend checking out the rspec book

4308047
ubuntu	debian
depending on your os distribution you should find the way to install the header files without installing the actual server debian ubuntu alikes should allow you to do so with the standard apt-get but i might be wrong

4308137
haskell	ocaml
i spent the last 18 months getting the grip of functional programming starting with learning ocaml and for some weeks now haskell

4308137
haskell	ocaml
now some imho quite annoying proponent of ocaml quite frequently bitches against haskell being slow compared to ocaml or f#

4308137
haskell	ocaml
but according to the the computer language benchmarks game haskell oftenly beats ocaml if only by rather small fractions â there remains the problem that this benchmark takes only very specific samples

4308137
haskell	ocaml
but maybe other people did comparable applications in ocaml and haskell and give some figures

4308147
opennlp	lingpipe
for open source you can look at lingpipe and gate and opennlp

4308176
children	parent
the state of the children should drive the state of the parent

4308176
children	parent
each parent has a list of children sorted alphabetically

4308273
wordpress	joomla
i prefer it over wordpress and specially over joomla

4308280
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i m using one javascript binds in master page for the entire project and the master page doesn t include a scriptmanager that is some pages include ajax components like updatepanel but some not

4308326
decoder	encoder
and vote for native encoder decoder in actionscript fp-1631

4308335
serializable	deserialization
if you substitute the string parameter with one of type java.lang.object then the jaxb runtime is bound to find difficulties during serializable and deserialization as no such bindings exist that determine how the runtime should perform such a process

4308350
sorting	filtering
in my project i have an ajax front end where the table contains editable controls and column sorting filtering

4308386
ant	maven
for me i am using maven to organise my webapp project so it slightly different from ant project

4308406
for-loop	loops
are there plans or perhaps a current way to implement this enhanced enhanced for-loop where one would be able to access the index of loops and even possibly manipulate it

4308434
folder	directory
in my java project i have src main python source directory where i placed pygments files into pygments folder so they end up on the classpath

4308479
hide	show
i think virtual desktop managers just hide windows and show them as necessary when the desktops change

4308500
width	height
shudder you may be able to differentiate based on image width and height

4308530
valgrind	memcheck
i suggest you to use valgrind memcheck

4308530
free	malloc
it works on linux and mac i don t know whether it has windows version and it replaces malloc and free methods and shows much information about memory handling

4308530
valgrind	memcheck
valgrind --tool memcheck

4308541
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
use svcutil.exe instead of xsd.exe

4308556
mouseup	mousedown
click will not fire under mousedown move off control mouseup

4308584
post	get
when i take out the post action and remove the get attribute so both get and post use the details action the problem goes away - but this also gets rid of my pretty url s when the form is submitted and causes the annoying are you sure

4308588
superclass	subclassing
in your subclassing i notice that you have an announcement variable that doesn t seem to show up in your superclass

4308588
superclass	subclassing
in your dealloc of the subclassing you release announcementtext which is also released in the superclass not announcement which is probably the cause of your leakage

4308592
versioning	upgrade
ive just upgrade to eclipse 3.6 and i have a seam application running on jboss 5 with the latest versioning of jboss tools

4308606
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to create a software simulation on an ubuntu gnu linux machine which will work like pppoe

4308642
google-chrome	firefox
another thing to test would be to do a view source or inspect element if you re using google-chrome or firebug in firefox and see if the html code is being placed where it should be

4308650
post	get
check to see whether there s a configdate parameter either get or post

4308672
post	put
400 bad request itâ s commonly used when the client submits a representation along with a put or post request and the representation is in the right format but it doesnâ t make any sense

4308679
pull	push
session a would have to push data into the pipe and session b would have to pull it

4308716
addclass	removeclass
you can use addclass and removeclass

4308717
dictionary	map
what i would suggest is either using a map dictionary data type or storing the keys and values in a single object and then having an array of said objects

4308718
hide	show
the wiki will tend to contain the major features while the bugtracker will contain minor features like add a button to show hide a section or something ...but the limit between major and minor features is very subjective and will tend to get messy so i ll have a hard time searching for a feature - i ll have to search in both wiki and bugtracker or i ll have to remember if it was a major or a minor feature

4308722
instances	transient
object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing

4308762
post	get
when the call completes twilio will post or get to the url with all the same variables it passes during a normal request

4308769
nsurlconnection	nsoutputstream
though i ve never used it myself from reading around the topic i think you need to use an nsoutputstream rather than an nsurlconnection which is toll-free bridged with cfwritestream

4308777
serializable	deserialization
so the problem is serializable and deserialization works fine

4308777
width	height
no errors and the dictionary has entries with what seems to be bitmapimages however their width height and

4308797
ivar	subclassing
in your subclassing setannouncementtext withsize actually does nothing to the announcementtext ivar which is confusing i guess

4308817
svnadmin	svnlook
if on the machine with the mirror repository my situation use the svnlook tool to look and svnadmin to change

4308838
width	height
the iphone4 resizes your content to fit its higher-res retina display compared to the older iphone and with that scaling i have sometimes noticed blur when using pixel values for block height width font size etc

4308845
interpolation	splines
i d like to quote introduction to catmull-rom splines to suggest not using catmull-rom for this interpolation task

4308874
width	height
the large image s width is always set to 600 but the height can be regulated as needed

4308877
width	height
the issue was that the floated divs didn t have hard width and height

4308882
haskell	ocaml
but according to the the computer language benchmarks game haskell often beats ocaml if only by rather small fractions â there remains the problem that this benchmark takes only very specific samples

4308882
haskell	ocaml
the benchmarks game reports 4 sets of results - one core and quad core 32 or 64 bit ubuntu - and you may find that the ocaml or haskell benchmark programs perform better or worse depending on the platform

4308917
typedef	struct
if you have the option to use visual studio 2010 there is highlighterr which changes the colors of classes struct macros and typedef

4308939
put	get
all i need to do is get the second line put into numbers

4308945
automake	autotools
i am using the gnu autotools including automake

4308979
gif	bmp	gif	ico	gif	png	bmp	png	png	ico
with you can either draw your own or upload a jpg jpeg gif png bmp or ico

4309013
button	checkbox
i tried to disable mousechildren mouseenabled and other possible parameters which would disable those tooltips from preventing user clicking on some button or checkbox

4309025
japplet	jdialog
it seems that while you can add actions to components you can t add them to containers such as jframe japplet or jdialog

4309037
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
when using fractional pixel values not percentages they work as suggested in the article i linked ie9p7 and ff4b7 seem to round to the nearest pixel while opera 11b google-chrome 9.0.587.0 and safari 5.0.3 truncate the decimal places

4309051
integer	fractions
as martin pointed out things break down when you get to fractions pixels but if your percentage values yield integer pixel value 50.5 of 200px in the example you ll get sensible expected behaviour

4309065
for-loop	loops
note i m using activeregion because in the spark parser activeregion gets declared as a variable and assigned the value of region in the current scope as you loops through the for-loop

4309084
equals	gethashcode
note that overriding equals means you should also override gethashcode which is another kettle of fish and can be quite difficult to do correctly

4309096
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode must be implemented in tandem with equals overloads

4309103
ubuntu	linux
update it happens when i run it under linux hardy 2.6.24-16-generic it does not happen under ubuntu 9.10

4309114
hide	show
so they don t look like tabs and when you click them nothing hide show as would be expected with tabs

4309114
hide	show
do i have to manually hook up javascript to show and hide the contents of the tabs or does the framework do this for me

4309115
google-chrome	safari
given that this works in google-chrome and safari it would seem that your markup styles are correct though

4309115
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if so then the styles you add will only affect those elements which are part of the dom at that point in time so you might be experiencing a race condition that actually happens to work in google-chrome and safari but not firefox

4309153
postgresql	mysql
i will be deploying a ruby on rails application soon active record orm and my database mysql or postgresql will be located at an external location outside of 127.0.0.1 range

4309153
postgresql	mysql
or is my data secure enough by default with mysql and or postgresql when working with databases at external locations

4309153
postgresql	mysql
so in short is there anything extra i should be doing when my mysql or postgresql database is located at an external location rather than when it s in localhost range

4309160
children	parent
i ve created deeply nested grid layout systems where parent widths are ems and children are percents and including up to four decimal points upstream had a noticeable impact

4309163
gridview	rowdatabound
though i set the modified ds and databind on the gridview it never fires the rowdatabound afterwards

4309199
ssl	https
several security experts have said in the past that the login page should be on ssl https

4309199
post	put
i read it s possible to put the form on http but post it to https but i read someone saying that it can be exploited with a man in the middle attack

4309200
versioning	upgrade
to make sure the mapping models where correct i upgrade it to each versioning one by one 10 to 11 11 to 12 etc.. and it did work..

4309207
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort mergesort etc for small values of m and maybe do that linear search for bigger values of m

4309218
bazaar	git	pull	push
with mercurial or git subversion or bazaar you can set up a server on your machine or with one of the public sites and either push or pull updates to your production server

4309239
post	put
i read it s possible to put the form on http but post it to https but i read someone saying that it can be exploited with a man in the middle attack

4309301
google-chrome	safari
webkit is the render engine used by google-chrome and safari and is very flexible

4309307
wordpress	joomla
both wordpress and joomla create forms as straight html so you can only alter it by altering the code that creates it which quickly turns into a maintenance headache

4309323
calloc	malloc
you also shouldn t have a cast on malloc calloc etc. generally speaking it can obscure useful warnings and you need to allocate six slots like i said so you can have the null-terminator which is the zero-valued character so we don t need to set it explicitly

4309323
calloc	malloc
combine that with the indexing mode include the missing stdlib.h for calloc you should have had it for malloc too and we re good to go

4309364
firefox	safari
on firefox v3.6 safari v5 and ie9 the red value comes back as 67 all on windows

4309364
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
on os x google-chrome v7 safari v5 and firefox v3.6 also come back as 67

4309377
put	get
when you put that code into your html document you get this button in that span element in an iframe

4309395
implements	extends
i imagine i have to make a new class that extends inotifysink and implements the functions but then what do i do after that

4309410
googletest	gmock
googletest and gmock looks like nice libraries with mockingsupport however it requires every object that shall be mocked to be virtual

4309417
equals	gethashcode
the other answers have pretty much covered the fact that you need to implement equals and gethashcode correctly but as a side note you may be interested to know that anonymous types have these values implemented automatically

4309417
equals	gethashcode
so without ever having to define this class you automatically get the equals and gethashcode behavior you re looking for

4309438
width	height
the tiles have some fixed size and you want to put them on a surface of a fixed width and minimum height

4309450
children	parent
i have an abstract parent class that has a constructor that is injected with an object shared by all derived children and each child also has an injectable constructor

4309455
google-chrome	firefox
all this works on google-chrome and firefox but in ie the button seams to dont exist

4309457
valgrind	glibc
the valgrind report is a well-known issue - either a false positive or a bug in glibc

4309472
openjpa	openejb
i m using openejb which relies on openjpa behind the scenes for unit testing and found when stepping through openjpa code that it successfully persists the document object but when it comes to the section object it creates a new instance reflectively and sets all fields to null so losing the sectionnum value before linking it to the document object persisted earlier

4309506
uiview	subviews
if i were to guess i would say that they have added a uiview with a transparent background which has a uiimageview for the photo and a tableview as a subviews

4309508
getter	setter
without using spring and only using getter and setter methods i am able set a list and retrieve it using get

4309547
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
what i have is a uitableview with a uisegmentedcontrol with two categories one that displays all and one that when selected should display only events what were created today

4309641
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
the space in my case was caused by the uinavigationbar part of the uinavigationcontroller taking into account the status bar and it was actually overlapping part of the view that i was trying to show in the uinavigationcontroller

4309668
google-chrome	firefox
start by ensuring that what you ve just developed works in firefox and google-chrome and then verify it in ie

4309687
vb.net	vb6
also developing enterprise application is such new languages java c# vb.net rubby is easier that vb6 because they rely on frameworks every body can write c# java code that function but it requires tricks good practices and some of imagination to write vb6 strong and rehusable code

4309697
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i suggest ie 7 + 8 firefox google-chrome and safari as in order of importance

4309719
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
works in firefox google-chrome safari opera and ie9

4309774
firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox and safari and is just an ie problem

4309823
octal	hex
unambiguous octal and hex escapes in strings like and

4309873
implements	extends
i never extends thread class but implements runnable callable interface

4309893
keydown	keyup
with keydown and keyup you ll be running your function twice for each pressed key which may not be what you want

4309923
children	parent
a parent and two children

4309949
fadein	fadeout
more details is like if we click beta the alpha will show it s fadein fadeout effect

4309954
hide	show
this would hide controllera s layout and show controllerb s layout -- or render the layout if not already in the dom

4309964
firefox	safari
i am trying to make an app with tabs at the top that link a website too each one such as a computer that uses tabs in safari or firefox

4309987
folder	directory
the long route would be to simply branch checkout into a new folder and diff redo the new changes over but i would like to avoid recoding changes or running a kdiff directory merge operation

4309991
jquery	scriptaculous
hi i have my code here in jquery for my footer chat panel and it is conflict with scriptaculous

4310031
comparator	comparable
if the class of the object implements comparable then all you need to do is properly code the comparator method to first compare dates and then if dates are equals compare values and then return the appropriate int result based on the findings

4310045
cpu	processors
user cpu time is time spent on the processors running your program s code or code in libraries

4310071
profiling	instrumentation
any profiling that inserts instrumentation into your program will inherently affect the performance in ways that might skew or invalidate the results

4310076
profiling	instrumentation
to answer your first question time the command-line utility times the execution of the whole process including the profiling instrumentation itself

4310076
profiling	instrumentation
the profiling instrumentation tries hard to separate out its own impact on the time accounting and in this case it seems that the profiling itself accounted for 2.34 - 1.18 1.16s of the runtime as reported by time

4310143
backgrounding	multitasking
-with multitasking you should call the passcode view in the becomeactive method in the app delegate too the way that your app could prompt for a passcode when in returns from backgrounding

4310160
pull	push
this would use what git calls remotes which are references to what a remote repository contains in order for you to be able to pull it into your own branch push your branch into the remote repository etc

4310169
int	chars
a phone numbers aren t actually int they are chars strings and should be stored in the database as such

4310172
pascal	delphi
in hindsight outdated books weren t as problematic as the more current books because the more current books are written for an audience that knows both pascal and delphi and thus leave out a lot of crucial info for the newbie

4310172
pascal	delphi
the delphi 5 books are equally as long as later editions but spend all of those pages on the win32 features of the vcl and some very valuable tutorials on pascal which is handy for those of us that went through our school years without learning pascal

4310178
children	parent
also you don t know how many children a parent has should you wish to resize it

4310274
associativity	operator-precedence
operator-precedence and associativity only affect the way operators are bound to operands

4310314
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i m using fullcalendar with a json feed and as per usual it works fine in firefox google-chrome safari but ie7 is not playing ball

4310342
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
ok so i have this page and when viewed in firefox the proper results show up but when i look at it in google-chrome or safari it is way off

4310342
google-chrome	safari
so as you can see the code is a bit off and i think that maybe the problem with why safari and google-chrome are off...any suggestions

4310359
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this will get the desired result in both firefox and google-chrome safari

4310416
integer	unsigned
the values were converted from the range 0 to 65535 unsigned 16-bit integer to -32768 to 32767 signed 16-bit integer using two s complement

4310441
firefox	safari
this works wonderfully in firefox and safari but is being blocked by internet explorer 8 s protection against scripted downloads

4310448
postgresql	mysql
i use mysql and sqlite often and plan on bringing more postgresql into my workflow soon

4310482
mouseleave	mouseenter
to bind a hover event manually you have to bind the mouseenter and mouseleave events jquery s hover documentation mentions that hover actually binds mouseenter and mouseleave event handlers

4310495
children	parent
ideally you would want to encapsulate the conditional creation of the children in the parent form

4310554
xrange	enumerate
how about replacing enumerate ... with zip xrange ... ...

4310555
int	chars
so i am assuming table with id int stringval string chars varchar whatever

4310563
post	get
when i get the new contents via post the tabs function abort and don t build the

4310587
haskell	ocaml
by all accounts both ocaml and haskell have sufficiently performant compilers and runtimes for almost anything

4310587
haskell	ocaml
if you want only very coarse parallelism at best and you intend to stick with mostly functional structures then pick based on something else like syntax i think haskell is much nicer here but that s subjective or available libraries haskell wins on quantity availability but ocaml might edge it out in the graphics department nonetheless

4310706
apache	nginx
4 which of these solutions require replacement of the typical mod_wsgi nginx or apache deployment model

4310719
min	max
autoconfig false min 2 2 max 40 40 maxconnections 10 httpruntime settings 8 4

4310719
min	max
autoconfig true min 2 2 max 200 200 maxconnections 24 httpruntime settings 8 4

4310728
unsigned	short
after reading this other so answer i tried replacing unsigned short d with unsigned char and unsigned short e with bool

4310738
textview	imageview
i m having a problem displaying the layout when my imageview and textview takes up more than 3 4 of the screen

4310738
textview	imageview
how do i make imageview and textview scrollable with the listview that is being displayed

4310788
textview	imageview
how about putting the imageview and textview in a layout and putting this layout inside a scrollview

4310802
firefox	safari
works on firefox and safari etc but dies after you go in and out of the various levels one or two times

4310802
firefox	safari
as i said it works fine in firefox and safari but simply dies in ie

4310806
width	height
init function cid width height

4310819
min	max
another way to look at it is 2 lines - one for max price and one for min price

4310824
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop with the f switch and the option to loops through every line in the file and store the lines in the variable i

4310856
codeigniter	cakephp
the above code is codeigniter and i think cakephp also following same coding style

4310911
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
create the objectoutputstream before the objectinputstream at both ends

4310911
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the constructor of objectoutputstream writes a header to the stream that the constructor of objectinputstream reads so if you create the objectinputstreams first you get a deadlock

4310953
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome firefox doesn t have problems with this but safari cries invalid date

4310963
getter	setter
for example by providing only public getter on my interfaces and leaving it up to implementors to decide upon setter and how to handle that aspect

4311006
jar	war
followed the instructions of the example i moved all the jar files out of the war module and put it into a lib folder within ear file

4311012
division	modulo
here you will get 2 as division and 10 will be yr modulo

4311051
getter	setter
this way your mutable interface has full getter and setter i don t think it makes sense to have an interface that has setter but no getter but any object that implements it will also have an immutable version of the interface that you can use for any pure-functional code

4311087
websphere	ibm
i am trying to integrate websphere portal with my custom user registry.i have completed all the steps required to implement custom user registry in portal as given in ibm documentation.i am adding my custom repository to the default federated repositories of portal 7.0.i have made the required changes under vmm federated cur properties section in wkplc.properties.i am using configengine.bat file to configure portal with user registry

opennlp	lingpipe
since you asked for pointers lingpipe already mentioned above opennlp and stanford nlp distributions

4311115
spaces	delimiter	punctuation	words
don t assume words are delimiter by spaces or that sentences are delimiter by punctuation if you re trying to support search

4311118
rss	feed
ive set the rss feed in the drupal admin to set rss feed to show 30 items per feed

4311119
nstextfield	nstableview	nsresponder	nscell
since none of the other nstableview components nscell nstextfieldcell etc derive from nsresponder i m assuming there is an nstextfield buried in there somewhere

4311131
onresume	onpause
consider stopping this after onpause has been called and to resume it after onresume

4311215
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
graphicsmagick is generally a better version of imagemagick i d take a look at that

4311268
width	height
for example to decode at half width and half height discard all but the upper-left quadrant of the coefficients horizontal and vertical frequency 4 and use a 4x4 idct on them instead of the usual 8x8

4311279
min	max
i m also looking into the max min size of the data that will be supplied

and getting them to show up via javascript also require an extra click from the user for no reason -- in order to get around pop-up blockers the user has to click on something like a login button largely pointless given that by the time the app knows it needs to display a login button it already knows the user needs to log in and may as well just present the permissions dialog

4311302
min	max
push all the min max x values into a set and sort them thus creating a list of vertical regions spanning the x-axis

4311302
min	max
repeat this procedure for min max y values to create a list of horizontal regions and associate each region with the set of bounding boxes it contains

4311303
superclass	subclassing
in other circumstances you may have subclassing the linkedhashset for instance extends hashset but it still makes a lot of sense to instantiate the superclass hashset in this case

4311341
post	get
try to change the request method from post to get

4311387
pull	push
for example you could set up a bare central repository on one computer s shared folder and then push pull to from it from both computer s local clones that you use for development

4311397
mouse	keyboard
you can use chinmayee s .click approach but check and double check that everything works properly when you use the keyboard rather than the mouse or you can add a click handler to all your radio buttons that blurs and refocuses

4311468
put	get
if you put something out you can only get that output if you buffer the output using the output control â s ob_start

4311495
put	get
f is never in the g because you never put it there so no possible chance it could get there

4311578
pop-up	dialog
after a reboot and the first time the app is run it normally manages to initialise the webcam ok and get regular frames from it but the next time the app is run it fails to locate the webcam driver and also pop-up a dialog asking me to specify the video source presumably because it can t find one

4311598
min	max
why do you suppose they even allow the min to be equal to the max in this case

4311694
width	height
i have a histogram with integer height and constant width 1

4311696
for-loop	arrays
there is only one arrays you are constructing outside the for-loop

4311712
folder	directory
so i created an endorsed directory within the java_home jre lib folder

4311714
children	parent
you can iterate through a form s mdi children using the form s mdichildren property such that when on mdi child window changes its formwindowstate the mdi parent form can apply the change to each of its children similar to the shared formwindowstate approach

4311727
content-disposition	content-type
make the script execute on a certain url with mod_wsgi then the script should set the content-type provides document type such as text plain and content-disposition provides download filename headers and send the document data

4311754
keystore	jks
keystore.getinstance jks than you can add multiple certificates with an alias to that one keystore

4311799
fast-forward	merge
this will be a fast-forward merge that should do what you want

4311801
slideup	slidedown
however the slidedown and slideup functions do not seem to be functioning unless slow means ultra fast...

4311841
hide	show
i also need to hide and show some of the controls based on previously selected values

4311867
datagridview	tablelayoutpanel
i just want to rope my 16 comboboxes to my 16 datagridview columns when its scrolled left changes boxes location i only need that every boxes be on head of grid columns .i tried lots of things tablelayoutpanel popups...

4311877
folder	directory
after trying to look up a solution i found that windows 7 had an issue with developer stuff being put outside of users directory so then i installed it again this time in c users username folder

4311889
put	get
the only concern is that the various defaults should be grouped in a number of smaller in the sense of number of fields tables otherwise you won t get any benefit from this approach if you put all the possible settings in a single table record you will have to duplicate everything as soon as the user changes just one field and this will give no benefit at all

4311900
innodb	myisam
to be clear the ddl i have provided should work for myisam and do nothing in the dri department until you get innodb

4311910
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
please visit with firefox safari google-chrome .

4311918

4311939
int	double
data could be int double

4311954
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari and opera it works right away by setting them sequentially but in firefox older than 4 and ie even in ie9

4311962
cobertura	emma
if you are lucky enough to have excellent test coverage another option is to use a code coverage analysis tool like cobertura clover or emma

4312017
width	height
well after a while and quite a long time gazing at the code wondering what the hell was wrong with it it occurred to me that the link directly within the li.submenu was set to display block with width and height set to 100

4312022
serializable	deserialization
i don t think sub-classing feels right here like serveritem item considering serializable deserialization

4312039
portrait	landscape
i want to change the view from right to left like a page turn whatever be the iphone orientation landscape or portrait .

4312100
keydown	keyup
there could be javascript code which listens events on textarea and do something with it keydown keyup keypress

4312107
filesystems	ntfs
you can mount a virtual storage as a disk or as a folder on ntfs disk using callback filesystems see vmounter sample

4312114
jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket	tapestry	wicket
frameworks i am interested in are jsf gwt wicket and tapestry

4312127
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
i m struggeling with a problem where in google-chrome on mac and in google-chrome opera and safari on pc it appears to be playing sounds twice generating an unwanted echo-effect with a rather random delay always under half a second though

4312208
cstring	bstr
but in this scenario you could use cstring allocsysstring to convert it to a bstr which is compatible with pcwstr

4312209
implements	extends
think like implements an interface or extends a base class to have these properties

4312281
datediff	difference
you need to do self join and get difference using datediff function and get average

4312299
aggregate-functions	sum
create an aggregate-functions that keeps track of the previous date and a running sum and count

4312325
google-chrome	firefox
if i copy the .plugin files into the internet plug-ins folder it will be detected by firefox and google-chrome as well when they are run

4312325
google-chrome	firefox
however the plug-ins are still registered by google-chrome and firefox

4312341
width	height
you can expose a .size property that would contain the height width of user control

4312344
actualheight	actualwidth
are you looking for actualwidth actualheight

4312361
implements	extends
as shown in the button table example we will create a class that extends jbutton and implements tablecellrenderer

4312395
int	boolean
it doesn t know which version of databind you re trying to use because nothing is convertible to both boolean and int

4312397
rss	feed
you could use the views data source module to re-create a rss feed of any length -

4312413
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox seems fine google-chrome and ie the text is still selectable is there any way around this

4312421
inherited	properties
i ve rolled singleton into a class so other classes can inherited singleton properties

4312423
google-chrome	safari
but when i refresh page with google-chrome or safari the cycle starts ignoring the pause command

4312445
getter	setter
properties automatically generate those getter and setter

4312446
getter	setter
iphone error object cannot be set - either readonly property or no setter found error comes when you have not synthesized it and still accessing its setter or and getter method

4312474
webkit	gecko
as the both styles related to gecko webkit are css you can use a class to apply it

4312498
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
like the mozuserselect styling in firefox you can use -webkit-user-select none for webkit based browser like safari and google-chrome

4312504
width	height
with this code i have acces to width and height but how can i have access to bytes of this image

4312509
hash	md5
as for such storing passwords it is not very good while many crackers can use rainbow tables with precomputed md5 sha1 and other hash and they can get password based on such hash

4312509
hash	salt
to prevent it salt should be used hash salt+passwd such salt can be random string saved in database per user or for example user login something that never can be changed

4312532
google-chrome	safari
for wekbit google-chrome and safari you can add

4312549
jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket	tapestry	wicket
not aware of jsf wicket and tapestry based apps but google wave adwords adsense are built using gwt

4312580
width	height
the problem is that when this view fly s in..its width and height changes

4312647
post	get
if you mean a list of recent post then you just get the data from the database and display it in a wall-like way

4312653
equals	compareto
the problem is even treeset.contains returns false i can still find one element in the treeset which is equals when using compareto and equals methods

4312660
integer	unsigned
but the silence value you get given is an unsigned 8-bit integer

4312678
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
opera google-chrome and safari will automatically download the whole video file even if it hasn t started to play yet

4312678
opera	firefox
opera plans to change to the firefox behavior of only loading enough to render a frame and determine duration by default unless the preload attribute says otherwise

4312684
multiplying	add
iteration is looping like you add 1+1+1+1+1 iteratively adding to get 5 or 3 3 3 3 3 iteratively multiplying to get 3 5

4312691
post	get
other approaches depending on your needs include using ajax to post get the request asynchronously or using include require to pull in abc.php if it only includes specific functioanlity.eg

4312722
piston	tastypie
you could try using something like piston or tastypie to quickly get something working

4312722
piston	tastypie
tastypie comes with a built-in shared-secret key authentication mechanism and it s not difficult to find the equivalent code for piston

4312722
piston	tastypie
edit btw i ve been working with both piston and tastypie recently

4312734
equals	compareto
your compareto and equals methods are not consistent and therfore the treeset cannot work correctly with them

4312734
comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator for a

4312801
getter	setter
usually in my own projects i use getter and setter for any field access and i followed to do the same on my job

4312801
getter	setter
so are there any reasons to using getter and setter inside a class for class own fields or is it better to use fields directly

4312834
int	double
in order to apply number formatting you have to pass cash as a number type int double float etc

4312840
multiplying	add
multiplying and add to restore the original

4312841
put	get
you can design a window like it was a dialog and put it in your resourcefile .then use the findresource and loadresource functions to get a pointer to a dlgtemplate which contains all the dialogs layout which you can use to size you own window and place controls at the positions you defined in the dialog it s not easy though to interpret the dlgtemplate

4312864
getter	setter
you want to declare them as public getter and setter and private fields

4312864
getter	setter
this means external classes not subclasses who want to modify the variables all do so through the setter and get them through the getter

4312864
put	get	getter	setter
the benefit of this is that if you want to control how or what condition they get or set them or want to add information or even print debug it means you only have to put it in the getter and setter

4312864
public	protected
in java difference between default public protected and private

4312886
getter	setter
this is part of the general question as to why you use getter and setter

4312886
getter	setter
personally i only put in getter setter if i need to

4312886
getter	setter
in general if i can easily add a getter setter later should i need it i won t add it

4312893
getter	setter
if there is any business logic around those values or there is the potential for such logic then there is a benefit to using getter and setter even for internal calls

4312933
multiplying	add
we then multiplying 12 by the number of years difference and add this to the result giving us the full month span

4312951
nsnull	nsstring
nsstring datavalue array objectatindex i objectforkey key nsnull null

4312971
getter	setter
reduces code behind bloat from getter and setter

4312977
public	protected
also i would make use of the template-method pattern that is a public non overridable getdata method which calls a protected virtual abstract method that should be overriden in a concrete implementation

4313009
getter	setter
that s my 2cent worth on why we have getter setter

4313038
maven	pom.xml
maven derives this information from the module declaration in the pom.xml file

4313052
width	height
you can then use the left top width and height css properties to see if an element is inside this boundary

4313139
superclass	subclassing
suppose that i have an abstract superclass abstract0 with two subclassing concrete1 and concrete1

4313142
innodb	myisam
however i solved the issue by using innodb engine instead of myisam

4313172
public	protected
why not roll them into a single builder abstract base class making the original abstract builder s public methods protected and the concrete subclasses override these as before

4313364
google-chrome	firefox
it does in firefox and internet explorer but not google-chrome

4313366
getter	setter
some people think that they should always encapsulate all fields by using setter getter

4313366
getter	setter
however you must or it s strongly recommended to use setter getter

4313366
getter	setter
in web applications sometimes there are requirements to use setter getter

4313366
getter	setter
if you want to add some extra logic when you set get values you must use setter getter

4313403
google-chrome	safari
i m playing around with websockets and it appears that all browsers with native websocket support i tested with safari google-chrome block some ports

4313411
opera	firefox
this solution works for me in ie firefox and opera

4313433
ubuntu-server	debian
ps with installing newest 3.70uc1 version i had problem problem on one of my old debian machine but it installed without problems on ubuntu-server 9.10

4313454
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but for some reason no data is added to the resultspage slideinresults is called and the empty page appears

4313455
put	get
i put together a regex to get this number but it refuses to work and i can t figure it out

4313458
tablet	galaxy
when i change my project to support android 2.2 i can still deploy the application to the galaxy tablet running on android 2.2

4313465
google-chrome	safari
but as soon as you move the cursor google-chrome and safari change the cursor style to pointer - exactly as it s expected but without mouse move

4313481
email	dkim
i m trying to sign email with dkim using phpmailer class and i can t get it to work

4313481
email	dkim
when i see the headers in my email on gmail i find that the class is successfully injecting dkim in the email header but gmail doesn t even care

4313481
email	dkim
the question is that i ve viewed the headers of linkedin email and i found out that they are using 2 dkim headers domainkey-signature dkim-signature

4313532
google-chrome	safari
the code below not working in google-chrome or safari

4313583
tablet	galaxy
create a new map api key for android 2.2 galaxy tablet

4313594
gif	png
and then there is really no need for gif support because the png file format is superior in almost every way

4313594
gif	png
the only thing supported by gif that is not supported by png is low-quality 1 animations.

4313605
gif	png
on the server the raw image data gif jpeg png is being encoded to base64 which already works fine and i need to decode this string and display the image in my flash movie

4313715
pylons	pyramid
i was planning to move from django to pylons but then i bumped into pyramid

4313715
pylons	pyramid
what are the differences between pylons and pyramid

4313715
pylons	pyramid
i read some text in pylonsbook which currently covers pylons 0.9.7 and wonder if it is a to start for pylons and pyramid

4313763
many-to-many	one-to-many
for the one-to-many or many-to-many hierarchy implement an extra table that would relate the two object

4313830
serializable	deserialization
deserialization does much the same thing as the first step by calling formatterservices.getuninitializedobject and then does much the same thing as the second step by setting the values for fields to be equivalent to those that were recorded during serializable which may require deserialising other objects to be said values

4313842
preferenceactivity	preferencescreen
i have created a preferenceactivity based on xml for preferencescreen

4313860
qimage	qwidget
using qt you can create a simple window with a qwebview this is webkit under the covers and then use qwidget render method to get qpixmap and then convert it to qimage

4313862
range	min	range	max	min	max
but if i give a min of 0 and a max of 1 in the range it always returns me 0

4313886
submit	submission
another reason for implementing a queue is that the user can submit multiple queries at the same time they don t have to wait for the first one to finish before submission another

4313892
range	minimum
you could encode the minimum maximum range into the tag property of each individual control or you could use the index to look them up from arrays

4313919
width	height
i want to add two buttons of width 133 px and 150 px each and 28 px in height on top of every view in my iphone app

4313930
spoofing	traffic
your spoofing server has to be able to listen to all traffic on the network to be able to receive the pings that are not intended to go to itself

4313930
spoofing	traffic
so your spoofing server has to listen to all icmp echo request traffic and generate an appropriate response

4313939
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
also remember array or any other memory chunk allocated with single calloc should be deallocated with single free call with same pointer as returned by malloc

4313956
ceil	floor
in favor of competitive prices you could also consider floor x instead of ceil x though

4313976
sorting	filtering
dataview should be used whenever sorting or filtering is to be applied in code

4313984
directwrite	direct2d
have you considered direct2d directwrite

4313988
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i would now like to not use a .htaccess anymore and instead put all the rewrite logic into my httpd.conf file

4314009
maven	pom.xml
and if you are using maven add this to your pom.xml file

4314017
jar	war
another ugly solution might be to use war file overlays exploiting the fact that this mechanism pays no attention to the versions of component jar files when applying the overlays

4314028
pylons	pyramid
meanwhile pyramid is a continuation of pylons

4314062
trie	tree
preprocess the dictionary into a prefix tree aka trie

4314070
google-chrome	firefox
i was simply confused by the way google-chrome displayed that exception and didn t recognize it as such right away i usually use firefox

4314070
google-chrome	safari
my tests have shown that google-chrome and safari block the following ports only ports below 1024 were tested

4314070
udp	tcp
the associated services are taken from the list of tcp and udp port numbers on wikipeda

4314082
google-chrome	firefox
any idea on how to fix it on firefox and make ie and google-chrome recognize the font type

4314102
kate	kde
it has ftp i m not sure about svn and is has feel similar to kde kate editor that is my first choice

4314121
jboss	glassfish
for java you will need to setup apache server your own java server glassfish jboss or tomcat it s a servlet container and that can be costly whereas php is readily setup when registering for a dns

4314245
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and i suspect safari can show attached event listeners when you select an element in the dom and then scroll down the right sidebar to the event listeners section

4314270
geocoding	geocode
my guess is because the geocoding needs a little time to return and the function continues on before returning the first geocode value

4314439
put	get
if i strip out handle_asynchronously on a mailer everything works fine...but if i put it back in i get

4314448
int	double
with two numeric types int single double etc. it adds the values together as you would expect

4314450
debian	linux
but when i try to run on debian gnu linux 5.0 i have

4314460
mouseover	mouseout
any time you only need to change css on mouseover mouseout events use this method

4314512
scrollable	panels
you can put celltable in a verticalpane and set vertical panels scrollable

4314548
put	get
i know it will take forever to get suggestions drafted tested and put into the css specs but there is no time like the present.

4314550
width	height
you can use the maxwidth maxheight properties of your buttons in concert with setting percentage based width height

4314596
post	get
there is a great blog post about how to get from concept to marketplace here -

4314611
button	checkbox
in your case you ll want to create a simple custom dialog box that includes a message a checkbox and however many button you need

4314611
button	checkbox
basically you need to define a new code-behind file that includes your textblock checkbox and button s in a panel object and you need to extend window

4314632
maven-dependency-plugin	pom.xml
i found a solution by using maven-dependency-plugin to copy resolved pom.xml dependencies and additional jar

4314638
post	get
write up a blog post describing it submit it to some popular sites like a list apart hacker news or reddit -- basically get as many eyes on your idea as you can

4314646
tunnel	packets
are you trying to capture the packets for analysis like wireshark or tcpdump or forward traffic through a gre tunnel

4314646
tunnel	packets
the tunnel interface gre0 is a normal network interface that the system s routing table can send packets to

4314659
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it sounds like you have a uinavigationcontroller as the main vc of your app and a uitabbarcontroller as one of the vc s on its stack

4314659
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i think you should embed the uinavigationcontroller inside the uitabbarcontroller instead of the other way around or you could just choose to use another way of showing what you want to show

4314702
post	get
first make up your mind do you want get or post parameters

4314710
vsto	add-in
i m not sure if shared is required in vsto i use add-in express vsto is such a pain

4314774
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i have crossdomain.xml and clientaccesspolicy.xml files in place in the root of the webserver but i cannot even see these files being requested in fiddler

4314818
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
i would then like to be able to pass the notes collection to a gridview listview or repeater in the relevant asp.net page for the customer or task classes

4314836
querypath	phpquery
as your source is xml you could use querypath or phpquery to filter the initial data set

4314842
width	height
remove width and height parameters

4314870
maven	m2e
maven integration for eclipse m2e version 0.10.2.20100623-1649 this has been configured to point to maven 2.2.1 environment and not to use the embedded maven3 instance

4314878
versioning	upgrade
hopefully heroku will upgrade their versioning of bundler soon to take advantage of some of the performance improvements

4314930
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it sounds like you have both a uinavigationcontroller and a uitabbarcontroller

4314979
getter	setter
check that appropriate getter and or setter methods exist

4314979
getter	setter
ensure that there are proper getter setter methods for the property user of the managed bean with name articles

4314979
getter	setter
check that appropriate getter and or setter methods exist

4314982
getter	setter
everyone suggest to use public getter setter but my app is too big and making a getter setter for each member would just cause maintainability issues

4314992
folder	directory
i downloaded a single dll file and added it to the bin directory of my root folder

4314995
versioning	upgrade
apropos versioning compatibility i use binaryformatter and have no problems with schema upgrade

4314998
width	height
i have drawn all the images separately in the same dimension width x height

4315003
ant	maven
if using maven there are a few ways to achieve something similar such as dropping down to ant using the antrun plugin

4315011
children	parent
you could use the children method to get all direct children of the parent element

4315026
x86	64bit
the application itself works fine under both 32-bit and 64bit windows but i can t use nunit as i get the following exception upon loading the x86 assembly

4315031
vb.net	vb6
i have inherited a frankenstein vb6 converted to vb.net winform application

4315034
folder	directory
the only dependency that i can see is in xmlrpc exception.php as it requires a file in the root directory of zend exception.php you could simply copy this file along with the xmlrpc folder keeping the directory structure the same and it should work..

4315066
gif	png	tiff	png
just add a couple files to your uses list and your application natively supports gif tiff png and many many others

4315103
rss	feed
depending on what you want to use this for you could look at the google ajax feed api which is a javascript api that will let you embed rss feed into your site

4315113
getter	setter
as well as setter and getter

4315113
implements	extends
checkitemrenderer has a label for the string and the image of the checkitem it extends container and implements listcellrenderer

4315128
post	get
it s very good at facilitating http get post requests via the command line

4315131
textwrangler	bbedit
just downloaded bbeedit and suddenly having problems executing script either from bbedit or textwrangler

4315134
button	checkbox
the excel document created as part of this project has a worksheet named start sheet which has some winforms controls like button checkbox etc and there are many other worksheets which mainly contains data

4315160
cvs	svn
then they just hg add the files they do want tracked -- hg add overrides ignore rules unlike in cvs svn

4315162
expandablelistview	expandablelistadapter
try putting this in your expandablelistadapter listview is a reference to the expandablelistview itself

4315179
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
then i want to take this information and on run-time begin to add subtract divide multiplying certain columns and place the information into other columns

boost	stl
i noticed though that when i try to check with other people the things i code using the material i learned they are usually considered non-idiomatic and superseded by an stl way to do it that is safer and easier well the book doesn t cover stl and boost libraries

4315214
boost	stl
i d be particularly interested in sources that included stl and boost stuff

4315266
lisp	smalltalk
i understand that learning smalltalk might be good in the same way that learning lisp is good for one s knowledge but i want to know if learning smalltalk-specific concepts will help me to understand objective-c more completely given smalltalk s role in its origin story

4315315
google-chrome	firefox
on the other hand firefox and google-chrome are deliberately wrong in copying ways in which user agents were frequently wrong some considerable time ago the problem started in the early days of http

4315315
post	get
for this reason 307 was introduced in http 1.1 to be clearer that the same http method should be used in this case it should be a post while 303 has always meant that one should use get

4315386
post	get
here are some examples send http post request get a cookie send a cookie

4315413
pull	push
now i can clone into my new repository and execute pull but i cannot push

4315424
min	max
i m pretty sure that you can add an attribute to the desired element defining its min and max lengths

4315486
getter	setter
you re synthesizing getter and setter for the instance variable so it s good practice to use those to access it they ll take care of retain and releasing appropriately

4315514
pull	push
these settings do not travel from one repository to the other by hg clone hg push or hg pull commands

4315524
post	get
use head instead of get or post

4315544
boost	stl
on top of all that you should read much doc about stl and boost and learn a lot about iterators

4315544
boost	stl
iterators are the key to use stl and boost implementation of containers and algorithms and if you don t know how to use them you won t write c++ idiomatic code

4315602
typedef	typename
see also why do i need to use typedef typename in g++ but not vs

4315607
memcached	apc
why not use something like memcached or apc for this

4315633
temporary	tablespace
you can also create another temporary tablespace with a fixed size and assign the user running the query to that one

4315710
h.264	webm
html5 enabled browsers have a tag that you can use to play a video on your site the encoding depends on the browser until now it was mainly h.264 but recently google mozilla and others joined efforts on the webm project with the new vp8 codec

4315720
getter	setter
a - create a php daemon that runs your world pipe all other traffic to either a getter or setter request file that interacts with the database

4315720
daemon	cron
b - use cron not a daemon

4315886
tcpdf	fpdf
tcpdf and fpdf have nothing on the utf-8 and font support of mpdf

4315942
width	height
so how to set new window width and height not using js

4315948
squash	merge	squash	branch
from other side i do not want to do squash or no-commit merge while difference are significant and could break current state of testing branch

4315974
audiotoolbox	avfoundation
link required frameworks to your target coregraphics opengles quartzcore openal audiotoolbox libz.dylib avfoundation

4315974
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
that said i actually do use a uinavigationcontroller and a uiviewcontroller with a nib file for my initial view

4315985
versioning	upgrade
we re still not using the data lists feature we just recently upgrade from alfresco 3.0 to the newest versioning but we do collect information and we do some counting calculating

4316006
rar	zip
investigate the jar file using a zip or rar tool

4316013
toolbar	tabs
the eui would be excel menus toolbar or ribbon tabs

4316020
public	protected
if foo dosomething is used outside foo.cpp if it s public or protected usually it must go in the header

4316024
children	parent
in the oo world references only go one way and there is no way for nhibernate to know that parent- children is the same fk as child- parent

4316024
children	parent
it s your job in the oo model to ensure that the parent- children collection contains the same set of references as the set of child- parent relationships.

4316034
free	malloc
although now you ll have to keep track of which elements of temp were allocated with malloc so you can free them later

4316050
pdfsharp	itext	pdfsharp	migradoc	itext	migradoc
as an alternative to itext there s also pdfsharp migradoc

4316060
free	malloc
malloc free routines or all

4316084
gridview	sqldatasource
i need to be able to generate a basic csv file of the results returned from an sqldatasource gridview upon the user clicking a button then allow them to save this file

4316131
uiview	subviews
i have successfully added a uiview as a subviews to window but it has no rotation

4316134
awt	swing	swt	swing
note that for the graphic part eclipse uses a library called swt which is a set of widgets that feel and behave in a different way that swing or awt

4316136
rss	feed
the app reads several different sources of rss feed that are outside of my control public facing built by others

4316177
fadein	fadeout
then use jquery mousevents along with fadein and fadeout

4316211
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the standard constructor also works correctly in google-chrome opera and firefox all under ubuntu ie6 ie7 and ie8

4316239
folder	directory
structure your folder so they replicate the production server s directory structure

4316272
jar	manifest.mf
not sure this is even allowed by the spec but you may try to change the manifest.mf for the jar containing the pu adding a classpath entry pointing to the other jar containing descentity

4316294
superclass	subclassing
another approach i was thinking about was to implement the template as a superclass and then create a subclassing for each of the classes i want to test

4316304
mouseleave	mouseenter
so in this solution an interval is set to cycle through and trigger the events mouseenter and mouseleave

4316304
mouseleave	mouseenter
since you might not want the images cycling while your mouse is over an element the interval is cleared upon mouseenter and set up again during mouseleave

4316321
uniq	grep
grep -eo w+ source.file | uniq -c

4316322
next	except
i then need to move repetitively into the folders and then into the next one to perform svn commands which are the same except for some variable extension

4316322
for-loop	arrays
so there should be an arrays or list defined and then a for-loop through that list and then a variable whose name is expanded to be fed into the cp and svn command

4316331
pop-up	dialog
1 instead of redirecting them to a login page i want to cancel the current request and give the user a pop-up dialog box to login with

4316373
union	distinct
these will be distinct result sets as the libname is different so use union all rather than union

4316382
int	chars
i would never write unsigned int or long int or signed anything except chars or bitfields because it increases clutter and decreases the amount of meaningful code you can fit in 80 columns

4316400
popupwindow	pop-up
i m using jquery popupwindow to pop-up the page but i don t have any idea how to fill that form field

4316414
fgets	strtol
it would be better to use fgets and then parse it yourself with strtol and a few for loops

4316424
children	parent
as nick craver pointed out children can t have a greater opacity then their parent why not set the opacity only on the .mostout element

4316431
groupbox	panel
as well as the usual manual panel and groupbox controls

4316438
boost	stl
moreover well-known c++ libraries like stl or boost propose their code in header files only which is a sign of good design

4316466
put	get
the issue that i m running into is that if i put a listview in the itemtemplate of my hierarchicaldatatemplate i get a listview for each child rather than a single listview with content

4316467
int	chars
rough estimate 12 bytes for array header 4x5 bytes for the pointers 8x5 if you re on a 64 bit jvm each string has 3 int +3x4 bytes and an array of chars +12 bytes for header + length of the string x2 because it s chars

4316497
xslt	xquery
the good part is in this version you can mix xquery and xslt code to get best of both worlds

4316499
versioning	upgrade
i d prefer not to tamper with the library so i can fetch upgrade by just untarring the new versioning

4316516
htmlcleaner	jsoup
instead of htmlcleaner i would recommend you try jsoup

4316518
children	parent
while it s memory-hungry a user can select de-select individual files and it s pretty easy to automatically select de-select all the children when somebody checks a parent folder

4316527
firefox	safari
for example safari on windows applies some heavy anti-aliasing to make text smooth which makes it look blaringly different on firefox even on the same machine

4316579
mp3	flv
u can only embedd cue point into flv files not mp3

4316696
calloc	malloc
i have written this source code for my better understanding of malloc and calloc

4316723
calloc	malloc
as you point out calloc zeroes out the memory is allocates while malloc doesn t

4316767
free	malloc
malloc free routines or all

4316769
free	malloc
on the other hand calling malloc b a times will results in a individual objects of size b which can be free independently and which are not in an array though you could store their addresses in an array of pointers

4316797
move	drag
we already successfully made one leg of the spider in the blender has bones and armature and ik constraint so in blender i can drag the leg to move

4316801
folder	directory
i tried copying the .libs the .dlls debug versions .pdbs both to the locations which my project uses and additional library directory and to the project s folder but this must be not enough

4316856
min	max
when you use an aggregation function as min max sum avg etc you need to include every column in the select statement that are not in any aggregation function

4316869
opera	google-chrome
however it was exclusive to ie---ff google-chrome and opera handled the modal appropriately

4316872
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade license is valid from any prior versioning including express

4316881
division	multiplication
so in objective-c the normal mathematical order of operations would be applied to the expression above â the division and the multiplication would be done first the additions afterwards

4316881
implements	extends
it then extends the c syntax to provide a means for posting messages to objects and for declaring and implements the messages an object may receive

4316888
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i simply want to enforce a hard page break that firefox safari and google-chrome will listen to

4316888
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
changing it to 9 inches seems to give me enough margin room for printing from all safari firefox and google-chrome when i have it set to a standard us paper size

4316899
pull	push
these basic commands are pull push init commit -am message

4316899
pull	push
same key combo plus git pull or git push for pulling in changes from code repository or pushing changes to code repository respectively

4316911
getter	setter
these getter and setter methods are working fine without using spring

4316955
width	height
from what i can see looking at the jquery ui code .swap is not called directly by it the only place in the jquery framework itself that uses .swap directly are the height and .width calls when retrieving the computed height width of an element

4316955
width	height
jquery ui uses height and width functions everywhere so it is little wonder that the .swap function figures highly in the profile

4317086
serializable	deserialization
it can help find places that are accidentally creating an instance of your util class where you didn t mean for it to serializable deserialization etc

4317182
portrait	landscape
i managed to do that in portrait mode with hidden edittext but when i change the orientation to landscape the sw keyboard opens with the white text field which covers all the space above the keyboard and it shows the text user has written

4317203
post	get
there is not much difference between a post and a get

4317217
nunit	fakeiteasy
i m developing an ease-it-in strategy using nunit and fakeiteasy

4317245
versioning	upgrade
i have an old grails 1.1.1 project that i had to upgrade to versioning 1.3.5 with sts pro

4317247
freebsd	opensolaris
- can i expect the same script to run in opensolaris as well as redhat freebsd

4317251
emacs	gedit	geany	gedit
how can i configure it so that when i create and edit files in emacs the formatting looks the same in editors such as geany or gedit it seems that the indentation is never preserved correctly

4317266
int	double
in this code the x and y are the tags of the c code above they re called type constructors because they construct an xy type out of an int or a double resp.

4317292
sys	subprocess
import subprocess os sys

4317294
entity-relationship	diagram
i have to create an entity-relationship diagram based on a relational schema

4317294
entity-relationship	diagram
i ve come up with this simple entity-relationship diagram but i m not sure having relationships going each way is allowed

4317306
post	get
i actually connect in my univ to the network through a captive portal at this url time ago i made a program to connect to it which worked perfect c++ libcurl sending an http post with the needed query string such as username and password but i think it was because there wasn t still the ssl a x.509 cert that now seems to work with a get instead of the post that used before

4317335
implements	extends
create a class that extends composite and implements requiresresize

4317337
rss	feed
from experience i ve found real world feed are often more complex than the rss parser can handle

4317366
bash	zsh
but almost every command in bash works in zsh the same way

4317366
freebsd	opensolaris
i saw zsh working on all linuxes freebsd and opensolaris

4317366
bash	zsh
why i prefer zsh z shell to bash

4317384
integer	unsigned
so the returned unsigned 8-bit integer contains all the possible values of zero amplitude for these formats

4317404
int	double
understand how to use pointers and getvalue to take in the input as a wxstring but that does me no good if i can t get the string as a double or int then i can t perform operations on it

4317410
bash	tcsh
freebsd includes sh csh and tcsh by default with bash and others in ports

4317410
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
once upon a long time ago mac os x used tcsh by default but it now uses bash by default and includes zsh along with most common shells

4317426
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
also if you re using firefox google-chrome or safari try checking your javascript console for errors

4317432
ubuntu	linux
by the way the only other platform tested is linux ubuntu 10.04 where it runs just fine

4317459
implements	extends
okay i agree that stinks but a t extends array and also implements ilist and i wonder if it implements ...

4317475
getter	setter
it creates the getter setter for you automatically

4317481
google-chrome	firefox
the following worked on ie8 firefox and google-chrome

4317482
getter	setter
if you refer to facebook then it will access the variable directly if you access self.facebook then it will go through the setter getter methods

4317511
coalesce	isnull
you can t use coalesce or isnull inside the select prod_id .

4317515
folder	directory
there is an external program that runs on a given directory creates output files folder etc

4317524
ubuntu	linux
i m using ruby 1.8 and linux ubuntu and slax and i need to write a script in ruby which finds out if some specific usb device is connected to the system and on which usb port 0 1 2 etc

4317555
accessor	properties
properties create these accessor and also provide things like proper key-value change notifications and atomic access

4317610
cpu	processors
if your going to implement a time based demo consider using one based on processors time and not an absolute date.the idea being the user can use your application fully for say 4 hours of cpu time

4317614
post	get
in which i will get the post entered in the text area of blog as an object in js and send that object to java server side

4317631
subclass	abstract-class
the following suggestion let s you test abstract-class without creating a real subclass - the mock is the subclass

4317631
subclass	abstract-class
in my honest opinion this is neater than using a spy since a spy requires an instance which means you have to create an instantiatable subclass of your abstract-class

4317647
post	get	post	put	put	get
in .net the httpwebrequest object is where you gather together all the pieces of info to be sent across the wire - including command http method get put post etc and byte stream

4317650
getter	setter
properties can generate getter and setter

4317650
mutators	getter
getter and properties for non-objects are mostly for orthogonality of coding style although they do have potential to be used for mutators key-value notifications etc

4317725
maven	pom.xml
i was able to configure the eclipse project and maven pom.xml to use jpa 2.0 metamodel generator in the build compile process

4317749
cos	sin
where degtorad x converts from degrees to radians cosz and sinz are the cos and sin of the z-angle from the gyroscope respectively and anglex and angley are the x and y angles from the gyroscope

4317749
portrait	landscape
the x-angle from the gyroscope measures up-down angle y-angle measures left-right and z-angle measures rotation of the phone from portrait to landscape

4317796
cvs	svn
you can also copy the .prefs files from to a folder called .settings in the root folder of your project and then add it to svn or cvs or ...

4317805
google-chrome	firefox
so text shadows in firefox and google-chrome are grate

4317845
hide	show
alternatively wrap the footer view in a wrap_content height framelayout and hide show the inner view leaving the framelayout visible

4317860
sorting	filtering
for more complex sorting filtering needs you may want to try glazed lists

4317861
hide	show
the droid-fu library has a class designed for having a loading footer show and hide listadapterwithprogress

4317888
pop-up	dialog
i ve already got the dialog box made but i m trying to add a semi-transparent gray rectangle over everything behind the pop-up again like the one used in asp.net

4317898
pop-up	dialog
the jquery dialog box pop-up like it should but when i click on the upload file button nothing happens

4317922
post	get
changing the input name attribute to match the url var name tzip to zip along with changing post to get did the trick but for some reason it s adding two additional url variables as well x 0 y 0

4317949
put	get
if there are less than 6 element left at the end they get put into a new ul as well

4317953
width	margin
when i create a new uiviewcontroller subclass myviewcontroller with xib and add this code to get the add the view to the window the contents always appear too high up by the same width as the default recommended left right margin

4317966
integer	unsigned
mysql s last_insert_id function will return the id from the latest insert on an auto_increment column on the current connection so if your column is an integer unsigned like you said it could return values greater than 2147483647

4317966
versioning	upgrade
do i need to upgrade mysql to a newer versioning

4317980
pull	push
click options and then select the allow push of a new branch or force push or pull option as needed

4318053
put	get
to get really tricky once the connection is made to the server the two computers can then be put into direct contact but that involves udp packets and some clever magic

4318103
width	height
essentially i would like to have a fluid height width listbox

4318151
put	get
specify that you allow read write sharing on the file and put a streamreader on your stream to get the same behaviour as file.opentext

4318190
portrait	landscape
each view has two nibs one for portrait orientation and one for landscape so i m searching for a method to programmatically switch nib for a given uiviewcontroller

4318207
spweb	spsite
this is happening because you have nodes present in the database but the actual spsite or spweb is not present in the content database

4318234
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
the second one uses the properties accessor the first just uses the ivar

4318253
serializable	deserialization
what s the correct way to declare the serializable deserialization

4318262
portrait	landscape
one for portrait and one for landscape

4318263
int	chars
it seems that subtracting 0 from the chars is casting it to an int

4318263
int	chars
convert another chars in to an int

4318284
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	solaris	bsd
this is native on unix platforms linux macâ osâ x solaris bsd etc. and installable on other platforms such as windows and android

4318300
int	chars	unsigned	short
because chars is the same as short although an unsigned short you can safely cast it to an int

4318304
int	chars
hence a chars which is a numerical value minus an int results in an int

4318312
getter	setter
how can i put validation in the getter and setter methods in c#

4318320
hide	show
i would rather use animation that does the whole thing first show the control then hide it

4318336
width	height
if i give my viewstack a fixed height the scrollbars appear but i don t want to give a fixed width

4318349
int	chars
chars s are converted to int implicitly

4318359
int	chars
when you use the - operator with chars java performs the operation with the int values

4318361
int	chars
a chars just like a short or byte will always be silently cast to int if needed

4318379
profiling	instrumentation
run some time profiling on it using instrumentation

4318380
int	chars
chars is considered a subtype of int so any chars may be assigned to an int

4318391
hide	show
i want to hide the filter div if the category div is show on page load

4318398
int	chars
why does c++ and probably c as well allow me to assign and int to a chars without at least giving me a warning

4318446
int	chars
the reasons chars pointers are guaranteed to work like this is so that you can for example copy int from anywhere in memory to elsewhere in memory or disk and back which turns out to be a pretty useful thing to do in low-level programming graphics libraries

4318459
pop-up	dialog
you also with some non-standard browsers ie have to set the disposition of the file to get the download file dialog box to pop-up and process the response correctly with a progress indicator

4318475
hide	show
i want to show the name of the menu when the mouse goes over it and hide it when mouse goes out

4318490
public	protected
thingbase would contain all the data in a protected structure providing public read-only properties for the fields and protected read-only property for its structure

4318501
innodb	myisam
changetableengine method is used to change table engine from myisam to innodb for instance

4318501
innodb	myisam
- new engine name memory myisam innodb etc

4318536
post	put
i read it s possible to put the form on http but post it to https but i read someone saying that it can be exploited with a man in the middle attack

4318536
post	put
i read it s possible to put the form on http but post it to https but i read someone saying that it can be exploited with a man in the middle attack

4318542
int	chars
if you asked to convert between float int and unsigned chars six or seven times in a single expression well that must be what you wanted

4318561
hide	show
assuming by show on page load you mean rendered and not the show hide visibility

4318623
width	height
i bet start has negative x or y when error happens or the size.hight + y or size.width + x is bigger than height or width of the image

4318627
portrait	landscape
been a long while since i solved this kind of problem but if its just a question of moving from portrait to landscape couldn t you just swap azimuth and inclination values as needed

4318628
submit	submission
i have a html form where i enter my data and before submission i need to view my data in the html form and if i need changes change it rt there and submit

4318629
width	height
the default width and height of a viewstack container is the width and height of the first child

4318635
width	height
when reaching 1280px of width and 830 px of height which is the limit resolution less than this things go wrong i m trying to get all the elements fixed nothing floats anymore so the scroll bars show the visitor can use them and no element gets under nothing

4318645
post	get
also it looks like you re sending through post but trying to retrieve through get

4318665
hide	show
use hide .show to show and hide elements

4318710
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
the intention of my upgrade msi is to uninstall the old versioning and reinstall the new versioning so that the old components are not left behind

4318710
min	max
i modified it so that the row with had the version min set to 1.0.0.0 version max set to the version number of the previous version and the attributes set to 768

4318710
min	max	versioning	upgrade
i modified the row with to have versioning min set to the versioning number of your upgrade versioning max set to blank and attributes set to 258

4318725
width	margin
because you re explicitly setting the widths of your container and inner divs you can center the inner div by setting it s left margin to an exact pixel length rather than using margin auto which is only needed for containers of indefinite or variable width

4318772
post	get
i won t post the entire thing they get pretty long

4318780
put	get
or to put it differently is it possible to get the current logincontext at run-time as some kind of system property and not by creating a new one

4318788
apache	nginx
here is a chart showing the respective performances of nginx apache and g-wan

4318794
accessor	properties
instead properties create accessor methods that manage retention and foster encapsulation

4318813
button	checkbox
for now when the delete button is clicked the checkbox is checked

4319013
post	get
right now i have it so that selecting an item from the gridview uses jquery to do a ajax post with the id to a webmethod in the code behind where it can then go off the database and get all the details of the record

4319076
inherited	subclassing
i can subclassing activity but that falls over as soon as i use a mapview and am forced to use mapactivity so not all my activities inherited from my subclassing

4319076
inherited	subclassing
where inherited isn t applicable i am tending to put generic methods and member variables into a subclassing of the application object but i m finding it s creating a mess of code as every class needs to either grab access to the application object through via context or i have to pass it down

4319101
iboutlet	ibaction
iboutlet ibaction actually mean nothing to the compiler but they let ib recognise the ivars it can send messages to or that will write to elements in a xib

4319113
versioning	upgrade
you might want to upgrade if your on an older versioning

4319123

put	get
they will get an awakefromnib message so that s a good place to put some code to check on what the state of the app is see if you have to do stuff with your object to bring it up to speed

4319295
post	get
you will need to change the form method from post to get and also rename the text input from tzip to zip otherwise your url will look like this

4319328
next	except
your implication is that the fsm shouldn t actually need 100 of the cpu which leads me to assume you are spending a lot of time doing nothing except checking to see if you need to move to the next state or not

4319351
isometric	draw
i draw the tiles using 3 separate calls to drawsprite one for the top one for the side one for the front using a source rectangle to pick the face i want to draw and a destination rectangle to set the position on the screen according to a formula to convert from 3d world coordinates to isometric orthographic

4319351
for-loop	loops
i tried using a different approach creating a second 3-tiers nested for-loop after the first one so i keep the top face drawing in the first loops and the edge highlight in the second loops i know this is inefficient i should also probably avoid having a method call for each tile to draw it but i m just trying to get it working for now

4319381
colorbox	thickbox
the difference is that thickbox uses the css position fixed to align the box whereas colorbox uses a relative position

4319411
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
to make this example easier let s assume that all real internet connectivity is fronted by a cluster of k http accelerators reverse proxies such as nginx lighttpd apache which have very easy configuration just internal ips to forward to

4319411
salt	md5
my-application-php - which would depend on mod_php apache and would include generated file like etc my-php-application config.inc.php that will include mysql database ips hostnames and login password generated as md5 current source code revision + salt

4319411
salt	md5
if yes - connects to the database applies migrations to bring it up to the new version kills all older logins passwords and recreates the new login password pair again generated using md5 revision + salt method

4319411
put	get
if you ll put more details here or as a separate question i ll gladly try to get into details

4319423
implements	extends
mvc is the most extensible and if you are familiar with how things work under the covers you ll probably be better off than implements a hard to extends ms thing like odata and wcf

4319433
put	get
when i need get weather for some city i put this link

4319437
windmill	mechanize

4319442
fadein	hide
you can just chain a hide with a fadein like this

4319475
width	height
you set the width and height but not the top or left properties so they will be set to 0 by default - ie the top left of the parent component

try to use double or better float coordinates instead of int

4319506
put	get

4319506
put	get
where do i put the proxy on my side so that i can access it with a jquery get

4319545
post	get
not really the right answer because you want ids in your array but i post it anyway because it s nice and short and you might actually get away with it

4319555
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
i suppose i can just add the units as they are in my methods adding matching units together and only converting in order to add subtract multiplying divide when they are requested which is great for adding and subtract

4319555
subtract	add
the example was mostly to discourage the reflexive answer that you add or subtract them piece-wise before converting at the last moment since and will fail

4319561
inherited	properties
projects tasks and sub-tasks all have a lot of similar properties so i thought i would use inherited but can t figure out how to query particular projects

4319775
entity-relationship	entities	entity-relationship	diagram
at this early stage it is normal to model entities and relations not attributes that s why it is called an entity-relationship diagram

4319775
entity-relationship	diagram
however i thought when mapping a relational schema back to an entity-relationship diagram a junction table becomes a relationship

4319782
getter	setter
it is easy to understand the concept of setter getter for a simple data an nsinteger for example

4319782
getter	setter
the setter for a changes the value of a and the getter only gets returns its value

4319782
getter	setter
it is then easy to understand atomic nonantomic concept since atomic will guarantee that reading a when a is being chnaged will always return a whole value getter and setter are synchronized

4319782
nsstring	nsdata	getter	setter
but what i do not clearly understand is setter and getter for properties which are pointers to objects nsdata nsstring for example

4319811
free	malloc
subsequently i have also obtained the malloc free source code from rowley - perhaps you could ask keil for their version

4319827
width	height
i know i could create an event handler that when i zoom in it adds width and height to each of the rectangles but then i have to worry about increasing the x and y positions of each of the rectangles so i keep the same distance between each one and so forth

4319831
hide	show
you can test it out here what this does it toggle the sibling still but then looks at its .siblings that have an id attribute and hide them if show

4319843
webclient	webrequest
my bet is that the speedup you re experiencing is not significant enough for your taste because you re either using a subtype of webrequest or a class relying on it such as webclient

4319866
debian-based	ubuntu
on ubuntu debian-based use apt-get install build-essential or search and install via yum on rhel-based systems i believe it would be something like yum install gcc

putting too much information into the styles can limit their use especially when dealing with landscape and portrait layouts

4320210
portrait	landscape
mypage defines the common properties for your layout and you then override these values in the portrait and landscape extensions

4320210
portrait	landscape
i..e you might have more right and left padding in landscape than portrait

4320222
pbkdf2	salt
if i use pbkdf2 from rfc 2898 with a common salt iterations and passphrase to generate an aes256-cbc key and iv on both sides i think i can authenticate the user and provide an encrypted channel all in one step

4320269
hash	md5

you have to convert the chars value to an int and then average

4320306
int	chars
in c if you cast a chars to an int you just get the ascii value of it

4320309
int	chars
when you cast a chars which is what token is to int you get its ascii value in c - which is 49.

4320317
post	get
controllers take the get and post requests and make the calls needed for a view to print the result often checking the parameters and multiplexing multiple model calls to get all of the appropriate data

4320317
put	get
models get and put data

4320317
put	get
controllers just get and put they neither generate html output nor access the data directly and models are mostly sql or other forms of getting data and stuffing it into something structured

4320323
post	get
i am going to answer you here on your original question try not to post duplicates - if your question does not get answered there is probably a reason

4320337
queue	fifo
so perhaps a better way to describe this data structure would be a queue fifo with the possibility of removing items mid-queue

4320344
ssl	https
this is conceptually similar to the way that https connections work over web proxies - the browser just says connect me to this destination and establishes an ssl connection with the desired endpoint

4320349
int	chars
casting a chars to an int takes the ascii value of the chars

4320369
next	except
there is no such thing as data past eof except depending on the implementation perhaps up to the next multiple of the filesystem disk blocksize

4320382
ant	maven
maybe ant or maven can help you

4320423
client-side	server-side
unfortunately actual usage has never quite replaced the character for this function and it is poorly supported by server-side code including asp.net which limits the ability of client-side code to adopt it pretty much no browser does

4320442
pbkdf2	salt	hmac	pbkdf2
use pbkdf2 with two different salt to generate two different keys - first the data is encrypted using cbc with the first key and then a hmac is calculated over the ciphertext using the second key

the above code seems to work fine in opera and firefox but the issue mentioned above happens in safari and google-chrome

4320730
superclass	subclassing
so far the only solution i ve found is to define a class method in the subclassing that calls the class method in the superclass

4320813
spweb	spsite
spweb and spsite

4320813
spweb	spsite
now this is a bit confusing but a spsite represents a site collection and a spweb represents a single site

4320813
sharepoint	spsite	spweb	spsite
say you have a sharepoint site on hxxp sharepointsite.com well the site collection spsite would be hxxp sharepointsite.com and a spweb would be hxxp sharepointsite.com blog or hxxp sharepointsite.com about

4320813
spweb	splist
basically a site collection is a collection of spweb which are a collection of splist and other things you won t care about

4320819
post	put
i basically have a script that lets users post comments but i have it setup so that at the begin of every comment the user put in the script puts in hate automactically which is how i want it to work but sometimes the user put in hating themselves and it comes out with hating hating and then users comment

4320868

why don t you keep the one static method in the superclass and have it return the appropriate shape subclassing

4320906
width	margin
margin 141 170 0 0 verticalalignment top width 300 horizontalalignment left

4320912

this would also simplify modifying the height and width of the matrix by using data.setrowcount newvalue

4320943
rss	feed
for a php-driven rss feed am i just overwriting the same xml file every time i publish a new feed thing

4320962

4321068
width	height
keepthis true tb_iframe 1 width 1000 height 400 model true

4321094
expression-blend	silverlight
silverlight will be quicker to develop - as animation data binding and charts via the silverlight toolkit are part of the platform - and there are mature tools for designing and developing it expression-blend and visual studio

4321101
google-chrome	firefox
it is displayed proeprly in firefox and ie but in google-chrome it is not displayed

4321311
qtableview	qtablewidget
assuming you are using a qtableview or qtablewidget for your table you can receive a qt-signal whenever the set of selected cells has changed by doing this

4321311
mouse	keyboard
note that that will work whether the selection was changed via the mouse keyboard or some other means

4321311
qtableview	qmouseevent	superclass	subclassing
if you really need the callback only when the selection was made via a qmouseevent you could probably implement that by overriding qtableview mousepressevent and or qtableview mousereleaseevent in a subclassing and setting a flag to true before calling up to the superclass and setting it false again afterwards and checking the flag within your selectionwaschanged slot

4321325
firefox	safari
i ve tested everything to work properly in internet explorer firefox and safari

4321335
submit	submission
the submit button will just do the submission etc

4321701
post	get
and the full-size url will be able to get to the post effectively since 25 characters gives you about 10 45 messages forever

4321728
public	protected
do public fields still have a place or should all fields be private protected and accessed via properties

int	double
i recently ran across the problem that i wanted a function to work on both double and int and wondered why there is no common interface for all number types containing arithmetic operators and comparisons

4322387
width	margin
to avoid this place image in div span set width of div span and use margin 0 auto

4322393
width	height
so in your case you could set the bounds-rectangle to cgrectmake -width 2 -height 2 width height and set its transform to

the effect is that the owning form does not need to call invokerequired begininvoke to update its controls

4327572
implements	extends
i guess you will have to determine specific order in which to eval them you might take a note which files include which to determine this order or take a look at extends and implements

4327602
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a gridview that appears in a modal popup that is generated dynamically and is bound to a dynamically generated sqldatasource

is there anyway i could alter my code to make it work with google-chrome firefox and ie

4327638
client-side	server-side
i ve always wondered how to decide on choosing between using server-side code versus client-side code to build html pages

4327663
implements	extends
you target class could implements a virtual method retrieveallknownfiletypes which the subclasses would extends and which the rest of your code could evaluate

4327665

4327829
width	height
going into expression and changing the document size to 96 pixels per inch does not indicate that it will change the document width height when you hit ok unless you tab off of it first - this is what got me

4327829
width	height
you have to change to 96 pixels per inch then tab off -expression then will then suggest a new width and height which is much bigger

4327840
decimal	ieee
floating point isn t able to represent certain decimal values exactly - this is a limitation of the standard ieee floating-point algorithm

it s also worth pointing out that any items in bigdata that have a timestamp min mdtimes or max mdtimes will not be included in any data segment .

4328058
database-normalization	denormalization
start with a reasonable level of database-normalization by reasonable i mean readable maintainable and efficient but not prematurely optimized then if you hit performance issues as you grow you have the option of looking into ways in which denormalization may increase performance

4328059
puts	gets
this is just one way to accomplish the task the onlyoneisenrolled gathers all the 1 s then notinoneisenrolled gets all the emps not in the above the final part of the query puts them together

4328078
put	get
i don t really get the way these objects works i think you need to put all the info into them and provide an ofset of some sort to show the separators between pixel normal and texture coordinates

4328103
width	height
most browsers and or the underlying os itself impose a minimum width and height for windows -- there is nothing you can do to alter this via javascript

4328148
next	except
everything works except for one issue - i did a setinterval that runs a function that does a trigger click so that it goes to the next tab after 5000 miliseconds

4328148
setinterval	clearinterval
i understand why it s happening i just wonder if there were a way to restart the setinterval timing without having to do a clearinterval and creating an entirely new setinterval

4328148
setinterval	clearinterval
thanks for the replies - the reason i was trying to avoid using clearinterval was because i was having issues of how to write the code in a way where the clearinterval would stop the setinterval completely

4328194
int	double
if you still go back to double for this you still won t get much further than 1475 but you should be able to figure out how to do even this part with exact int math only â º

4328350
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
solving the captcha on maps.google.com helps in firefox safari and google-chrome but with internet explorer the maps still don t work on other websites after solving the captcha

post	get
i ve want to get a simple partial view in the shared folder to post to a specific controller so that i can re-use it elsewhere such as for articles blogs etc

4328380
width	margin
keep in mind that the width css property on the div only applies to the content so you need to set the margin-left to be the sum of the width border margin and padding properties of the first div

4328381
textarea	textbox
but i want to get all form input controls textbox checkbox textarea dropdown radio in my selector to grab the first enabled and not hidden control

with lxml you ll have to invest more time learning but it generally considered not only by me a better alternative to beautifulsoup

4328408
put	get
i put in some extra examples to check if the user is actually trying to get to the registration or login page and what step they are on there

4328430
mouseleave	mouseenter
you could also probably unbind the mouseleave when you click so that it isn t firing to no effect after the mouseenter has been unbound

4328435
post	get
the only problem is that when i dump the post vars i don t get the posted variable

4328449
getter	setter
which takes advantage of the syntactic sugar for getter and setter

4328449
getter	setter
the getter definition must exist for the setter definition to work

4328450
post	get
i think that it would be appropriate to post the basic conclusions of the recent thread on this topic on the d newsgroup here so that those who don t track that list can still get the appropriate answer

4328491
lisp	smalltalk
in addition many of the hottest development lanaguages borrow heavily from lisp and smalltalk both of which pioneered object oriented methodologies long before c++ came along

4328491
lisp	smalltalk
javascript ruby perl 6 and perl 5 moose object system all use mixins which were first used in lisp and smalltalk

4328508
post	put
the issue is that some clients set the expect header and only send the request headers before a put or post of data

4328508
post	put
this allows the server to respond with errors redirects security violations prior to the client sending the request body put or post data

4328548

i have tried the src and bin folder inside the project directory and even placed it directly into the project directory but nothing seems to work

extjs	sproutcore
i m very curious about the community s opinions on server side frameworks like django and ror versus client side frameworks like sproutcore and extjs

4329168
direct3d	directdraw
the device i am working on is a custom framework where direct3d is not an option though i do have information from the board manufacturer that directdraw is supported and 2d hardware acceleration is available so that shouldn t be an issue

4329229

keydown onkeydown and keyup onkeyup issues

4329359

ubuntu	linux
i am running linux ubuntu with an x86 processor

4329469

can i check if a number is even or odd by using add and subtraction

4329587
implements	extends
and classes that extends proxy that implements the functions needed for for each loops

4329588
folder	directory
because these files are placed in the tools directory they are only visible to executables in that folder all other apps on your system will continue to use the winsock dll in your system32 folder

4329592
put	get
i also tried to put a try catch block around the code to see if i could get the error

4329622
gridview	repeater
basically when in a repeater of any kind which a gridview is the names are no longer all the same from the group property as a result of the way asp.net names things inside a repeater essentially each control gets a prefix to make it unique

4329626
children	parent
i m looking for a way to achieve the inverse so the children layouts would override specific blocks of the parent similar to django templates

4329626
children	parent
that way if i wanted to add that footer i would just change the parent and the children would continue to override just the content

4329657
google-chrome	safari
webkit supports it so it is possible in safari and in google-chrome

4329679
division	modulo
okay you re not specifying which operators you can use but since you mentioned in one comment that you only really abhor division and modulo i propose this

4329735
textinput	textfield
method in the autocomplete component textinput is my textfield

4329767
devise	cancan
typically you could use devise for authentication and cancan for authorization

4329909
hash	md5
i am looking to encrypt hash passwords to md5 or sha-256 preferably sha-256

4329927
hash	salt
if you re not familiar with it salt is a set of random bits that are included as an input to the hashing function which goes a long way to thwart dictionary attacks against a hash password using a rainbow table

internationalization	localization
i am going to be disabling the localization internationalization plugins on the website which is going to change every single page s url on the website from to the en portion is being stripped out

super	implements
if you implements clone clonable in the correct way you will not have any super class problem

4330013
printf	strlen	printf	strcpy	strlen	strcpy
this will cause printf and every other string-using function like strlen strcpy etc. to run off the end of the string into unallocated heap memory or stack memory depending on how you resolve the uninitialized pointer issue

4330043
post	get
basically the first from gives us a stream which we use for the async post in the first let the third from will ignore the result of the upload thus strangely named variable _ and finally the last from simply subscribes to the result of the get response

4330057
google-chrome	firefox
seems to just be with ie as google-chrome and firefox work fine without the addclass

4330057
google-chrome	firefox
you can verify in this fiddle that firefox and google-chrome are fine

4330073

if file2.xls then it will be moved to a directory s folder b

4330100
int	chars
main.cpp in function int sdl_main int chars

4330104
passenger	thin
so it turns out to be phusion passenger or nginx depending on how you look at it - and thin as well that doesn t add a date http response header combined with what i see as a bug in .net httpwebrequest in my situation there s no if-modified-since thus date shouldn t be necessary leading to the problem

4330108
mouseup	mousedown
you might need to check other events also mousedown mouseup etc

4330116
rss	feed
so i have an iphone app that consist of a tabbarcontroller 5 tableviews one for each rss feed and a webview to show the selected news post

4330135

essentially i want the text to fadein delay for a 3 seconds and then fadeout

4330208

4330222
jar	war
with maven is it possible to have a top-level project who s packaging type is war which will build itself and all of its dependent modules packaged as jar and have the build generate a project.war file

4330222
maven	pom.xml
so basically i need something which is effectively like declaring a for maven to build and in that same pom.xml declaring a on that same module which needs to be built

4330223
children	parent
in derived type models everything about the parent is guaranteed to be true about the children lsp in this composed type model everything about the children is guaranteed to be true about the parent. instead of new dog animal new cat animal it s new dog cat catdog so you get a new construction of all statements that are true about cats and dogs

4330261
min	max
if so max and min ok

4330309

you may want to have that top-level project be the parent of both the war project and of the jar projects that are dependencies in the war

4330326
packets	pcap
i wrote a very simple c program to do a packets capture using pcap

4330344
int	chars
finally shorts int and longs must all be made up of an integral number of chars

4330344
int	chars
if you were to port a c++ compiler to them you could legally decide to have 9 bits in a chars 18 in both short and int and 36 in long

4330369
post	put
following on the logic in 1 you need to post the message using postthreadmessage to put it in the thread s message queue

4330379
selecteditem	selectedindex
this limitation may seem a bit strange but it simplifies the logic as now selecteditem has a one-to-one correspondence with selectedindex for items in the list

4330411
division	multiplication	division	modulo	multiplication	modulo
they are arithmetic operators equivalent to multiplication or division by a power of 2 modulo some weirdness about how c treats negative numbers

4330416
google-chrome	safari
safari same as google-chrome as they are both webkit.

4330438
min	max
2. re-size the data based on new max and min coordinates for x and y

4330438
min	max
this needs to be reproducible when re-sized across a spectrum of possible max and min values

4330439
rss	feed
i have to parse a rss feed and display the same in android

4330439
rss	feed
also changing the rss feed is not an option.

4330456
asp.net-mvc	openrasta	wcf	openrasta
in my opinion openrasta s strong focus on resources means it s much closer to roy fielding s original vision for restful architecture than many of the multi-purpose web http frameworks including wcf and asp.net asp.net-mvc

4330465
versioning	upgrade
is there a chance that the upgrade is not truly replacing the previous versioning of there app

4330493
post	get
written directly into the post so i may have got a couple of the parameters wrong but you get the idea

4330496
rss	feed
move the five rss feed from the tab bar to the left tableview the user can then select the rss feed which will push the rss feed into the left tableview

4330518
maven	pom.xml
in case it helps anyone here s the full maven 2 pom.xml of project 2 in the accepted answer

4330560
for-loop	loops
and as a matter of fact it gives better performance than the explicit c-style for-loop as others benchmarks have shown because perl is able to do the counting loops in nice efficient internal code

4330586
hash	salt
don t use a simple hash or even a salt hash

4330604
ubuntu	linux
my operation system is linux ubuntu and my processor is x86

4330620
children	parent
that way if i wanted to add that footer i would just change the parent and the children would continue to override just the content

4330713
factories	presenter
autofac s delegate factories are a true joy here since you can just inject a delegate into the presenter and autofac will automagically wire it up as if it were a factories pseudocode follows

4330728
width	height
i need to render the value of the width or height of a 2d geometry object and the request is for it to not just be text but somewhat like a dimension that would be a set of building plans

4330754
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this working proposal is supported in recent firefox google-chrome and safari

4330765
children	parent
i have a parent with many children which is fine

4330770
free	malloc
one more remark what i would like to add is can i call the free anywhere from the program or it is required to call from some particular locations like the place where the malloc has been called or at the end of the program

4330786
put	get
if you intend for getoffset to be a property you need to put in the get and set keywords

4330789
hash	md5
result â s arg parameter value is the temporary hash placeholder for â s output md5 i believe that the template class reserves until later

4330798
free	malloc
you need the same number of free calls as malloc calls

4330802
parallels	bootcamp
the harder ways are to use bootcamp or a virtual machine like parallels to run windows xp with ie6 or attempt use winebottler to run ie6 without windows

4330810
children	parent
parent must exist before they have children

4330834
glassfish	resin
fyi atmosphere run on top of resin glassfish and jetty

in this blog post the call to authorizepayment was put on hold until the updated bundle is available

4330997
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i m getting a sort of glow-y blueish rollover highlighting of my yui menu items when i m in safari and google-chrome but not firefox

4331021
unsigned	short
java has no concept of unsigned so the unsigned short option maps to simply signed short which is 16 bits or +32767

4331025
oncreate	ondestroy
oncreate ondestroy events

4331108
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if i set the header in the httpd.conf or .htaccess like this it works

4331169
getter	setter
then we run into the whole getter and setter debate and in the context of this application the fields of my data objects should only be modified by these xml messages not anywhere else

4331188
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
works great in firefox safari and opera but not in ie or google-chrome

4331213
int	double
you will occasionally need to add these modifiers as 5 is considered an int in this case and 3.0 is a double

4331246
rel	attr
i m trying to get the rel attr from a set of links in a slider to then use as the text for the control

4331249
min	max
that s a width of 8 min value is 0001-01-01 and max is 9999-12-31

4331249
min	max
also a width of 8 min value is 1753-01-01 and max is 9999-12-31

4331313
hash	salt
most posts you find online will talk about ascii encoding the salt and hash but that is not needed and only add unneeded computation

4331313
hash	salt
below are a few functions that will generate the salt compute the hash and verify the hash against a password

4331313
hash	salt
the password can then be hash using the salt with the function below

4331313
hash	salt
the salt is concatenated to the password and then the hash is computed

4331315
public	protected
on the other hand if you really want to expose the protected members of a class i would try using public members and returning a reference to the protected through it

4331328
integer	fractions
c# performs integer division truncating the fractions portion

4331333
integer	fractions
any int int int divided by int results in integer division which discards any fractions remainder losing precision

4331334
rss	feed
on my test site the rss xml feed is parsed and displayed properly

4331445
getter	setter
then there is no need to call .replace .text is a both a getter and a setter so you can just pass view summary to .text and it will change the element s text

4331450
post	get
when i perform the post i get a response from the server with the post id but it doesn t look like i can make modifications with it

4331476

the first time and the first time only that i call navigationcontroller pushviewcontroller loginviewcontroller animated yes the login view comes in and the login title appears on the nav bar only after the view has fully appeared

4331490
vim	emacs
if i were you i would edit the question and only ask for answers from people who are equally proficient with eclipse intellij vs etc as they are with vim emacs

4331494
google-chrome	firefox
the below example is working in google-chrome but fails in ie 7 and firefox

4331499
google-chrome	safari
however in google-chrome and safari the list items have a strange jump-glitch on hover such that it appears the hidden nested span is actually being displayed as block but not floated as it should

4331557
uiview	subviews
device window - nav tab bar controller - table view controller s - subviews uiview

4331576
subtract	addition	subtract	add
in addition it appears that the variable chance is not really used since you first subtract it and then add it back again

4331605
rss	icalendar
most icalendar .ics based calendars on the web expect to be used in a polling type fashion similar to rss or atom in which a client will periodically check to see if any changes have been made and if so download the new content accordingly

4331637
superclass	subclassing
if the subclassing has access to the state of the superclass it can implement writeobject and readobject to save and restore that state

4331653
super	implements
as far as serialization process is concerned the state belongs in the super class that does not implements serializable

4331699
width	height
originally the chessbutton s wouldn t appear unless i moused over them but i solved that problem by placing each chessbutton inside a separate jpanel and setting each button s setpreferredsize to a set height and width

4331702
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
your problem is that your for-loop is going from 0 to count inclusive but your node data arrays isn t defined at data count its only defined up to data count-1 so the last iteration of your that loops always gets garbage which sometimes might be non-zero and not show up but othertimes might be random characters

4331796
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem
you ll have to manually manage its stack of uinavigationitem s but if you do that right then you can get about the same behavior out of it as you would with a uinavigationcontroller

4331806
jar	war
can we put exploded jar files in war web-inf libs

4331825
post	get
the easiest way to get around this is to data-bind your dropdown list in code only when it needs to be bound like when the page is first loaded and not on post back

4331839
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops	puts	gets
gets chars from the user puts it into a pointer arrays using a while loops nested in a for-loop

4331841
inherited	properties
if it works at all it s only because the framework is doing things in a specific order that happens to make it work first the properties is inherited from the parent control then bindings are applied and the properties change caused by the binding doesn t trigger the binding to run again

4331848
getter	setter
dtos are dumb objects composed of public getter setter

4331898
folder	directory
it works perfectly if the files you are copying from and the folder you are copying to are located within the codeigniter install directory

4331927
width	height
again i want to be able to create a datagrid-like control that even supports cell borders and cell widths and height should be connected to the other controls width + allow resize

4331927
width	height
but remember the cells height and width has to be dynamic and individual to specific columns rows

4331927
width	height
in reference to this question i created it in a slightly different way having a third control for cells but the question is still the same i want the height width of the columns and cells to be dynamic and give the user ability to resize them affecting each other

4331939
post	get
all i m trying to accomplish is to get the id that was passed in the url which in the controller i m grabbing that id and putting it in the viewdata and set the parentid property of my object for the post so that it will save it when the object is returned to me

4331959
width	height
originally the chessbuttons wouldn t appear unless i moused over them but i solved that problem by placing each chessbutton inside a separate jpanel and setting each button s setpreferredsize to a set height and width

4331980
floating-point	integer
integer versus floating-point can also be done using typeof

4331984
int	chars
others have already told you some specific problems with your code but one thing they seem to have missed is that c should be an int not a chars

4331999
for-loop	loops
as for the number of iterations if your for-loop is of the form constant n and m then max 0 m-n loops are executed if x is not changed in loops and no weird stuff overflow hidden casts of negative numbers to unsigned etc. occurs

4332050
twitter	myspace
can any one give me link for api s to post messages over twitter facebook myspace social media

4332058
ant	maven
the how to use wiki page of the project i wrote explains if for using a maven as well as an ant or eclipse based build

4332069
expander	grid
i used a grid to put the icon in the top right corner of the expander

4332105
width	height
according to this blog just add the x y width and height to grab the full desktop

4332210
rtp	rtsp
i have setup darwin streaming server the open sourced rtp rtsp streaming server and successfully played a video on my adp2 phone with donut image using rtsp url

4332219
for-loop	loops
actually i would probably code the inner while loops as a for-loop on i like so

4332291
addition	multiplication
we can optimize the calculation of by observing that the bitwise-or is equivalent to addition refactoring to caching the values of and between iterations and using shifts instead of multiplication

4332299
mouseover	mouseout
if you remove the image1 class from the element on a mouseover then that element won t be matched by the .image1 selector for the mouseout

4332301
mouseover	mouseout
the .hover function lets you specify both mouseover mouseout at the same time and you need to make a function for the setinterval

4332352
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i also have .js files being redirected to javascript engines as well for main.js in google-chrome it tries main.v8.js in safari main.nitro.js in firefox main.gecko.js

4332380
ddms	adb
you ll want to find the stacktrace from the crash you can get this with logcat either open the logcat view in eclipse or open the ddms perspective or run adb logcat from the shell to see the log

4332440
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
you have to stick either with visual studio or give sharpdevelop or monodevelop a try

4332441
udp	tcp
you could have a look at soatest which claims to be socket based and should be able to use whichever web protocol you are using hopefully tcp udp

4332482
profiler	yourkit
there are tools like yourkit java profiler that help you to identify such leaks

4332485
admob	inmobi
i am addind adds in my application using inmodi and admob adds inmobi adds not connect some problem

4332514
postgresql	mysql
sqlite fine for now but mysql or postgresql would be great

4332537
cvs	svn	perforce	cvs	perforce	svn
since perforce is less commonly used compared to cvs svn amongst bamboo users we generally get less feedback about it and hear less about existing issues

4332614
expander	togglebutton
it is because of the default template of the expander togglebutton contentpresenter

4332631
addition	multiplication
however it s still constant time - at most it s going to do one comparison one addition and one multiplication

4332717
free	malloc
a key distinction from malloc is that you never need to call free rather you just allow the last reference to it to evaporate and the garbage collector will reclaim its storage eventually

4332728
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
set the width and height margin and padding in pixels

4332756
put	get
i used the method of using sub-queries on my database to put together a list of bulletins replies count the number of reply likes and dislikes and get a particular users rating

4332792
clang	llvm
one of clang particular interests wrt optimization is that you can emit the optimized llvm ir code instead of machine code

4332793
java.util.calendar	simpledateformat
well personally i d use joda time and its localdate class if you really only want to maintain the date rather than java.util.calendar but if you do want to use calendar you need a simpledateformat

4332944
google-chrome	firefox
does not work on google-chrome ie firefox

4332959
gmail	hotmail
the e-mails get received on gmail and others as far as i m aware the only real problems i ve had is when sending the e-mails to a hotmail or yahoo account

4332962
postgresql	mysql
unnormalized data in mysql postgresql

4332962
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql is still pretty fast and allows free form queries thanks to the usual b+tree indexes

4333016
put	get
absolutely only the compiler docs and or source code can tell you the chance of that though you can put some performance checks into nightly test runs so you ll get alerted if performance suddenly changes

4333029
cpu	processors
on 1 processors the computation will be doing a lot of data movement between cpu cache and ram

4333029
cpu	processors
on 8 processors the computation will only have to move data between cpu and cache

4333030
versioning	upgrade
however if i open the project properties in the upgrade versioning go to the compile tab and change the function returning intrinsic value type without return value option from none to warning then i can build the project again

4333045
ssl	https
and always test to see if your request was done through https don t test for port numbers to determine ssl

4333052
emacs	aquamacs
i m using aquamacs and started the emacs server with m - x server-start

4333071
folder	directory
the directory structure is followed for the most part by all applications because artifacts are defined primarily by their root folder

4333096
getter	setter
add getter and setter

4333114
vim	emacs
failing that a powerful text editor like vim or emacs will get the job done

4333116
mouseleave	mouseenter
how to implement mouseenter and mouseleave event in qwidget

4333126
mouseover	mouseout
i changed hover to mouseover since hover triggers twice once on mouseover and once on mouseout which seems not to be what you want

4333144
hide	show
calling show hide in showevent hideevent doesn t make sense - those events are the result of show hide calls and the like not the trigger

4333174
cldc	midp
using this approach may allow you to make your application to be depend only on midp cldc profiles thus to be easier portable to other phones at least in theory

4333177
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
just tested working in firefox 3.6 ie8 google-chrome 7 and safari

4333253
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
use usings for disposable objects like sqlconnection and sqldatareader

4333272
postgresql	mysql
fortunately both postgresql and mysql support loading db credentials from a file

4333272
postgresql	mysql
for postgresql you use .pgpass and for mysql i believe it s .my.cnf

4333335
min	max
if expr is greater than or equal to min and expr is less than or equal to max between returns 1 otherwise it returns 0

4333335
min	max
this is equivalent to the expression min expr and expr max if all the arguments are of the same type

4333341
min	max
background i have a resizable window with min and max sizes set via the window s minsize and maxsize methods

4333362
implements	extends
i was implements a category that extends uinavigationbar like this

4333375
ubuntu	debian
as for debian being more stable than ubuntu for using as server it can be true in very rare occasions where the package is very obscure

4333375
ubuntu	debian
throughout these years i have encounters only one instance in case of a great dns server called nsd3 where ubuntu has a tiny difficulty to install the package while there was no such problem in debian

4333408
subtract	add
if you add that to 1 then subtract 1 again you will not see all those numbers as a double only holds about 15 places of precision but the number above +1 gives requires 17 whereas the numbe i have printed uses just 9 places because the leading zeros don t count

4333420
x86	64bit
i have seen problems where people have hard coded paths c program files x86 or registry keys which don t behave as well as they hoped when switching to 64bit

4333436
try-catch	exception-handling
more about exception-handling and try-catch blocks

4333462
super	extends
just some minor modifications were needed inherits and extends base for super etc and run the app

4333518
getter	setter
in objective-c all methods including getter and setter created by synthesize behave the same

4333577
jlist	jtable
especially i felt it in components such as jlist jcombobox jtable

4333602
cdr	cons
some more details i am emulating a lisp list in tcl which is built up out of cons cells that each have a car and a cdr

4333616
hide	show
the logic is when #menuscontainer is show bind a click handler to body that hide #menuscontainer only if the target of the click isn t a child of #menuscontainer

4333637
matlab	freemat
or matlab or its free counterpart gnu octave or scilab of freemat

4333655
int	double
an example would be gdi uses system.drawing.point for most of its drawing related tasks whereas xna uses vector2 however they are both objects that represent an x y same with the other libraries some store the x y values as int float double but ultimately at the heart they represent the same data

4333660
width	height
with that format the name of the resource being requested is separated from the representation of the image at a height of 5 and width of 10

4333674
disk	ram
ii file-backed data structures which i believe but i am not certain is synonymous with a memory-mapped file structure and which works enabling very fast access from disk using pointers thus avoiding the ram limit on available file size

4333702
google-chrome	firefox
when editing the most used page various users browsers google-chrome and firefox get an error from apache complaining that the if-none-match field is too long

4333702
google-chrome	firefox
is there a way of clearing out etags from firefox or google-chrome

4333713
fadein	fadeout
the above jquery updates the image-hover div and its displaying the div by fadein but its getting fadeout at all times

4333722
client-side	server-side
what strategies can you suggest to investigating identifying and resolving slow-downs redundant code leaks and other issues in web-apps - both server-side and in the browsesr on client-side

4333752
pull	push
what you want to accomplish is for each remote branch on repo-o create the same branch pointing to repo-o s branch if i don t have it or pull information on the local branch from whatever is on the same branch on repo-o and at the end push all these branches to my repo-f

4333757
hebrew	persian
i am not sure it can satisfy you but hebrew test is 4 times slower than persian

4333768
mouse	keyboard
all is fine when i use the mouse but the moment i use my keyboard an ugly dotted grey border comes out

4333780
google-chrome	safari
webkit safari google-chrome browsers - web inspector

4333797
getter	setter
property nonatomic retain int age defines getter and setter for int age

4333797
getter	setter
and synthesizing them in implemetation gives the autogenerated implementation of the getter and setter

4333826
versioning	upgrade
i support an application written in delphi 3 and i would like to put in some improvements to the source code while waiting for the opportunity to upgrade it to a newer versioning of delphi

4333863
getter	setter
is really supposed to declare setter getter methods for age ivar but that line will give compiler error as you can t declare property with retain attribute for non-object types see docs for more details

4333863
getter	setter
this line does not differ much from the 1st one - it also declares setter and getter methods for popovercontroller ivar and automatically synthesized setter will retain popovercontroller it gets

4334036
post	get
if you are validating db data make sure all db queries variables which originate from sent post get variables are escaped using mysql_real_escape_string to prevent sql injection

4334047
udp	tcp
if you have a game where losing the odd update isn t important you can achieve far better bandwidth use latency and scalability by using udp instead of tcp

4334083
udp	tcp
i am working on a packet system udp or tcp either way is fine but i came to the conclusion that my current tcp system is really awefull

4334094
pull	push
it allows any number of producer threads to push data into the collection and any number of consumer threads to pull it out again

4334102
x86	64bit
since hardly any vst au plugins and also sequencers for that matter have made the leap to 64bit you d be better off just compiling your app as a 32-bit x86 binary

4334139
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
but then you couldn t get support for other older browsers without equivalent support safari 2 firefox 2.0 opera 9 etc.

4334175
filesystems	hfs
most likely uses apples hfs plus filesystems so max file size would be 8 eb 8 billion gb

4334179
inherited	properties
my resource provider inherited from markup extension with one properties key

4334185
google-chrome	safari
maybe its a webkit bug but its occurring in the latest google-chrome developer build and in safari 5 so probably it s not

4334186
hide	show
this approach hide them all then using the same set and taking the 0-2 index elements to show

4334197
superclass	subclassing
i have 6 subclassing for that abstract superclass

4334217
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme	lisp	smalltalk
most modern programming languages have some form of anonymous literal block of code lisp 1958 scheme smalltalk 1974 perl python ecmascript ruby scala haskell c++ d objective-c even php

4334239
equals	tostring	tostring	getter	getter	setter
and our java code looks like this i have omitted getter setter and hashcode equals tostring from entities - the entities were generated from the db via netbeans then modified slightly so i don t believe there is any issue with them

4334241
folder	directory
if you just want to have a kind of symbolic link to that default values directory so that when you change something inside the default directory the files i the linked directory represent the same changes then you just go to select where the new folder should be created in your case the res directory and then hit on and there select link to alternate location linked folder then browse to the directory you want to link to in your case the values directory and your done

4334244
expander	togglebutton
the trick to getting the checkbox to work is that when you put it or indeed any togglebutton based control into an expander template you need to use a data binding configured with its relativesource set to the templatedparent

4334281
setinterval	settimeout
function settimeout and setinterval

4334377
post	get
i ll post if i get anything useful

4334396
maven	pom.xml
add this to your pom.xml i prefer making a multi-module maven project with modules for frontend backend and api

4334426
ubuntu	linux
return linux which we also collect but we are looking for a way to get ubuntu as well

4334466
ivar	subclassing
subclassing uibutton with an extra ivar + property context

4334505
put	get
if you put the path in quotation marks you don t need to escape the spaces but when you call cd you need to put the variable itself in quotes to get the proper behaviour

4334520
google-chrome	firefox
work perfectly as expected in firefox and google-chrome but ie fails

4334544
button	checkbox
the problem is at ie when the user presses the query button the browser sends all checkbox or radiobutton values as the string on although the value attribute is clearly different from on

4334563
typedef	struct
to avoid writing struct all the time struct tagmystruct is typedef d to mystruct

4334584
typedef	struct
defines a typedef called mystruct which is equivalent to the given anonymous struct

4334714
union	distinct
using union will be the performance killer as this will force a distinct sort of the two tables

4334715
cassini	iis
i would say move your server project to iis instead of cassini since that s where it ll run while on the azure platform

4334715
cassini	iis
i did have some issues playing with azure and cassini that did not happen on iis

4334767
portrait	landscape
i finally ended up using different images for portrait and landscape versions.

4334790
bazaar	svn
if you havent t commited on the bazaar repository you can commit on the svn working folder therefore placing those changes on the svn repository and repeat the svn-import operation with bazaar

4334792
width	height
for example height is 60 width is 100

4334804
width	height
work out how long you want the particle to cross the whole of the width or the height then use s 0.5 a t 2 + v0 t to work out v0 the initial speed take a look at the equations of motion

4334808
stdout	stderr
i need to read stdout and stderr separately

4334832
stdout	stderr
see this article for details on how to replace stdout and stderr

4334846
hash	salt
you need to salt and hash the password using an appropriately secure algorithm

4334854
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
save an md5 hash and to make it more secure add a salt

4334876
int	double
you should always keep in mind that a pointer conveys two pieces of information the type of the pointed data int double ... which specifies how to interpret it and the address of the data it points to which specifies where you can get the actual value of the pointed data

4334876
int	double
the type information is in the type of the pointer double int ... while the address of the data is the actual value contained in the pointer variable

4334876
int	double
you know that at that address there s something but you don t know if it s an int a double or an array of flying cows

4334909
pull	push
then go on the git repo on production and git pull --rebase origin live and git push origin live

4334915
put	get
then just get your nodes and put them in an nsmutablearray and do a

4334920
int	boolean
i then have a which may contain string boolean int etc

4334941
serializable	deserialization
now we will do a similar exercise but will include serializable deserialization

4334973
getter	setter
in addition events also allow you to add remove methods which are called when the handlers are attached detached to it just like the getter and setter of a public property allowing you to control the process better

4334974
directx	gdi
gdi uses integers xna directx and opengl use single-precision floats generally and silverlight uses double-precision floats

4334974
xna	spritebatch
the nice thing about opengl directx and xna excluding things like spritebatch is that you basically tell the api your data layout - and you can use whatever you like internally

4335001
post	get
- get post session cookies hidden fields .

4335023
post	get
if you want to transfer information from your client to your server you could use either post or get

4335023
post	get
remember that a hidden field in the end will become a post of get variable

4335023
post	get
get post cookies and hidden fields can all be manipulated relatively simple

4335032
internationalization	localization
more information here about internationalization localization

4335043
std	ostream
if have a ton of user defined types which implement to write to an std ostream

4335049
folder	directory
it depends how many images you re expecting to have if we re talking about thousand keeping the pictures in diffrent folder make s it easier for the computer to scan the directory for the file

4335065
filesystems	ntfs
for a modern filesystems like ntfs or ext3 keeping huge numbers of files in the same directory is not a problem but some older filesystems could not handle it

4335088
ubuntu	linux
now when loading the entity with those properties on one machine ubuntu linux with sun jdk 1.6.0_22-b04 i am able to load the 256-byte encrypted keys and ivs

4335107
post	get	post	put	put	get
if its on page load a cookie if you have sessions a session if your submitting a form which is http post or get if submitting and you dont want the user to see use a hidden field with a form which is http post or get via the url get and lastly if its a ajax eg web app you have several options and methods open to use http get put post and delete - see restful apis for a good example

4335107
post	get	post	put	put	get
note with all http get put post and delete methods you can still use cookies and sessions as well

4335155
post	get
hidden fields used in post get forms for various reasons often for ids or something like this

4335170
getter	setter
it should have a generic getter and setter that receive the member name as a string and return some sort of variant type boost variant

4335170
boost	stl	getter	setter
i was thinking it could be implemented using boost fusion map by adding a string representing the name of each member and building an stl map between strings and getter or setter functions

4335198
put	get
if in the future i get a request to expand my model and put some new attributes field in my bo and send it to the client what would be the best approach

4335259
post	get
switch the asp to expect get instead of post then just do

4335267
nsstring	nsxmlparser
- void parser nsxmlparser parser foundcharacters nsstring string

4335337
hide	show
i have a apply a href in jobdetails which have a show and hide div mechanism for apply rendering apply.ascx in jobdetails

button	checkbox
so only the author of the article is supposed to see those button or checkbox

4335443
backbone.js	zepto
i had a look at backbone.js and while it s a great product i don t like the binding to jquery zepto for controller navigation

4335477
vxworks	isr
vxworks states that mutual exculsion semaphores cannot be given inside isr while the condition is vaild for binary and counting semaphore

4335517
put	get
the jquery documentation is followed to the letter now i need to get the php file to get the date then select the data from mysql table and put it into the div waiting for it

4335550
post	get
then you pass an object to .load it s a post not a get request

4335564
free	malloc
it do a lot of malloc free and run rather fast so i can t see the max memory in top

4335587
stdout	stderr
i thought i could just pass my file-like object as named parameter stdout and stderr

4335613
filtering	grouping
what you have tried would make sense if you were to grouping by cc column if that was possible and then that would filtering out all rows with same cc value that didn t appear exactly 3 times

4335624
mspec	fakeiteasy
i am using mspec and trying to get my head around fakeiteasy in order to write up my test

4335638
folder	directory
take jar and other files from glassfish installed directory and put them into a deployer folder d deployer etc.

4335683
stdout	stderr
hudson is not recognising the error probably because in your build step you are redirecting both the stdout and stderr for qmake and make to a log

4335684
websphere	ibm
i know this is specific to ibm websphere but perhaps your app server if not websphere has something similar to help you kick them off

4335705
stdout	stderr
i am trying to capture the stderr and stdout of a number of processes and write their outputs to a log file using the python logging module

4335705
stdout	stderr
also i would also like to have a master log of all individual processese activity in other words i want to automatically without polling write all the stdout stderr for each process to a master logger

rss	feed
why do you want to use an rss feed why don t you calculate the current phase yourself like explained here calculate moon phase data with php which is referencing this moon phase php class

4336694
pop-up	dialog
what seems to work for me is is treating the vd like a real phone and turning it off before shutting the window - so press and hold the power button then selecting power off from the pop-up dialog then give it a short while to shutdown if you watch from the ddms logcat view in eclipse you can see it running through the shutdown processes

free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
one method i ve used is to incorporate my own simple heap routines and take over the malloc calloc free functions from the library

4336818
free	malloc
the only part that requires porting is taking over the malloc free interface and making sure you get initialized early enough

pivot-table	crosstab
what you are trying to create is called a pivot-table or crosstab report

4337136
cpython	ironpython
one of the largest benefits of ironpython is that it has effectively no gil - meaning that if you are both writing python code and it is multi-threaded - you can often get performance that is better than cpython without having to spawn multiple process and pickle objects across the boundaries

4337156
mouseleave	mouseenter
you then have the user control register for its mouseenter and mouseleave events and when the mouse is over you make the button visible and when it leaves you hide it again

4337217
int	chars
so i know that the difference between a signed and unsigned int is that a bit is used to signify if the number if positive or negative but how does this apply to a chars

4337241
google-chrome	firefox
there are no js errors for me in either google-chrome 7 or firefox 3.6.8

4337245
typedef	typename
using a nested template i can introduce a typename via a typedef

4337249
int	chars
any chars is usually an 8-bit int and in that sense a signed and unsigned chars have a useful meaning generally equivalent to uint8_t and int8_t

4337249
int	chars
technically a chars can be any size as long as sizeof chars is 1 but it is usually an 8-bit int

4337252
int	chars
chars is an int type same in that regard as int short and other int types

4337252
int	chars
chars just happens to be the smallest int type

4337252
integer	unsigned
so just like any other integer type it can be signed or unsigned

4337252
int	chars
but chars in c are represented by their int codes so there s nothing unusual in the fact that an int type chars is used to serve that purpose

4337252
int	chars
the only general difference between chars and other int types is that plain chars is generally not synonymous with signed chars while with other int types the signed modifier is optional implied

distributed version control systems such as git mercurial and bazaar are particularly nice and let you start committing immediately without the need to push those changes to a central server

4337347
stdout	stderr
this conflates stdout and stderr but it does give everything a timestamp

4337364
squash	branch
basically i i have a feature branch i m working on and i m ready to put it into the master branch i would do a rebase to squash all of my commits into one clean one so that it s easily integrated into master without all the messy history

4337375
implements	extends
iterate over all items of the list and find the greatest common divisor the most specific class or interface that all the items extends or implements

4337671
innodb	myisam
reworking petr s answer a bit to avoid the in clause and to make it for myisam or innodb

4337679
int	double
so searching for the number 1 int double etcetera is not the same as searching for 1 string

4337680
for-loop	arrays
in the arrays case the easiest way to retain the index is to simply use a vanilla for-loop

4337684
unsigned	short
an unsigned char is an unsigned value which is typically smaller than and is guaranteed not to be bigger than a short

4337691
nunit	mstest
fortunately most of the functionality in nunit can be replicated in mstest without too much hassle

4337700
ienumerable	ienumerator
it works with any type that exposes ienumerable or implements a getenumerable method and uses the returned ienumerator to iterate over the items in the collection

4337706
ienumerable	ienumerator
likewise the collection can have a method called getenumerator which returns a type with the appropriate members but without any implementation of ienumerable ienumerator in sight.

4337715
int	double	int	chars
default promotions of small types chars short and float up to at least int double always apply

4337724
folder	directory
when i looked at the created directory you dont see a share icon on the folder but it is indeed shared

4337758
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception

ssl	ntlm
i can also authenticate via the os x mail.app application using the identical host username password account type imap port 143 ssl false authentication ntlm domain name

4337815
google-chrome	safari
that being said ie google-chrome and safari all support the onselectstart event which is cancellable

4337815
opera	firefox
for firefox opera and other browsers however there s no solution other than cancelling mousedown double click and key events

4337839

multiplying	add
if it s stored as a binary integer then read the bytes in to an array or read them one by one then multiplying by powers of 256 and add together

4337941
phpmyadmin	heidisql
my advice is that you find another sql client such as heidisql and try to repair the phpmyadmin database

4337942
int	boolean
my first instinct is to use boolean as my solution so that it truly acts as a flag but i have coworkers who have suggested using enums or int as more of a status rather then a flag

4337945
fast-forward	merge
rebase against master one final time then do a normal fast-forward merge which essentially brings all your branch s commits into master one by one

4337978
google-chrome	firefox
if you re running google-chrome or firefox are you even able to see the id of the button in the first place

4338046
stdout	stderr
doing this doesn t require installing any utilities and works without redirecting stderr to stdout

4338055
google-chrome	firefox
but then when the data replace is completed the link color turns back into blue even though before it was black and this only happens in firefox not in ie or google-chrome

4338057
getter	setter
not sure if this is a getter or a setter either

4338078
hide	show
you can hide and show divs based on your choice that would be simplest way to do that

4338090
httphandler	httpmodule
when the iis server receives a http request it goes through series of objects httpapplication httpruntime httpmodule httphandler

4338090
ready	each
the page object is created for each request and disposed off when the runtime is ready to render the html

4338143
datamapper	activerecord
from my point of view the datamapper model is much easier to grasp but since activerecord is the defacto standard it feels weird to change the orm just for this little problem

4338212
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome firefox and ie

4338214
firefox	safari
in some browsers like firefox it s extremely slow while in others mostly newer versions of safari on snow leopard it s perfect

4338230
sorting	filtering
i am not able to implement pagging sorting and filtering on partial view page

4338247
inherited	properties
you can then set a value for that properties on the owner object textbox in this case and then access the inherited value on any element inside the tooltip

4338259
memcached	apc
the framework however does have memcached and apc options for caching installed but even with apc or memcached on it doesn t make a big enough difference.

4338326
ready	each
i m performing a lot of dom manipulations such as moving images within divs that are positioned below each other into a stacking order and moving all divs off stage w e of one .the external js file uses the ready event the js file is included in the head after the css file

4338326
firefox	safari
what i m finding using firefox and safari single stepping are that operations on the dom are taking place as the code is executing

4338326
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
therefore what i see is clean rendering in firefox safari and google-chrome in both osx and xp

4338353
submit	submission
i have been using the below code to automatically print out a form on submission but the problem i have encountered is that upon navigating away from the page the submit - and print button stops working

4338356
google-chrome	firefox

4338386
jquery	simplemodal
i am using jquery and simplemodal in c# vs2010 .net 4.0

4338386
post	get
my solution for the project i m working on now is to use a jquery ajax call to pass all the form data to the server and get back the validation results before allowing the post to proceed

4338410
ant	maven
use the java_home variable in your path variable as well that way you only have to change the java_home which is used in many projects anyways maven ant etc

4338469
division	multiplication
the cost of those additions on common hardware pales in comparison to that of the trigonometry reverse trig multiplication division and square-root calculations that are common in the arithmetic of sphere geometry

4338593
converter	multibinding
i ve never tried to do something like this before but if i had to i would probably try and use a converter that takes the multibinding and breaks it up and returns a stackpanel of the pieces

4338602
unsigned	short
i would like to cast unsigned int 32bit a to unsigned short int 16bit b in a following way

4338621
vbscript	vb6
why doesn t it work in vb6 vbscript

4338646
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari the left padding on each li item says 10 but it s actually adding a couple extra pixels making padding 12 or 13

4338670
hash	md5
just use md5 its slightly more compact than the proposed rubik states rather fast and has good collision properties - it s not like you have a malicious adversary trying to cause rubik cube hash collisions

4338670
hash	md5
edit using cryptographic hash functions such as md4 md5 is usually simple once you have a library or function implementing the algorithm ex openssl gnu tls and many stand-alone implementations exist

4338688
vbscript	vb6
vb6 vbscript regexes probably don t like s in a character class

4338729
width	height
lwindist and lmaxdepth are the width and height of the rectangle to be displayed in 48ths of an inch if it matters

4338775
x86	64bit
when x86 moved into the 64-realm the i o address space remained at 64kb and they didn t even add the ability to move data in 64bit units.

width	height
i want a way to update that based on changes in screen width height

4338808
jboss	weblogic
and now it works in tomcat jboss weblogic webrick.

4338893
innodb	myisam
you can use the engine column in the table to see if you re counting on myisam tables the table_rows will be correct then or innodb table_rows will be the estimate used by the optimizer

4338902
min	max
if you re really truly devoted to being too clever by half then ruslik s second suggestion is actually quite beautiful much nicer than a generic min max

4338962
min	max
i know that if i could get that runid i could group by run to get counts averages totals max min etc

4338970
spweb	spsite
also you are referencing an spsite and spweb object without disposing of the object this has inherent performance issues as well

4338973
int	boolean
the type parameter is normally one of the migrations native types which is one of the following primary_key string text int float decimal datetime timestamp time date binary boolean

4338982
calloc	malloc
2 - declare a pointer that will be allocated memory at runtime with malloc or calloc

4339005
inherited	subclassing
dynamic polymorphism in c++ depends on inherited the pointer passed to dowithfoothing may point only to instances of foothing or one of its subclassing

4339008
getter	setter
public getter setter methods or properties are questionable as they primarily expose object state which see item #2 above

4339027
post	put
is it possible to upload a file in openrasta using the put post method

4339036
crypt	hash
i use a php script that hash passwords using php s crypt and uses sha512 however when i try to check if sha512 is set i get the above error

4339052
cube	skybox
hy.i drawn a skybox and a few objects inside it every thing is alright except the fact that my objects are deformed by the use of gluperspective which i need to draw the skybox and stuff for example i have a cube but it looks like paralelipipedic long a longer box .now i have read chapter 3 of redbook but i can t figure it out .i have tried using glfrustrum glortho and so but i just can t figure out how to make this work normal

4339070
filtering	grouping
however the where clause is not filtering the data properly for more recent years it only returns records where the parameter grouping is null ie not passed in

4339103
memcached	apc
when you say apc and memcached is on have you actually set them up to actually work

4339106
freebsd	linux
i need to know if there are any differences between freebsd and linux in the following categories

4339121
button	checkbox
what s behind the checkbox are colored picturebox es and a button

4339129
dictionary	map
it s easy enough for a caller to write out the dictionary comprehension or map call

4339134
free	malloc
from what i understand because malloc dynamically assigns mem you need to free that mem so that it can be used again

4339134
free	malloc
what happens if you return a char that was created using malloc how are you supposed to free that

4339153
cpu	processors
processors intelâ coreâ 2 duo cpu 2.00ghz 2.00 ghz

4339170
free	malloc
if you malloc you need to free

4339171
free	malloc
yes every call to malloc has to be matched with a call to free

4339176
free	malloc
if you have a pointer to memory created by malloc free ing that memory using that pointer will do the right thing

4339179
free	malloc
if you return a that you know was created with malloc then yes it is your responsibility to free that

4339183
move	drag
i doubt that this is directly relevant to this question but i had a similar problem - my slider could have its value set by my program and it would move but i could not drag and move it

4339206
freebsd	linux
you can set up the registers linux or stack freebsd yourself and then use a syscall by raising an interrupt or just use nasmx s macros to do so in a cross-platform way

4339206
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr are file descriptors 0 1 and 2 respectively

4339207
post	get
funny thing is in the allow header of response it lists get and post as allowed methods

4339253
post	get
that s working but now i need to get the edit post to send the content back as application json but i m having no luck

4339258
entity-relationship	diagram
if you d like some more in depth analysis try whipping up an entity-relationship diagram

4339317
post	get
also are you sure that the page that it s posting to is getting post variables and not only get variables

4339340
svg	vml
on the other hand every svg vml element you create is a real element in the dom

4339359
width	height
try changing designheight and designwidth for height and width respectively and also set sizetocontent to none

4339378
width	height
you want width and height

4339425
hex	binary
this will output the data byte-by-byte and let you examine the individual hex values of the binary data

4339451
mouse	keyboard
mouse scrolling hangs up mouse scoll events doesn t work and pressing up arrow key from keyboard solves the problem

4339508
pull	push
nominally the right way to do this in git is to push your code to a stable location github and then have the online server pull from that location

4339517
int	chars
if it s a fixed-row size myisam table which it looks like due to the datatypes in the table then including the chars field even if it s blank will make the table 75 larger on disk 4 bytes per int field 16 bytes whereas the chars 12 would add another 12 bytes

4339532
nagios	mrtg
the closest i ve found is pg_top which i m working on installing grumble grumble and check_postgres.pl which is a back-end to data collection for nagios and mrtg

4339537
innodb	myisam
it s easier if you use mysql over sqlite and if you use innodb tables over myisam tables

4339547
mouse	keyboard
the mouseverticalposition mousehorizontalposition ismousecaptured are assigned in a chart mouse down event and modifierkey is boolean to tell if any of the keyboard modifiers are pressed to know whether or not to move

4339547
move	drag
here is my question is there different way to do the drag move or the resizing adorner class that i am not seeing

4339574
put	get
and once i get a batch put this subset for processing and come back and restart preparing another batch and so on till the end of file is reached

4339593
width	height
you need to have properly height and width for your image e.g 512x512 or 512x1024 so it fills a quad rectangle specified by your gl_texture_crop_rect_oes

4339602
serializable	deserialization
when i do serializable deserialization of single instances of this class sub classes everything works fine

4339602
serializable	deserialization
and on deserialization this is done in the serializable constructor also on the serializationinfo parameter

4339602
serializable	deserialization
deserialization always gives me an array of nulls and as i mentioned earlier a single item serializable and deseriaizes just fine with this code

4339602
serializable	deserialization
deserialization serializable constructor

4339611
post	get
for instance a function that executes a sql query is a sink and get post variables are sources of taint

the framework used to migrate the sqlite schema can also be used to load migrate data during an app upgrade

4340130
wordpress	joomla
i have a joomla plugin which does a one-way single sign-on between joomla and wordpress

4340130
wordpress	joomla
it means the registrations and logins are handled by joomla and every time someone registers in joomla it replicates the user s data into wordpress user tables and everytime someone logs into joomla it writes the user s status as logged in into the wordpress cookie thus the user automatically gets logged into wordpress

4340130
wordpress	joomla
hence i want to divert users from wordpress to joomla pages for login and registration activities

4340318
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode is not and cannot be collision free which is why the equals method is required in the first place

4340345
width	height
however resizing both width and height would result in a stretched image

4340345
width	height
to either resize the width or height depending of what side fits best you may consider a bit of javascript like this

4340366

crypt	salt
is it possible to use php s mcrypt functions to get the same results as with crypt using a sha512 salt

4340513
hash	md5
as a note i have used guid uuid fields in databases to store md5 hash

4340513
hash	md5
while no longer cryptographically secure 128bit md5 hash are fine for checksums and is much better than 64 bits.

4340622
hash	md5
you can easily use an md5 hash for this but you will have to alter the way it is stored

4340622
hash	md5
a standard char is 8 bits however so 16 characters is exactly enough to store the value of an md5 hash

4340625
jar	war
the data objects are in a separate project jar that the webservice war depends on

4340625
jar	war
the question is should the jaxb.properties file be included in the data object jar or in the webservice war or both

4341065
google-chrome	firefox
still none the wiser about why firefox google-chrome and ie all ignored float left in print though but it s working now

4341144
free	malloc
i wouldn t go so far as to say every malloc must be free but i would say that no matter how long a program runs there must be a bounded number of allocations and total size that won t be free

4341207
doc	rtf
i have a fulltext index on one of my tables which contains some metadata and a document blob pdf or doc or rtf etc

4341312
des	aes
probably the most normal approach for a diy solution is to encrypt the license file using some standard algorithm like aes 128-bit or triple des

4341336
free	malloc
at the same time nowhere does it make any requirement that memory obtained with malloc should or must be released with free before a call to exit or a return from main and i think it s pretty clear that the intention is that exiting without manually freeing memory will not leave resources tied up - much like how calling exit without closing all files first automatically closes them including flushing them

4341343
put	get
i would like to allow users to log in via windows authentication perhaps through a special page but anonymous users should not get prompted to put in their password ever

4341347

in vxworks the isr context is not the same as the context of a task

4342012
strncmp	strlen
i could pass in strlen message as the length argument to strncmp but this seems to defeat the purpose of using strncmp which is to prevent overflow in the case of unexpected input

4342018
portrait	landscape
when i do the same loading in landscape mode the view is first loaded in portrait and then it is turning to landscape mode

4342078

gridview	sqldatasource
means by default all records from the table will appear in gridview using sqldatasource and i also wanna search for a particular record by enter id in text box .

4342267
strncmp	strcmp
you then use strcmp instead of strncmp

4342287
strncmp	strcmp
presuming that the string in message is supposed to be null-terminated the only reason to use strncmp here rather than strcmp would be to be to prevent it looking beyond the end of message in the case where message is not null-terminated

4343754
glut	sdl
it is not clear for which os you are targeting but there are cross-platform frameworks like glut sdl etc

4343775
free	malloc
would be undefined behavior because array itself was not allocated via malloc therefore you can t free it and don t need to - the memory will be managed by the compiler

4343791
free	malloc
note that you must call free with each pointer that is returned by malloc

4343791
free	malloc
it invokes undefined behavior because you are passing a pointer to the base of the array itself to free that did not come from a call to malloc

4343810
factors	matrix
remember that you can lose interpretation when you obtain the principal components of your dataset or its factors so you maybe wanna go the non-negative matrix factorization route

4343811
free	malloc
as others have mentioned you ve created an array of pointers on the stack and need to malloc and free each of them individually as you are doing

4343811
free	malloc
however you don t have to use malloc and free one struct at a time you can do something like this

4343836
calloc	malloc
if you do really want to use an array you might want to make it an array of student rather than student in which case you can use calloc rather than malloc

4343850
put	get
if there is one single vla then one can either put it before or after all the variables and therefore get a static offset for most of the stack frame or so it seems to me but i am not well-versed in stack management

4343903
gson	jackson
json - use jackson or gson

4343970

then i change the orientation onpause is called followed by ondestroy at this point getintent returns the correct intent followed by oncreate which has the old intent followed by onresume which also has the old intent

4348537
oncreate	ondestroy	onresume	onpause
i know i can change the launchmode from singletop to standard but this will also affect android 1.6+ which i don t want because with singletop the changing of conversation goes fast only onpause and onresume are called with standard oncreate and ondestroy are also called.

4348569
verilog	vhdl
this is the question as in this question but for vhdl instead of verilog

4348601
width	height
the issue is if you can independently change the width and height of a rectangle and a square is a rectangle then you can change a square to not be a square

4348608
width	height
you could make it so that if the square constraint is set setting width or height would cause the other one to match automatically

4348617
vb6	vba
the vba in office has been the same for about 10 years now still using old vb6

4348651
width	height
notice how the z-index is high to put it on top of everything and the height and width are 100 to make it take up the entire window with its opaque background

4348677
min	max
you can set the min and max using an ajax call or jquery

4348677
min	max
set the min and max to one month less and or one month greater to avoid the bar filling the entire chart area

post	get
you want to set up both get and post routes

4348790
post	get
get shows the form and post handles the submission

4348807
implements	extends
this is a simple example of how you can create an itemrenderer extends skinnablecomponent and implements idatarenderer

4348837
trie	tree
you might try implementing a prefix tree trie as a data structure particularly if you know the range of the characters

4348844
jquery	jqmodal
i dug into the source for jqmodal and it looks like it s just using jquery .load internally

4348871

4348879
firefox	safari
btw when i check it in firefox and safari on a mac it looks ok

4348886
wordpress	phpbb	wordpress	joomla	joomla	phpbb
do phpbb wordpress or joomla that i know pretty well use a design pattern

4348894
post	get
depending upon the website you may be able to post directly to their page which is basically skipping their form or you may be able to pass their input field parameters in the query string if they are not being picky about whether the data is read from the get or post variables

4348995
wordpress	phpbb	wordpress	joomla	joomla	phpbb
do phpbb wordpress or joomla that i know pretty well use a design pattern

4349003
for-loop	loops
you can use this for-loop to loops over the subviews of the search bar and enable it when the search button is pressed on the keyboard

4349009
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
_input and _output are bufferedinputstream and bufferedoutputstream spawned from the socket

4349014

i want this to work with int long double float so i want to specialize it for this set of datatypes

4349043
gitignore	hgignore
is there any automated way to convert hgignore to gitignore or vice versa

4349062
cpython	ironpython
ironpython is also much easier to extend than cpython

4349062
cpython	ironpython
that s the reason that i ve started using ironpython because i got tired of writing wrappers for my c++ code in cpython

4349076
webkit	gecko
or if you are more adventurous there are also solutions involving webkit and gecko browser engines discussed here

4349076
webkit	gecko
is it possible to embed gecko or webkit in a windows form just like a webview

4349146
set	bag
a bag collection is kind of like a set except that it can contain duplicates and it keeps track of how many duplicates there are

4349155
min	max
in both c# and java the min and max values for long are the same

4349163
actionscript	mxml
i know you said i m making all of this in actionscript 3 i assume that means that you re avoiding mxml for some reason

4349174
postgresql	mysql
it does not directly compete with rdbms solutions like mysql postgresql etc

4349234
bash	zsh
in bash 4 with shopt -s globstar and zsh you can use which will include everything except hidden files

4349234
bash	zsh
you can do shopt -s dotglob in bash 4 or setopt dotglob in zsh to cause hidden files to be included

4349334
gif	png
or is it faster to have it in png or jpg or gif

4349336
weka	orange
if you need a less naive solution try data mining practical machine learning tools and techniques and use weka or orange

4349339
hash	salt
store a salt hash of the password

4349387
backgroundworker	blockingcollection
i m asking this because you can access your blockingcollection fine from within the backgroundworker but you can t do it from a separate workerclass since it s a plain vanilla separate class

4349389
google-chrome	firefox
update 2 it now works in firefox and google-chrome

4349393
webrat	cucumber
i don t have a sample integration test in the book for devise but i think the code in the step definition in the cucumber chapter will also work if you have webrat capybara installed

4349397
mouseover	mouseout
there s a really good explanation of the limitations of the mouseover and mouseout events in the jquery docs about half way down that page

4349397
mouseover	mouseout
mouseover and mouseout events trigger when you move the mouse over the bound element as expected but they also fire a separate event when you mouse over any inner elements within the parent element - this is obviously undesirable in most circumstances

4349397
mouseleave	mouseenter
basically to fix your problem use the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead

4349397
width	height
if you want to keep the visual effect you ve current got with a tall coloured area behind each link make the link take up the whole box - 100 of the height and width of the div

4349406
subtract	add
with the use of the following gui the user can add or subtract more or less items for the three different parts

4349421
int	chars
if you use the array method use bytes unsigned chars s instead of int s

4349424
unix	solaris
so really looking for c api on solaris unix that would give me the total and available number of inodes given a filesystem

4349425
pull	push
and afterwards you ll find it s even possible to scale up across multiple processes and machines with little effort. take a look at the guide to get started and the zmq_socket 3 manpage specifically for how push and pull works

4349456
swt	swing
if you truely want a real desktop experience though then swing or swt should be sufficient for your needs

4349460
google-chrome	firefox
since then google-chrome has advanced 4 versions the firefox team has put a lot of work into performance in firefox 4 and ie9 has arrived with hardware acceleration

4349566
put	get
visual studio will put it in the bin directory for the dll project but it won t get copied any further up the line

4349567
google-chrome	firefox
i got it working in firefox + google-chrome but ie decides to not follow any rule.

4349588
post	get
looking at the requests in firebug showed the original post but then it returned 301 and issued a get to the lower case version

4349589
post	get
so in this case getjson post must return the same result but i get different results because of datetime difference

4349606
getter	setter
like a flattened field-only view with no getter and setter cluttering everything up

4349621
subtract	add
however it s still hundreds of cycles for things like add subtract and compare

4349630
onfocus	onblur
according to quirksmode onfocus and onblur are available on the window in most browsers

4349642
getter	setter
you generally don t test things like property setter getter i think this method is simple enough to avoid unit testing for the same reason

4349685
mouse	keyboard
hey i m developing application and want to simulate mouse keyboard events in other program game

4349688
width	height
set the width and height obviously to 100 and all of this on both html and body like the following

4349700
int	double
if you want to restrict your getratio function only for int long double and float then you can use this function as well

4349702
ubuntu	debian
additionally there are still distributions within their mainstream support cycles like fairly recent versions of ubuntu and debian that do not have it by default

4349712
width	height
data file data.txt lines represent width height

4349748
rss	feed
is there any easier way to read rss feed from other websites without all these exceptions and problems

4349838
glfw	sdl
good options nowadays are glfw or sdl

4349845

i am running centos 5.4 ubuntu 8.04 php 5.2.10 apache 2.2

4349861
versioning	upgrade
i am using jquery 1.4.2 i m not in a position to upgrade yet as we are on an older versioning of jquery ui and have way too many bugs using anything newer than 1.4.2

4349869
uiview	subviews
if you want some customized behavior you can create a custom uiview subclass that always contains a button as a subviews so that you can take advantage of some of uibutton s functionality

4349872
pull	push
we have a what we call a shared repo on one of our file servers where we push to and pull from in order to share code

4349873
folder	directory
if it s not there it looks for eggs folder unzipped in the python module directory and imports those

4349914
put	get
it s difficult to tell you exactly where to put the code without knowing some more about your page and how the checkboxes get un checked but the general pattern for doing this check would be something like this

4349919
range	min	range	max	min	max
if the intended behaviour of this method is to set this.value to a random double within a previously specified range then the above three tests are useful assuming genesvaluesinterval min and max are the previously specified range and that you have tests in place to assert that numbergenerator.generatedouble min max returns a double within the specified range

4349945
jobs	cron	rss	feed
in google app engine for a task like scanning some rss feed and adding new entries from the feed to the datastore every 10-15 seconds should i use cron jobs task queue or deferred tasks

4349959
for-loop	loops
then change the foreach loops to a for-loop and go from to thisprivilegeset.privilegecount

4350038
jobs	cron
seconds not skipping than i would cron jobs

4350058
swt	swing
if you download the now opensource windowsbuilderpro tool then it has excellent examples in both swing and swt of doing good databindings

4350058
swt	swing
it does the same example of a phonebook in both swing and swt gui libraries to demo its drag-and-drop gui builder tool power

4350058
swt	swing
so it is a great way to compare and contrast swing to swt whilst learning databindings

4350061
post	get
i tried with both get and post

4350065
put	get
if i put it as a get parameter in the img src itself it will be too many characters again

4350101
uploadify	swfupload
1 assuming you are talking about allowing bulk uploads from the website not as a rake task the typical way for handling multiple uploads is to use uploadify swfupload for the frontend along with a gem such as paperclip to handle the images on the rails side

4350101
uploadify	swfupload
a google search for paperclip uploadify or paperclip swfupload should give you some good reference material

4350103
int	chars
if you just have 3 possible values use an array of chars and that will copy 4 times faster than int

4350113
int	chars
use chars instead of int or

4350179
codeigniter	cakephp
the easiest to get off the ground in a working state are probably cakephp codeigniter and symphony

4350207
equals	tostring
no typeclasses you overwrite the equals and tostring methods instead no equivalent for read though

4350230
width	height
the way the box models are set up now just doesn t lend itself well to full width full height layouts

4350235
audiotrack	audiorecord
this class holds 2 sockets one audiotrack object and one audiorecord

4350235
audiotrack	audiorecord
when the service class receives a stop as its data in a tcp connection i would like to call a method inside that activity class not create a new one to close those 2 sockets and call stop and release on the audiotrack audiorecord object

4350246
width	height
in qt i would do it like this x and y are the height and width of the image data points to the 24-bit rgb pixels

richfaces	tomahawk
due to project constraints i m limited to use jsf 2.0 and richfaces 3.x which partially supports it so i can t rely on tomahawk solution preservedatamodel

4350299
firefox	safari
in ie8 firefox safari it works # of list itmes comes out to 3

4350315
width	height
my main problem - i do not see how to change horizontal rows with js knowing that height and width may vary

4350321
freebsd	linux
freebsd and linux have different schedulers

4350321
freebsd	linux
freebsd for a time differed substantially in its kernel threading model but now is closer to linux

4350321
freebsd	linux
freebsd and linux have different default filesystems although both support multiple filesystems and there is some cross-os support

4350421
apache	nginx
then the apache config looks like this proxy to nginx

4350483
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
tested on ie7+ ff2+ safari 4+ google-chrome opera

4350496
codeigniter	kohana
they re both more flexible ton of config options than kohana s or codeigniter s orm but they have a steeper learning curve and involve much more configuration read about convention vs configuration

4350534
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome and firefox

4350590
children	parent
i do not think that you can .unwrap without loosing focus since it removes the parent node from the dom and appends the children where the parent was afterwards

4350621
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
complexexpand sqrt x 2 + y 2 cos arg x + i y + i sqrt x 2 + y 2 sin arg x + i y

4350626
getter	setter
it allows you to have getter setter functions while using the same syntax as you would for accessing any other data member in this case does the same thing as mylength._setbasic 10

4350626
getter	setter
because you can do this you should not write getter setter functions for your data members by default

4350626
getter	setter
if you need to have getter setter functions later you can convert the data member to a property and your module s users won t need to change their code

4350626
getter	setter
note that the docstring is on the property not the getter setter functions

4350631
versioning	upgrade
now i m afraid of upgrade to last versioning again

4350633
realloc	malloc
you might also have to check for the size after malloc and realloc if necessary

4350640
lisp	scheme
for an environment to implement tail call elimination is mandatory in scheme but not in most other lisp dialects such as common lisp

4350668
implements	extends
not required to implements extends or

4350718
prepare	execute
when using queries with more than 10000 keys using pdo with prepare execute the performance degrades 10x more than doing the same query using mysqli with prepare statements or pdo without using prepare statements

4350718
prepare	pdostatement	prepare	execute
the performance degradation occurs after prepare execute is complete - it s entirely in pdostatement fetch or pdostatement fetchall

4350809
pull	push
pull like you ve done merge then push

4350834
mouse	keyboard
it is unusual to want a link to be styled differently when activated with the mouse than with the keyboard though

4350835
tcpdf	fpdf
i have never used any php libraries like fpdf or tcpdf but am concerned about speed

4350846
sysv	systemd
since you didn t specify what operating systemd you are using i point you to a unix sysv shared memory tutorial

if you want to get down to the hardware try checking out microcontroller like pic and avr

4350907
button	checkbox
labels are used to associate text with a form element such as a radio button checkbox text field etc

4350927
client-side	server-side
struts2 is an mvc framework for building server-side web applications and ajax is a concept that exists within the client-side of things

4350988
accessor	properties
for each setting create an accessor properties that has a switch which uses the environment detection function to determine which value to return

mbunit	mspec	mbunit	nunit	nunit	mspec
mspec doesn t support the rowtest concept known from other frameworks like nunit and mbunit

4351062
mouse	keyboard
hook up a keyboard and mouse to it and you have controls

4351062
mouse	keyboard
you can even write your own trap handlers for writing to lcd and reading inputs from keyboard and mouse to understand how interrupts and exceptions work at low level

4351075
16-bit	64bit
when you insert do a 16-bit hash the 64bit int by xoring each of the 16-bit pieces together to get a table index

4351117
width	height
your webpart should just render the object applet tag and its attributes relevant to the applet code height width or you can let the javascript do it all and your webpart can provide the marker div where the applet needs to be rendered

4351140
pull	push
i looked into rabbitmq but that s more of a push and like i said i need a pull

4351164
children	parent
i am trying to parse an xml file the parent and children use - instead of _ which i m used to

4351188
submit	submission
i ve got my js to the point where the url that the submission goes to and the get parameters match exactly what the google form submit firebug s net tab was very handy here

4351191
setinterval	settimeout
a bug in internet explorer 8 seems to have an arithmetic overflow when calculating when to fire a setinterval or settimeout event

4351191
setinterval	settimeout
this bug will probably occur for any time after 25 days uptime 2 31 milliseconds if a large enough number is passed to setinterval or settimeout

4351198
background-color	transparency
the larger issue is not actually the background of the element you want to see through which would just be background-color transparency but instead its ancestor element s

4351198
background-color	transparency
for instance a div with a background-color transparency is still going to look as if it has a white background if its containing element has a white background

4351212
children	parent
and to facilitate this instead of calling getter methods on lazy relationships does that mean its best to keep the transactions short and do finds manually for the children of the parent

4351220
int	chars
there also seems to be a misunderstand on your part about what the int function does when given a non-numeric chars string what it does is raise an exception rather than returning something less than 0

4351227
strcpy	strcmp
there are numerous utility functions like strcmp or strcpy which can do this for you

4351256
fadein	fadeout
jquery s fadeout and fadein functions support specification of callbacks so you would change the above code to something more like this

4351258
keydown	keyup
how do i detect keydown keyup events with a console app

4351258
keydown	keyup
note that if you hold down a key keydown will be called numerous times and keyup will only be called once when you release it

4351266
post	get
one note i saw one previous post but couldn t get it to work

4351308
rss	feed
i have a very basic php script that i use to post interesting links that i find to a filterable list on my site and also to my rss feed which feedburner then also tweets when pinged

4351308
jobs	cron
does this require cron jobs

4351345
google-chrome	firefox
note that the npswf32.dll is the netscape plugin firefox google-chrome version of flash so make sure you look for the ocx

4351386
getter	setter
if so which tool can be used to map the xsd to a class set simply giving access to the data components of the nodes using getter and setter

4351394
int	chars
well i want to know considering tables with a lot of records if the best way is to put a tiny int with chars length of 1 and set 1 for yes and 0 for no

4351398
dictionary	map
a simple solution is to use a dictionary to map ids to panels

4351435
jobs	cron
use cron to execute jobs on a regular

4351439
width	height
the bitmaps themselves either have a height that matches the size of the imageview or a width that matches

4351440

subtract	add
if your model assigned the wrong ranking you correct the feature weights you add 1.0 to the weights of the features that fire on the better slogan the one that s better according to the people s vote and subtract 1.0 from the weights of the features that fire on the worse slogan its score was obviously too high so you re lowering it now

4351441
subtract	add
typically you don t really add or subtract 1.0 but eta times 1.0 where eta is the learning rate which you can set experimentally

4351582
mp3	wav
i m trying to set up a program to record a portion of an internet audio stream and save it to a file preferably mp3 or wav

4351589
subtraction	addition
i need to create a program where it lets you choose from addition or subtraction

4351593
16-bit	64bit
if they are already well distributed you can just fold the 64bit down to 16-bit with a couple of shifts xors and a mask

4351635
put	get
large multiplayer games mmos - games that require multiple machines use their persistent data store as a write-only pipe and for recovery and then put a lot of energy into a scheme for partitioning data in such a way that the simulation ie business logic can get at what it needs to with latencies on the order of local memory access

4351655
getter	setter
you have to go through the setter and getter you ve made

4351655
getter	setter
by the way you can take care of setter and getter by adding

4351666
implements	extends
we can now create an interface for the modelclass table objects which implements our irepository and a concrete class extends the abstract repository class and implements the imodelclassinterface

4351689
width	height
the main-div container is positioned with a fixed width and height

4351724
mkmapview	mkoverlay
i am working on an iphone ipad app that is using semi-transparant tiled map overlays via mkmapview and mkoverlay

4351731
width	height
if it s not going to be dynamic and just straight up html would be easier to just abs position each image considering your container div has a set width and height anyway

4351749
hash	salt
a salt is a value that is added to a password or other secret which you want to hash one way

4351749
hash	salt
what this does is it mitigates dictionary attacks - basically dictionaries of common passwords pre-hashed with no salt - from being used to guess a one way password as long as the attacker does not know the hash

4351749
hash	salt
if every password has a different hash then it makes it very difficult for an attacker to create a dictionary optimized for cracking your passwords they would need a dictionary for each separate salt and they would also need to know where the salt was placed in each password

4351749
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
then when a user attempts authentication you combine that recorded salt value with the password during the call to crypt for example and if the resulting hash matches then they have entered the correct password

4351782
put	get
every time i put the inner class though i get a syntax error

is there an implementation of the bag collection a collection like a set that kept count of how many times an object is inserted

4351811
folder	directory
i have several files and folder that i create in the application.commonappdatapath directory during runtime

4351837
put	get
in fact if you put the query in a mapping file you can even get intellisense and real-time error checking by installing the hql language service for visual studio

4351864
free	malloc
you should initialize the array and free it like this am i using malloc properly

4351884
inherited	properties
rule files follow the same properties inherited guidelines as properties sheets vsprops files

4351884
inherited	properties
for more information see properties inherited

4351919
stdout	stderr
first off i recommend you do something other than your print_info approach since it s not very flexible - what if you want to actually use the version rather than simple print it to stdout or what if you wish to report the version in an error message to stderr

4351985
vcard	vcf
i am trying to write a program in c# that will split a vcard vcf file with multiple contacts into individual files for each contact

4352020
post	put
lets put or post that to foo 1

client-side	server-side
to have the validation occur client-side in addition to server-side you d need to use javascript

4352042
put	get
i am new here and i got a bit of web development skills and because in my new project i need user information on different bits of application i was wondering is it all right to put the whole user row in a session array or to get data each time from database if so what is the easiest way to get a column cell data based on id from mysql with php

4352071
put	get
just put whatever you use on every page in the session and get the other columns when you need them

jdom	dom4j	jdom	xom	dom4j	xom
beyond using a tree model dom xom jdom dom4j which would work well with xpath best choice when dealing with data is usually data binding library like jaxb

4352113
onresume	onpause
then use onpause onresume in each activity to bind unbind from the service

4352113
onresume	onpause
alternatively you could add a pair of methods on your service which tell it to start stop listening for location updates and call it from each activity s onresume onpause

4352151
folder	directory
similarly we have a resources directory usually in the same directory as the .xcodeproj file and under that folder for images nibs audio etc

4352151
folder	directory
many of our projects reference a common directory that is outside of the project folder and under common we have model view controller etc.

4352154
onmouseover	onclick
for inline event handlers like onclick or onmouseover you don t need the javascript part

how to real time convert wireless packet 802.11 to ethernet packet 802.3 in windows

4352229
ethernet	wireless
this will make your computer into a very expensive two port ethernet switch where the wireless link is a port

4352284
hide	show
i want to show or hide an extjs panel based on some django template logic

4352304
mouse	keyboard
i want the image to be in the front at a visual level but without it having any bearing on the keyboard mouse interaction with the app

4352304
mouse	keyboard
my fall back is to create a series of 1pixel wide lines which will still be in the foreground mouse keyboard wise but i can cope with losing that much interaction ability

4352333
post	get
i get a different error that i can t post becase the editor thinks i m posting hyperlinks

4352338
freebsd	linux
it needs to work on the major operating systems unix linux macosx freebsd and windows

4352413

works on firefox 2.0 google-chrome 8.0.552.215 ie8 8.0.7600.16385

4352428
django	web2py
i have just spent a few days playing around with web2py and really like it and i am wondering if django offers something more that i am missing out on

4352428
django	web2py
update thank you all for the wonderful input after buying three django books and going through a few small projects tutorials for both django and web2py i have settled on web2py

4352428
django	web2py
django is also a wonderful framework but web2py is just better in my limited experience opinion

4352449
pop-up	dialog
as i said any function that is not a callback returns a valid result additionally the dialog pop-up as expected no problems with dll s hinstance

4352478
django	web2py
for example develop your e-commerce website on web2py or django

4352480
division	modulo
your friend is right you need to use the operator called as modulo which gives the reminder after division

4352514
bazaar	git
using hg tried git bazaar etc.

4352547
lxml	beautifulsoup
use lxml it is very efficient as it is written in c another popular html parser is there beautifulsoup but again it is based on sgmllib so i would recommend that you should go for lxml

4352554
mef	prism
you probably do not want to use prism waf mef

4352604
range	min	range	max	min	max
if i have to use range then in this case we have to use min and max of ax

4352606
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari the menus render fine

4352643
public	protected
the compiler itself remembers which ivar is public protected or private and emits errors if you try to access them from somewhere inappropriate

4352652
accessor	properties
unless you have a good reason to you should in general use the accessor methods for properties rather than accessing ivars directly

4352656
int	chars
however if i call the function once with a file call it again with a nonexistent file then call it one more time with the original file the chars string buffer is larger than the int length

4352670
int	double
the arraylist then gets filled with a string a score value as double and an array of int

4352670
int	double
all goes well i can read every single arraylist entry the label string the double value and can access the array of int with a nested loop

4352670
int	double
to be pedantic i i double check if that array entry of the int array is an instance of int with isinstanceof

4352670
int	double
if i leave out the isinstanceof call just looping over the int array all goes fine it loops over the complete arraylist reads my strings and double loops over the nested int array and finishes successfully

4352682
memcpy	malloc
if instead if allocating space for this array statically if i malloc it and then do a memcpy only the data section size will reduce or the text section size also will reduce

4352690
mouse	keyboard
seems like i could just call settimeout for my desired idle time and then call cleartimeout upon any mouse click or keyboard press by having something like body .click cleartimeout ..

4352732
mouseup	mousedown
in the mousedown mouseup events of the window call the mousedown mouseup event handler of the parent

4352751
int	chars
int senderror send this- m_socket chars wbuffer wcslen wbuffer sizeof wchar_t 0

4352771
portrait	landscape
the problem is arranging this stuff so that it appears fine on a landscape mode as well as portrait mode

4352803
mouse	keyboard
how to find out the system idle time means to calcuclate the time the user keeps the system idle ie without moving the mouse and without touching the keyboard and between which time the system is idle .also i should require an excel or mail to be send to the user with the summation of all the idle times for that day for that particular system

4352823
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
malloc and its friends free and realloc is the way to do this in c

4352860
post	get
you may simply use params as a hash of all passed parameters both get and post

4352896
dddd	cqrs
terms of cqrs and dddd originated in .net world and were pushed by .net practitioners like greg young and udi dahan

4352956
django	web2py
both django and web2py are excellent full stack web frameworks with similar features and capabilities - you won t be missing out on much as a beginner with either framework

4352956
django	web2py
having said that web2py has a lower initial learning curve than django as it was specifically designed as a learning tool

4352956
django	web2py
although there are more learning resources for django as it has been around longer and has more users learning web2py is also fast because of the excellent book and almost instant responses to questions on the user group

4352982
getter	setter
forget about the setter its only getter now when you dereference names readonly property the actual type behind dereferencing is statebag and statebag implements idictionary tha s why you can cast viewstate property to dictionary now when yo call add method of dictionary it will be stored in the statebag which is known s control s viewstate

4352988
post	get
it has simple rest interface and responds to get post requests

4353033
django	web2py
django has been around 5 years longer than web2py therefore it has more users and more applications to show off

4353033
django	web2py
django has what they call admin which is not the same as web2py s admin but more like web2py s appadmin

4353033
django	web2py
django s admin is better and more customizable than web2py s appadmin

4353033
django	web2py
django does not have the equivalent of web2py s admin

4353033
django	web2py
django is comparable to web2py in terms of security except that web2py had csrf prevention and default escaping in templates before they did but django broke backward compatibility when 1.0 was released

4353033
django	web2py
i am not aware of any functionality of web2py that is not present in django

4353033
django	web2py
you should try ask a question on the web2py google group and on the django group

4353034
inherited	properties
so in that case you could discover the inherited methods by enumerating the properties of obj.prototype

4353080
cpu	hyperthreading
if a multithreaded program runs safe on a single-core cpu with hyperthreading will it also run safe on a dual-core cpu with hyperthreading

4353104
pull	push
in mercurial you add lines to hgrc in the paths section to create aliases to push to and pull from

4353117
google-chrome	firefox
see this w3schools item ie and this other w3schools google-chrome and firefox

4353117
google-chrome	firefox
on browsers except google-chrome and firefox use window.screenleft and window.screentop

4353117
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome and firefox use window.screenx and window.screeny i have tested this in google-chrome

4353150
uiview	subviews
consider a screen point cgpoint and a view uiview which is somewhere inside the view hierarchy it can be a subviews of other views

4353173
super	self
in your case you may want to send initwithname andlocation andsomethingelse to self directly and if needed you can re-define this selector on the class and call super appropriately

4353191
copying	overwrite
you are also copying items from two positions into the same position so the second copy will overwrite the first

4353193
nunit	moq
i m using asp.net mvc 2 nunit moq and mvc contrib

4353197
versioning	upgrade
of course it means you ll have to go through the extraction step if you want to upgrade to a newer versioning of sqlcipher but it d probably be worth it unless you really want to install a cygwin development environment just to be able to build this single library

4353198
hash	salt
i would go with a one way salt hash

4353198
hash	salt
when you create the hash of the password you first combine the password with the salt and hash this combined value

4353198
hash	salt
to authenticate the user you combine the entered password with the salt stored for the user perform the hash on the combined value and compare

4353198
hash	salt
by adding the salt to the mix you ensure that the hash for passwords that happend to be the same have a different hash because the salt portion differs

4353256
carrierwave	paperclip
the alternatives that pop into mind are paperclip and carrierwave

4353261
gif	png
slightly longer answer it s a very inefficient form of steganography it won t work for jpeg images and for gif png it ll basically make your image uncompressable

4353311
hash	salt
storing salt password hash with per-user salt of course is all well and good

4353312
udp	rtp
as the link points out you will get a few false positives where dns and possibly other udp packets occassionally contain the header byte 0x80 used by rtp packets however the number should be negligible and not enough to cause kernel drops

4353323
actionlistener	focuslistener
if you can not change the actionlistener of the close button add a focuslistener to the text fields

4353332
children	parent
if the parent has 5 children and each of those has 4 children then you ll get a total of 20 rows returned

4353373
apache	nginx
i ve finally got my server up and running using nginx as the frontend listening on port 80 and apache listening on 8080 but there s no problem there the actual problem resides with wordpress.

4353373
post	get
which breaks a few things on wordpress for some reason like i can t insert images to the post as i get permission denied from firebug so without 8080 being added on to the url everything works correctly

4353410
children	parent
what i m trying to do is to figure out if some folders is one of children parent or not related

4353515
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
iirc in windows xp when you press save on a savefiledialog or open on a openfiledialog the directory where the file is saved or opened is set as the new current working directory the one in environment.currentdirectory

4353521
folder	directory
an annoyig quirk of the original implementation was that after you made your selection the current directory of your app changed to that folder meaning that if you expected file operations to be relative to your app folder it now failed

4353523
hide	show
my page generates a lot of information dynamically and uses jquery to add remove show hide stuff in the dom

4353525
multiplying	add
they are reasonably fast but it s still something like 100 cycles to add or multiplying

4353529
nsautoreleasepool	nsinvocationoperation
each operation that is called using nsinvocationoperation has it s own local nsautoreleasepool per apple requirements

4353529
nsautoreleasepool	nserror
when i pass back an nserror object using performselectoronmainthread withobject error doesn t the local nsautoreleasepool release the nserror object

4353537
addition	multiplication
that s 2 additions subtractions and 1 multiplication instead of 2 addition subtractions and 2 multiplication

4353561
range	max
range of values max value

4353566
getter	setter
i m not sure i understand your question but it appears that you want to process xml formats like atom and represent it in objects with getter setter

4353573
jboss	glassfish
the resource servlet will be loaded automatically in servlet 3.0 environments glassfish v3 tomcat 7 jboss 6 etc however in older environments you need to configure it manually in web.xml

4353620
post	get
only within the namespace post you will get linedlogger instead of logger

4353635
firefox	safari
i ve also found that if you re using a .net webservice and it s running on the test debug server instead of the real iis server explorer s xmlhttprequest will accept answers but firefox and safari s won t

4353649
floating-point	fixed-point
if you re coding for a microcontroller without floating-point operations then it s better not to use floating-point numbers at all and to use fixed-point arithmetic instead

4353651
stdout	fflush
what if one does fflush stdout after each printf

4353653
int	boolean	oncreate	ondestroy
if you need your service to continue running as a single instance without being killed and restarted i would recommend placing startforeground int id notification notification in your service s oncreate method and stopforeground boolean removenotification in your service s ondestroy method

4353656
subtract	add
if a cast is faster than a float add subtract on your platform and if an integer answer is useful to you this might be a reasonable alternative

4353659
implements	extends
you can extends this to implements more sophisticated languages like scheme

4353700
post	get
i ve successfully set up the route using camel s http component but i m unable to get the body of the jms message to post

4353727
treeview	treelist
i have written a treelist treegrid tree with columns control that inherits the treeview control

4353728
hide	show
the boolean flag firstshow allows you to hide the form only for the first call of show while for the following invocations it will work as usual

4353761
onchange	onblur
try javascript onblur or onchange access textbox_1 by document.getelementbyid or by document.getelementbyname and write to other textbox_2 by the same functions

4353773
getter	setter
you could override the setter or getter

4353804
width	height
keep in mind that the position display width and height css statements are going to be what makes your layout work--or not work as the case may be

4353828
put	get
if the caller is interested heâ ll put out the fuse by retaining. and if the caller is not interested like maybe heâ s ignoring an output from a function or just uses the value to construct some other object he does not do anything and the object will get out of memory

4353867
children	parent
hi i have a parent class that is abstract employee and i have children secretary engineer technician if i have and in a for-loop i have randomly made employee new secretary or new engineer.

4353905
client-side	server-side
as pekka said php runs on server-side while what you are trying to do is client-side increment of a variable

4353909
firefox	safari
either way works for firefox and safari on mac pc and ios

4353910
portrait	landscape
why dont you try changing the frame of your view controller s view property for the current mode that the user is in portrait or landscape

4353910
width	height
so in shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation just change yourviewcontroller.view.frame cgrectmake x y width height and perhaps you will have your rotated views

4353912
cpython	ironpython
from straight python or ironpython or cpython or whatever your best route is using the soap-based web services to query the list in question

4353923
int	double	int	chars
also floats can t be passed in varargs they re always promoted to double in the same way chars and short are promoted to int in varargs

4353960
wstring	istringstream
it should be obvious that if you have string istream and istringstream therefore you also have wstring wistream and wistringstream

4353996
postgresql	mysql
the most common choice for storing a significant amount of information would be a sql-based database such as mysql postgresql microsoft sql server sqlite etc

4354004
allocator	stl
recently i ve been using one of the lesser-used stl features- custom allocator and i need some serious help in reducing my semantic overhead

4354005
disk	ram
in a small system with extremely limited ram today found mostly in embedded applications you may have to update the disk file

4354103
disk	ram
by way of contrast your classmate conserves ram by waiting to load the data on demand from the hard disk

4354103
disk	ram
you could store as much of the data in ram as possible while periodically writing any edits or modifications back to the file on disk during your application s idle state

4354112
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari webkit developers tools built in

4354115
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly on windows opera google-chrome firefox

4354115
firefox	safari
but not on ie and mac firefox safari

4354137
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	html5lib	html5lib	beautifulsoup
but instead of beautifulsoup and lxml i would suggest html5lib

4354198
hide	show
hide show column in an html table

4354199
jobs	cron
i would recommend a git repository lay out with the project name as the root under which all your source would lie including cron jobs db scripts unit tests library code as well as the php source in your www root

4354285
submit	submission
i think your code is missing the submit button on the image form submission

4354291
lisp	scheme
scheme p or -p other lisp simulating the question mark with a similar letter also denote predicates

4354309
pop-up	dialog
i keep getting visualstudio file pop-up dialog boxes when its hits the error on line return icontroller _container.resolve controllertype

4354318
dictionary	map
it s a very light-weight map not a dictionary

4354331
disk	ram
whatever ram disk you choose to purchase or write remember check if the ram disk driver responds the setdispositioninformationfile call

4354333
cpu	hyperthreading
do you have a dual-core or hyperthreading cpu

4354356
hash	md5
this doesn t seem to be an md5 or sha hash but i m not very worldly wise in this area so it may well be

4354394
hash	md5
md5 is a hash function

4354422
viewdidload	didreceivememorywarning
didreceivememorywarning - release any data that is used in the presentation of the ui that i can recreate if when viewdidload is called again or some other app specific event

4354437
children	parent
now all of the children are associated with parent

4354502
vim	emacs
i was thinking to write an emacs or vim script using abbreviations or something like that

4354521
google-chrome	firefox
obviously it should look good on all major browsers firefox google-chrome and ie for that matter

4354527
realloc	malloc
look at malloc and realloc

4354548
qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
there s a pretty good qtreeview qabstractitemmodel example here

4354578
datalist	repeater
bascially create an asp repeater bind your data to it in much the same way as the datalist and build your markup in the itemtemplate tag

4354578
put	get
you will only get the markup you put in the templates nothing else

4354595
smarty	phpbb
if you don t have access to extend php on your server and smarty isn t your cup of tea on format of performance and would like all the bare-metal code you could do like me and rip out what s in phpbb

4354602
equals	gethashcode
then it will use equals and gethashcode but if you use

4354604
int	double
c# float and double map to them just like int and long map to system.int32 and system.int64

4354610
folder	directory
the only problem i have is when i hit run on netbeans it doesn t show the actual web page it shows me the directory where i saved the project to instead of the public folder

4354619
vbscript	jscript
whether a batch script itself can cope with unicode i do not know but if that is the only problem remaining i would switch to using vbscript or jscript instead of a batch file

4354619
vbscript	jscript
i m not a big fan of vbscript and jscript but at least they don t have completely insane arcane semantics and limitations like batch does

4354634
put	get
i have been trying to put together a query to get the carid where it has attributes of both fast and small but have been having no luck

4354641
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
you now need to define functions called malloc free and realloc which you pass to this c library

4354656
range	min	range	max	min	max
if you want to make sure newax stays within a particular range of values you can use the functions max and min like so

4354661
minimum	max
basically a user can select three different paths and each path has a minimum of 3 steps and a max of 6 steps depending on which path is chosen

4354704
hash	md5
i just updated the readme for you to know how to use it but it basically uses md5 hash it provides expiration times to channels and per-client-ip per-channel security it additionally adds jsonp support if you need it

4354711
put	get
i tried some variations on what to put on curlopt_postfields too but couldn t get it to work

4354804
setinterval	clearinterval
if cleartimeout needs to be bulletproof or you need setinterval and presumably clearinterval you d need to throw more code at the problem but the principal of verifying enough time has elapsed before executing func holds

4354819
inherited	subclassing
if you were to use inherited to cover all these features you d need one subclassing for every feasible combination of features no border no scrolling border without scrolling scrolling without border border and scrolling etc.

4354824
post	get
if i post to search properties refno 5 propstatus finished a correct post is first made then when the results form is being rendered a get action is being done to search properties refno 5 propstatus finished jquery jquery0.5.2.min.js which is incorrect

4354851
free	malloc
malloc you need to free eventually

4354861
instances	transient
ebs backed instances ensure that even if the machine gets rebooted the transient memory is not lost

4354927
ienumerable	ilist
so the property should be an ienumerable or an ilist if you need to allow access to count or indexed access

4354932
children	parent
the children belong to the same process group as the parent process and are thus killed together with their parent process

4354937
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
according to the specifications there isn t any limit but someone has tried to reach this limit and it seems the limit for opera safari supported well over 4000 classes and firefox at least 2000 classes

4354942
x86	64bit
however on 64bit systems 32-bit programs should not install to that folder and instead to programfiles x86 which as i understand points to c program files x86

4354974
zoo	lubridate	zoo	chron	zoo	xts	xts	lubridate	xts	chron	chron	lubridate
edit here is a list of time date implementations which lubridate package refers to posixct osixlt date chron yearmon yearqtr zoo zooreg timedate xts its ti jul timeseries fts

4354995
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
the basic principles are pretty straightforward any memory allocated using the alloc family of functions including malloc calloc or realloc must be deallocated by a corresponding call to free

4355029
children	parent
i am going to implement a program where one parent process reads a text file and feeds the data he s reading into a shared memory buffer that s going to be read by some children processes

4355029
children	parent
when it finally goes down to 0 the parent process will be blocked until one of the children unlocks it after having read some block

4355029
children	parent
here is pseudo code for both children and parent

4355037
scheme	racket	lisp	racket	lisp	scheme
racket is closer to scheme than to common lisp but you could dip your toes into the lisp family without the speed bump of the emacs style of development

4355077
folder	directory
then go to cuda c c++ and under common add the location of the cutil.h to the additional include directory folder

4355090
free	malloc
when using the malloc free family of function there are two rules to be obeyed

4355090
free	malloc
you can only free valid memory returned by a malloc family allocator and freeing it renders it invalid so double freeing is an error as is freeing memory not obtained from malloc

4355129
internationalization	localization
you ll want to read up a bit on internationalization and localization often referred to as i18n l10n

4355168
hide	show
my page generates a lot of information dynamically and uses jquery to add remove show hide stuff in the dom

4355174
zoo	xts
fwiw my money is on zoo and xts

4355184
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
these canvas and css3 approaches will work in modern browsers at least in opera 10 firefox 4 safari 4 and google-chrome

4355203
int	boolean	width	height
void drawbitmap int colors int offset int stride float x float y int width int height boolean hasalpha paint paint treat the specified array of colors as a bitmap and draw it. can i use that i m really not sure what its saying

4355220
free	malloc
you have only 4 malloc calls so you should only have 4 free calls

4355241
awt	swing
it combines the native-ness of awt with the ease and features of swing and of course runs everywhere

4355247
free	malloc
in general you cannot free a part of a malloc d structure

4355260
width	height
ok height takes a bit of work but it s pretty straightforward but the width â this gets really interesting

4355263
prepare	execute
i also implemented a staged approach to fetch data where i prepare a list of batches and then execute them

4355270
mongodb	bson
store your reports information in mongodb s native bson documents

4355288
hide	show
you can just show hide a gif but you can also embed that to ajaxsetup so it s called on every ajax request

4355315
int	chars
i want transformation from int to chars or string in c++

4355413
put	get
the only way i am able to get an email is if i put in some value

4355416
hide	show
when you click the visible one hide it and show the hidden one

4355416
hide	show
then you can also hide show the other buttons in an onclick event

pull	push
here s the work flow i desire to figure out it s centralized in that my fellow collaborator and i push to the remote master and pull changes from the remote master and i think i understand how to do that well enough

4355442
pull	push
however i also want to be able to have a remote development branch from the main line of development the remote master but also i want my collaborator and i to clone this development branch onto our machines to be able to pull from this development branch and to push to it from our local machines and then when the development branch is stable to merge it onto the remote master and then we pull from the remote master onto our local clones of the master

4355442
pull	push
so far what i have learned is about the centralized workflow is that the collaborators can push and pull to and from the remote master and choose to make their local branches on their own machine and then merge those with their local master and then pull from the remote master first before pushing to it

4355727
vim	emacs
if you re talking vim and emacs you might want to try a simple bash script

4355733
for-loop	loops
the only loops i can see in your code is the for-loop which is finite no more that 150 iterations so that would not make the code execute indefinitely

4355733
for-loop	loops
for instance if you put a line before and after the for-loop and when executing only the first one is displayed you know your problem is somewhere within loops

4355831

terminate	timeout
the watchdog arranges sleeps for the timeout period and when that time is up sends a signal to the actual command and a terminate signal to the parent process

4356020
int	chars	memcpy	memcmp
the way to deal with this issue is to accompany each buffer with an int that will indicate the number of chars in it and then stick to the memory area manipulation functions such as memcpy memcmp etc

4356020
puts	gets
you should also avoid puts and gets for file i o since those are also string-oriented

4356027
ssl	https
when the admin clicks this admin link the site redirects to ssl https protocal and is suppose to send the admin to the administrtion area of the site

pop-up	dialog
hi i was wondering if there was a way for a batch file to make a pop-up appear using the command along with other selections besides the ones that are there by default cancel and ok by this i mean add custom buttons to the pop-up message such as a next button that would bring you to another pop-up message with dialog on it or something along those lines

4356062
cvs	svn
your source control system should manage this for you and you should be able to access this information using cvs annotate or svn blame

4356080
width	height
that shader needs to run twice for it to work what you call blursize should be a vec2 and the value of that should be vec2 0 1.0 height for vertical blur and vec2 1.0 width 0 for horizontal blur

4356084
pascal	delphi
i come from a delphi pascal programming world but i also play around with c++ or c once in a while there is a question that bothers me the most why does c++ use . to access a structure member and - to access method

4356084
pascal	delphi
in delphi pascal we use . for any of those even properties.

4356088
google-chrome	firefox
but i have a strange problem in firefox in google-chrome this works perfectly in which the uniform location for each matrix sampler in each shader are not saved properly

4356088
google-chrome	firefox
like i said this doesn t work only in firefox which make me believe firefox and google-chrome store uniform locations differently

4356089

4356635
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
one thing i noticed is that it does not include add subtract multiplying or divide functions

4356635
multiplying	subtract
is it as simple as just adding subtract multiplying dividing them together using integer math

4356635
multiplying	subtraction	multiplying	addition	subtraction	addition
i can see addition and subtraction working but multiplying or dividing wouldn t take care of the fractional part..

4356657
button	checkbox
for checkbox or radio button you can use the checked or checkstate property

4356668
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs has access control lists encryption and so on--if you can t trust your filesystems to keep your data safe why do you even bother caring about network traffic

4356672
versioning	upgrade
as a first step i would suggest that you upgrade to the most recent versioning of wordpress

4356684
wordpress	joomla
wordpress drupal and joomla are ready-to-go with minimal set-up

4356702
profiling	debugging
if your post-backs are slow you need to profiling the activity going on or otherwise debugging what s going on rather than try to avoid the page life-cycle

4356729
implements	extends
i have a class that extends glsurfaceview and implements renderer in my android app that takes care of the opengl rendering

4356739

while malloc simply allocates the memory calloc

4356754
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it s a bit ugly but it works for firefox google-chrome and safari just not ie

4356763

i also managed to make it so that it can detect the height width by itself

4356801
subtraction	addition
no need for directional pointers just use some smart addition and subtraction logic

4356834
children	parent
adding restrictions to the criteria will not affect what children are loaded only what parent which doesn t make sense in your case because you already have a parentid

4356852
zoo	xts
the xts time series package works on top of zoo and handles the most common date time classes by translating them to posixct and back again

4356886
oncreate	ondestroy
in your case what you have to do is to stop the handler on ondestroy so that it can be re-executed again in oncreate

4356915
int	chars
question i would like to compress a list of int in as short a string as possible consisting only of ascii chars usable for filenames and urls

4356930
slideup	slidedown
i am using yahoo s yui3 library which doesn t yet have native slideup or slidedown methods so i m simulating them

4356930
slideup	slidedown
i can easily simulate slideup by executing a simple animation that sets the height 0 but i m having trouble simulating the slidedown method since i don t know the final height of the ul list i am dynamically building

4356970
filtering	grouping
in my experience most common tasks that rely on result filtering ordering projection grouping logical conjunctive or disjunctive statements or subquerying can be carried out by mutating a criteria object in the expected ways

4357032
hide	show
i tend to just show hide a img as other have stated

4357032

that will hide horizontal overflow and show vertical overflow.

4357300
for-loop	arrays
you can use a for-loop to iterate through the arrays as

4357317
folder	directory
if you are using standard java file system interaction that s going to be your first bottleneck - java is pretty bad at folder content iteration - and if you are doing checks against each file as you iterate get the modified date make sure the file isn t a directory etc... performance can take a big hit these all involve round trips to native land

4357317
folder	directory
next raw iteration of a huge directory in ntfs isn t particularly slower than an n-ary tree approach folder and subfolders etc...

4357320
implements	extends
but when you extends customitem and implements your own item complete control lies within the implementation

4357357
post	get
no direct access - however use intermediate get post or ajax

4357376

inherited	subclassing
how can it is possible to inherited by composition if there are around 50 subclassing to inherited

4357589
superclass	subclassing
as far as i see by doing this i can still achieve the same thing as the composition example as well as i won t have to make a lot of wrapper methods to delegate methods of superclass for each subclassing

4357595
for-loop	loops
in that case you can add a nowait clause to the firs t omp for and rather than all threads waiting until the for-loop ends whoever s done first can immediately go on to start working on the second loops

4357625
phpstorm	webstorm
webstorm without php support and phpstorm with php support from jetbrains

onresume	onpause
i call the mtts.shutdown in onpause and reinitialise it in onresume

4358765
int	chars
so getchar returns any chars value as an unsigned chars converted to int which will therefore be non-negative

4358765
int	chars
well it has undefined behavior if the input is more than long_max chars due to int overflow but we can probably forgive that in a simple example

folder	directory
so if you have files directory in the root you need to move the one-by-one to the samplesproducta folder

4358883
accessor	properties
it is usually considered bad form to call properties accessor in init because they may have side effects that you wouldn t want to happen while the object is incompletely initialised

4358883
accessor	properties
similar considerations apply in dealloc btw it s better to release your ivars directly rather than using the properties accessor

4359477
mongodb	bson
of course it works with bson documents but when you want to update some record mongodb returns full bson doc not the part

4359499
trie	tree
you can use a bloom filter before looking up in the hashset.this can fasten things up.the bloom filter has a problem of false +ve s.so for all true the bloom filter returns you will have to look up in the hashset once again to make sure but all false you can be sure.also you could replace your hashset with a radix tree patricia trie for more compact storage

tcp is the most commonly used connection type and your chat program would likely communicate over tcp especially if you are connecting across the net because udp broadcasts are useless across the internet

4359958
udp	tcp
you should be safe forwarding and unblocking only the tcp ports but sometimes when i m unsure i just do both udp and tcp just to be safe

4359958
udp	tcp
in fact many routers and firewalls have 3 options tcp udp or both which saves you from having to create two rules for both types of the port

4359987
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it works well but in firefox generate this error

4360024
webrat	cucumber
i have read a lot of similar topics but most solutions are for older versions of rails rspec webrat or for other testing frameworks like cucumber and so i do not know if how they would apply

4360036
try-catch	exception-handling
and don t forget to use lots of try-catch logic around it because the mail stuff in gae is prone to throwing lots of exception-handling

4360045
sudo	passwd
sudo will only prompt you the first time or every n minutes for a passwd

4360045
sudo	passwd
i noted here that in 10.5 and later sudo will only work if your admin account has a passwd

4360067
equals	gethashcode
i d rather override bool equals system.object and int gethashcode and use equals for value comparison - imho makes the code more readable by virtue of reducing ambiguity

4360075
hide	show
the first time the show hide login link is clicked everything appears to work fine and the div with the class loginbox appears on the screen

4360075
hide	show
the second time show hide login link is clicked nothing happens

4360091
cpu	hyperthreading
in addition to what roman said you should see whether the client s pc has multiple cpus cpu cores hyperthreading

4360091
cpu	hyperthreading
if there s just a single cpu with a single core and no hyperthreading you won t benefit from parallelizing a computation

4360130
des	aes
des is a very weak algorithm you might want to think about aes rijndael

4360194
mongoid	mongomapper
above is for mongomapper but idea is the same for mongoid -- just drop to the database level and drop all collections

4360195
int	double
is just a shorter abbreviated form of coding in fact the compiler will allocate the memory the same qty of memory for the array the first one is not explicitly write the new just like when you assign an int to a double variable you can write the cast or not because is a safe cast and will produce the same effect

4360221
google-chrome	safari
the client is either the latest versions of safari or google-chrome

4360256
getter	setter
i omitted generic getter setter

4360314
width	height
what i need to do is resize only this link so the page shows normal size yet scaled down to about 50 of its normal width and height while fitting in the iphone iframe perfect

4360325
margin	height
the height animation and also the built-in slide effects don t account for margin and border

4360325
margin	height
as a result the animation runs for example on a hide it collapses the interior height of the element to zero then it applies display none -- since the element s margin and border are still visible the application of display none causes the element to blip out of existence

4360325
margin	height
now all of the visible content including the margin and border are inside #faq-group-notice so when the height animation effect runs it collapses everything -- not just the stuff inside the border

4360343
getter	setter
remember that properties are just syntax aliases to setter and getter methods

4360411
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if your character set is ascii then it s quite easy to compare characters in alphabetical order either case-sensitive or case-insensitive

4360516
google-chrome	firefox
it s realy strange behaviour of google-chrome and firefox but i m glad it works with this workaround

4360544
put	get
this is the general idea of hashing and you will recognize the put and get method from java.util.map

4360568
width	height
expands it if it s too small height width

4360579
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
opera and safari 4 and google-chrome

4360594
folder	directory
for xcode 3 the build directory is usually located inside your main project folder

4360598
vpn	wlan
my usual basic assumption is to treat a wlan as the internet - anyone can listen so you either configure the wlan with encryption if possible most wireless routers these days support wpa2 tkip aes which should be considered reasonably strong or you configure a vpn over something like ssl and use a cert as per cowabunga darren so you get greater strength than passwords

4360599
width	height
it s difficult to diagnose without seeing your markup and css but what might work is to make the target s parent maintain its height width when you animate

4360612
x86	64bit
i m running windows 7 64bit installed eclipse and android sdk in the program files x86 folder

4360616
width	height
tablelayout gives all children fill_parent and wrap_content for width and height respectively

4360616
width	height
tablerow gives all children wrap_content for both width and height

4360620
width	height
in any case default width and height if you ask me is a bad practive what will be your default

4360633
google-chrome	firefox
i am not coding for ie at the moment and only using latest google-chrome and firefox for testing now

4360655
dictionary	map
in another language with a similar data structure you might use a for...each loop processing every record and then deleting it from the hash dictionary map whatever

4360690
width	height
to follow up on slaks answer to use the pixel dimensions of the image regardless of the dpi you can bind the width and height to the pixelwidth and pixelheight of the source like this

4360708
pbm	pgm
read up on the pbm or the pgm image formats

4360745
away3d	papervision3d
i believe the latest version of flar toolkit has support for away3d papervision3d sandy3d and alternativa3d

4360773
put	get
and when you put each of these files in a different folder it can get tedious going back and forth and finding them

4360782
int	chars
it is possible to call a function defined as for example returning int and having a declaration for it returning say chars

4360855
debian	linux
i ve tested this code on dell computers running debian linux and not had this problem

4360894
folder	directory
looks like the only app that can hold a handle to the folder is the manager itself because its starting directory is the one the error complains about tools

4360902
httphandler	httpcontext
and in the httphandler code you just read it from the httpcontext parameter of the processrequest method like so

4360956
post	get
i need to get an understanding about how you can handle get and post data in a form in asp.net in these 2 situations

4360956
post	get
i wonder what are the exact commands to access get and post variables directly

4360958
maven	pom.xml
i m looking into the maven wagon plugin to attempt uploading some artifacts to remote unc server shares servername share directory to put to and i have gotten it configured to work like so in the pom.xml

4360968
post	get
if you want to know more about the difference between get and post variables i d suggest having a read of this question when do you use post and when do you use get

4360970
client-side	server-side
i am trying to create a server-side solution which periodically pushes data to the client no client-side polling via node.js

4361034
vim	notepad++
in keeping with enlightenment ruby culture and simplicity aims of the project you don t need much more than a terminal and vim or notepad++ to work with the koans project

4361042
post	get
- you can pass the values using get or post variables

4361042
post	get
i think the easiest way to do it is to use post variables is as easy as with get but you should avoid passing an url in the url itself

4361050
passenger	webrick
tried running the app with both passenger standalone and apache module and webrick rails server

4361077
rss	feed
i have a situation where i have an hourly batch job which has to parse a large number of rss feed and extract the text of the title and description elements from each item per feed into strings which will then have their word frequencies calculated by lucene

4361102
move	drag
i ve thought about writing a program that just displays the image then you drag a box and its saves the image and move on to the next one

4361105
northwind	adventureworks
you can also grab some of the sql sample databases like northwind adventureworks and use that data to populate your objects if it s suitable

4361115
width	height
i have a filled shape and a bitmapdata that is the same width and height as the shape s bounding box

4361120
instances	transient
if you were to decide your repository and defaultcontainer should be transient rather than singleton but still had the static field you d be facing a pretty nasty race condition as the instances successively overwrite the shared field

4361165
button	checkbox
i have a usercontrol which may contain many different kind of controls button textbox combobox or checkbox

4361172
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
and i ve considered the route of using an explicit oo inherited model where i have subclassing of a base product class to represent any product that has additional properties

4361192
opencv	emgucv
emgucv on sourceforge is a .net wrapper around opencv which has numerous image manipulation capabilities including image filters and a bounding box algorithm that could solve this pretty easily

4361236
opera	firefox
firebug has a good one for firefox opera has dragonfly and other browsers tend to have them built in

4361268
folder	dir
copy the source folder to a dir which is not source a folder

4361272
post	get
i ve read countless post about this but i just can t seem to get it to work

4361296
mouse	keyboard
when i press on tab keyboard hyperlinks don t get focus and i can t work with my window without the mouse

google-chrome	safari
try converting the font to truetype .ttf and svg .svg and then use truetype for ie and svg for safari and google-chrome

4361358
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have tested basic auth in google-chrome 55 and firefox 50 and verified that the basic auth info is indeed negotiated with the server this may not work in safari

4361377
versioning	upgrade
i ve already talked to my host and i am looking to upgrade to the latest versioning

4361378
public	protected
make sure the class is public or protected if in the same package

4361389
algol	smalltalk
ruby has been called smalltalk with an algol syntax where algol is the language that gave us the conventions you re talking about here

4361406
pull	push
it is typically put under version control so that the settings will propagate to other repositories with push and pull

4361413
post	get
when i am putting request via get it s working printing value of params but for post it s not working

4361433
int	chars
i need to hash an id int or chars array to an x y point confined within that boundary area

4361490
textmate	gedit	kde	gnome
well if you plan to use your linux distro with gnome instead of kde you probably should check gedit with gmate plugins although is not like textmate power it has a lot of it features

4361536
post	get
to solve the problem it is necessary that you post your stack trace you get when the force close message appears

4361538
put	get
i get confusing results depending on where i put the chr 10

4361541
int	chars
i know it returns an int but not an int does that mean instead of using getline i should get input chars to chars

4361553
public	protected
when and why should i use public private and protected functions and variables inside a class

4361561
post	get
how can i use the c# sdk to get permission to post to one of that user s business pages wall they must select one if they admin multiple pages right

4361576
public	protected
the visibility of a property or method can be defined by prefixing the declaration with the keywords public protected or private

4361583
google-chrome	firefox
firefox works like a charm but not in google-chrome it seems that autocomplete plugin is hijacking the enter key keycode 13 every other key works so when i click on enter without choosing a suggested text nothing happens

4361622
tolower	ctype
c++ also provides tolower in its ctype facet which you can use here

4361629
memcpy	strcpy
memcpy is not really any slower than strcpy

4361629
memcpy	strcpy	strlen	strcpy
in fact if you perform a strlen to identify how much you are going to memcpy then strcpy is almost certainly faster

4361641
division	subtraction
if you don t want to implement division for 128bit value you could precompute several 40 128 bit values that represents powers of 10 and use subtraction

4361645
rvm	bundler
based on my limited understanding of bundler and rvm it seems that they--like rubygems--have their own install locations for gems

4361645
rubygems	rvm	rubygems	bundler	rvm	bundler
do we use all three rubygems bundler rvm and tell them all to install gems to the same place

4361645
rubygems	rvm	rubygems	bundler	rvm	bundler
on a related note are bundler and rvm wrappers around rubygems are they alternatives to it or are they completely orthogonal to it

4361659
rss	feed
i ve categorized database of rss feed around 1000

4361659
rss	feed
so i iterate throught the rss feed downloads only feed with new items

4361659
rss	feed
- via the wrapper for gevent pool run task for rss feed download at every stage new items found add new job to quique to download item at every item downloaded add tasks for image downloading

4361662
folder	directory
if you want to do that you have to save the image to the app s directory folder and then build a way to show to the user the images he has saved internally and allow him to delete load etc

4361702
textarea	textbox
if you are watching changes that the user enters in the textbox itself you should use the class textarea or textinput instead of text

4361707
put	get
basically get s all the table s values and put them in a json array

4361716
rvm	bundler
when using rvm and bundler together rvm tells bundler where the gems should go and bundler installs them into the rvm-folder

4361716
rvm	bundler
i personally use bundler and rvm for all my projects

4361718
agile	sprint
well my experience from real life is that certain agile planning tools tools were handed to the scrum teams before they even started their sprint fortunately the teams liked it but we were free to inspect and adapt to using something else if it did not work out for us

4361736
rvm	bundler
this way i use bundler to keep track of the dependencies for each app and rvm to isolate each app s gems from each other

4361736
rvm	bundler
i have not yet installed rvm on my deployment server there i just use bundler to make sure each apps dependecies are handled

4361736
rvm	bundler
as for your last question bundler is a wrapper around gem rvm just manipulates the gempath where gems are installed

4361761
128bit	64bit
since the largest 64bit number is 20 digits long that means all 19-digit decimal numbers can be printed that way but since the largest 128bit number is 39 digits long we can t break it up into only 2 parts since there s a chance that we might end up with a 20 digit number bigger than the largest 64bit number

4361764
memcpy	malloc
sounds like you re onto something with your with malloc memcpy idea there

4361767
switching	screens
then if you want to add it to your project switching back to the wpf project currently open in eb and click the right arrows on the toolbar placed on the left-hand side of the screens and go to project - your user control here

4361849
onchange	onkeyup
i looked around and the text field does not have the onkeyup or onchange events

4361865
onkeyup	onblur
i would say an onblur onkeyup down event that triggers a custom event that waits for a pause or space then sends the data then handles the return

4361879
keydown	keyup
it does have keyup and keydown listeners but they are assigned at runtime via addeventlistener keyup ...

4361879
keydown	keyup
use your browser s dom inspector to select the input element and then drill into the event listeners currently assigned in webkit s inspector that s under event listeners at the bottom of the right-hand pane -- you ll see keyup keydown and several others

4361899
iboutlet	ibaction
using interface builder or some similar program for creating views that will connect to the code with iboutlet and ibaction

4361901
memcpy	strcpy
replacing strcpy by memcpy doesn t make any significant difference

4361903
decoder	encoder
use the built-in decoder and encoder functions rather than trying to create json-encoded characters like u..

4361909
free	malloc
but i think think there is another problem when i try to sort a bigger array 200 elements the program doesn t work i get a malloc error incorrect checksum for free object - object was probably modified after being free

4361920
jqgrid	datatables
if you don t have someone around to help with jqgrid you are better off with datatables

4361930
post	get
nb the way on how you get the single id name depend on how the is formatted so you do better if you post to us the echoed json

4361948
google-chrome	safari
when i load the page in google-chrome and click around the logs show the only thing it s trying to reach on the server is favicon.ico which is a 404 and which i don t think ios safari tries to load anyway

4361953
udp	tcp
http is an application layer protocol which could be encapsulated with a protocol that uses udp providing arguably faster reliable communication than tcp

4361953
udp	tcp
quake 2 protocol proves that udp can be used over tcp to provide a basis for a structured communication system insuring flow control chunk ids

4362006
gif	png
yet many of us don t know the trade-offs between a gif jpeg or png file â and there are some major differences there

4362006
tiff	png
tiff â any bit depth any compression lossy or lossless everything including the kitchen sink â and no better than png

4362006
tiff	png
but for some customers like the federal government it s tiff instead of png

4362029
firefox	safari
if you are struggling with the cache manifest add the following javascript to your main html page and view the output in the console using firebug in firefox or debug show error console in safari

4362037
firefox	safari
if you are struggling with the cache manifest add the following javascript to your main html page and view the output in the console using firebug in firefox or debug show error console in safari

4362049
rss	feed
i need some help with my rss feed reader script..

4362049
rss	feed
i want thumbnails in my listview taken from rss feed thumbnail

4362060
maven	m2e
use the maven eclipse plugin m2e and just use target gwt run

4362064
division	multiplication
the reason to do this is because even though there is an integer division instruction div idiv in the instruction set it s typically very slow several times slower than multiplication

4362064
multiplying	division
the second part calculates the remainder by multiplying the result of division by 10 in an indirect way via shifts and adds

4362077
int	double
i need to rewrite the operator so that it can cout values for hour int and temperature double

4362081
division	multiplication
finally on the computation of i 10 the basic idea is to replace division by 10 with multiplication by 1 10

4362146
post	get
these programs will work with any browser that supports http proxying and give you the ability to modify get or post parameters cookies requests and responses

4362197
jobs	cron
here is a blog post about cron jobs and a library that i have used in production code

4362206
pull	push
use push over pull where ever it is possible to save polling the network

4362233
google-chrome	firefox
i d like full skinning support but i might be happy with something simple like firefox personas google-chrome themes

4362255
versioning	upgrade
i ve released new versioning of our software in wix we specify to upgrade without uninstalling first

4362255
versioning	upgrade
when new versioning msi is ran it upgrade main application but watchdog application is not upgrade even if it s not running so it s not in-use problem

4362257
hide	show
to get windows xp to show the accessibility underscores all the time go to display properties | appearance | effects and uncheck hide underlined letters for keyboard navigation until i press the alt key.

4362265
decoder	encoder
in any case lame.exe is not a good choice for editing tags as it s an audio encoder which will decoder and re-encode the mp3 causing quality loss

4362280
translation	localization
this is where i learned that localization is a lot more than translation

4362303
post	get
when i try to upload a file using this code i get a post success response on the client end but the file never shows up on my server

4362330
width	height
and width height is the same as x y

4362339
width	height
you can vertically and horizontally align it using just css providing you know the width and height

4362339
width	height
if you don t know the width and the height because it varies you could always use javascript or jquery to get it

4362360
int	double
c++ operator rewrite to cout int and double values

4362360
int	double
i need to rewrite the operator so that it can cout values for hour int and temperature double

4362378
unsigned	short
there s an unsigned short counter that gets incremented in the loop and within the loop i -drain and re-alloc the pool if the counter ever hits 0

4362397
division	multiplication
which makes sense - there are plenty of number collections that we might want to make instances of num where multiplication is irreversible - a division operation would be essentially meaningless

4362403
hide	show
you normally don t need to hide one mdi child before you show the next one but it is possible for the timing to get mixed up in which case the wrong form can end up on top

4362449
submit	submission
however after submission if i click the back button on my browser change some fields and then submit the form again the mysql data isn t updated nor is a new entry created

4362450
whenever	rubber
if you need a rubber band arc you ll have to erase and redraw it whenever the mouse moves

4362456
int	chars
public bruteforce chars characterset int guesslength

4362465
punctuation	words
get rid of punctuation and split the sentence into words

4362483
width	height
the biggest one you can fit in memory pixelwise will be 2gb leading to sqrt 2x10 9 maximum height and width

4362483
width	height
from this number and dividing by the number of images you have for height and width you will get the overall pixels per subimage allowed. and can paint them into the appropriate places

4362486
post	get
you really should be using post instead of get but regardless i would check the following

4362497
folder	directory
keep in mind that if you re working in eclipse your class files will probably be in bin with respect to your working directory so if it s just in your project folder the way you have it should work but not getresourceasstream

4362615
implements	extends
my class extends surfaceview and implements surfaceholder.callback

4362659
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i think you have to put your addtype handler in httpd.conf and nott in .htaccess

4362662
nsmutablestring	nsstring
based on the error message you are receiving i expect the culprit is a nsstring or nsmutablestring object

4362682
wan	lan
to go across the network wan or lan you pretty much have to use ip

4362682
udp	tcp
lastly in addition to tcp consider using udp as well because you get builtin message boundaries and easier endpoint management

4362688
lisp	smalltalk
just like lisp and smalltalk - # and so on are simply legal method names

4362717
client-side	server-side
server-side and client-side validation can easily exist simultaneously

4362770
post	get
if it is make a second request with the proper get or post method to retrieve the body

4362783
serializable	deserialization
plain binaryformatter serializable is working fine but deserialization crashes with access to private field errors

4362791
post	get	post	put	put	get
spring 3 mvc supports all 4 of restful methods get post put and delete

4362791
post	get
it is clear since most browsers don t support other methods besides get and post

4362791
post	put
but why post and not put

4362823
vbo	pbo
only basic opengl commands are used no pbo fbo vbo ... the only one problematic thing could be the use of shaders available only from qt 4.7 but its code is trivial

4362825
strcpy	strncpy
note that both strcpy and strncpy alone are unsafe the first might overflow your buffer and the second might leave it without a nul terminator

4362841
put	get
instead of .load which isn t intended for binary data...which is why you get those fun symbols with the encoding you just need to create an element with the right src and put it where you want in the document for example

4362857
udp	tcp
whenever the server has created new socket tcp i want it to notify the client to use the new socket for further communication.currently i have thought of sending udp packet to the client to be notified

4362857
udp	tcp
it it is not a good idea two have two tcp connections i can use udp to send the control information

4362871
pull	push
you can then push pull to this just as you would any other repository after you have added it as a remote

4362928
superclass	subclassing
1 when you extend a class your subclassing implicitly contains a chunk of data that consists of all the data used to make an instance of the superclass

4362941
implements	extends
one of my class extends activity and starts a thread that implements runnable

4362942
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
they are correctly positioned in ie8 firefox safari google-chrome

4362972
implements	extends
threads or rather runnables which you should implements rather than extends thread have a run method that contains the code they are expected to execute

4362985
google-chrome	safari
it s open source and seems to be based on the webkit engine which is used in many browsers today google-chrome safari ios android

4362987
hash	md5
now i would like to save some bandwidth so what i have done is made a created a php script that md5 hash the images and then my java captures the output and then compares it against hash stored using the preferences api

4363020
google-chrome	firefox
if i run utf8_encode on the string i m echoing out it looks fine in google-chrome but shows a different weird character in firefox

4363036
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works great in google-chrome firefox safari ie8 and ie6-9 via ietester

4363132
xmltype	clob
first just to load the file you can either use sql loader to load the data as an xmltype or you can use something like dbms_xslprocessor.read2clob to read the file as a clob and then convert it to an xmltype

4363137
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it has a uitabbarcontroller containing uinavigationcontroller presenting uitableviews that eventually lead to a uiviewcontroller that sets hidesbottombarwhenpushed to yes in its designated initializer to hide the uitabbar

4363137
uitableview	uisearchbar
the previous uitableview all have a uisearchbar in their tableheaderview that i move out of sight in viewwillappear

4363137
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
it remains hidden through the uitableview s viewwillappear and viewdidappear methods and the uiview s viewwilldisappear and viewdiddisappear methods and then finally pops down of its own accord

4363137
uitableview	uisearchbar
what is causing the uitableview to reveal the uisearchbar after i have hidden it

4363240
innodb	myisam
myisam and innodb behave differently in this regard for various reasons

4363240
innodb	myisam
for instance innodb will partition disk space for each column on disk regardless of whether it has data in it while myisam will compress the tables on disk

4363240
innodb	myisam
on the other hand innodb does row-level locking which means that with caveats concurrent read writes to the same table will perform better myisam does a table-level lock on write

4363240
innodb	myisam
for instance in innodb possibly myisam also

4363888
post	get
note this only affects get requests post requests work just fine since there s no re-using of the connection

4363930
post	get
using gaetestbed or your own unittest code like this simply instantiate your handler classes directly using a mocked fake environment dictionary and call the methods initialize and get post etc in the case of webapp directly

4363971
udp	tcp	udp	tftp	tftp	tcp
if you can t use tcp perhaps your client don t have enough cpu power or ram to handle tcp consider using some easy to code udp based protocol like tftp

4363971
udp	tftp
the tftp udp ip stack was coded in pure tp 7 with only static allocated memory and was working great

4363971
udp	tcp
but if you don t have such low cpu requirements rather consider using tcp ip instead of udp ip

4364159
children	parent
a parent - which contains some properties an item collection and a collection of children

4364164
x86	64bit
as for why there is an x86 subdirectory that s because your compiler also supports other cpus like arm for android win phone 7 and iphone and also to differentiate between 32bit and 64bit

you have to override equals and gethashcode

4364416
equals	gethashcode
you can override this behaviour by overriding the equals and gethashcode methods

also when overriding the equals method it is good practice to override the gethashcode method as well

4364431
equals	gethashcode
you can override this behaviour overriding equals and gethashcode

4364436
versioning	upgrade
i decided to upgrade three20 to the latest versioning as well but i encountered the compile issue listed here note apple login required

4364438
post	get	post	put	put	get
the reason you get the post not supported message is that your form uses post and your handler is annotated with put so it doesn t match

4364461
equals	tostring	equals	gethashcode	tostring	gethashcode
that doesn t mean you should simply make it a struct as to avoid boxing etc you would also need to override gethashcode and equals anyway plus tostring - and by the time you ve done that you could have done it for the existing code

4364821
free	malloc
i assume you define malloc and free in the main.cpp file that you try to compile and that mem_alloc and mem_free are located in libmemnmf-0.a

4364821
free	malloc
when the linker includes the objects from glibc and finds that these objects require a malloc free symbol it will try to include the malloc free from the glibc library directly

4364821
free	malloc
this will obviously include another malloc and free object in your executable

4364821
free	malloc
what you should do is put the malloc and free routines in a separate .o file and add that file somewhere in your link-command preferrably on the end assuming you do not specify the standard library in a special way on that line

4365365
try-catch	exception-handling
i guess that the exception-handling are not handled correctly but if i put the close calls into finally block they would have to be surrounded by try-catch block which would look very messy

4365449
int	double
the compiler would not know if you a want to call function 3 or b call function 1 and do an implicit widening conversion from int to double

4365502

for-loop	loops
now what the for-loop executes is clearly defined and if we wanted to do more in our loops we would add the extra instructions in between the curly braces

4366624
for-loop	loops
the reason loops continues rather than quitting is because without squiggly brackets to indicate a statement block the for-loop will only loops the single statement immediately following loops - that is the console.writeline

4366639
for-loop	loops
that is the basic of the for-loop in that loops you declare that the starting value of integer i is zero and it should continue to loops until i is equal to the length of string argsin and increase the value of i on each iteration

4366676

i would imagine containers and functionality would be doable in terms of char s bitshifts and for loops and other byte fancy things but stuff like exceptions and perhaps std cout and std cin seem hard to me without a dependency to begin with

4367602
put	get
higher values decrease the space overhead but increase the lookup cost reflected in most of the operations of the hashmap class including get and put .

4367639

4367961
width	height
for a particular image say on blue background i can get its width and height in android

4367961
width	height
but still if i try to find out the width or height of image programmatically i still get the same as in previous step

4367961
width	height
what i wanted to achieve is there any way through which i can get the exact height or width of image minus transparent background

4367961
move	drag
i want to do this because i m trying to implement a drag move gesture

4367999
wtl	atl
my app is vs2010 c++ with wtl not mfc or atl

4368068
width	height
in my own experience with visual studio 2010 in order to see the line in the designer view i had to set non zero width and height while also using x y to set the line within that space

4368090
width	height
and how are you trying to retrieve the width and height of the image

4368090
width	height
so in code you could either check the width and height of the imageview or the image it contains and get the same numbers

4368118
put	get
i have a problem with my layout i use javascript to get a xml-file and put it into a table

4368123

4368454
disk	ram
store your temporary iis files on your fastest disk or a ram disk

4368487
for-loop	loops
but if the for-loop is small feel free to unroll loops too

4368496
next	except
perhaps someone will have a better idea but the only thing that comes immediately to mind is to add a resetup flag so that you could sort of replay a script of the user s previous activity navigation actions within your app having your activities start each other up in turn but due to the resetup flag bypassing most of their code so they don t really do anything except essential setup and start the next one

4368526
uitableview	uisearchbar
uiviewcontroller to implement a view to placing an uitableview uisearchbar and being implemented

4368529
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i duplicated the code in viewwillappear and put it in viewdidappear and the search bar appears to be hiding properly

4368562
floating-point	fixed-point
this will be slow but you should initially build your code with floating-point support then profile to see if there are just a few places that you need to convert to fixed-point to get sufficient performance

4368562
floating-point	fixed-point
you will also need to have the floating-point stuff running to provide a comparison as you port to fixed-point to make sure you haven t lost anything in the process

4368566
cassini	iis
it works fine when debugging in cassini but when i publish to iis i get nothing returned from my entity query

4368602
swt	swing
as a consequence widgets must be updated in swt event thread like in swing

4368630
super	implements
this method could then in turn be called by init and if it is in a hiearchy all classes should implements it and call super reset

4368642
spaces	delimiter
a single spaces after a semicolon and comma for easy location of these types of delimiter

4368652
cassini	iis
there are differences between iis and cassini which can bite you if you aren t aware of them and it just makes more sense

4368652
cassini	iis
unless you are deploying to cassini and you aren t no one does then there s no point in developing against it unless you simply can t you don t have a local install of iis

4368744
rss	feed
2 you build an rss media feed yourself containing the photo stream item data and feed it to the wall

this works fine in google-chrome but firefox throws the error

4368801
scatter	graphing
scatter graphing for response

4368845
cos	sin
the reason the input signal is correlated with sin and cos functions is to account for phase differences between the input signal and basis functions

4368861
zoo	xts
this could be some example data stored in xts or zoo object

4368861
zoo	xts
i didn t figure out how to do this using the xts-formatted data or if this even suits the purpose of the xts zoo formatting of the data which seems to always carry the year information along it

4368894
children	parent
in other words the select works properly if i select all categories that has the top parent marked as main it will display the tree with all categories including children categories marked with

4368896

factors	matrix
it is particularly aimed at irregular time-series of numeric vectors matrix and factors

4369063
google-chrome	firefox
i m not worried about varying values between ie google-chrome i can debug that just the way mouse position is interpreted but firefox not picking any values is confusing me

4369065
touchesbegan	touchesended
unfortunately returning no for touchesshouldbegin blocks the touchesbegan and touchesended methods

4369082
for-loop	loops
the only noticeable difference is that find uses a for-loop because it already knows the number of elements and first uses a foreach loops because it doesn t know it

4369087
subtraction	addition
if you perform any operation such as negation addition subtraction etc and either operand is null the result is null too

4369133
pthreads	fork
with pthreads you can use the pthread_is_multithreaded_np function but it would make your fork code dependant on pthreads and it doesn t work on all platforms

4369139

4369256
linefeed	delimiter
we have an access application interfacing with a sql server database and we need to find a way to programmatically export a given view to an excel spreadsheet -- or at least an excel compatible spreadsheet csv tab delimiter etc. i can use bcp however several of the views contain fields with linefeed in them which proves troublesome when importing to excel

4369262
fadein	fadeout
i m trying to fadeout a row and fadein as the last row in the table but i can t get the fadein to work

i m working on doing some custom filtering and sorting of a dataset based on a collection of sort fields sent from the client browser and am using dynamic linq to achieve most of the desired effect

4369346
accessor	properties
will emitting opcode.call for the static properties s accessor have poorer performance than ldsfld bear in mind this is across tens of thousands of invocations since every method in the assembly is woven

4369363

post your code so that we can get more insight

4369418
opera	google-chrome
if i attach files over 2 megabytes defaultredirect works perfectly in opera but does not work in google-chrome and ie

4369461
folder	directory
i need to have it in a compressed folder called by a specific name and then upload that folder to a specific directory

4369488
sorting	filtering
it supports server-side processing for sorting filtering and paging

4369488
sorting	filtering
with an html table so you could send down a bunch of html and then have all the sorting filtering and paging work client-side

4369520
inline	inlining
while i believe that the jit prior to that will still inline small methods properties are simply methods after all there is a bug in the earlier frameworks that prevented inlining of methods that take or return value types

4369535
hide	show
i assume you have some other tags that have the specific image descriptions so you ll have to show hide them too

4369542
hide	show
clicking on the movie hide the conrols the status bar clicking again show the controls and the status bar comes back too

4369673
folder	directory
you probably need to check to see if the directory folder exists and if it doesn t then you need to create it on the ftp

4369685
post	get
be sure that it fits the http model of simple request reply get post processing

4369687
filesystems	fat
if you are talking about the sdcard with a fat filesystems i believe based on past recovery of an accidentally saved back picture edit that linux doesn t even try to write back to the same blocks of the filesystems

4369710
width	height
this will allow you to add url parameters for width and height on a fancybox by fancybox basis

4369783
width	height
how can i change the height and width of the slider as the window is resized

4369861
folder	directory
instead of looking in the project s bin debug folder it looks for it in the test s working directory c projects sap reapprovals testresults name_machine 2010-12-06 13_45_43 out

4369900
facade	memento
facade and memento

4369904
getter	setter
i d personally err on the side of caution and stick with the property setter and getter as potentially the method body might change and as a result the raw field access mutation may not be enough

4369926
button	checkbox
um they seem to work quite okay js fiddle demo except that without the position absolute the after content appears within the element itself inside the button or checkbox and so on

4369938
for-loop	loops
also on the first line is a typical for-loop for each item resulting from the sub-shell we loops once storing the value of the item in the variable kind

4369995
floating-point	fractions
firstly floating-point numbers use a base-2 internal representation in which it is impossible to represent some decimal fractions exactly

4369995
floating-point	integer	floating-point	fractions	integer	fractions
secondly the reason floating-point numbers are called floating-point is that instead of using a fixed precision for the integer part and a fixed precision for the fractions part they offer a continuous trade-off between magnitude and precision

4369995
integer	fractions
as the magnitude of the integral part increases the bits that were previously used for precision are now needed to store the larger integer value and so the accuracy of the fractions part is compromised

4369996
stateless	stateful
jsf is used often so you d have managed beans and probably stateless or stateful ejb s also

4370057
equals	tostring	equals	gethashcode	tostring	gethashcode
it should and it does override the object methods equals tostring and gethashcode

4370079

min	max
then i would like to sort the resulting list consisting of key value pairs from min to max depending on the 2nd element value

4370128
range	min	range	max	min	max
i am looking for a numeric spinner that has a property for incremental value .25 .5 .75 supports auto-rounding in case someone types in a value or an change event max and min range and support for custom images would be great

post	get
i can grab info and post it just fine however when i get to the point of uploading images it seems to work no runtime errors image in wp media tab however it uploads a broken image link

4370161
hide	show
maybe you could hide one view then show the other using a uiview animations block

4370178
uitableview	reloaddata
first off there s a reloaddata method on a uitableview which you can use to force it to reload its data

4370193
appfuse	spring
as a comment on the actual question i don t think either of the two is way better than the other in the actual entity generation but there is a big difference of course between appfuse and spring roo aside from the entity generation

4370193
appfuse	spring
if you actually need dao s this is something that comes out-of-the-box in appfuse and put partly in spring roo but there is also a great addon for spring roo hades addon that does a great job at this maybe even better than appfuse

4370193
wicket	appfuse
main reason to go for appfuse in my humble opinion is if you require another web framework ie wicket

4370193
jsf	tapestry
tapestry or jsf as front end then spring mvc or gwt as these are currently the only well supported web frameworks within spring roo more coming though like flex etc.

4370193
appfuse	spring
other reason you might go for appfuse is if you want to use an ide with full intellisense and code-completion support but don t want to use eclipse you can use other ide s and build works perfectly well with spring roo but due to the aspectj files which aren t recognized by netbeans other ide s then eclipse currently don t do code completion well for the spring roo generated managed files

4370206
x86	64bit
is there a standard program i can use to find out whether i m on an i386 or x86 32-bit or 64bit machine

4370223
division	subtract
with a little math think about integer division by 7 you can get the number of mon-thursday days in that range subtract the number of holidays that don t fall on the weekend from that number and you are done

4370236
avr	microcontroller
microcontroller pic msp430 avr assume these are not microcoded

4370239
range	min	range	max	min	max
i m currently using the data function to clamp the values out of range to the y axis min max but this displays misleading data

4370239
min	max
is there a way to make it draw the lines to the y axis max min point making it look like the line goes off the plot

4370253
loops	if-statement
your nested loops will execute if-statement many of them invalid because of wrong combinations of numbers

4370277
getter	setter
in this case an errant synthesize tableview at the top of the implementation file generating conflicting getter and setter

4370302
division	multiplication
firstly multiplication and division is actually quicker in some circumstances

4370324
google-chrome	firefox
i would get an extension like noscript for firefox or notscript for google-chrome

4370356
post	get
you re doing a post but your resource says that destroy_image is only available via get

4370413
boost	stl
you do not have to use an implementation file if you tell the vs wizard that you want to create an inline class it will only create the header file but typically that is only done for template classes the stl classes and many of the classes in the boost library or very simple classes

4370435
range	max
for operations which can possibly overflow the range of the variables you need to add checks for overflow and decide how to handle it - pin it at max store with a different scale raise an error etc

4370442
jax-ws	jax-rs
since then the java standards committee created a new api named jax-rs the rest counterpart to jax-ws

4370452
awt	swing
awt swing allows to show application modal blocking the whole application and parent modal blocking only the parents dialogs

4370464
int	double	int	chars
my core api class varies based on std vectors of built-in numeric types chars uchar short ushort int uint float and double

4370487
children	parent
you actually say you re looking for this count but only for nodes what are children of a main parent

4370490
children	parent
prior to the code in question i ve successfully created a parent and three children

4370509
getter	setter
blazeds will not serialize a property unless it has both a getter and a setter

4370519
min	max
min and max no

4370555
post	get
when i try to post this email name+1 domain.com i get name 1 domain.com in my model s property in the controller

4370658
jquery	simplemodal
i am using eric martin s simplemodal plugin 1.4.1 with jquery 1.4.2 to display basic form in a modal window

4370684
vbscript	jscript
i started out in vbscript but switched to jscript around 2003 and never looked back

4370687
apache	nginx
before phusion passenger allowed rails hosting with apache and nginx deploying a rails app was scary and difficult

4370687
apache	nginx
nginx is not as mature but is very efficient also very configurable and a great alternative to apache for rails hosting. webrick and mongrel are great for development but unless you are an expert it is difficult to set them up for production use

4370710
width	height
one thing i was thinking was surrounding the input with a div of the same width height and giving the div the hover background image and on hover fade the span out to opacity of something like 0.01 so that it would still be clickable but be transparent

4370722
getter	setter
this may also allow you to declare dummy getter setter that satisfy your other requirements without screwing up the jpa commits and retrieves

4370726
hex	binary
i am also using hxd hex editor to look at the binary

4370730
post	get
when you post a message you also return new messages and things shouldn t get out of order

4370783
accurev	cvs
the pulldown menu only has accurev cmvc cvs and clearcase so i specify a subversion project in the local location so it can auto-detect

4370791
apache	nginx
there are two ways around this either you run several ruby application servers and put a load balancer or reverse proxy in front of them nginx or apache in front of a pack of mongrels or thin servers the number of processes you run reflects the number of requests you will be able to handle in parallel

4370791
apache	nginx
or you run passenger which is an apache or nginx module that manages a pool of applications that can dynamically grow and shrink as the load changes

4370795
xdebug	xhprof
i know there is a way to achieve such a task with facebook s xhprof profiler but was hoping for a similar solution using xdebug

4370800
int	double
i need to pass an array to a function in c# where the array may be a string int or double and may be 1 to multiple dimensions

4370819
firefox	safari
browsers affected firefox and safari which use a back forward cache

4370819
firefox	safari
i ve used javascript in the past to force the form fields on a page to match the query string but there are issues with that approach firefox and safari don t normally execute the onload event for the window when loading a page from the cache and it seems like a hack to me

4370851
folder	directory
map a virtual directory on your website to your upload folder - on our sites we have upload on all our web servers mapped to an open share on a fileserver in our dmz

4370883
post	get
post value from index.php then get the value by self without refresh the page

4370894
udp	tcp
how much slower is tcp than udp

4370940
int	chars
a trivial compression would be a b c d e f and if the chars set is known beforehand and only those 6 chars you could even pack things into a 16-bit int

4370951
screens	mdpi
i ve been testing my application on a samsung moment which is an mdpi screens

4370951
screens	hdpi
today i went to test my application on a samsung epic 480x800 which is a hdpi screens

4371003
width	height
i have been searching for a solution to resize the text size in a div to make the text fill out the entire div height and width with no avail

4371003
width	height
so this is a simple div with a height and width set

4371003
width	height
this height and width does not change the text in the box does

4371003
width	height
so what i want to do is to make that text fill the whole width and height of the div just like in the image below

4371016
pop-up	dialog
currently at about 4 minutes of inactivity a jquery ui dialog pop-up warning the user of their impending timeout

4371044
fast-forward	merge
-- this is a fast-forward merge so no merge commit

4371136
getter	setter
it is nothing more than a getter setter for an object

4371142
getter	setter
it is just a method that defines getter and setter methods for instance variables

4371216
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop and on each loops i want to add a new line of text to the end of the file in question but every time it adds a new line it removes all the other text leaving just that line

4371247
children	parent
i have two lists parent children

4371247
children	parent
the children list has a one-to-one lookup column to the parent list

4371248
width	height
check this jsfiddle example it retuns width and height

4371344
udp	tcp
what you can do is deal with the problem in the same way tcp does over udp

4371396
hide	show
i am trying to switch out the show and hide functions of jquery for the hoverintent plugin

4371472
width	height
set path.data.transform to a scaletransform with scalex and scaley bound to the actual width and height

4371513
post	get
your delete page tries to access both _get id and _post id which won t ever both be set since an http request is always of a single method get or post or head etc

4371523
curlpp	libcurl
but you tagged this c++ so if you want a c++ wrapper for libcurl then use curlpp

4371574
put	get
this is also a bit of a hack but the only thing i could get working was to put an intermediate delegate on the nstextview s layer so that all selectors are passed through but drawlayer incontext then calls the nstextview s drawrect

4371574
nstextview	nscell
it might be worthwhile looking for an nscell backing the nstextview as it s probably a lot more appropriate to use this instead

4371596
dosbox	djgpp
it is not clear to me that dosbox supports dpmi but i imagine that it does and djgpp itself is in the dosbox compatability list so one would imagine that the code it generates might run also if it does not do anything too out of the ordinary to the emulated hardware

4371618
for-loop	loops
for a while loops it looks ok but even more messy for a for-loop or a foreach loops

4371619
required	placeholder
another option that doesn t required subclassing - leave placeholder blank and put a label on top of edit button

4371621
goto	break
you have to use goto to break out of multiple loop levels in c#

4371726
client-side	server-side
xmlhttprequest is used on the client-side in chrome webkit browsers to fetch server-side resources without page refreshing and content is dynamically loaded in and animations can be hooked in during that content being appended

4371734
client-side	server-side
as has been said a million times client-side validations are good because you can use them to keep well-behaved users from hitting your server with bad requests but every validation client-side must be mirrored server-side as well

4371755
put	get
i am trying to put a variable htmlcontent into a div element and refer to the divid to show on the thickbox but i am unable to get it working

4371828

4371842
rss	feed
retrieving rss content from url and parse it into rssfeed feed instance variable via getfeed string url

4371863
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
in my delegate i add a uinavigationcontroller s view to the window with a uiviewcontroller as rootviewcontroller

4371865
int	chars
a chars is essentially just an int so that means you want to subtract one from the chars and print it as a string.

4371865
ord	chr
if you don t know what the python functions ord and chr do look them up in the interactive interpreter using help ord and help chr .

4371896
rss	feed
what you want to do is obtain the rss feed in doinbackground and then update the ui in onpostexecute

4371908
put	get
the breakpoints i put on java code get hit but the ones i put on

4372051
mockups	prototyping	mockups	balsamiq
my suggestion instead is to prototype with an ria prototyping tool like balsamiq mockups or use a grid system like 960 grid to generate rapid prototypes then use a web development framework that allows your developers to run the code with or without the backend server

4372054
gmail	hotmail
how do i achieve this with php without having to pay for my own smtp server and without having to use my own gmail hotmail account

4372057

the problem is the semantics of set and bag

4372083
gmail	hotmail
how do i achieve this with php without having to pay for my own smtp server and without having to use my own gmail hotmail account

4372114
client-side	server-side
a server-side framework like asp.net mvc makes it very easy to handle requests a client-side framework like jquery makes it very easy to manipulate html and make ajax requests

4372154
queue	fifo
my goal is simple i want a fifo queue but if i insert an element and an element with a given key is already in the queue i want it the new element to replaced the one already in the queue

to convert between the two wrap an inputstream into a reader or an outputstream into a writer you need to choose a character set

4374090
outputstream	inputstream
i m feeling strange why not read out from outputstream but from inputstream

4374090
outputstream	inputstream
of course somewhere on the other end of the stream someone might treat your outputstream as their inputstream .

4374125
onmousedown	onkeydown
your first instinct might be to override the potentially relevant events exposed by the .net framework such as onmousedown onkeydown etc. and reset the selected length to 0 so that the text is immediately unselected after it is automatically selected

on another note which might be helpful to others it seems event delegation is only possible with firefox and not opera google-chrome or safari

4375847
portrait	landscape
for example if a 1024x768 splash image is used and the initial view doesnâ t support portrait viewing through orientation locks this can cause visual ui objects to appear off screen especially when animation is involved as the view will try and present itself in a portrait configuration even though the device may be in landscape

4375847
portrait	landscape

hide	show
if you need to only show certain elements based on what the user is doing then it s better to have everything and show hide the necessary bits

4376142
children	parent
if the headers match the divs in number and order and they are children of some parent without other siblings you might be able to make use of the jquery index method

4376168
width	height
the scrollviewer contains a user control which dynamically renders its contents based on an input object so may be of variable size - when it renders itself it sets the width and height of the user control to be the correct size

nunit	mstest
mstest or nunit are good unit testing frameworks

4376445
children	parent
if you want the text to remain when hovering children too put it on the parent instead of the like this

4376445
mouseover	mouseout
for all the other issues it s because mouseover and mouseout fire when entering children you re seeing the most common side-effect flickering with animations

4376445
mouseleave	mouseenter
instead use mouseenter and mouseleave ...or the shortcut .hover like this

4376474
google-chrome	firefox
it also seems that google-chrome supports a non-prefixed border-radius but firefox doesn t so i was wondering if i should only use

4376518

4376775
ant	maven
each ide has a different approach to things like deployment by plugins so you might be better off doing your deploy through ant or maven which can be called from the ide

4376826
hash	salt
store passwords as salt hash

4376843
for-loop	loops
if you re doing that within your for-loop then yes you are starting new processes every time through loops

4376847
versioning	upgrade
that s the biggest thing you need to be sure of -- keep an eye on drupal versioning and always upgrade when a security update is released

4376865
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox after a while the form gets submitted something like 10seconds and in ie it crashes

4376885
pbkdf2	hash
if the hash is computed with a large number of iterations with pbkdf2 and the encryption is a simple application of a password run through a single iteration of a hash function to get the key data then the encrypted value would actually be the weak point in terms of cpu cost

4376919
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if u already use a navcontroller please post your viewdidload and viewwillappear of the viewcontroller of tab 1

serializable	deserialization
i am referring to the following link for xml serializable deserialization

4377093
post	get
in general i recommend you to use httpclient for implementing http conversations in java anything more complicated than a simple one-time get or post

4377106
post	get
the third party tool makes an http post request to the webservice to get user information

4377154
versioning	upgrade
i can t upgrade the jquery versioning thus can t use live

4377160
ant	maven
the underlying build system used in spring roo is maven where jboss seam uses ant

4377160
ant	maven
seam can for as far as i know also be used with maven but seam-gen by default uses ant

4377160
jsf	seam
seam with seam-gen is mainly targetted for using jsf as the web framework while spring roo is focused on spring mvc and or gwt as its web framework

4377160
jsf	wicket	jsf	seam	wicket	seam
if you want to use jsf or wicket go for seam while if you want to use spring mvc or gwt use spring roo for other web frameworks it probably doesn t really matter which you choose though spring roo might then be a better solution

4377171
glut	fltk
fltk provides modern gui functionality without the bloat and supports 3d graphics via openglâ and its built-in glut emulation

4377196
folder	directory
what you need to realize is that this does not actually remove the source directory from the deployment but the output folder associated with that source directory

4377196
folder	directory
by default all source directory share the same output folder

4377196
folder	directory
if you remove one source directory from the deployment assembly in this situation you still get its classes since another source directory outputs to the same output folder and eclipse copies over the complete output folder completely disregarding which source folder contributed which classes

4377196
folder	directory
the solution is to associate an independent output folder which each source directory that you want to exclude

4377224
range	min	range	max	min	max
for instance looking for a level-12 weapon one would pick randomly an axe min 0 max 72 pick randomly of fire min 6 max 72 eliminate sharp min 24 max 72 pick randomly dull min 6 max 18 and then use a fudge value of 2 12 6 for the range

4377306
put	get
the idea of the http methods is that when a the characteristics of a request fit those of get put and delete you should use them

4377306
post	get
there are numerous hybrid approaches one of which is to post the query parameters and have the server create a new temporary resource that represents the query and then return a redirect so the client does a get on the temporary query resource

4377316
folder	directory
i m using visual studio 2008 and easyphp whose directory includes ext folder php extensions directory

4377368
octal	decimal
033 is an octal number in c because it has a leading 0 and that means its value is 27 in decimal

4377384
google-chrome	firefox
it is only supported by firefox and google-chrome so far but as usual the others will adopt it sooner or later read later

4377395
std	ostream
either add using std ostream

4377395
std	ostream
whatever you do don t be tempted to use either using std ostream

4377399
hide	show
this is the jquery code to show and hide an elements

4377432
google-chrome	firefox
install firebug on firefox or use google-chrome s built-in debugger - in both cases right click the div and select inspect element

4377445

in post handler i was expecting the command object to have all the properties that was loaded in get handler in addition to the properties that are bound with jsp

4377445
post	get
in post handler i was expecting the command object to have all the properties that was loaded in get handler in addition to the properties that are bound with jsp

4377475
put	get
in your case if you get rid of the scalar variables and just put the subqueries inline it should work

4377501
webclient	httpwebrequest
beyond that you just need to pick a data store to hold your processed data you can use any database technology for that and a way to download content from the web which .net provides two high-level mechanisms for the webclient and httpwebrequest httpwebresponse classes

4377551
google-chrome	firefox
it works totally fine in firefox and google-chrome but the background image and text don t display in ie8

4377564
octal	decimal	octal	hex
note 2 the lookup table would contain c escape sequences for codes that have them n r etc and backslash plus hex octal decimal codes for those that don t

4377612
uialertview	uipickerview
i am afraid it is not possible to pack uipickerview into uialertview

4377614

stay away from toy languages that encourage parsing text to do everything and languages who are weakly typed such as bash perl php javascript tcl c c++ python etc

4377643

how can i incorporate this kind of a look up into ssis 2008 in bids

4377659
postgresql	mysql
i found this post very useful - migrating django from mysql to postgresql the easy way

4377709
int	chars
i tend to store timestamps in int 10 format as a unix timestamp will always be 10 chars long

4377709
int	chars
it s recommended to use int instead of varchar or chars as when you use sql s order syntax it won t get the order incorrect

4377709
mktime	strtotime
say you want to convert from a date to a timestamp you could either use strtotime or mktime depending on what you re doing

4377713
width	height
however you may also consider sizing your child elements in updatedisplaylist which will always give you the the height and width of your container which i suspect is more important for sizing purposes than the screen resolution

4377740
temp	tmp
i have to store file paths in a db field tmp aaa bbb c temp xxx yyy etc.

4377755
associativity	operator-precedence
in particular it doesn t support several expression features and it doesn t add parentheses where required by operator-precedence associativity

4377755
associativity	operator-precedence
adds parentheses where required by operator-precedence and associativity is correctly regenerated

4377794
pull	push
with that parameter i could pull out the the information from the order model and then push it into a block which made a nice html formatted invoice

4377809
inherited	properties
on ui you can use inherited to not duplicate properties

4377809
inherited	properties
for example if you have a model with 10 properties but need to edit only 2 of them create editmodel and inherited viewmodel from it

4377810
cassini	iis
it has been working fine in dev and on a number of web servers running cassini and iis

4377827
hash	md5
each method that returns an a set of results you would them md5 the query to create a unique hash for that query you would then check to see if it exists in the cache if so you would return instead otherwise just run a new query fetching the results and then before you return them store them within the cache

4377876
pop-up	dialog
most people are used to seeing a save dialog pop-up when saving a document

4377888
joystick	keyboard	mouse	joystick	mouse	keyboard
there you can basically define which input events mouse keyboard joystick touchscreen are mapped to what actions

4377888
mouse	keyboard
for example if you want mouse and keyboard movement you have to add horizontal and vertical axis twice

4377888
mouse	keyboard
once for mouse input one for keyboard input

4377891
webclient	httpwebrequest
use webclient or httpwebrequest to retrieve the web page and query the results - including the response headers and status codes

4377895

4377948
integer	unsigned
can anybody please tell me which flag i have to use in order to make gcc ignore the comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions warning message

4377972
setinterval	settimeout
also i would use setinterval instead of settimeout

4377999
many-to-many	one-to-many
would the answer change if the relationship was one-to-many and many-to-many

4378046
stdout	stderr
presuming test_app is a program that outputs one line to stdout and one line to stderr

4378062
many-to-many	one-to-many
one-to-many can be modeled with a inside a while many-to-many is the only case in which having a mapping could be good since otherwise you would have to explore both objects to understand their mappings

4378128
many-to-many	one-to-many
this answer does not change if it s a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship

4378151
srp	principles
an object that can save itself to the database would violate srp single responsibility principles

4378181
hash	salt
if you don t use in app purchases you could set up your own authentication process and give a token to the device and have your server remember said tokens and then later only serve valid responses for requests that had the said token appropriately hash and salt

4378348
put	get
you can then put a feature condition on it to control whether the components brought in by the merge modules get installed or not

4378364
post	get
if you have to use webforms don t use the postback and page lifycycle model - have aspx pages with presenters for get requests and have a handler or empty aspx per post

4378400
orientdb	neo4j
my suggestion is to pick a java-based graph db like orientdb or neo4j and then use it via the php java bridge

4378400
orientdb	neo4j
in the near future neo4j and at some point orientdb as well should get native php support and you can replace the bridge with native access

4378432
loops	while-loop
this means your code to update the progress bar in the while-loop is holding the ui event lock and prevents other ui updates from happening until the while loops terminates -- in this case when thread.isrunning returns false

4378435
accelerometer	gyroscope
i have recently come across a few websites that seems to access the accelerometer or gyroscope on my laptop detecting changes in orientation or movement

4378443
set	bag
is it mapped as a bag or as a set

4378478
ssl	https
since you set ssl options you probably use https

4378484
disk	ram
nodexl does scale in part in proportion to the amount of ram disk and cpu available

4378534
google-chrome	safari
as you mention support is limited to google-chrome and safari at present

4378560
folder	directory
i created a .vim directory on my user folder c users username and extracted the plugin there

4378573
feedback	review
after the review is done this document is sent back to the student with proper feedback

4378575
folder	directory
change the name of wp-contents folder to something else and move it outside of the main wp directory

4378575
folder	directory
this code in your wp-config.php file will help to install in a directory and move wp-contents outside of it into an includes folder

4378580
put	get
my idea is if i get data with page load from server and put it in some array in javascript and as user click it get data from client side

4378627
mouseover	mouseout
the jquery menu is programmed to animate out on mouseover and collapse on mouseout

4378627
width	height
ul.inactive3 .stop .animate width 500px height 150px fast function

4378627
width	height
ul.inactive3 .stop .animate width 500px height 300px fast

4378627
width	height
ul.inactive3 .stop .animate width 500px height 150px fast function

4378627
width	height
ul.inactive3 .stop .animate width 0px height 0px fast

4378643
width	height
as you see it sets the background right top with some width and height with #af7a38 color background for the rest of column but what i want to do is to set another background instead of color for example setting this

4378656
pull	push
all development commit push pull merge is done in the individual subrepos

4378668
post	get
the problem is that the edit action takes a get not a post so it s probably never getting called

4378721
squash	branch	filtering	grouping
if it is just you using the repo or a select grouping of folks that you can easily communicate with then you can safely squash or filtering see below to clean up history and then when they fetch they ll need to manually reset all their branch heads to the new heads

4378732
switching	screens
but if for some reason you have to use a modalviewcontroller you could either just deactivate the tabbar while the modalview is shown or try to implement a switching or a simple if...else case in your viewwillappear where u check what screens to load

4378765
umask	chmod
in this case use 770 as the file permission and ensure that files created by php get this permission either explicitly after creating with chmod or with umask before creation

4378772
superclass	subclassing
that said i don t have any problem with throwing a superclass and its subclassing

4378778
rss	feed
what i have considered is creating an rss feed that is polled by the client and lets the client know when these particular areas need to be updated

4378778
rss	feed
the rss feed will be managed by a service that either polls the database for changes or iterates through a list of items that are queued up by the wcf requests made by the client

4378779
pull	push
in git each user has their own repo which is cloned from the central repo and they push and pull from the central repo which as philipp points out should be bare when you create it do git --bare init

4378779
pull	push
that repo should be shared of course but only so that people can push and pull from it

4378803
onchange	onsubmit
and if you use the onchange and not onsubmit setting the hidden input value when the combo changes not when the form is submitted the id attribute is useless too

4378817
folder	directory
this is possible if we manually create a filesystemwatcher and watch the parts directory here some dlls inside the folder and track any changes then we reflect the changes into a container which allows for recomposition

4378832
children	parent
you can get all of the children of the element s parent and exclude the element itself

4378834
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql offers to write expression into order by clause in sql query

4378837
rss	feed
i am trying to parse live weather data from weatherbug s rss feed in php

4378840
single-quotes	double-quotes
if you use single-quotes instead of double-quotes the dollar sign won t be evaluated

4378840
single-quotes	double-quotes
generally speaking you should get in the habit of using single-quotes unless you really need double-quotes for something such as escaped hex values

4378849
x86	64bit
x86 64bit 00000000004004c0 main

4378849
x86	64bit
x86 64bit -duse_shiftor 080483a0 main

4378858
rss	feed
but if the expensive operation is the client pooling the server you can use an atom or rss feed with pubsubhubbub to minimize the number of requests to the server

4378894
pull	push
i ve been reading things about push pull etc

4378905
rss	feed
with an rss feed you ll have to make a request for the feed get it parse it and take action based on the relevant values

4378912
width	height
all other attributes should be grouped by their impact - appearance related background foreground opacity etc. layout related height width aligments etc

4378912
width	height
not to have width in top of your attributes list and height somewere in the bottom

4378919
put	get
if you really want to fail graciouslly no matter what then yes put a nested try inside the except clause - but log the full traceback otherwise it can get really hard to debug

4378942
config	ini
if nothing exists at the above registry location i proceed to reading config at the standard location whether that s an ini file or another reg key does not matter

4378944
onchange	onsubmit
basically handle the onsubmit action of the form or the onchange of the dropdown list --both will work and change the form s action based on the value of the drop down list

4378952
children	parent
after all i assume the different children are all reading different slots so if you need to prevent them treading one ach other s toes you ll need to do the same for the parent too

4378952
children	parent
when it gets signalled the parent checks if he can write and the children check if they can read

4379006
hide	show
in the above we re using .toggle bool to do the hiding showing this allows us to hide show the depending on whether the checkbox we care about is checked

4379010
folder	directory
i tried to place the file in the main project repository folder and in the working directory

4379044
svg	vml
i would recommend using either svg if you can limit yourself to browsers that support it or a drawing api like raphaã l to abstract support over svg and vml for ie

4379084
width	height
what i am trying to do here is stretching an image to fit the page in height and width

4379090

4379401
serializable	deserialization
i would suggest creating a wrapper over membershipusercollection for your serializable deserialization purpose

4379419
rss	feed
i don t know if it s a bit too much for what you re wanting but websvn gives you an rss feed that you can then subscribe to in an rss reader

4379419
rss	feed
that way you just need to monitor the rss feed

4379469
post	get
when i need to store information between a get and a post that is set something on a get and read it back on a post i set a session attribute

4379540
iprincipal	iidentity
fortunately httpcontext itself is fakeable just enough for you do replace the iprincipal user and iidentity

4379588
richtextbox	tabcontrol
there does not seem to be a newtabadded type event for tabcontrol and the initialized event for the richtextbox does not seem to even make it to the code behind in the view

4379665
jar	war
figured it out just missing classes in the ejb jar in myproject s war web-inf lib folder

4379704
getter	setter
one thing you might be seeing is the magic getter and setter in the zend framework

4379760
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome as well as safari has really underestimated developer tools feature

4379773
filtering	grouping
i can also filtering by the grouping - but that s not what i want

4379812
datagridview	xtragrid
i am looking for a free or very cheap alternative to the datagridview one that looks more like what i see on ads for xtragrid

4379819
int	double
your problem is probably due to type conversion from native .net types int double datetime etc. in your calling c# code to the oracle types number date used to store the values in the database

4379831
integer	unsigned
a simple and fast way is to use an unsigned integer as a cursor and shift it to advance the cursor

4379895
yacc	bison
i can t use lex flex and yacc bison

4379907
gridview	sqldatasource
edit i should note that i am using the sqldatasource for the outer gridview as it is also editable

4379930
folder	directory
by default it tries to create a directory and store a file in the currently logged in user s applicationdata folder

4379937
put	get
just to be more clear i need to check a directory for any file that ends in recipient or otherwise put if i were to use ls if a file with that name exists then i need to get its name

4379952
int	chars
i also belive that in the for-loop you are changing the pointer value itself and that would make only the first chars of s to be tested when testing the other chars of s search_chars will always be equal to 0 try using an int like len on the for-loop as well

tabcontrol	tabitem
use an eventsetter in the itemcontainerstyle for the tabcontrol to perform some logic when each tabitem loads

4379995
.htaccess	httpd.conf
personally i think the best place to put the addtype directive would be in apache s httpd.conf as .htaccess puts a performance hit on your server but in the case of shared hosting .htaccess is usually the only option available

4380034
getter	setter
then have your standard property getter and setter

gridview	repeater
use a repeater for your outer databound control as it renders more efficiently and it will have the same effect you re trying to achieve with the outer gridview control

4380181
gridview	repeater
in your code behind retrieve your data for your outer gridview which is now a repeater and load it into a datatable and add it to a dataset do the same for data in the inner gridview

4380215
margin	height
another way is to use math and do calculation of the height of grid row and control and position it by margin

4380235
implements	extends
remember that an interface doesn t implements anything and so in deriving one interface from another you re merely extends the contract that must be implements by implements classes

gridview	objectdatasource
i believe the gridview s sort is intended to work with something like an objectdatasource which knows to call a method to retrieve the data and pass a sort string into that method

4380559
try-catch	exception-handling
however a method definition will be placed outside the standard try-catch so you have to handle the exception-handling yourself

4380569
ceil	floor
the very best you can to is type cast to int or use php rounding functions like round floor or ceil

4380570
try-catch	exception-handling
in the short term you can change the declaration of the md5hash method in the second snippet to throw nosuchalgorithmexception that way you do without the try-catch and don t eat the exception-handling

4380570
try-catch	exception-handling
by the way the try-catch is not just useless it is potentially harmful since you could have a problem and not get notified about it because of the exception-handling getting eaten

4380579
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to get rid of an exception that makes the library partially work on firefox and completely die in google-chrome

4380719
google-chrome	firefox
i thought that binding the click event in javascript is done by using node.onclick and google-chrome firefox seem to agree with me but i saw it written .onclick here 4 times by 3 people so it can t be a typo and i doubt that it s a coincidence

123ll a signed long long a 64bit or 128bit value depending on the environment

4380759
onresume	onpause
i m guessing that the behavior you are seeing is related to the lifecycle of the activities within android and you might need to move some of your processing to the onresume onpause or onstart onstop methods

4380824
ssl	https
even if you tried to put the login block in an iframe that uses https a man-in-the-middle attack might change the src of that iframe easily so you either make the loginbox a login link with https login page or you will need more resources to run your website with ssl for all webpages that has the login box .

4380825
svg	vml
it uses vml in ie but svg in all other browsers

4380825
svg	vml
as the op said you can grab the raw svg as it s a whole svg doc and download that he is looking for some similar functionality with vml

4380840
innodb	myisam
myisam doesn t support many of the enhanced data validation facilities supported by engines like innodb so you are generally at a disadvantage by starting with myisam

4380947
width	height
what is the best way to ensure that the content of an s richeditabletext in flex will always fit in the specified width and height by shrinking or increasing the font size dynamically

4380947
width	height
i tried to come up with an equation with number of letters width height it s alright but it s not a 100 reliable because the characters widths are different so in some cases it doesn t apply very well

4380960
width	height
use a second div whose css position is fixed and whose width and height is equal to the window.innerheight window.innerwidth properties respectively

4381040
disk	ram
i know it reduces the size of the disk file -- what i m interested in here is that actual ram used

4381177
stdout	stderr
if significant output is being written to stdout and or stderr or you re both reading and writing to the process

4381177
stdout	stderr
however it s when system buffers for any of stdin stdout or stderr fill up that blocking becomes likely and things can get more involved

4381177
stdout	stderr
if the child process fills up the stderr and or stdout buffers it ll likely block and wait for you to clear them

4381177
stdout	stderr
but if you re waiting for the process finish before you read from stdout or stderr

4381177
stdout	stderr
both stdout and stderr are monitored concurrently

4381177
stdout	stderr
if you re writing to stdin and reading from stdout a pipe you ll want to keep stdout and stderr clear and only write to stdin when its ready to receive input

4381177
stdout	stderr
simply waiting for the process to finish then reading stdout stderr probably works 90 of the time

4381240
vb.net	vb6
vb6 com components require sta threading which by default your vb.net apps will not run as

4381270
rvm	bundler
i have tried running bundler and also using rvm to install sqlite3 and i still have the same issue

4381281
openssl	gnutls
so i should be using openssl and not see gnutls

4381456
pull	push
let the worker fetch a request from the queue using a req rep connection and have it send the answer along with the original envelope when the processing is done using the same socket as above or even better through a separate push pull connection

4381459
boost	stl
could you possibly use stl boost containers holding smart pointers boost shared_ptr to get round the problem that your classes must be none-copy constructable and non-copy assignable

4381466
accessor	properties
it is my understanding with the modern runtime this will not only synthesize the accessor for my properties but also the instance variable itself so i could then say in one of this class s methods and it would work just as if i d declared an instance variable

4381466
accessor	properties
i know there are sometimes when i want to keep a variable private and not give access to it externally but then i usually just declare the properties in my private class extension or i don t create a properties for it at all if i don t need accessor for it

4381515
for-loop	arrays
to enforce a particular order for your output just replace in your for-loop with an arrays of the object properties in the order you want to display them in your case

4381550
width	height
you might want to just set the height and width of the img tag in html to 100

curlpp	libcurl
curlpp is just a wrapper over libcurl it doesn t dictate which ssl implementation libcurl uses

4381615
openssl	gnutls	curlpp	gnutls	curlpp	libcurl	gnutls	libcurl
am not exactly sure how you ve come to the when i switch to curlpp it uses gnutls instead of openssl conclusion but i suspect that you have multiple libcurl.so installed the one libcurl uses and another that your app is using via curlpp

4381641

for every event mouseenter mouseleave click etc. on my svgs produced by raphael

4381742
hex	binary
it s easier to go the other way â convert the binary data to a hex string for comparison

4381742
hex	binary
even if you prefer converting to binary sscanf ... 2x... is better than manually parsing hex numbers

4381759
junit	mockito
however if i right-click a single test function and choose run as - junit test i get an exception java.lang.nosuchmethoderror org.mockito.mockito.doanswer lorg mockito stubbing answer

4381759
junit	mockito
best i can think of is if eclipse is trying to help me by providing an outdated mockito artifact i m using 1.8.5 in my maven dependencies for the junit plugin akin to how the maven plugin can stick you with an oddball version of the maven runtime for certain tasks

4381802
ant	maven
building another maven but with more flexible support on top of ant using beanshell mostly is something i ve done already

4381821
mdpi	hdpi
i can put all the resources in res drawable however i want the hdpi versions to appear instead of the mdpi versions which i believe is the default for res drawable

you can time the difference in time between mouseup and mousedown events and react to the resulting timespan ranges

4381862
ironruby	ironpython
it doesn t really look like anything you ve ever used in .net unless you used ironpython or ironruby

qapplication	qcoreapplication
there is a signal from qcoreapplication inherited by qapplication called abouttoquit that is fired immediately before the application terminates

4381930
client-side	server-side
just because you re used to persisting data server-side doesn t mean it wouldn t be better to persist it temporarily at least client-side

4381939
client-side	server-side
realistically i think the notes ought to be saved server-side and client-side and kept in sync.

4382060
hide	show
to do it manually you ll need to manually modify classes and show hide ul visibility

4382086
google-chrome	firefox
here is a link to the page that looks nice and uniformed in google-chrome and firefox bt all over the shop in ie

4382091
range	min	range	minimum	range	max	min	max	minimum	max
where max and min are the maximum and minimum absolute values of the real and imaginary components and alpha and beta are two constants which are chosen to give a reasonable error distribution over the range of interest

4382115
ienumerable	ilist
because the ilist interface does not derive from the generic ienumerable but rather the non-generic version of ienumerable you can t use many of the extension methods on the enumerable class in the system.linq namespace

4382115
ienumerable	ilist
however if you know that the non-generic ilist implementation contains only implementations of ivendors then what you can do is call the cast extension method on ienumerable like so

4382122
background-image	background-color
to fix the problem one have to do one from the things 1 remove ui-widget-content class 2 use background css style instead of background-color 2 use background-image none together with the background-color style

4382129
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i currently have it set to 4ms per write and 2ms per read and this fixes it completely in older firefox google-chrome with http uploads and opera

dbcontext	objectcontext
even using objectcontext instead of dbcontext i can t figure out how this simple test scenario can be recreated without manually cleaning up any mock test objects created

4382139
dbcontext	objectcontext
is there another method or manner of using dbcontext and or objectcontext in order to rollback during unit tests

4382173

the shell script would check for the presence of the file and then invoke the mvn plugin using the maven pom.xml directory - which can be obtained and passed to the shell script via the maven environment variables

4382213
svg	vml
it is a js library for drawing diagrams on a svg vml canvas

4382286
width	height
you can constrain it any way you wish such as only selecting one that would result in sub-rectangles of at least a certain minimum width or height or no bigger than some amount

4382286
width	height
in the sample code in my answer it s defined as the center point â 1 3 of the width and height of the outer rectangle but basically any interior point would work to some degree

4382290
hide	show
my problem is that i want to hide this screen after 5 seconds and show the welcome screen of the app

4382306
stdout	stderr
is there are configuration way to do this rather than redirecting the stderr and stdout file streams within the command

4382326
filesystems	hfs	filesystems	ntfs
in order to rename the file in a case-retaining case-insensitive filesystems like hfs or ntfs you ll need to do it in two steps

4382336
try-catch	exception-handling
so i would like to use a try catch statement to figure out what possible unhandled exception-handling might be being thrown meaning i d encase the main method in a try-catch and if an exception-handling is thrown print to the command line a message

4382351
superclass	subclassing
searching on the superclass collection will find subclassing objects and i guess that even though you explicitly searched the resource collection the actual object you found was a video

4382353
uitableview	uipickerview
i m trying to setup a ui with a uipickerview that s populated based on the selected row in a uitableview

4382373
prepare	execute
if this identical prepare query though with different parameters each time will only be execute once for each of these different users is there any potential performance gain from using a prepare query

4382373
prepare	execute
this would avoid making two trips to the db one to check the validity of the prepare query and the other to actually execute the query

4382416
exponent	modulo
i have coded fast exponentiation algorithm to check if the encrypted value is equal to the original value for a given exponent e and modulo base n

4382473
width	height
the canvas is 200px width and 30px height

post	get
rafe kettler s answer is correct but it seems you have managed to get a 0 0 0 after adding it to b according to your post

4382493
mouseleave	mouseenter
also note the similar mouseenter and mouseleave methods

4382559
int	double
doesn t work well in the int case with float and double yes

4382565
mouseout	mouseenter
there is a reason to use mouseenter vs mouseout - it has to do with nested elements

4382587
put	get
when the select option starts jquery sends this to a php file which will open the proper file and get the correct contents out of file and put them into a different select statement

4382652
versioning	upgrade
when i build and run qt the old versioning of the .ui is what is shown without my feature upgrade

4382794
int	chars
incidentally you re trying to assign a string more than one chars to an int

4382831
google-chrome	safari
it seems that google-chrome and safari which use stylesheet.innertext run incredibly slow on larger stylesheets

4382835
int	double
my issue is if the user puts in 10 11.1 12.2 those are taken as int double double and not the float that i require the assignment says the 3 sides must be float values

4382835
int	double
so how can i convert each input into a float regardless of if it s an int or double when inputted

4382852
ready	each
so each call into the unmanaged .dll first calls getinstance if the instance is null it initialises it and reloads everything if not it assumes its ready to go

right now i have this working well in ie decent in google-chrome and not so well in firefox

4382906
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i havent seen any good answer for this but though my own work figured out the following code should work for styling a hr to look consistent in firefox safari google-chrome and ie not sure if it works below ie7

4382907
opera	google-chrome
browsers other than webkit accept the html selector so i use that for all other browsers annoyingly using html works in opera but not google-chrome and using body works in google-chrome but not opera..

4382912
min	max
expr between min and max

4382912
min	max
if expr is greater than or equal to min and expr is less than or equal to max between returns 1 otherwise it returns 0

4382912
min	max
this is equivalent to the expression min expr and expr max if all the arguments are of the same type

4382923
inherited	properties
i also changed the way you get the value from a properties to a method and even used inherited

4382972
typeerror	attributeerror
if the method was t implemented you ll get an attributeerror if it s not there at all or a typeerror if something by that name is there but it s not a function or it didn t have that signature

4382972
typeerror	attributeerror
catching attributeerror and typeerror is important in a lot of situations actually

4382985
for-loop	loops
if you want to use the cycle as it is you could try rendering the entire list of objects in your template and then have your template do a for-loop over them - instead of doing a loops in your code

4382989
post	get
after reading the zend documentation and some post here i could not figure out how to get my user role out of a user table

4383012
post	get
get top 20 cities and include the top rated post highest rating

4383021
post	put
the data i am receiving seems to be fine because if i simply put the post data from my webserver logfile inside a file with my hex-editor on my mac the png will work

4383038
spaces	delimiter
the words are delimiter by a spaces

4383048
min	max
the min max dot products for the would then be

4383048
min	max
so the min max pair for this normal is -5 5 as are all the others in this case due to symmetry

4383048
min	max
from my understanding i need to shift the min max pairs by the projection of the given axis onto it s global position

4383048
min	max
this means that the adjusted min max values would be 15-5 15+5 10 20 which is correct

4383064
nunit	mspec
i generally would recommend against converting from mspec to nunit

4383064
nunit	mspec
when introducing people to mspec i like to start with a classic nunit personrepositorytester.testaddnewperson fixture convert it over to a more bddish fixture like the one below and then show them how mspec can help to reduce language noise and introduce readability + better reporting

4383085
gif	png
can it be due to php generated image and not png jpg gif extension

4383131
jar	war
since you said that you place it in your src file then you just need to make sure it gets packaged into your jar or if you are using a war then place it under web-inf classes

4383131
jar	war
the advantage of this is that anywhere your jar war goes the file goes and you don t ever have to worry about the file location because the classloader reads relative to the source of the archive file

4383144
multiplying	add
multiplying by the truth value usually works and then you simply add the values together

4383169
redhat	fedora
if you are using gnome on redhat centos or fedora ensure that the run command as login shell option is checked under the title and command tab in profile preferences

4383201
spaces	delimiter
or change your token delimiter with note the spaces

4383203
pop-up	dialog
this may pop-up the certificate dialog box for the user

4383204
typedef	struct
many people who use the symbol defined by the typedef feel it more natural because often they come from other languages c++ c# ... where there s no need for the struct thing

4383204
typedef	struct
in many cases they even omit the struct name from the declaration and just leave the typedef name

4383205
post	get
i believe you should not be using urls routes to achieve this type of functionality - you are far better off passing this kind of data as post or get i prefer the former its heaps tidier to the controller and then sorting out the business logic from there

4383217
post	get
let me know how this works and if you get any errors post them here

4383239
calloc	malloc
when you use calloc instead of malloc it zeroes out all the memory you requested

4383245
robocopy	rmdir
if you have the xp resource kit you can use robocopy to move all the old directories into a single directory then use rmdir to delete just that one

4383247
int	double
but then when you try to add 0.5 to it it says it s a double but it truncates the decimal part like an int

4383249
folder	directory
maybe you should copy the entire developer folder somewhere first then do the official uninstall then try just restoring that applications directory

4383282
for-loop	loops
it prevents errors from creeping in you forgot to i++ in the for-loop that could cause loops to malfunction

4383285
dictionary	map
if you want to use for to loop over a non-array ordered sequence a map dictionary then you have to write the code a little differently

4383292
typedef	struct
while it s up to you whether you use a typedef or the struct name there is a very good reason not to use typedef names ending in _t

4383308
button	checkbox
it seems the currently plausible work-around is setting the label in the code which i prefer not to do as i plan on including more button checkbox etcetera and that would become a hassle to look at

4383340

package - build the target artifact jar war ear etc

4387996
maven	pom.xml
from the above it should be clear that specifying hibernate3 as a dependency in your maven pom.xml will instruct maven to go off and look in your local repository for the necessary jar files that make up hibernate

4388004
scheme	racket
alternatively you could target racket which supports parallel constructs and would make it very easy to target from your scheme system

4388366
ubuntu	linux
this occurs severely on firefox linux ubuntu

4388384
uiview	calayer
yes one could use a uilabel here and get drop shadow properties to set but that wouldn t be as performant since any uiview subclass such as uilabel wraps a calayer object and is going to be heavier performance wise

4388479
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
this should work in opera ie firefox and google-chrome

4388609

4388964
disk	ram
when the size of the memory mapped file however increases there is still enough ram to cache it when the server is running the system at times virtually grinds to a halt as it seems the operating system linux in my case consumes a lot of resources synchronizing the file with the disk

4388985
maven	m2e
there are lots maven document but some of them pushing you away like this from using m2e

4388985
maven	m2e
by simply entering a groupid into the query field m2e queries the repository indexes and even shows a version of the artifact that is currently in my local maven repository

4389000
maven	pom.xml
if they are proprietary you can manually install jar to your local repository using maven you can use your version suffixes group names artifactid etc and then use them in your pom.xml

4389007
hash	salt
the only vulnerability with salting is that you need to know what the salt is in order to reconstruct the hash for testing the password

4389008
salt	md5
in addition to providing salt or seed the md5 is a complex hashing algorithm which uses mathematical rules to produce a result that is specifically not reversable because of the mathematical changes and dataloss in throughput

4389014
hash	md5
md5 or better put hash algorithms in general are used to safely store passwords in database

4389016
ant	maven
is there anyway i can merge this xml file and a .properties file using maven or is this a task best left to ant

4389039
inherited	properties
the vbcrepository inherited from a vbcrepositorybase class that in tern implements the ivbcrepository and defines a properties session

4389041
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
if you use the crypt function it allows you to specify a string to hash a method to encrypt in some cases and a salt

4389041
hash	salt
returns a hash and salt password ready for storage

4389047
hash	salt
salting prevents this because then a part of the input value to the hash is controlled and so tables have to be compiled for that particular salt

4389047
hash	salt
so practically you store a salt and a hash value and authenticate by hashing a combination of the salt and the password and comparing that with your hash value

4389052
getter	setter
the getter and setter are actually methods and not fields

4389052
getter	setter
however the compiler at least the microsoft one will optimize this code and make the method call to the getter and setter inline so that the performance between the property and using a public field is the same

4389058
salt	md5
your example is almost good except your application needs to be able to regenerate the md5 using the same salt every time

4389058
hash	salt
your example appears to use one of the random salt which will fail 2 of 3 times if you try to compare a users password hash to something input

4389067
min	max
reduce the number of data points using min max avg before you display them

4389068
typedef	struct

4389068
typedef	struct
but i have found few examples with typedef struct

4389068
typedef	struct
i would greatly appreciate any additional detail about the correct usage of __attribute__ aligned with a typedef struct

4389070
roxygen	vignette
within r i can run through the example in the roxygen vignette

4389078
hash	md5
if everyone just takes their passwords and hash them with md5 then my hash table is good for any set of password hash i can get my hands on

4389078
hash	salt
the data for the salt could be stored right beside the password and even if i get both it doesn t help me get the password back since i still have to essentially brute force the hash separately for every single user - i can t form a single rainbow table to attack all the hash at once

4389088
ant	maven
you may use ant for merging and invoke the task from maven

4389096
getter	setter
getter and setter for dependencyproperties should only call getvalue and setvalue because xaml doesn t use them they are only for convenience

4389119
put	get
we want to use c# to get the idle time for the system across all sessions and put the machine to sleep if nobody is using the machine for x minutes

fcntl	fork
if what you re testing is only reading not seeking or writing or doing fcntl and stuff or only writing then it is quite possible to realize this by using a pipe and fork

4389375
pthreads	fork
i ve never done this in windows but i suppose it should be possible as both pipe and fork are pthreads

4389392
children	parent
said another way parent can have multiple children as in the case of invoice parent and lineitems childs

4389799
hebrew	polish
generally speaking i will test in german polish hebrew or arabic and an asian language japanese chinese korean

4389799

4389806
versioning	upgrade
solution upgrade jira versioning

4389809
put	get
from a security perspective if you put your xml file on your site and i can guess discover the filename i can get the file and i now know all your sites what servers they are on and a set of ports on the server that are open that i might be able to use to attack and take control of the servers

unless there is something funky about the getter or setter methods their bodies will be inlined so that they are as fast as doing field assignments

4395104

put	get
note that this approach does not work because i don t want a map in the put method and the get method returns just this null

on top of that fink gives you access to more packages than macports

4396850
children	parent
the problem is that the parent property of frameworkelement is of dependencyobject which has no notion of children

hash	salt
a good rule of thumb is to use a salt that is the same size as the hash output so you ll have two 40-character columns one for salt and one for the hash

4404318
hash	salt
3 store the salt in a different field with the hash

4404325

he has an app with two view controllers in mainwindow.xib a uiviewcontroller and a uitabbarcontroller

4404570
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	hide	show
when the user logs in it uses some technique to hide the uiviewcontroller and show the uitabbarcontroller

uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
when the button is tapped it removes the uitabbarcontroller from the superview and shows the login uiviewcontroller

this my code which works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

4405249

note that keydown and keyup provide a code indicating which key is pressed while keypress indicates which character was entered

the total width of the element is width + border + padding + margin so when you set the width on the to be 100 it sets the content width to 300px but the total width is that 300px plus the default borders which causes it to exceed the 300px width of the

4405506
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
you ll could accommodate these borders in the using padding margins but a better solution would be to set the box-sizing property on the to border-box to force the width property to define the total width of everything up to and including the border of the element

helpers	actioncontroller
everything seems to be working except form_for helpers which genererates a form tag with actioncontroller instead of action rails controller

there are pyqt4 and pyside both qt there s pygtk gtk wxpython wxwidgets and more

4406526
width	height
the easiest way is probably to animate a change to the frame property and increase the width and height there rather than try to work out the complexities of a transformation based around the center point

4406533
opera	firefox
it further seems that when you use absolute positioning tricks to set the height of the table firefox and opera interpret this as if you ve set an explicit height even though you haven t

google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox and kinda works in google-chrome

4406651

4406733
children	parent
there seems to be a short lag after parent already started to fade out and before children actually follow

4406743
qstring	qtextedit
i must add that it would probably be a better design to store just the richtext data in bbb as a html qstring as opposed to the qtextedit itself

4406768

4406973
qtextedit	qtextdocument	qstring	qtextdocument	qstring	qtextedit	qstring	qbytearray
for reading back the qbytearray store it into a qstring see qstring fromutf8 and use qtextdocument sethtml to display the content into the qtextedit widget

4407159
pull	push
now when the other developer has new work done and want to push 10 git will refuse this push since the f commit in the central repository is not an ancestor of any commits in the developers repository and git now forces the developer to pull f from the central repository 11

4407159
pull	push
you can do corrections in a clone of live website and then push these changes into path to staging which then distributes your changes back to live website but do not push into live website which cause git to screw up your index nor do pull your clone changes in there because then you may need to merge different development histories from your clone and path to staging in live website which is definitely not what you want

4407204

the header file is uitableviewcontroller i ve declared four nsmutablearrays and i ve given them properties set up getter and setter

4409252
int	chars
i decided not to use size_t structure instead just assigned int and chars types so i know exact value of bytes to read out

i solved by removing the checkbox and adding 2 radio button

4410306
rss	feed
especially as you ll presumably need to load the rss feed in its entirely anyway.

fgetc	getline	fgetc	fread
so does a getline function that uses fread block i o instead of fgetc character i o exist

4411345
fgets	fgetc
it s a fgetc -based approach but it has an interesting discussion of the alternatives starting with how bad gets is then discussing fgets

4411345
fgets	getline
so does a getline function that s based on fgets and doesn t truncate the input exist

4411378
fgets	getline
it is definitely possible to provide 100 of the semantics of gnu-style getline including embedded null bytes using purely fgets but it requires some clever thinking

client-side	server-side
to which you calmly respond no that s 1 10th the network traffic because 9 times out of 10 the requested resources are already sitting in your client-side browser cache and when they re not it s 1 10th the server s computational resources since they re sitting in a server-side cache and when they re not there either we avoid stampeding with a smart cache on the server .

4412077
width	height
i have some images that are 48 pixels or greater in height and 48 pixels or greater in width

4412077

4412288
ubuntu	linux
the commentator also claims that when using apc opcode caching the speed difference between the two is completely irrelevant. regarding the actual implementation of require and require_once this indicates that either the os ubuntu linux in my case or apache is caching or knows the results of the previous stat calls so it doesn t bother repeating them. take that for what it is worth

my program calculates x-acceleration and y-acceleration of velocity as well as taking to account the maximum height reached the total time it takes to reach the final point and the angle of the projectile launched

4412379
filtering	grouping
i have also used one of the ways to find max per grouping and that is to join a table on itself and filtering out a row for which there are no records that have a bigger id for a same name

4412415
projectile	angle
if it is a tail wind it will add a certain ammount of velocity over time until it reaches the max velocity that the tail wind can contribute to the projectile itself and the same is almost true for head wind except that at a certain angle with certian horizontal speeds of projectile a head wind of high enough speed may reverse the horizontal velocity

viewmodel	caliburn.micro
if you have a property on your dialog viewmodel which is another viewmodel type and you add a contentcontrol to your dialog view which is named the same as this property then caliburn.micro will automatically inject the view which corresponds to your property viewmodel type into the contentcontrol placeholder and bind that viewmodel type to the view automatically too

getter	setter
should i bother with making class members private and implementing getter and setter functions

4413161
getter	setter
the question is will an employer want to see getter and setter or will that just clutter things up

4413196
min	max
so in that particular case it will evaluate if that s true it ll set s to d 2 - max - min else it ll set s to d max + min

getter	setter
i like to make the properties in my class protected or private and then use getter and setter

4413220
getter	setter
i don t want once again to repeat the argument that even that you don t expect inheritance now you may still need it in the future but they are still more reasons to use getter and setter

4413220
getter	setter
getter and setter will let you easily implement validation of your properties

4413220
getter	setter
if i ran into a code file that didn t use getter and setter i would be very skeptical about it and would have to read it carefully many times

4413220
getter	setter
do you want to have getter and setter for some classes you need them and not for some others

4413220
getter	setter
there are tools that can autogenerate writing the getter and setter for you

the html5 geolocation api works in never browsers safari google-chrome firefox though it requires some kind of location service on the computer

4421228
hash	md5
i would go with md5 with hash that changes on interval

4421284
jobs	cron
also take note that apache is running as a particular user and that s usually not root which means the cron jobs can only be changed for the apache user unless given crontab -u privilege to the apache user

4421306
typedef	typename
so my question is why do compilers still need the typename keyword even in unambiguous situations such as when we use typedef and new

4421306
typedef	typename
unless c++ allows us to write typedef 5 five or typedef t value t_value where t value is value the presence of typedef itself removes all ambiguities and so typename seems to be an unnecessary requirement by the standard in such situations

4421311
gridview	rowdatabound
in asp.net we can handle the rowdatabound event of the gridview control

4421312
translation	localization
this will prevent localization guys from modifying them removing bolded text from cjkv translation

4421330
associativity	operator-precedence
the order of execution is determined by operator-precedence and associativity

4421338
post	put
i know it sounds like i m trying to breach my own privacy but of course i would put some exceptions to the user history that i post on the web

4421458
accelerometer	gyroscope
i would like to use gps but even accelerometer and gyroscope if it s possible

4421458
accelerometer	gyroscope
gps + accelerometer + gyroscope

4421518
int	double	int	chars
i usually pick references for everything other than the built-in data types chars int bool double etc.

4421529
submit	submission
it s worth noting though that this is also visible in the html source of the submission page even if you use post to submit the form

4421570
jobs	cron
i had similiar problem for which i didn t want to couldn t use cron jobs

4421582
post	get
inspect get post requests

4421609
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome this sidebar seems to be absolutely fine displaying on the right as it should

4421610
keyup	mouseup
you ll have to handle keyup and mouseup events for the whole document and write some code to compare the current selection with the previous selection from when the event handler last ran

4421634
mouse	keyboard
you could attach a mouseup event listener and a keypress listener respectively for mouse and keyboard selections and then use window.getselection to tell if any text is selected

4421641
simplecursoradapter	convertview
i m not sure maybe the simplecursoradapter version in the phone checks that the convertview parameter you are passing is of the correct type

4421641
simplecursoradapter	convertview
if you want to try an easier way to solve the problem but less optimal you can always pass the convertview parameter to the simplecursoradapter as null

4421668
post	put
here s a post i put in the devexpress forum but i don t think my issue is with their control rather with my databinding syntax

4421671
centos	linux
there is centos 5.5 oracle 11g release 1 oracle application server 10g release 3 10.1.3.2.0 for linux x86

4421683
qtkit	audiotoolbox
the second one would be to switch to a lower level framework from qtkit to audiotoolbox

4421683
qtkit	audiotoolbox
audiotoolbox isn t as straightforward as qtkit but it offers a clean solution to your problem

4421693
post	get
get will allow you to bookmark the url with the submitted parameters post will not

4421693
hash	md5
as for what is well implemented token i would say that 12-15 characters long random string hash into md5 should do the job

4421693
post	get
any user is able to submit any nonsensical or resubmit data to your server side script regardless of how the data is sent there post or get so it is not a valid consideration.

4421697
folder	directory
your template should reference images using #image_prefix#some_folder_name some_file_name in which case you need to put the images in a folder called some_folder_name beneath the directory that the i alias points to

4421715
int	double	int	chars
to the former belong for example int chars and double

4421716
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and also google-chrome implements a multi-file selector in html5

4421746
google-chrome	firefox
what s really weird if i keep reloading the tab in google-chrome it sometimes works and is consistent with firefox internet explorer but often is not and looks like the above this is quite a mystery to me

4421784
accessor	properties
sorry the problem was not that it wasn t compiling i missed the public accessor on writing the stuff here the question was why not to use ienumerable for a properties

4421786
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works perfectly in google-chrome and safari except in firefox the flashing text cursor does not appear inside the form input when it has focus

4421792
width	height
your slideshow div has a predefined width and height set to 22px

4421792
width	height
just change these values to height 332px and width 532px

4421792
google-chrome	firefox
ie and firefox does this in the background while google-chrome displays it wrong

4421802
getter	setter
that fails to compile because when you include an extra access modifier for a getter or setter it has to be more restrictive than the overall access of the property

4421804
post	get
imo the main reason to use post isn t security you can secure get but it s a matter of having the right semantics

4421834
kde	gnome
generally gnome and kde use gtk+ and qt respectively

4421840
toolchain	binutils
the best option for me would be using the gnu toolchain gcc binutils etc.. to do so but i might be missing an easy way of doing it with swig

4421871
post	get
to fix that problem there exists post redirect get pattern you need to follow

4421871
post	get
post redirect get prg is a common

4421950
google-chrome	safari
webkit browsers safari and google-chrome can fire the event prematurely in this case before the images have loaded

4421950
width	height
you need to specify a height and width value for each of your images so the browser can calculate page flow before the images are loaded

4421953
rss	feed
i was trying to parse smsugsmug rss atom feed using simplepie php parser and am getting error

4421963
udp	tcp
so far i only worked with sockets tcp or udp

4421985
google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in ie8 firefox google-chrome etc.

4421989
std	ostream
in addition to that you ve got some serious namespacing problems- you ve used namespace std for the ostream but then called your argument cout which is a conflict with std cout

4421994
textview	imageview
it s just a relativelayout with two textview s and a imageview

4422043
width	height
what i am trying to do is dynamically change the height of an inputbox when the users text overflows it s width sorta like facebook s status update textbox

4422050
trie	tree
as flightofstairs mentioned depending on the requirements a bloom filter is one solution if you need the full data another solution is to use a trie or radix tree data structure

4422068
awt	swing
i m relative new with awt and swing and this is for homework

4422087
put	get
the data you ll get from them probably won t be very accurate so put some more thinking on this area rather than silverlight perf

4422100
clang	llvm
apple is pushing llvm and clang a lot

4422129
haskell	ocaml
you could imagine it being a lisp-like s-expression or an g algebraic data type in haskell or ocaml

4422149
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome it looks fine as per below

4422177
width	height
you can manually control the size of the textarea using the css height and width parameters

4422200
tax	shipping
so i ask you to help me i need to make the exact same calculation as magento do and still get out the values that i need each product shipping with discounts but without tax

4422204
gif	png
try to put both of the images background and logo back-page1.png logo5.gif in the same format either gif or png i prefer png and it should do the trick

4422233
client-side	server-side
i m not aware of any means to interact with a file input on the client-side so you ll need to verify validate the uploaded file server-side within the next.php script but this should be enough

4422235
gif	png
at this point you can make it more secure by checking the type and ensuring it s only jpg gif png or of the sort

4422273
int	chars
seems like from the text box you will be taking first two chars from the string convert it into an int and then do xor on it

4422284
implements	extends
there may be a problem between your use of the keywords interface abstract and extends implements

4422287
awt	swing
instead of using awt components like canvas i would strongly strongly recommend using swing or really any other graphical library

4422325
fadein	fadeout
now what i want is to add fadein and fadeout to the changing background however i m not sure of the proper way to do it i ve tried some different arrangements of it and it worked just not in the direction or order i wanted it to

4422327
prepare	bindvalue	prepare	bindparam	bindparam	bindvalue
stmt- bindparam and bindvalue and in general prepare statements are safe against sql injection

4422329
mouseup	mousedown
you seem to already know that with regards to the mousedown event and it s exactly the same thing with the mouseup event

4422331
width	height
one thing you could try is if you set the canvas s width height with css into for example 300x300 and then give the canvas width and height attributes of 150 and 150 it will appear zoomed in by 200

4422346
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
now i want a renderized nsimage or nsbitmapimagerep of it

4422358
width	height
you can upload an image into the media section and then using css format the header area to the height and width that you want and place a background image into the header

4422361
getter	setter
perhaps you could implement getter setter to retrieve the metadata or something along those lines

4422402
libsndfile	jack
i m using libsndfile to load the music file and i use jack to play it

4422405
macports	homebrew
have you tried homebrew instead of macports

4422407
clang	llvm
with clang llvm they have no such restriction and thus are able to do far more with their tools starting with the integrated clang static analyzer in xcode 3.2 and going much further with xcode 4

4422407
clang	llvm
beyond the license issues clang llvm builds much faster than gcc and in apple s benchmarks and my own experience creates better-performing executables than gcc

4422407
clang	llvm
however clang llvm is the way that apple s going so why not plan for that

4422415
hide	show
if i understand you right you are looking for something that hide the submit button and you want to show the submit button once you obtain focus on the status update

4422415
hide	show
what you are doing in your snippet is that as long as there is focus on the status update box the submit button will be show but if you try to click on it the focus is lost and immediately the submit button hide

4422442
int	double	min	max
i tried for example to simply for each attribute divide the difference between the max value and the min value for that attribute dividing it into an arbitrary value like 10 and then map all the double values of each attributes to the index of it s corresponding interval and by doing so normalizing my attributes to int values between 1 and ten.

4422467
singleton	facade
this could be achieved either using singleton pattern as you ve suggested using static fields or by using a service provider facade to access the object either of those will do the job

4422470
integer	unsigned	unsigned	short
unichar is an alias of unsigned short and so is an integer type

4422483
unsigned	short
now as the name specified it returns the unicode character value unichar which is actually a typedef of unsigned short

4422517
firefox	safari
i am not talking about xcode tabs in which i can show different files but tabs for the web browser that i am making such as the ones in safari and firefox

4422574
google-chrome	firefox
i m using mainly google-chrome and occasionally firefox for testing

4422596

it does support oracle mysql and postgresql

4422661
subtract	add
if it doesn t add or subtract x as many times as necessary until you are in this range

4422691
getter	setter
it is cleaner than trying to use the jquery ui getter and setter to try to change the buttons and their click events and if you making a large app will help you in lots of other places

4422693
std	ostream	ostream	istream
edit because your requirements state use of which is already opened and you cannot change you can implement a std streambuf implementation that uses an existing to allow re-use of high-level std istream and std ostream operations

4422729
ssl	https
the most recent problem was related to ssl and adding https for use

4422743
folder	directory
i want to know what is the simplest way to archive my old logs into a folder but not in the main logging file directory

4422749
min	max
because by using you tell the database that you want an aggregation query and therefore any columns or expressions in the select that do not include some aggregaton function like count min max etc. are used to define the buckets that the aggregation will be performed on

4422758
urdu	arabic
for example one character from urdu and other from arabic will not join properly

4422812
mamp	wamp
to run wordpress locally you ll need to install a local server environment xampp mamp wamp and from there you can pretty much install just like you would on a normal server

4422816
typedef	typename
use of typename keyword with typedef and new

4422843
punctuation	words
in other words punctuation is discarded and spaces are replaced with hyphens

4422897
rss	feed
i got an rss feed app

4422910
ivar	subclassing
specifically in objective-c an ivar will be protected by default so they only can be accessed within the same class or subclassing

4422910
accessor	properties	getter	setter
the methods you mentioned are accessor getter and setter and in that case you probably want to use properties since they can be defined in 1 line and you can set some attributes like retain assign copy readonly etc

4422963
opera	firefox
looks the same in opera firefox

4422976
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
that attribute will just be ignored by google-chrome and firefox and safari and everything else that s not ie

4423000
google-chrome	firefox
so i want this line to hit if its ie7 8 and firefox and google-chrome

4423000
google-chrome	firefox
i tried this but it doesn t seem to work in firefox or google-chrome

4423014
for-loop	loops
you can of course maintain a counter when using a foreach loops as well but there is no reason to since you have the standard for-loop at your disposal which is made for this sort of thing

4423025
int	boolean
copy does occur with primitive types such as int or boolean

4423030
pull	push
i d also recommend setting up a bare repository somewhere that you both push to and pull from

4423031
spaces	linefeed
both tables have a field notes of type text containing words separated with spaces and cr linefeed pairs

4423053
post	get
the script behind go takes the title gets the id of the post uses the id to get an url from the database to execute it

4423077
disk	ram
the target machine has multiple cpus great disk and lots of free ram

4423077
disk	ram
i m only investigating this because i m guessing that a transaction give ese the ability to do more caching in ram minimzing disk flushes

4423077
disk	ram
in general how do i make use of multiple processors lots of ram and nice disk

4423081
ncover	ndepend
the logical loc code metric is supported by most .net tools including visualstudio code metric ndepend or ncover

4423102
google-chrome	firefox
firefox allows you to develop add-ons to add functionality to the browser as does google-chrome

4423107
post	put
when you put those within the contenttemplate tags it will post back asyncronously and in your code-behind you will be able to do something like.

4423141
ncover	ndepend
the logical loc code metric is supported by most .net tools including visualstudio code metric ndepend or ncover

4423184
ubuntu	linux

4423212
getter	setter
unless you need to do extra work in your property setter and getter there is no reason to choose one over the other

4423236
width	margin
i m creating html documents for printing by testing i found that width of around 650px is close to the margin

4423275
portrait	landscape
how do i know whether uideviceorientationfaceup and uideviceorientationfacedown is happening in portrait or landscape

4423275
portrait	landscape
i know that the device is facing up or down but i don t know if i should reposition everything to portrait or landscape

4423283
uniq	grep
for example there s huge value in being able to use awk grep sed sort uniq etc

4423327
public	protected
output as a literal in this case your codebehind class must expose a protected or public property or field named urlparams

4423347
mouse	keyboard
the jquery ui source library contains a jquery.simulate.js file for simulating mouse and keyboard events

4423350
puts	gets
sticking my entry under gets me my item but no matter what i pick for the position i get two different extremes i don t like top puts it above the default item bottom puts it right above properties

4423429
rar	zip
this works fine for most of patterns i m looking for zip rar sfv

4423579
boost	stl
the only two well known production quality libraries that i know of is boost and stl

4423656
uiview	subviews
you can get an array of subviews of any uiview using subviews property

4423665
debian	linux
the autoconf archive is available as a package in debian gnu linux and macports and probably many other systems which means that any neededâ definitions can be used without copying .m4 files around by hand

4423666
width	height
the best approach is to make all the parameters configurable with some common default values width height and px pt ratio

4423685
singleton	facade
i usually and that s personal preference have one singleton that controls the network management a singleton and facade pattern in one as to not having more than the 5 allowed connections

4423704
post	get
a different way to get to the same solution but wanted to post the working version

4423729
google-chrome	safari
css3 has support for marquee but it is only supported in a few browsers safari and google-chrome are the only one to my knowledge

4423763
mouseleave	mouseenter
when you mouse over the prev is sends mouseleave to container then you move the mouse and since prev is hidden now it sends mouseenter but then the prev appears again and you move and it sends mouseleave etc.

4423763
hide	show
or instead of hover monitor mouse movements and it the mouse is inside the container show the prev next otherwise hide them

4423801
int	chars
so first of all i m declaring 3 arrays of chars and an int in my employee struct

4423872
google-chrome	firefox
it s still a working draft but support is beginning to show up in recent screen readers jaws 9 recent versions of nvda when used with recent browsers ie 9 firefox 3.6 partial and 4.0 google-chrome

4423885
typedef	struct
also another suggestion whilst we re at it is to define the pointer to a struct using typedef

4423890
postgresql	mysql
i have a mysql database with over 40 000 records i want to import into a new postgresql database

4423920
google-chrome	firefox

4423987
children	parent
use the button s parent then look through the children for the textbox

4423998
castle	common.logging
use common.logging and inject it via castle castle ioc

4423998
castle	common.logging
injecting common.logging via castle castle seems like wearing a belt and suspenders to hold your pants up

4423998
castle	common.logging
my guess is that you really want to use one technology or the other common.logging or castle castle s logging facility

4423998
castle	common.logging
if you really do want to inject common.logging via castle castle you might find this link useful

4424025
hex	binary
the data from the binary file in hex is as below

4424164
textchanged	keyup
can t use the textchanged event but i can accomplish the same by linking to the keyup event of the itemscontrol

4424168
min	max
now suppose i want to do something a bit more advanced instead of throwing an exception i d like it to return the min or max of the target type saturation

4424180
nsstring	nsobject
if you re struggling to get this to work consider archiving and unarchiving a standard nsobject like an nsstring or some such

4424182
fink	macports
the pkg-config we ship by default does include this so you probably have macports or fink prior to ours in your path

4424210
onclick	onsubmit	submit	submission
use onsubmit for the form submission handler not onclick on the submit button

4424210
submit	submission
you can t cancel a form submission reliably cross-brower via the submit button s onclick

4424240
ienumerable	icollection
as for your claim that both types have one common ancestor would that be icollection ienumerable or object

4424279
innodb	myisam
for either innodb or myisam each alternate key in the model must be defined as an additional index unique not null

4424280
width	height
then you make the div around your images only the height width of one image

4424314
stdout	fflush
note that due to perl s output buffering mechanism you need to tell your perl script to make stdout implicitly fflush or make it hot in perl-speak

4424335
hide	show
or you can move your menu to usercontrol and hide or show just use id of your usercontrol

4424341
idictionary	ilist
types including idictionary ilist and

4424354
post	get
you d need to get a cgimage draw to a bitmap context then create an image from the bitmap context and post that onto the main thread to be wrapped into a uiimage

4424357
apache	nginx
apache will go under real quick as jon mentions while nginx performs great and the push module is as simple as it gets

4424371
hide	show
that way you don t need your loginuser_loggedin method and the menu will show hide on every load depending on the user is logged in or not

4424375
post	get
be sure to post back when you find out how to get it to work

4424389
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome as it s referring to a real image but fails in firefox

4424397
hash	md5
i tried the md5 hash but found generating the hash became a bottleneck

4424402
floor	sqrt
this can be naively implemented by checking if it is divisible by all integers less than floor sqrt n in a loop

4424403
range	max
if you know the range of the inputs which you do since your function takes an int you can precompute a table of primes less than or equal to the square root of the max input 2 31-1 in this case and then test for divisibility by each prime in the table less than or equal to the square root of the number given

4424424
cvs	svn
also what is the difference between svn and cvs

4424518
post	get
i m creating an ajax app using jquery 1.4.2 and i ve tried using using get post and the ajax method itself

4424530
postgresql	mysql
in php mysql mysqli postgresql etc.

4424540
rpm	yum
these machines have a setup that prohibits me using yum so i need to make a request to those maintaining the system about which rpm i want installed

4424589
hash	md5
which provides md5 hash implementation among other things

4424629
width	height
i m writing a small application for the wp7 using silverlight and it would be helpful for my application to be able to know the very basic dimensions of the touch fingerprint height width

4424629
width	height
however this is always returning a value of 1 for both height and width

4424635
put	get
if you can t get that to work then you could also put a different rewriterule above your one to redirect before this rule is matched.

4424639
hash	md5
i went to a website and generated a random md5 hash with random text is this what i m supposed to do

4424684
pull	push
my current idea do the git pull and manually update the last two days files from my backup then finally do my git push

4424716
min	max
i need to write a method that accepts two ints as arguments a min and a max

4424716
range	min	range	max	min	max
on the next line i start with min+1 print all numbers up to max and then go back to the front of the range and print min

4424716
min	max
next line i start with min+2 and so on until i have repeated this starting with each number in the range.very hard to explain here s two examples say i pass 1 and 5 as the min and max arguments

4424727
rss	feed
currently we are just using lwp useragent to download each rss feed and then checking each url in the resulting feed against a mysql database table of already found urls one at a time

4424741
allocator	stl
stl fails even with aligned allocator because pass by value problem remains

4424753
post	get
you can read request post get variables parameters with the

4424756
minimum	max
the number formatters in objective-c do this very simply i can just set a max number of digits i want to show at 2 and the minimum number of significant digits at 1 and it produces my desired output but how can i do it in java

4424764
apache	nginx
i have nginx as a reverse proxy to apache serving static files for django sites

4424764
apache	nginx
i have 3 django sites on the server that are working and have been working for over a year now but when i try to add a new one either nginx or apache is serving one of the ones that already exist

4424764
apache	nginx
i copied over the nginx apache config files linked them properly and changed the settings in them properly restarted nginx apache sucessfully with no errors but when i try to go to c.com it loads a.com

4424764
apache	nginx
i am assuming this is apache since it is actually rendering the django code for a.com or could nginx be be giving apache the wrong directive

4424764
apache	nginx
and then relink add to sites-enabled in both nginx apache and it too now will not work

4424764
apache	nginx
i ve been digging around google with no luck other than apache nginx defaults but nothing on how to fix this

4424764
apache	nginx
here are example nginx apache config files

4424769
ati	nvidia
developing for both ati and nvidia is actually not too difficult so long as you avoid using any part of either vendor s sdk

4424780
for-loop	loops
in the case of a for-loop there are 3 settings arguments that control loops

4424797
fgets	fread
i am guessing fopen flock fwrite fgets fread fclose

hide	show
i found a workaround for that too which basically hide and show menu bar

4428880
width	height
also i noticed that when parent form is in normal window state mode not maximized and you change the width or height of the form by 1 pixel child form becomes maximized as it should be and child form s icon on menu bar gets refreshed properly and you don t need other workaround i described above

4428894

4429100
disk	ram
pages otoh are simply a unit of management for the contents of ram or disk

4429100
disk	ram
this may be more that the physical ram available to give to the process so the operating system allocates blocks on disk called pages which will hold the contents of certain logical pages in the process s address-space

4429100
disk	ram
you could also think of a process s address-space as being logically stored on disk pages with the os-assisted mapping into ram being just a way to cache the contents of those pages such that the process isn t continually accessing the hard drive

4429111
squash	branch
additionally when tortoisesvn has had trouble merging entire branch in the past i have resorted to rebasing topic branch on top of trunk and squash all the commits into one commit which is similar in nature to a cherry-pick

4429517
wxpython	pygtk
this is a non-trivial problem given the way that vpython wants to work but there is an example in the contributed programs section of the vpython web site that shows how to embed vpython into a wxpython application so perhaps you can look over that code and determine what you would need to do to perform the same magic in pygtk

4429534
width	height
but take care that the textlabel has a fitting width and height

inherited	subclassing
since uiview inherited from uiresponder you can create a new subclassing of uiview and use that instead overriding only the touch-related methods

4430269
post	get
use post instead of get

4430276
folder	directory
so i am using the following snippet to unzip all the zip files in the directory but each zip file does not contain a parent folder at the root so each successive zip file is unzipped and overwrites the previous files

listview	gridview
i have a sneaky suspicion that listview its view property and the gridview are more closely related than it would appear at first glance and achieving my goal may not be possible in any practical sense but this is just a hunch

4430399
pull	push
however it seems to me that you actually want to push data to the client from the server rather than have the client pull the data from the server

4430443
post	get
i think you have formed this post like a get not sure why

4430448
folder	directory

google-chrome	firefox
however jquery and css are both having some issues running properly in ie8 it works fine in ie7 and firefox and i believe even google-chrome

4430726
portrait	landscape
landscape and portrait mode

4430726
width	height
height and width are each a multiple

4430738
google-chrome	firefox
with the content check it out firefox and google-chrome output something like the following

4430752
google-chrome	firefox
the following works in google-chrome and ie6+ but in firefox the text is not wrapping

4430770
cos	sin
for using this function t will need to support both sin and cos static members

4430796
google-chrome	firefox
ie7 by itself is largely incompatible with firefox google-chrome standards and requires a lot of hacking

4430799
folder	directory
i found a great treeview on the internet but the problem is this tree is for folder and directory and not for text items

4430800
google-chrome	firefox
also this solution should support ie7-ie8 firefox google-chrome

4430807
children	parent
the style override only occurs on the children of the said menuitem the parent has the expected style

4430811
width	height
there is another solution which is to give your text widget a requested width and height of one

4430811
width	height
if you set the width and height to one your initial window unless explicitly set to a larger size will be rather small

4430830
mp3	wav
there s a free for non-commercial applications sound library for .net called irrklang that supports playing multiple sounds at least wav and mp3 from what i can gather at the same time their tutorial specifically covers this case as basic usage of the library

4430845
northwind	adventureworks
about your secound questions the reason you more see northwind database than adventureworks is just because aw is a huge and northwind is a fairly small database hence make it a better fit for samples and walkthroughs

versioning	upgrade
and this is after the webservice versioning upgrade

4430889
width	height
set your canvas a height and width

4430890
hide	show
to hide the tinymce and show the textarea you should call

4430900
std	ostream
you can use the string extraction operator of std ostream

4430942
integer	fractions
you can use class rational - it stores non-integer numbers as fractions of two integer s which as far as i know will be automatically converted to bignum when need

4430944
width	height
in the above code malloc is taking arguments which is width height sizeof rgb

4430951
for-loop	arrays
in addition you would probably want to optimized the arrays clearing code to not use a for-loop

4430987
post	get
i am that kind that spends more time looking for bugs in web projects and correct them but i still have one question about the use of the get and post method

4430995
move	drag
if a tile isn t touched when the user touches the screen i can somehow catch the tile when the user drag their finger over it as they attempt to move it

4430995
move	drag
that said how can i catch a tile when the user drag their finger over it and send it touch events to move it where the finger is

4430995
touchesmoved	touchesended
currently my tiles are implemented as subclasses of the uiview and they handle the touch events touchesbegain touchesmoved and touchesended directly

4431084
int	double
it looks like you can t pass an int so just make i a double and that should work

4431103
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
it is easy enough to find the answer for windows linux and osx on the web but how about on commercial unix operating systems like aix on power hp-ux on itanium and solaris on sparc

4431134
inherited	properties
note no versions of internet explorer including ie8 support the properties values inherited or collapse

4431166
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
exactly the opposite - you must not free that particular pointer value since it hasn t been allocated with malloc or calloc

4431242
getter	setter
for example i have addresstype.java in my workspace with getter setter

4431276
setinterval	settimeout
any call to settimeout setinterval will flow through and in the first example i was using settimeout instead of setinterval

4431342
post	get
i think it determined this via the post or get methods

4431391
comparator	comparable
implementing the comparable interface on element will force you to implement the comparator method

4431392
onreadystatechange	onload
you could try listening for an onload or onreadystatechange event to see if it s being fired later

4431447
stdout	stderr
in the end i followed runrig s advice but then used the core module open3 command so i could capture the output from stderr as well as stdout

4431489
folder	directory
my .h and .lib files are in the folder c pcm .i specify this path at the required places c c++- additional include directory linker- input- additional dependencies .every thing works fine

4431502
implements	extends
i would personally make the repository interface extends idisposable - it s easy enough to implements it with a no-op after all

4431599
super	self
but override hittest on the board view so that it first calls the super implementation in order to find a tile if the result is self the board itself was hit

4431600
hide	fadeout
but since i have this hide and fadeout the fields wont appear again how can i solve this

4431600
hide	show
so i want it to hide on success and then if you press on the link it should show the fields again #respondmsg #response

4431619
versioning	upgrade
it provides additional support for new os versioning and deployment scenarios and is the upgrade path for users of earlier versioning

4431659
ubuntu	linux
if you re developing on ubuntu linux you need to add a rules file that contains a usb configuration for each type of device you want to use for development

4431695
onfocus	onblur
i used onblur and onfocus on these elements since there was no description beside the textbox to indicate what each box is for

4431712
google-chrome	firefox
use firebug addon for firefox or ie google-chrome debugger to inspect the element you need to modify its style and see if gwt has assigned it a style class name or read its javadoc

4431712
width	height
to add vertical horizontal scroll you need to specify height width or max-height and use overflow-y scroll

4431772
post	get
the problem that this causes is that my post now get a 400 - bad request response from my server

4431815
subtract	add
i m thinking maybe just subtract a set amount from each of the first control points and add the same amount to the second control points but that sounds over simplified to me

4431856
floating-point	fixed-point
for floating-point and fixed-point types m is the total number of digits that can be stored

4431881

4431885
hide	show
i m writing a wordpress plugin that allows people in the admin to hide show content specific to us states

4431926
mouseover	mouseout
and i d like to add a sort of listener such mouseover or mouseout for each of this div by taking the class teamscroll as reference

4431931
typemock	moles
technically this can be done by using a suitable mocking tool such as typemock isolator or microsoft moles there is a third one which i don t remember now

4431941
mouseover	mouseout
the difference here is that .live runs an extra selector and the event bubbles all the way up to document ...as well as it actually maps to mouseover and mouseout under the covers which is often undesirable

4431960
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

4431973
for-loop	loops
also if you want to only run loops five times your outer for-loop should be only to x 5

4432014
superclass	subclassing
i think that the easiest solution would be to leave the instance variable declarations in the superclass but duplicate the property lines in each subclassing

4432029
hide	show
i can probably wait until the window show up and then hide it by getting a handle to the open window

4432080
put	get
the funny thing is i can get it to work without the timegodkend variable but no matter where i put the timegodkend now â œ it gives me an error message

4432096

4432101
google-chrome	firefox
everything works perfectly in firefox and ie believe it or not but i m having issues with google-chrome

4432101
google-chrome	firefox
from what i can tell the cometd 2.0 emulates websocket by using long polling in browsers that don t support websocket natively firefox ie etc and uses websocket in the browsers that do support it google-chrome so i m guessing that s where my issue is coming from

4432132
jboss	glassfish
apart from upgrading to a servletcontainer which supports el 2.2 tomcat 7 glassfish 3 jboss 6 etc you can also replace the el implementation yourself

4432137

put	get
3 put the big one sun in the dead center and for the middle ones planets -- just choose a very easy heuristic what about from biggest to smallest going anticlockwise srtaing at the top left don t try to get clever than that with that part of the problem - which indeed could be a huge research project purely on it s own

4432202
mouseup	mousedown
starting a drag on mousedown indeed interferes with the click event there won t be a mouseup event to trigger the click

4432206
stdout	stderr
close it or redirect it stdout and stderr and close stdin

4432206
stdout	stderr
in bash you use to redirect both stdout and stderr to logfile and trap hup to ignore the hup signal

4432211
implements	extends
the only objection that i can see is that extends the interface will require all derived classes to implements the interface

4432221
x86	64bit	128bit	64bit
the sse2 instruction set uses 128bit registers however most of the registers in a x86 x64 are 32-bit or 64bit

4432230
division	modulo
modulo it is used for remainder division on integers typically but in python can be used for floating point numbers

you can extends jdialog and call super in your constructor with the second parameter set to true

4432554
pop-up	dialog
background threads cannot pop-up dialog

4432554
pop-up	dialog
what you need is a handler on your ui thread to pop-up the dialog for you

4432570
pop-up	dialog
the way to do it is to use the handler that you have already implemented to pop-up the dialog

4432582
mdpi	hdpi
note there are several sets of the images hdpi mdpi etc.

4432605

then go into iis select your website in the left tree control and set up a virtual directory pointing to that folder you just created

4432639
filtering	grouping
go with the simple foreach as you are clearly wanting to perform an action on and or using the objects in your collection as opposed to wishing to project filtering grouping etc

4432653
post	get
the recommended way to make an edit page for asp.net mvc is to have two methods on a controller called edit one get action and one post action both sharing the same name but overloaded differently

4432653

4436896
onresume	onpause
when my android application needs to register a receiver i ve been registering in activity.oncreate and unregistering in activity.ondestroy i think i m supposed to be using onpause and onresume instead but that s not really the point

4436924
int	double	int	chars
remember that for example chars are promoted to int when used in operations involving int int are promoted to floats floats to double etc

4436924
int	chars
so typeof int_variable + char_variable is int since the chars would be promoted to int to perform the operation

4436991

folder	directory
thats great in the sense that it copies the folder to the output directory

4437338
folder	directory
i need a new way of doing it as it doesnt locate the xml file as its within the folder in the output directory opposed to directly in the output directory if that makes sense

4437401
getter	setter
on a sidenote __get and __set are not lazy replacements for proper getter and setter

4437401
getter	setter
also note that they are much slower than proper getter and setter

4437420
decoder	encoder
instead i would work with a well defined object model and have a simple encoder decoder to handle the conversion to xml string and vice versa

4437444
width	height
make sure using firebug that the body element is actually visible on the page the contents might because the overflow is set to auto by default but you ll also need to set the body height and width to 100 to ensure that when you re mouse moves across the screen it actually invokes body.mouseover

4437475
hide	show
you re best bet is to give each form or its containing div a unique id and using this to show hide using jquery

4437495
integer	unsigned
or as an unsigned integer

4437526
post	get
you won t get analytics but if you include the post views function in your page you can see how much

4437557
gif	png
the logo is a transparent png whereas the original image can be png jpg or gif

4437682
post	get
if you want to send post back to your current page remove in form tag method get action profile.aspx attributes

4437697

plus you get the compile-time overhead of looking up the implicit conversion and the run-time overhead of wrapping the match in a partialfunction not counting the conflicts you could get with other already defined matches methods like the one in string

4437705
integer	unsigned
u is unsigned integer

4437713
versioning	upgrade
i was about to start my first rails 3 app and thought i would upgrade to the latest versioning of ruby before i did and the ruby fails to make correctly

4437736
google-chrome	safari
i ve been working on a menu and have it perfectly working in google-chrome safari

4437740
maven	pom.xml
when maven builds a jar it places a pom.xml at meta-inf pom.xml

4437777
width	height
however the width and height of the composed text layout is equal to that of the canvas so it is not a matter of just turning on the scroll policy

4437777
width	height
somehow i am not able to find the full height and width of a full composition of the textflow

4437840
equals	gethashcode
but i strongly suspect it s because you haven t overridden equals or gethashcode in dickeys

4437840
equals	gethashcode
you can override equals and gethashcode to provide equality based on the contents of the objects though

4437840
equals	gethashcode
see this question for an example of the kind of thing you might do in equals and gethashcode - and some other members you may want to provide on types which have value-based equality

what is the difference between iqueryable t and ienumerable t

4437871
superclass	subclassing
you can only hide superclass methods by defining a method with same name and signature in the subclassing but it s quite confusing and therefore generally not recommended

4437887
jobs	cron
read about setting up cron jobs here

4437892
mp3	wav
if you didn t touch the binary data and it s still in its original binary wav mp3 form you have the audio file

4437918
mp3	wav
you do not need to convert it but if you want to allow a user to download an mp3 or wav file you need to set the correct headers

4437921
mp3	wav
if converting to mp3 is impossible then maybe somebody at least knows how to convert it to wav

4437924
udp	tcp
the tcp and udp protocols have too many semantics to be easily mapped to your usual file stream apis

4437924
fgetc	fread
at the end of the day once you ve dealt with binding and listening and accepting none of which you can do with c file streams and wrapped the resultant file descripter in a file stream type all you are going to do is use fread and fwrite maybe fgetc so you may as well leave it as an ordinary file descriptor and us recv and send and save yourself the hassle of wrapping

4437964
google-chrome	safari
instead of debugging on their site i d probably do my best to record via firebug or google-chrome safari s dev tools etc. a sample ajax interaction and then set up a dummy page on my own local server that would simply echo that interaction playback style

4437984
hide	show
and show hide the required form as per the requirement

4437985

4438228
getter	setter
largeproduct has a variable height which has getter and setter methods which have to be implemented in the product class

4438251
superclass	subclassing
note that things are slightly different when you are subclassing a class and you want to know whether the superclass responds to a certain selector

4438251
super	self
therefore sending respondstoselector to super is equivalent to sending it to self

4438256
rss	feed
this code is meant to pull rss feed from yahoo weather server in a map-reduce pattern

even if you create directory under resource folder all resources go to a flat directory under app bundle

4438333
qlist	qtextstream
the first error namely no matching function for call to â qlist append qtextstream â is caused by you using operator in this line

4438355
children	parent
if you want to enumerate all the children of a node you just need to get your parent node with something like element parent root.getchild parentnodename then you can enumerate the children with the same methode list children parent.getchildren childname

4438359
min	max
i know this is not working as rand needs a min and max number but what is the solution for this

4438395
firefox	safari
it produces the right results in safari and ie but fails to get the position of the img that you hover over in firefox - it returns 0 0

4438429
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to be working as expected on google-chrome and firefox but in ie 7 9 the min-width is not enforced

4438488
bmp	png
all i want to do is convert it to some kind of more universal format eg png bmp giff whatever which i can then allow the user to download

4438488
svg	vml
i would have thought the seeing as vml is microsoft s proprietary svg format they might have at least provided facilities within their own languages c# vb.net to convert vml to bitmaps

4438498
folder	directory
it works by copying the database from the assets directory to the data data com.myapp.db databases folder

4438539
imagick	ffmpeg-php
i m currently obtain the frames using ffmpeg-php and process each frame by imagick

4438572

the folder is a virtual directory setup unter the root of the site in iis and it s alias is admin

4438590
width	height
in javascript onload i know how to call window.sizetocontent for it to guess what the size should be but does anyone know how i can change the window width and height specifically

4438594
memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strcpy	strcpy	strncpy
to copy the contents of a string into a or a for that matter you d need to use strcpy strncpy or my preference memcpy

4438606

i want to have an edit link on each row that will pop-up a jquery dialog so that the row can be edited

4438638
google-chrome	firefox
in ie8 firefox google-chrome etc it works fine however in ie7 standards using the developer mode it doesn t show any content whatsoever

4438658
width	height
if the new image dimension width x height is exactly the same as the displayed image s dimension in html then web users will still see a sharp image

4438669
getter	setter
but because i need el syntax i still need to create getter setter for this public field

4438698
mouseleave	mouseenter
this shouldn t stop the mouseenter and mouseleave from working though

4438736
mouse	keyboard
you can turn off the navigation toolbar but that won t actually disable navigation - there are mouse buttons and keyboard shortcuts for navigating back

4438739
for-loop	loops
instead of comparing for-loop control scoping try using the for each loops since that actually uses iterator which in some collection implementations is a lot faster than iterating by using index

4438761
getter	setter
typically you should begin by writing a test testing a setter or a getter before implementing it

4438761
getter	setter
a not implemented setter or getter can look trivial but makes test fail

4438761
getter	setter
and why would you write any line of code even a setter or getter if it s not driven by a test failure

4438833
google-chrome	firefox
how can i add a simple hover to a div that will be compatible with firefox ie7+ and google-chrome

4438847
pop-up	dialog
there is no way to circumvent the pop-up dialog requesting the user to accept trust or deny the certificate

4438897
post	get
querystring is a get post adds items to the form collection

4438904
children	parent
for historic reasons all of this would have been done on the same form so user would have a form for the parent and one child and they would hit a button to add more children

4438968
int	double
known fixed arguments this is when you declare function with arguments foo int x double y

4438968
int	double
but when you try to call it as with count is of double type compiler will try to pass count through stack as it is not int

4438968
int	double
it is not abstract example as double in arument may be just result of computation involving floating point numbers and you may just miss this assuming result is int

4438969
public	protected
this means that the standard rules of inheritance apply to variable scoping - if you have a public or protected member variable declared in your code-behind class it will be directly accessible in the aspx just like in your example

4439045
button	checkbox
i am new to windows forms and localization.i have a windows form which is containing some radio button and checkbox and some button

4439056
mef	caliburn
i use caliburn micro and mef as ioc

4439056
viewmodel	caliburn
i bind event click of button with caliburn convention on viewmodel

4439206
innodb	myisam
if you use myisam as the db engine you will need to keep track of the ids manually but if you choose innodb as the engine you can use foreign keys

4439212
versioning	upgrade
another gotcha to watch out for is since you are modifying the xml future upgrade won t install newer versioning of the xml by default since it now has user data

4439241
geocoding	geocode
each map kit application has a limited amount of reverse geocoding capacity so it is to your advantage to use reverse geocode requests sparingly

4439262
inherited	subclassing
since dispose is declared virtual calling dispose on a subclassing instance always causes that class s dispose method to be called first which in turn calls base.dispose as it s last step giving a chance to clear up each level in the inherited hierarchy

4439307
mouseover	mouseout
whenever mouseover mouseout is on the tag the event will bubble up to the

4439318
cos	sin
it is stated that to rotate a line by a certain angle you multiply its end point coordinates by the matrix cos a sin a -sin a cos a where a is rotation angle

4439318
cos	sin
simplifying it new coordinates will be x cos a - y sin a for x and x sin a + y cos a for y

4439320
public	protected
i want a phone number which display on public page will be protected

4439385

looks fine in firefox and ie but in google-chrome the tab seems to be 1 pixel higher than the bottom of the menu bar

4439557
uilabel	nsstring
i fill a uilabel text with a large string and sometimes it doesn t do so everytime my uilabel.text is incomplete not the whole nsstring

4439558
folder	directory
the c system volume information directory would only usually contain 1 folder which is the _random guid folder

4439584
icmp	udp
but remember if you are talking about udp icmp .

4439628
kerberos	ntlm
crystal report server is java-based tomcat or wac and java sso does not support ntlm so yes you will need to use kerberos

4439635
nsstring	uifont
+ float calculateheightoftextfromwidth nsstring text uifont withfont float width uilinebreakmode linebreakmode

4439675
free	malloc
if you get the debug versions of the libraries msvc offers a debug malloc and free as well as a debug new and delete

4439680
pull	push
the only thing that would be different from a clone is the lack of hardlinks and that the default pull push path will be set-up to be the same as the original rather than pointing to the original

4439681
folder	directory
why not query that folder location and loop through the list of directory to find the folder that starts with _restore and then plug that into your argument

4439685
updatepanel	scriptmanager
on a partial postback the scriptmanager will not be added because you are trying to add it outside the updatepanel where it has to be

4439685
updatepanel	scriptmanager
but after the partial postback the dynamically added scriptmanager won t be available to the page and because you are trying to add it outside the updatepanel -- addat 0 ... - after a partial postback it won t actually be added

4439788
qtcore	qtgui
you should be linking against qtcore and qtgui libraries but you don t

4439788
qtcore	qtgui
it s also evident by the fact that both qtcore and qtgui are present in your include paths

4439788
qtcore	qtgui
i haven t used cl.exe with qt but you could try adding to force linking to qtcore and qtgui

4439797
sin	sqrt
its available for me only log base e sin tan and sqrt only square root functions and the basic arithmetical operators + - mod

4439797
base	fractions
i must implement exponentiation of rational fractions base and exponents

4439799
firefox	safari
i had a similar issue but safari and iphone were both not working whilst ie and firefox were working

4439907
springsource	grails
if you want grails rather than just groovy support the simplest option is to install the springsource tool suite sts which supports groovy grails and lots of other products under the spring portfolio

4439956
hide	show
or perhaps it would be better to put the image in the page coming from the server then just show and hide it

4439956
hide	show
to do this you could use the other version of .toggle that performs a show hide

4439969
struts	stripes
iâ m not familiar with struts but if it does not support this basic feature i would recommend you switch to the stripes framework or the more complex spring mvc framework

4439972
ienumerable	iqueryable
read more as bill wagner explains difference between iqueryable and ienumerable here

4439977
google-chrome	firefox
i use custom js-element for my form and when i use for the submit button google-chrome does not submit form on enter although firefox does

4440025
post	get
is it possible to just get the username from the http header or does it require some negotiation first before it will post the header

4440033
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in all browsers i tried firefox linux firefox google-chrome opera windows except for internet explorer where the line breaks from the original file are removed

4440036
int	chars
in the code you ve posted you are trying to cast an int n in something that seems to be a chars prime_array k it can t work because n and prime_array k dont have the same type and also because you can t cast an int in an array like that

4440038
persistent	transient
they must be always up-to-date with the persistent state but they also have a transient state that is never stored in the db for which the lifespan is the whole user http session can last a whole day or more and which is specific to each session user here a user is a screen

4440038
persistent	transient
how to cleanly combine both states in order to maintain the transient state in-memory in the http session while regularly refreshing the persistent state from the db

4440047
onresume	onpause
while the service can currently only be stopped through the stop service button i m unbinding the service in onpause and rebinding it in onresume

4440047
onresume	onpause
onpause and onresume lifecycle methods are called quite often so this is a lot of binding and unbinding overhead but as onpause is always called before the application could be killed i think this is the best place for releasing service bindings and to avoid leaks

4440052
setinterval	settimeout
note such browser-based methods as setinterval or settimeout are not available in wsh

4440081
versioning	upgrade
will there be any problems if i upgrade my delphi versioning because of unicode support provided in newer versioning

4440094
many-to-one	one-to-many
for example one-to-many collections are often in my experience practically always marked as inverse the many entities members of the collection have a column with the parent s id mapped as a many-to-one property and simply creating one of those entities means that it will be implicitly included in the collection so no need to explicitly update them

4440152
apache	lighttpd
you can set cache headers either in http server apache lighttpd etc. or in code

4440153
qlineedit	qlabel
i have two widgets one arbitrary usually a qlineedit and one qlabel which displays a pixmap

4440167
fflush	gets
whenever the server gets some output from the program it should push it out on the network and fflush the stream

4440208
sudo	passwd
sudo typically requires terminal input must have a tty as it will attempt to ask the user for a passwd before allowing you to execute a command

4440218
setinterval	settimeout
as far as i know there is no equivalent to settimeout setinterval under windows script host shockingly

4440219
portrait	landscape
after rotating my ipad to portrait and switching back to landscape the space is gone

4440226
accessor	properties
the variable thenumber is not accessed via the properties accessor so it is not actually retained in the initwithstring of the super type method last code snippet

4440231
pexpect	telnetlib
so i started to use the build in telnetlib not pexpect

4440293
hide	show

4440364
audiotrack	audiorecord
i am using audiorecord for obtaining recorded audio at client side and audiotrack classes for playing raw data at server side

4440457
min	max
i can use max or min etc

4440457
min	max
i think that max or min produces small overheads

4440474
inherited	subclassing
i using the table per subclassing strategy for inherited in my application as described in ayende s post here

4440526
versioning	upgrade
but that would mean an upgrade of jquery would require heavy testing on both sides while the mangled jquery versioning is contained and that any plugin wanted would require the client to add appropriate script tags to their site spurring a political debate between the two parties on what versioning win

4440543
inherited	properties
you could add a static integer properties let s say self counter to your zend_form inherited class

4440635
width	height
if you are able to render to a view or layer that is smaller in both width and height than those dimensions you don t need to use a catiledlayer and can get away with a standard layer

4440731
post	get
but frameworks are something similar because the framework usually allows you to to map the post or get build forms and save the info into the db according to a model.

4440763
gridview	sqldatasource	gridview	formview	sqldatasource	formview
we usually bind data controls such as formview and gridview to sqldatasource and put one textbox control in their template

4440766
sqldatasource	detailsview	sqldatasource	formview	formview	detailsview
one way is have your controls in a formview or detailsview then set the datasourceid of the formview to the sqldatasource and in your controls you bind them like so asp label id .

4440787
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and opera the output is bar but in google-chrome the output is foo

4440820
actionscript	haxe
this requires haxe code i think which is not actionscript 3.0 but is close and should be easy to pick up if you re already comfortable with as

4440824
sudo	passwd
try sudo -s to see if setting it to read the passwd from stdin even though it doesn t need one will bypass the test for a tty

4440887
boost	stl
note that i cannot use boost or stl for this - and no it is not a homework its a problem i run into at work and we do not use boost or stl in the code where this thing goes

4440908
client-side	server-side
i couldn t make this work server-side despite my code apparently being fine so i ran it client-side with a javascript synchronous http request

4440913

expander	grid	expander	gridsplitter
i have a 3 columned grid with some content in the first column the gridsplitter in the second column and the expander in the third column

it looks like what is happening is that after the gridsplitter is moved the width of the column containing the expander is altered from auto to a fixed size

4441694
mef	prism
i know the risk of dealing with these overnight frameworks lack of documentation buggy etc etc that mef seems to be but prism is not a option to me i feel like buying a m16 to kill a fly when i can use my finger

4441737
tablelayout	margins
now i want to modify tablelayout margins s according to screen resolution the problem is how to reach to tablelayout via code i tried this

4441755
onkeyup	onkeydown
set up an event handler for the onkeypress or onkeydown or onkeyup event and check which key was pressed it will be in the event arguments

4441794
free	malloc
on the other hand virtual memory will increase if malloc can t find an unused block of memory to allocate but it won t decrease when free gives memory back

4441886
disk	ram
the server has plenty of ram and iotop shows that there is no disk io happening

4441901
getter	setter
it s probably because your getter and setter is not following the javabeans convention

4441901
getter	setter
what i d suggest is - name your fields and then use your ide to generate setter and getter

4441904
int	boolean
add a column to the id code pair that is some representation of a boolean or an int type that indicates what type of row this is user-defined or system

4441920
hash	md5
the hash could be md5 sha1 â there are easy to find js implementations

4441934
gcov	gprof	gcov	autotools

4442249
int	double
a processing only one specific primitive type int double float ... of the formal parameter and for other types throwing exception

fink	macports
you should be able to install kcachegrind from macports package kdesdk4 and maybe also fink which i never used myself and use it just as you do on linux

4442289
post	get
a third option would be to pass the page address the back link should point to as post get parameters through all pages

4442289
post	get
pass the history count through on sessions get post and then use that to populate the number that goes into the javascript .go x function

4442311
post	get
it is sometimes to change the default sessionid if you are uber-worried about session hijacking though the chances of someone successfully hijacking a session are pretty well slim if you take the most rudimentary steps in sanitizing your data turn off register globals and only accept the specific post or get variables cast correctly from your forms.

4442338
memcpy	strcpy
use strcpy or memcpy instead to copy the contents of the string pointed to by question to the contents of the memory pointed to by memq

4442479
x86	64bit
gets program files x86 in 64bit windows and program files in 32 bit

4442511
google-chrome	safari
the easiest would be to add stylesheet blocks interpreted only by google-chrome and safari that adjust behavior to take into account the rendering issue

4442511
opera	firefox
avoid using media screen and -webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio 0 since that can affect opera and some versions of firefox

4442569
min	max	width	height
this was actually not a gallery problem the images i was downloading weren t being scaled properly so they were coming in with a max width height that was the same size as the view instead of a min width height to achieve what i wanted here

4442614
post	get
my site was just bombarded by an attacker trying to pass php input into any get post variable they could think of

4442616

depending on what you need the structure for you can use some lockless data structure like win api interlocked slist

4442662
getter	setter
preferably stick them in a separate class and have setter and getter

4442667
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the idea is to provide a soft lead-out which works nicely on google-chrome firefox safari whathaveyou but obviously one can t have nice things and ie wants to stand out

4442757
std	ostream
a common solution for c++ is to use std ostream and operator

4442990
rss	feed
after examining my site i found that a for-loop which i used to retrieve data dynamically from an rss feed is making the problem

4443031
daemon	cron
the best option would be to read from a local cache and setup a cron job daemon to update the cache regularly

4443033

this is supported by ssms when sqlcmd mode is on sqlcmd and is trivial to support it in client libraries too dbutilsqlcmd

4443374
try-catch	exception-handling
stored procedures and application logic scripts in general use try-catch blocks instead but with proper care exception-handling handling and nested transactions

4443436

4443533
equals	tostring
edit i was overriding the equals and tostring in playlist partial class

4443546
hash	salt
edit 2 i thought you could unique-ify against a hash but as someone pointed out with varying salt this would not have the intended effect

4443568
cvs	svn
does any of those diff libraries support a feature like cvs annotate or svn blame

4443616

you should hash the password with a random salt

4443625
hash	salt
i store a cryptographic hash sha-1 or some variant of that password that is manipulated with some sort of unique salt padding

4443630
width	height
giving it a position absolute and declaring the height and width seems to screw up the layout placing it overlapping the footer but bleeding below it

4443634
post	get
this would mean when we are viewing a family members feed of post we would be able to query the db for simply the rows in the map table to get all the children id s of the current family member and subsequently query other tables for the post data

4443677
width	height
a rectangular area of dst_image of width dst_w and height dst_h at

4443677
width	height
meaning if s width is longer src_x has to be 0 and if height is longer src_y has to be 0

4443689
width	height
after suspending painting you need call updatebounds method of the control and increase clientrectangle width or height by one and then decrease it back to the same value it was before

4443739
hash	md5
md5 isn t an encryption algorithm - it is a cryptographic hash function

4443739
pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt	hash	salt
when you store a hash password you should use a salt and key strengthening for example pbkdf2 to make these attacks more difficult

4443743
hash	md5
ref get md5 hash in a few lines of java

4443745
pull	push
gitolite will work just fine certainly for centralised repo push pull

4443752

i ve been forced to use md5 before because another application has demanded it but you don t want to be broadcasting that hash to the world

4443769
wav	riff

a streaming protocol like rtsp rtmp or the many varieties of http streaming allow seeking to any part of the file and only downloading the part seeked to

4444034
unification	inference
if you like to think about ml typing in terms of its usual type inference algorithm each explicit user variable introduces a set of constraints in the unification algorithm

4444034
ocaml	sml
standard mlers note this is one place where ocaml and sml differ.

4444046
post	get
when using get the parameters should be really placed along with the url - the body argument to which ou are passing params is only used in post requests -

4444063

4444268
centos	linux
this hardware works with an hp dl360 g7 server with centos linux 5.4

4444269
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the solution to this is to create a uiviewcontroller project file which subclasses uitableviewcontroller and then you create a class called mytablewithnavigation as a sublcass of uiviewcontroller expose one method called init and in that you programatically create a uinavigationcontroller passing initwithrootviewcontroller and then return the resulting object to the appdelegate that called it

4444292
button	checkbox
my end goal is to show the div containing the submit button if any of the checkbox are checked

4444292
button	checkbox
the only time the div containing the submit button show be hidden is if all checkbox are unchecked

4444292
button	checkbox	hide	show
however the code i have come up with below show hide the submit button div for each checkbox instance

4444292
button	checkbox
in other words if i have three checkbox checked and i uncheck one of them the submit button div get hidden

4444331
width	height
as far as my eyes can tell it seems as though the width and height are being swapped

4444363
qtableview	qitemdelegate
i am using a qitemdelegate combined with the qtableview s isusercheckable flag to draw a centered checkbox column

4444380
ilist	iqueryable
in c# dal what advantages will i derive if i return iqueryable than ilist iam not using entity framework n hibernate just plain old ado.net

4444381
hash	salt
i need a code example for c# of how to generate a hash using sha512 using a random salt and for n number of iterations

4444410
libs	buildpath
i ve added them to my buildpath and they are referenced above the jre system libs in properties-java build path-order and export

4444411
portrait	landscape
another thing to take into consideration that by using native widgets it will probably be easier to add support for different ui sizes portrait and landscape mode in various sizes can be a pain to get right in a single webview

4444415
post	get
ok was able to get it going thanks to the suggestions on this post

4444417
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried this exact thing on both google-chrome and firefox

4444418
post	get
now whenever you get your post they will be ordered by -timestamp

so first of i put a timeout test in there then i get my data from the web service and then i parse it

4444473
width	height
i have to know the size for setting images width and height dynamically according to the viewport size and orientation

4444556
hide	show
sometimes you want to change a content image on rollover and not a background image and putting two versions of a content image next to each other then using hover to hide and show them puts a foot into the realm of content not making sense without the presentation layer

4444558
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to build an expensive script with mouse and keyboard control on canvas

4444558

i m using document.onmousemove and document.onkeydown onkeyup to do this control but when i press any button i ve got a lot of onkeydown executions and mouse lags terribly

4444558
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it on firefox and google-chrome this problem exist only on firefox

ilist	iqueryable
i believe returning an iqueryable allows lazy enumeration whilst returning an ilist doesn t

4444608
getter	setter
showtitle if the row contains a title the getter setter would return set the actual tablerow s visible state

4444633
google-chrome	safari
the element is launched in a uiwebview which is rendered by the webkit engine google-chrome safari

4444645
google-chrome	firefox
these events can queue up in the browser s input queue and be dispatched to your script later which is probably happening in firefox or they may be discarded if your script doesn t process them quickly enough which might be happening in google-chrome

4444645
setinterval	settimeout
instead of using setinterval try using settimeout after each execution of tick -- this will prevent multiple timer events from queuing up and firing together

4444683
sorting	filtering
callers can add filtering paging sorting etc

4444683
ilist	iqueryable
if you need extra control beyond the dal you could add options to the interface or a not so good idea would be to return iqueryable of ilist to limit what the ui code can do

4444692
clang	llvm
i ve been working on a small tool with clang llvm but i haven t been able to successfully get g++ and gnu s linker to properly link my code against clang

4444783
interpreted-language	compiled-language
i have the impression that method overloading can be done on compiled-language java c# and can t be done on interpreted-language ruby python

4444809
width	height
when the user changes this setting the values for width and height are swapped to resize the control to its new orientation

4444809
width	height
for the vertical orientation i create a graphics object and set the height of the control to the width of the sizef object returned from graphics.measurestring text font

4444809
width	height
this means that i can t change the width or height when i want to change the label s orientation

4444839
octal	decimal
it only supports decimal hexadecimal and octal

4444862
octal	decimal	octal	binary

now i want to put this object into a variable but i can t get it to work..

4444871
post	get
or as part of a form one of get or post defaults to get

4444871
post	get
this will run your program with the same query string as above or a different parameter if the text box is changed but request_method will be either get or post depending

4444914
octal	decimal	octal	binary
there s no way to explicitly assign an integer as binary only decimal octal and hexadecimal

4444932
width	height
i used to be doing this by calculating the scale of a cgaffinetransform and multiplying the xscale by the width of the related view and the yscale by the height

given that everything must be stored on the device i am basically treating the password hash and salt as already compromised as anyone who has spent 10 minutes reading can root a given device and access my database preferences

4445174
hash	salt
this single salt value will be appended to the current hash

4445174
hash	salt
the new hash + salt value will then be hash and steps 2 - 3 will be repeated

actually a protected data member is accessible only using protected and public inheritance

4445345
hash	salt
suppose you have a hash function that takes salt a number of iterations and a password as input and returns a hash as output

4445345
hash	salt
randomly generate one salt on the first run of the app and hash the newly chosen password

4445345
hash	salt
store this salt and the resulting hash in the application preferences

4445345
hash	salt
then randomly generate another salt and hash the password with it

4445345
hash	salt
use the resulting hash as the database encryption key but store only the new salt in the application preferences

4445345
hash	salt
later when a user wishes to use the app prompt for the password and use the first salt to hash it

4445345
hash	salt
hash it again with the second salt and use the resulting key to decrypt the database

4445353

4445456
post	get
i don t think it know the_title of what custom post type to get

4445477
hash	salt
assuming your hashing method is not weak it doesn t matter if the salt is known - salt is simply so that 2 users with the same password have different hash - and a casual inspection of hash wouldn t result in identical passwords being obvious

4445520
post	get
i need to access post and get variables inside a server control class there is no access to request object in server control class.

width	height
my current idea is to get the left most and right most vertices as well as top most bottom most deriving the dimensions of the entire geometry based on that then going through each triangle and setting the uv of its vertices based on the triangles width height to a value that it will use a bit of the texture such that it will blend into the next one one vertex uv would be 0.1 0.3 and the next would be 0.2 0.4

basically sql server will use as much memory as it can possible grab it is much more expensive to read from disk than from ram

i have a view that uses renderaction to render another view - it used to all work fine but i did a reasonably small refactoring and moved some of my model s properties to an abstract base class which my model inherited

4450871
jar	war
not sure this is related to the fact that you are deploying as a war but the path should be simply app-sevices-1.0.jar and the jar should be in the lib of the java ee application

4450871
jar	war
i would test making an ear containing a war for the webapp jar for the pu and your other jar for app-services like a traditional java ee deployment would be

getter	setter
coming from c# php i would like to have full getter setter on the classes functions that i create with javascript

4450941
getter	setter
however in much of the javascript code i have encountered getter and setter are not used rather simple public variables

4450941
getter	setter
i was pleased to find john resig s article on getter and setter but some comments on it which state that some browsers do not support getter and setter which is confusing to me since they are not a feature of javascript but more of a simple pattern which uses basic javascript syntax

4450941
getter	setter
what is the current state of getter and setter in javascript

4450949
width	height
you can define the number of pixels for both width and height

4450956

google-chrome	firefox
this code works in ie firefox google-chrome

4450978
implements	extends
extends your window class so that it has idisposable then implements the dispose method as before

4450994
getter	setter
getter and setter aren t features but design patterns code bloat in this case for languages that don t support property syntax

4450994
getter	setter
since javascript doesn t need getter and setter you don t want to write them

4451005

i have tried putting it in all lib folder in the glassfish dir and even inside various places in the ear only

4451030
versioning	upgrade
just make sure you have a good tracking mechanism to know what versioning each client is on and that you use source control to track all database changes by versioning so you can easily upgrade

4451033
getter	setter
the getter and setter methods here act on a private object used to store properties that cannot be accessed from any other methods

4451033
getter	setter
so you could for example implement a setter or getter that logs or does ajax or whatever whenever a property is modified one of the purposes of getter setter methods

4451048
rss	feed
after reading a bit more about database management i found another way to handle this was to have two tables the meta table and a table for every item in the rss feed and in that table have a column with the id of the feed it came from

4451053
children	parent
the environment shell which this parent lives in does not know anything about its children which means it does not know anything about the events they will be expecting

4451062
onclick	onchange
note that i m binding to the checkbox instead of including the onclick or onchange directly on the html element

nfa	dfa
can someone much brighter than i succinctly describe to the so community the nfa to dfa conversion algorithm

4451204
nfa	dfa
i m mostly confident in generating an initial nfa transition table from a state diagram but after that i lose the dfa in the epsilons and subsets

4451223
gridview	repeater
you might want to maybe think about using a repeater to generate the outer table and perhaps embed a gridview into each row to do the detail - i think this might give you a bit more flexibility in your layout

4451226
client-side	server-side
i think the answer might be that what s good for client-side isn t always good for server-side

4451262
restrict	shared
so if the your want shared the app from the phone to phone then i have to restrict to shared or ask for the payment

4451262
publishing	copy-protection
is there possible to publishing my app without licensing by selecting copy-protection option as off now and update it later

4451268
getter	setter
or maybe the other answerers are missing the point. ecmascript provides a behind-the-scenes getter setter mechanism so that

4451268
getter	setter
where putvalue and getvalue are unnamed not directly accessible functions for setter and getter for properties

4451268
getter	setter
and 8.7.2 the 3rd edition doesn t seem to explicitly define how users can set up custom getter and setter functions

4451268
getter	setter
see this so question on getter and setter

4451306
dictionary	map
it can be treated as an array list vector hash table an implementation of a map dictionary collection stack queue and probably more

this as you probably guessed get s called after the save of your model and you can then implement whatever post save functionality that is post write to the database you require

4451398
hash	md5
is it safe to keep the user password hash for example md5 in session

4451411
int	chars
if your key_event is an int or chars you can use a switch statement which might be more readable

g++	gcc
the errors reported by g++ gcc 4.4.4 linux is

4451459
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox currently surround round-corners via the border-radius and -moz-border-radius css attributes so you can achieve a circle visually with 50 border radius

4451502
folder	directory
you can use searchoption.alldirectories to recursively search down folder you just need to create the directory before you copy.

4451517
firefox	safari
some of the calls were simply ignored by internet explorer 8 firefox 3.6 and safari 5 worked fine

you probably want to include the libraries for llvm before you include the clang libraries

4451618
getdate	sysdate
the query syntax is effectively the same getdate will need to be sysdate however included as a sample inner join

4451650
nstimer	nsnotification
would i have to use nstimer or nsnotification or some combination

4451683
uiview	subviews
i m doing uiview animation on individual subviews that have a number of sibling views that i don t want affected by the single-view animation

4451725
nfa	dfa
the core idea is probably to understand that the dfa is a sort of machine that is superimposed over the nfa

4451725
nfa	dfa
each state in the dfa is a subset of the states in the nfa

4451725
nfa	dfa
the start state of the dfa is the set containing only the start state of the nfa and the accept state for the dfa is all of its states which have the accept state of the nfa as elements

4451725
nfa	dfa
an nfa is non-deterministic because its output states for a given input is a set of states but the dfa has sets of the corresponding nfa states as its own states representing which of the nfa states the automaton could be in

4451725
nfa	dfa
so the output state of any dfa state for any given input is the union of output states of all of the nfa states of that dfa state

4451725
nfa	dfa
in terms of actual implementations the dfa has a state population that is essentially the powerset of the nfa s states

4451725
nfa	dfa
in practice it s usually much smaller but there s no general way to predict it s size so some practical nfa to dfa implementations generate the dfa states dynamically as they are reached and cache them

4451750
nfa	dfa
when you construct a dfa from an nfa you basically find those sets of states that the nfa can be in a time like simulating the nfa

4451750
nfa	dfa
those may lead to another nfa state for that you find the states reachable through epsilon inputs again and you will get another set of nfa states that will be a new dfa state

4451750
nfa	dfa
the point is that the resulting dfa states will become sets of the old nfa states that are compatible regarding to epsilon transitions

4451750
nfa	dfa
it shows the nfa state sets that form the given dfa state

4451750
nfa	dfa
any dfa states that contain at least one nfa accept state will become accept states in the dfa too

4451851
children	parent
then i can have an unlimited number of parent children

4451884
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to understand why the following produces different results in ie firefox and google-chrome

4451884

now to copy the stl from c++ i m creating a map class to wrap the tree for an alternative to the python dictionary

4451932

4451935
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	getter	setter

jquery	scriptaculous	jquery-ui-autocomplete	scriptaculous
use an existing implementation of this offered by a javascript framework like prototype scriptaculous or jquery eg ajax.autocompleter jquery-ui-autocomplete

4452056
folder	directory
you can use searchoption.alldirectories to recursively search down folder you just need to create the directory before you copy.

4452063
hide	show
don t use opacity to show hide elements -- use visibility instead with the values visible or hidden

4452068
subscript	superscript
and then thereâ s the fraction slash u+2044 â and the superscript and subscript numbers at positions u+00b9 u+00b2 u+00b3 and starting at u+2070

4452072
superclass	subclassing
the problem is subclassing have an is-a relationship to their superclass

4452072
superclass	subclassing
if the subclassing took methods off semantically would it be an instance of the superclass

4452072
superclass	subclassing
you would run into all sorts of pain when you passed a subclassing in to a method that expects the superclass type which you should be able to do

4452091
integer	unsigned
generally speaking there isn t anything that an unsigned integer can do that a signed integer can t do

4452110
for-loop	loops
if you want to make an object iterable so that you can loops over it with a for-loop you have to implement __iter__ and next explained here

4452133
pop-up	dialog
when clicking the connect button in ie i get the login pop-up appear but instead of showing the login dialog it tries to display

4452184

your reference to subclassing and inherited is confusing

4452262

cpython	ironpython
now i need to use ironpython instead of cpython to serve image files

4452493
for-loop	loops
if you want to remove elements from a loops on a list of elements the trick is to use a for-loop start from the last element and go to the first element

4452506
put	get
and here s where i m trying to get the id in activity b and put it in selectedrowid

4452530

the other thing to note is that hover should work here instead of mouseenter and mouseleave

4452597
width	height
i had a really big problem where i was setting the videoview s width height to the entire display size when i still had the notification bar title bar on the screen and it was not resizing the videoview at all

post	get
i m using asp mvc 2 and i have a page which has some data on and i have a link which will execute an ajax request to get some data and post it to a div on the page

4452743
hide	show
once i have the data i d like something to become visible which i could click to toggle the visibility of the div containing the data so the user could show hide this extra information but i don t want the original link to be visible anymore

4452743
hide	show
i don t mind if the original link changes what it does so that say before the data is loaded it says show data then once it is loaded it then changes to hide data and if it is hidden it changes to show data again and if it is clicked again then it just show the div again although reloading the data from the ajax call would not be the end of the world

4453814
hash	salt
since the hash algorithm of your choice produces quite a long string 64 character composed of 0-9a-f you might want to contemplate generating a salt of random length credits to ircmaxell here and either concatenate that to the beginning or end of the password hash

the only workaround i can think of is to create a prepare statement from a dynamically created string where you can use the variables to specify the order by details and then execute that prepare statement

4455015
children	parent
specify it once in a parent pom instead and all the children should inherit the same setup.

4455057

however i ve been unable to get the plugin to execute the shortcode once it is not placed in the content area of the post

4455507
ilist	icollection
ilist is everything that icollection is but it also supports adding and removing items retrieving items by index etc

4455507
ilist	iqueryable
you can always create an iqueryable from an ilist and use linq to objects but you also find iqueryable used for deferred execution of sql statements in linq to sql and linq to entities

4455585
scheme	racket
their freshman undergraduate course starts with a first semester introduction to functional programming using scheme i think plt racket and is followed by a semester of oo programming with c++ or java.

4455706
stdout	stderr
redirects the stderr of the command to stdout so that it becomes sed s stdin

4455706
stdout	stderr
shorthand for this redirects sed s stdout to stderr

4455746
x86	mips
you would need a build targeting intel x86 a build targeting mips and a build targeting powerpc

4455747

one issue you will have is that someone with dba sa access to the database can get around anything you put in if they desire so what are you trying to protect against casual user or anyone

http.sys	httplistener
quick background i understand that httplistener uses http.sys kernel driver which supposedly makes it a great performer

4455910
post	get
what i m not sure from your question is whether you are meant to get visual studio to auto-generate a web-service proxy by adding a web-reference in your web-forms project or if you need to create and post the xml to the web-service over http yourself explicitly

4455919
public	protected
i guess i could rewrite mage_core_model_resource_transaction and add public wrappers for the protected methods but i m hesitant to override such a core class

addition	multiplication
if you think of false as of 0 and of true as of 1 then is like multiplication and || is like addition they are actually called logical multiplication and logical addition

4456107

width	height
i m loading the map into my page in an iframe that has a width and height 400 x 200

atexit	main
if the main application uses the standard c library then you can make use of the atexit 3 function to register a function to be called when the application exits

4456667
post	get
option quotes you must post data to get the information you want

opera	firefox
the easiest way would be to use browser developer tools such as firebug for firefox or opera s dragonfly to capture a utm.gif request and copy the url

4456724
freebsd	linux
i tried it on linux and it worked but on freebsd i see the results you got

4456756

4456827
width	height
i have few windows each window can be moved and re sized but with specified ratio between width and height eg

4456827
width	height
2 1 height width

4456837
post	get
on the other hand if the post snippet classes do have different behavior depending on type then a better solution would be to use duck typing to get the output you want

4456838
post	get
the simplest would be to enforce by convention that all views only use get and post arguments and otherwise take some standard set of arguments request template_name

4456849
viewmodel	caliburn
when you re using caliburn micro it will automatically map keys in the query string to properties on the viewmodel

4456926
inline	inlining	children	parent
for this my rule is only to inline children into parent to prevent infinite recursion but this precludes sibling functions inlining once into each other

4456926
inline	inlining
as mentioned i broke this regress by only allowing inlining a recursive call to a child preventing sibling recursions being inline

4456926
inline	inlining
if all the calls to a function are inline we should get rid of the function if it has not been inline into yet otherwise we ll waste time inlining into a function which is no longer used

4456926
polymorphism	specialization	inline	inlining
this makes the inlining routine extremely complex for example type-class instances replace abstract functions whenever possible due to type specialization when calling a polymorphism function it may be possible to find an instance whilst inlining so now we have a new function we can inline

4456966
post	get
my second question is - how might i modify the request part of this to do a post instead of get

4456983
post	get	post	put	put	get

4457098
google-chrome	firefox
the code works as expected in firefox but not ie or google-chrome

4457118
width	height
width and height are override properties of the stage

4457118
width	height
anyway you can alternatively set the width and height of the map object by assigning values to those properties map.width and map.height if you don t want to use their not-so-convenient setsize method

4457141
queue	fifo
i m looking for a way to serialize the requests into a fifo style queue meaning that any ajax request that s made check messages check contacts send message can be pushed onto the queue and will execute as soon as the previous ajax call is complete 100 done and returned

4457145
hash	salt
given a salt an attacker can build what s known as a rainbow table that s basically a reverse of the hash function

4457172
post	get
if so iphone app should get the page with the form and then post using the csrf token

4457201
hash	salt
the hacker has everything he wants except the users passwords which dont give anything he hasnt got already apart from the opperunity to spoof a user access -- which he can do very simply by putting his own hash and salt in the database

4457201
salt	md5
so yes md5 plus salt is good enough security in this case

innodb	myisam
some people have said that for reads myisam is faster but recent improvements in innodb have either alleviated or eradicated this difference

4459983
innodb	myisam
there s also a lot of foreign keys which require innodb anyway so those will stay as innodb but i would like to know if i m right to change the tables that are mostly read from and have no foreign keys to myisam or whether this is a pointless thing to do with the latest versions of the two storage engines being used

4461323
versioning	upgrade
now there can be an issue with clients that are linked with different versioning of subversion i noticed this back when i upgrade tortoisesvn that used the new versioning 1.6 subversion libs but still used the old ankhsvn that was linked to v1.5 as a result tortoise automatically upgrade the wcs which meant ankh no longer recognised them

4462416
hide	show
so then when the checkbox named 04 is checked we look in its rel field for the id of the object to hide or show

if it s not working i suggest saving it in some properties and after changing the content you can set the saved width and height to the button

4462637
int	chars
answers are correct except nobody mentioned the reason c++ int promotions require that chars type is promoted to int in expression had the types be different the answer would be quite different as well

4462658

x86	64bit
i did finally resolve this it turns out that the code is not the issue in my case but instead i had used a 32 bit version of the system.data.sqlite.dll and compiled my test assembly as x86 to get it to work correctly and my other assemblies as anycpu which on my system meant 64bit

4463026
jmenubar	jmenuitem
with 2 jmenuitem added to a jmenu which is finally added to the jmenubar

4463031
printf	strtod
others have already commented that 23.345466467 does not exist as a float but if your goal is just round-trip conversion of float values that do exist without accidentally changing their value slightly you can either use printf and strtod with at least decimal_dig places posix but not plain iso c guarantees this round-trip to be exact or print the float in hex instead of decimal

mouseenter and mouseleave events

4463384
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave events

4463384
mouseleave	mouseenter
if css doesn t do it for you you re looking for the mouseenter and mouseleave events which are ie-specific but emulated by jquery on all other browsers

4463384
mouseover	mouseout
the reason you had trouble with mouseover and mouseout is that they bubble and so your mouseout handler on your parent element was seeing the bubbled mouseout from the underlying element when your mouse moved into the delete element

4463384
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave don t bubble and so they don t have that problem

4463390
mouseleave	mouseenter
have you tried using mouseenter and mouseleave events instead

the default is any cpu change the setting to x86 to match your unmanaged dll and you should be fine regardless if you run on a 64bit or 32-bit os

4463468
pthreads	fork
if that won t work you really should think about whether fork is the right tool for the job i ve seen a lot of fork -related questions here probably as a result of some old-timer professor with his head buried in the 70s not being aware that pthreads are the tool for most such jobs

4463488
client-side	server-side
usually this is done server-side but i can understand how if this is a simple one-page production you might want to do it client-side

4463521

you could try to populate the hough domain with m and c parameters instead so that y mx + c can be re-written as c y - mx so instead of the usual rho x cos theta + y sin theta you have c y - mx

4463546
performselector	delegation
the detail view controller then can use that delegation pointer to send messages to the list view controller either directly via willsetvalue or indirectly via performselector withobject . when using performselector withobject it is generally a good idea to call respondstoselector on the delegation first to make sure you won t throw an exception should the object not respond to that message

4463568
children	parent
the children are automatically deleted when the parent is deleted

4463616
backgroundworker	dispatchertimer
your best bet if you don t want to use the filesystemwatcher is to either use a dispatchertimer or a loop within a backgroundworker - for what you re doing i would highly recommend the dispatchertimer as it processes on the ui thread which means you can safely update your datagrid without any threading issues

mouseup	mousedown
you can pretty easily set changes to occur on the normal sorts of visible states hover focus mousedown mouseup and it ll animate those state changes correctly from whatever state you re in to whatever other state you need

4463786
mouseup	mousedown
if the kind of change you re looking for is more extensive changing the type of control to say a contentcontrol and then catching the mousedown mouseup events from there might be a better workaround

4463791
versioning	upgrade
if nothing else works- and it well might i am not an iphone developer just an ipad user- you could try going with only one versioning of your application with the pro versioning existing as an in-app upgrade

the divs to show hide are

4463871
dialogresult	invokerequired
when it was removed from the property as such the codebihind still had the dialogresult cancel for it - so my form was indeed closing and of course it was missing the handle so the invokerequired didn t return correct info and hence the errors

4463875

int	chars
ry is an int 0 is a chars

4464062
int	chars
in java it is possible to upward-cast chars to int

4464062
int	chars
that is int - chars as far as types are concerned

4464062
int	chars
thus your java vm will automagically cast the chars to int which will make both arguments of the minus match typewise

4464062
int	chars
you can check that by changing the declaration of rz from int rz to chars rz the compile will then complain that you re trying to assign a int the result of the subtraction to a chars variable rz without an explicit cast

boost	stl
boost is fine stl is fine

4464226
width	height
if you want to do truly customizable width and height there is no built-in feature that i m aware of that is equipped to do this

4464226
width	height
could you use a set width and a variable height or vice versa

4464235
hide	show
instead i was hoping there was a way i could show hide checkboxes via the change changestart function

4464238
hash	salt
instead it is usually best to store a one-way hash such as using sha1 of the password combined with a random salt

4464238
hash	salt
you can combine the salt with the password and generate a one-way hash as follows

4464238
hash	salt
store both the hash password and the salt

4464238
hash	salt
when authenticating a user use the same salt as that used when creating the stored hash to hash the password entered by the user

4464290
folder	directory
i could probably create a virtual directory on the admin application to point to the root s views shared folder but it d be nice not to have to do that as it seems a bit of a hack

4464323
vbscript	vba	vbscript	jscript
the secret to using the common dialog from vbscript or vba or jscript for that matter is that you have to have its license installed on your machine

4464441
submit	submission
this creates 2 buttons the insert being the submission button so i refer to it as the submit button

4464446
google-chrome	safari

4464485
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to test whether a user closed a pop-up dialog or not

firefox and google-chrome do both utilize javascript and css but they are fundamentally different in their structure

4464520
submit	submission
if you use jquery you could simply catch the form submission from a submit button like so

4464540

hash	md5
will the md5 cryptographic hash function output be same in all programming languages

4464712
children	parent
most programmatic approaches i ve seen try to assume all controls are direct children of the same parent container

4464730
hash	md5
often unintended whitespace or capitalization result in different md5 hash for what was assumed to be identical data

4464755
google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in google-chrome and firefox but in ie 8 the live event will not fire the first time i uncheck a box

4464758

4464864
hash	md5
d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e is the md5 hash of an empty string so somewhere you have failed to fill your string with something more useful.

4464864
hash	md5
as luck would have it your hash is simply the result of md5 is very common

4464878
getter	setter
if you re going to this level of complexity and mucking up your object model just because you don t want to have getter and setter do it in groovy instead

4464878
getter	setter
they will have to override get which you re basically using to encapsulate your getter and setter anyway why not just add that method and delegate to those other methods and write specific logic which is likely to degrade with time

4464910
jar	war
i had all my jar files in webcontent web-inf lib directory of my project - i soon realised that when i export this as a war file and deploy in tomcat it takes these jar files with it and stores them local to the application

4464910
folder	directory
so i removed all the jars out of my projects lib folder and put them in the common lib directory

4464922
getter	setter
it become very difficult to write non-trivial getter setter in future

4464971
nsurl	nsdata

profiling	benchmarking
i ve tried looking into benchmarking profiling tools but i haven t found anything good

4465093
width	height
use externalinterface to call a javascript function in the wrapper html this will change the dimensions of the height width of the enclosing div that wraps your .swf embd embed at width 100 and height 100 alternatively use swfobject to get a handle on the embedded object and change the height width properties to match

4465099
mouseup	mousedown
i want to catch both mousedown and mouseup using gesture recognizer

4465099

4465399
stdout	stderr
everything i said here about stdin fd 0 should be applicable to stdout fd 1 and stderr fd 2 except that they will both be writable rather than readable

4465408
boost	stl
c++ has stl and boost

4465433
hash	md5
you don t even need to use md5 all you need is a hash function that produces few collisions but uniqueness is not necessary

4465468
entity-relationship	diagram
i ve got some entity-relationship diagram representing several thousand tables in a database

4465495
cpu	processors
at about double the number of threads as the number of execution units that the processors has the number of cpus times the number of cores on each cpu x2 if the cores can be hyper-threaded your computer will start spending more time scheduling threads than it spends running them

4465509
fadein	fadeout
i am creating effects in my air application using actionscript like fadein and fadeout

happy	alex
i have happy and alex in the build-tools field for both executables but cabal ignores that and then complains that it cannot find the modules that happy and alex should be generating

4465668
disk	ram
if it doesn t have enough ram to keep the relevant parts of the database in memory then disk speed of that server is crucial

4465683
google-chrome	safari
when i checked those buttons in safari they looked different than in any other browser even google-chrome

4465683
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
in general buttons looks the same in firefox ie6-8 opera and google-chrome

4465683
google-chrome	safari
but in safari buttons have 3px of unknown extra space on left and right sides so buttons looks wider in safari rather than in google-chrome or other browser

4465683
google-chrome	safari
total width of button in safari web inspector 6px larger than in google-chrome web inspector

4465683
google-chrome	safari
since safari and google-chrome have same layout engine webkit i m in a little embarrassment

i have a uinavigationcontroller -based app that only supports portrait but need to push one view that requires landscape

4465708
portrait	landscape
i ve found a previous post that describes how to allow mixed rotations for a single view but what is the process for forcing a single view when pushed to be in landscape then returning the app to portrait mode when the view is popped

4465761

shadowing	named
the easiest improvement is just to use functions instead of vars and avoid shadowing the method named with the argument named so it s clearer whether you are calling a recursive function or not

4465826
post	get
another service may have strayed from a rest best practice and uses a get request to a specific url to post data and then you will have to know the query string format and use your http library or tool to munge it up for you based on it s apis

4465826
post	get
if your use case is to post data at a url resource using xml over http just get any library out there for your development system that supports http requests and tell it to make a post request to that url with your xml data

4465843
width	height
so i also check to see if formrectangle top left width and height are not all 0 before returning true

4465844
int	chars
i would also recommend against int for nrcombinations because with only six chars with your base 36 alphabet you will get in trouble 36 6 2 31

4465859
hash	salt
in fact the only reason to transmit passwords hash hash + salt or otherwise over the network is in order to adhere to a legacy system or a system that otherwise has what i would call legacy requirements

4465898
width	height
i need to find the entire size also called logical area of a tscrollbox - as opposite to visible area that you get via width and height property or clientwidth clientheight

4465937
hash	salt
hash the password with sha512 along with a unique per-user salt then either base64 encode or hex encode each byte of the input becomes the 2-digit hex value of that byte

it can be less than height and width if the scrollbox logical area is not bigger than phisical area scrollbars not visible in that case

4466018
width	height
from altar comments i can add the logical height and or width is not the problem

div on the center of the page i want them draggable are icons when you drag them and then drop them on a folder on the left it will be move there

4466084
getter	setter
if you implemented you own getter and or setter check that you are retaining and releasing everything properly

4466088
qobject	qmetaobject	classname	inherited
note if the class were inherited from qt s qobject i could easily use qmetaobject classname to get the class name

4466099
setinterval	settimeout
also note that greasemonkey has some caveats about how to use setinterval and settimeout

4466102
ostream	istream
the poco library requires an istream for input and ostream for output to compress data using its zlib wrapper

4466130
stdout	fflush	puts	fflush
which puts 2 into the stdout output buffer but does not fflush it

4466130
stdout	fflush
the child executes exit 0 which as a side-effect fflush stdout

4466130
stdout	fflush
the parent executes exit 0 which as a side-effect fflush stdout

4466130
stdout	fflush
if you put fflush stdout

4466134
ostream	istream
you could use normal istream and ostream objects and use the pubsetbuf method of their streambuf s to set the internal buffer of the stream to the internal buffer of the vector

4466135
magento	oscommerce	cart	oscommerce
please don t take offense if i suggest that if you are having these problems and you are attempting to build a shopping cart that you instead utilize a mature ecommerce solution like magento or oscommerce

4466150
boost	allocator
no need to use boost even if it s nice or to split allocator between lines with multiple indirection this is quite bad as it usually gives big performance penalty when accessing data and it fragments memory

4466150
boost	stl
obviously even if the above code is still simple and straightforward stl or boost does it well hence no need to reinvent the wheel

4466153
put	get
is there a way to get nhibernate to just put the correct masterid in the initial insert rather than running an update afterwards

4466283
subscript	superscript

4466306
mousemove	mouseleave	hide	show
you need three things an absolutely positioned div that s not nested in anything else parent is a mousemove event handler to show the div and move it around and a mouseleave handler to hide it

4466357
width	height
setting only the width or height of an img element causes the image to be proportionately scaled

4466387
equals	gethashcode
if they re value types your class needs to override equals and gethashcode

4466387
equals	gethashcode
if they re objects the equals and gethashcode implementations that you inherit from system.object will use reference equality to determine whether two objects are the same and therefore should be treated as the same key in the dictionary which is what you want

4466387
equals	gethashcode
so as long as you don t inherit from something that itself overrides equals and gethashcode you don t need to do anything special to use an object as a key

min	max
max field1 then min field1 || ||max field1 else min field1 end

post	get
html-forms uses either post or get

4466537
post	get
stick with post on any action that does more than get data avoid xss-issues

4466539
for-loop	loops
if you are using a for-loop to iterate over the different images you need to set your constraints on loops itself not the content of loops

4466548
put	get
to get to the original object you want to put the function code in a closure and make a reference to the object outside the closure where you still have the correct reference to this

4466569
put	get
for get requests - just put it in the parameter line

4466575
children	parent
i could attach event handlers to each of the children however the child already knows about its parent so having the child inform the parent directly seems like the way to go

4466598
post	get
no problem if you use scripting on the same domain if you want to use cross domain just provide each page .php html etc that call each other an exchange paramater query safely using post get

4466621

so hypothetically you could have a web container that would end up returning bunny.class from the jar file instead of the one from the root hierarchy of the war file

4466670
innodb	myisam
i know that myisam is supposed to read faster but innodb doesn t have to lock the entire table on writes

4466672
128bit	64bit
as far as i know movq supports at most one memory operand and its arguments are of 64bit size anyway so even if two memory operands were supported it still wouldn t give you that atomic 128bit copy you re looking for

4466704
innodb	myisam
myisam supports fts but innodb does not

4466719
children	parent
when using for xml the order of the result set must have the parent xml nodes before their children in general xml files should not rely on being ordered

4467068
ant	maven
does anyone have any ideas why a test would pass when run with ant but fail when run with maven

4467078
getter	setter
in particular having those function definitions readily available to the compiler at the call site may enable inlining which for setter getter usually improves both speed and size of the executable

4467082
firefox	safari
but error is different between safari and firefox

4467082

4467196
hide	show
essentially upon clicking no the onclick event you want to hide div a and show div b

4467450
daemons	systemd
the focus at the moment is on nodejs-based web servers and network-based applications but the modules link includes many other things including parsers daemons and bindings to linux s notification systemd just to give you a taste of the diversity there

4467460
put	get
the code is quite straightforward i firstly parse the xml and get all the product nodes and put them into a nodelist and the productlist is an arraylist

to me it is better to create methods like mousedown mouseup and etc in the dragstate

4467659
firefox	safari
i m primarily using firefox on pc and mac but it seems to do the same thing on ie pc and safari mac

4467740
firefox	safari
i don t know why it works but the drawback is it essentially removes the cross-fade envelope in ie it doesn t appear to visibly affect firefox or safari

4467749
allocator	stl
the full declaration of unordered_map as well as of all stl containers includes allocator as the last parameter

4467767

can i specify width and height via options or something rather than dragging the handlers

4467916
dbcontext	objectcontext
in entity framework you have objectcontext and dbcontext

4467922

wordpress	joomla
yesterday i started to write website content on and support customers of plugin s for example captchas etc. supporting different web cmses content management systems on different platforms mainly php-based ones like wordpress joomla drupal etc. though they can be for any non-php cms like dotnetnuke

4467952
range	minimum
it should also be noted that there is sometimes a range of minimum and maximum bit rates that can be employed so that at no time can the bit rate be less than x or more than y

4467968
wordpress	joomla
it would be helpful to read some tutorials on the various cmses that you ll be supporting the most popular ones are definitely wordpress drupal and joomla but like you said there are others

4467970
hide	show
you should either always show your actions on the screen or if they are unimportant or infrequent hide them behind another action button like a + or wrench icon

4467975
width	height
sure define a javascript object which has a function that takes in a width and height parameter

4467975
width	height
it should return your desired font size based on that width and height

4467995
client-side	server-side
php is a server-side language javascript is purely client-side

4468030
udp	tcp
even the tcp extensions to the ice specification note that tcp connections are much less likely to succeed than udp connections between natted peers

4468030
udp	tcp
that said you can workaround this by routing tcp packets over a udp bridge including all of the error correction and flow control features

width	height
about the above link image dimensions the question is - i have lots of dynamic images on my site that are uploaded via a cms and therefore vary in height width

4468096
put	get	width	height
b use php s getimagesize function to get the image dimension dynamically and put it in the img tag as a width and height

4468096
width	height
c update our database to store the width height per image i m already querying other info from the image table in my database such as the text for the alt attribute and then access those columns for the img tag on the front end

4468258
bazaar	svn
have you looked at using bzr-svn which is a tool for working with svn repositories by checking out using bazaar

4468258
bazaar	svn
you will want to take a look at the documentation for bzr-svn which describes how to simply check out from svn with bazaar

4468258
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
also for svn you would have to set up a local svn server repo on your machine not as simple as git mercurial bazaar

4468274
wordpress	joomla
i want to create a cms website and i want to create component or plugin for my cms.who can show me the solution create module or component or plugin same wordpress or joomla

you use it by replacing calls to malloc realloc strdup etc

4468325
pull	push
i am not sure what you mean since your example includes 2 identical url but urls for push and pull can differ because of

4468393
put	get
too late but usually i get flots fixed by adding or an absolute width a number in pixels points or any hard measure system instead on em and so or sometimes to put a min-width property solves it also beware of padding and borders because of the boxmodel sum

4468409
switching	screens
this is my code when i add the coarse criteria the gps does not go on no gps flashing logo on the top of the screens and when i use the fine criteria i dont get any thing from the network.......so do i have to write criteria for both and switching between them for what ever is available or can they both be in the same criteria

4468426
hide	show
why the less size is hide scollbar because the scrollbar some times is made because the one div is too big to fit the father div and the father div create scollbar to show it all

4468446
post	get
if you post a form to an aspx page you can get the submitted values through the request.form collection

4468455

4468510
fontfamily	font-size
how do i set the font-size and fontfamily for an iframe css or jquery

4468598
diagramming	flowchart
it is not a dedicated flowchart or diagramming package but it s core use case-- efficient and aesthetic rendering of objects comprised of nodes and edges obviously subsumes flowchart drawing--particularly because its api allows the user to set various constraints on the layout to encourage rendering in the various formats--eg you can require all nodes of the same level same number of parents from the root to be rendered in a single center-aligned row

4468633
rapidsvn	tortoisesvn
some clients like tortoisesvn cache some of these but not sure about rapidsvn

4468707
viewmodel	caliburn
i have followed exactly what was specified in the caliburn documentation and i saw a post earlier that mentioned something about iconventionmanager but my concern is that even by putting the rescue method directly on the viewmodel class itself the rescue method never gets called

4468809
rss	feed
i want to aggregate various rss feed from various websites and display them in the main site page as blog entries

if you can t find any orphans it would tend to indicate that there s an issue with your ordering the parent is in the rowset but appears after the children

4468855
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have overcome this by setting the widths in javascript jquery which offers a cross-browser solution tested in ie7 ie8 firefox google-chrome safari opera

hide	show
but the state of the show hide sections is reseted

4468963
hide	show
the show hide action is done with jquery toggle

4469011
hide	show
in the case you ve described you want the sections show hide status to be kept between pages for a single client

4469033
children	parent
as for your multiple source folders a multi-module maven project would probably be the best fit with a and b being children of some new parent project

4469036
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome works quite well though

4469044
google-chrome	firefox
this bug only appears in firefox - google-chrome does not appear to exhibit this problem leading me to believe that this may be a problem with either firefox s javascript engine or the greasemonkey add-on

4469046
background-repeat	background-image	background-repeat	background-position	background-image	background-position

4469455
nhibernate	automapper
you can do that either by using nhibernate projections and transformers or by using a tool like automapper

ostringstream	std
and while to maintain its illusion of being a stream a std ostringstream can t be directly copied it can be moved

4472333
children	parent
with inverse attribute on children property child is responsible for itself otherwise parent is responsible for deleting a child

4472333
children	parent
you do not need both properties children parent in most cases you need them if you specify inverse true on children

4472338
width	height
and apparently if i were to try that i d learn it doesn t work - ok well width and height definitely seem to be attributes of elements as far as ie is concerned

4472347

i logged into my dx account and found to my surprise that dx was offering me an upgrade to a new hotfix versioning of the same 2008.3 release even though my subscription is expired

4472586
lisp	scheme
bringing in a language like ruby or lisp doesn t make sense because javascript is a powerful dynamic language very close to scheme

4472589

ant	maven
most likely the ant build sets some sort of properties for the environment either via your ant script and properties files directly or via the ant task you are using and the maven build does not do that

4472962
ant	maven
that in turn leaves you with different test runtime configurations failing in maven but not in ant

4472974
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the advantage to this is that when you install the msi it installs everything for ie firefox safari google-chrome and opera as well as other browsers which are compatible with the same plugin technologies that those browsers use

4472974
versioning	upgrade
that means that you don t have to worry about supporting uninstalling 10 different old installer versioning that put things in different places etc because the msi system takes care of uninstalling everything cleanly when you upgrade

versioning	upgrade
few days back i upgrade my xcode versioning to 3.2.5 and i am not able to see ios sdk 4.0 in it

4473043

i succeed when i m looking for get messages or status codes but i don t know why it doesn t work for the post requests

you can however put multiple uiviews inside the uiscrollview and you ll be able to scroll the views to get where you want to but i don t think that s what you re aiming for.

4473449
ant	maven
in other words you have to forget ant and start using maven

4473540
punctuation	words
the key part being you keep two parallel lines of text one that you check for words to translate and the other you check for punctuation if your translation search comes up with a hit

4473680
post	put
204 - no content possible response for successful put post delete

4473707
nsurl	nsstring
but instead of accessing controls in view controller s views directly it d be better to declare the url string as a nsstring property called say urlstring in webviewcontroller and set it to filestring before the presentmodalviewcontroller call and don t create the nsurl etc there

4473707
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
finally in webviewcontroller in viewwillappear or viewdidappear create the nsurl using urlstring create the nsurlrequest and call loadrequest

4473724
pull	push
do i need to pull the entire array element modify and and push it back in again

4473788

post	get
get and post requests can be syntactically equivalent.

4474233
post	get
the difference is entirely semantic - post requests are expected to do something while get s are supposed to be safe always

4474235
instances	transient
basically it s reusing transient component instances for constructor injection with

versioning	upgrade
for what it s worth .net versioning upgrade are mostly backwards compatible

4474270
versioning	upgrade
there really isn t a big deal in .net upgrade as opposed to say java versioning upgrade which i ve seen break things in new and mysterious ways

4474289
zoo	xts
i suggest switching to a time series class like xts or zoo

4474289
zoo	xts
if you re ready for xts or zoo this should work in either then i suggest using rollapply to get the forward look assuming you want the forward looking return which makes it a lot easier to form portfolios today and see how it works into the future

4475238
equals	gethashcode
regarding checking to see if the collection already contains the object have you properly overriden equals and gethashcode

4475238
equals	gethashcode
in your class you need to override the equals and gethashcode methods to implement your desired method of determining equality

4475246
versioning	upgrade
i should note that versioning 2.3.9 is not the latest versioning of the 2.3.x branch and you should upgrade the the latest versioning available

4475256
width	height
turns out i can prevent the app from crashing by removing the width and height from the pushpin

4475256
width	height
the microsoft solution didn t include pushpin width and height - so i assumed creating the map control dynamically was the answer - but adding the width and height - same crash as my original app

4475256
width	height
i need to change my code back to the original version with the map control in the xaml - and remove the pushpin width and height to see if it solves both versions - but this seems to be the problem - my app is now running fine - dynamically created map control - pushpin with no width or height

4475260
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
maven or similar build tools help avoid this situation by allowing you to commit just your source and a pom.xml file which describes the compilation of the project sort of like an ant file this way it can be built by anyone with maven from the command line furthermore plugins provide the ability to generate the ide specific files for users for example i use the flexmojos flexbuilder plugin at work or eclipse eclipse to generate the project files for flexbuilder or eclipse

so if you upgrade to a new versioning of jquery say 1.4.5 and you wanted to make sure that the client got the most current versioning of the file you change the end of the url

4475327
pydev	virtualenv
if this works anything like ipython you will need to install pydev inside of your virtualenv

4475337

4475368
opera	firefox
these tags donâ t work at all in firefox 3.6.11 and opera 11.0 â regardless of the css display property they simply donâ t parse correctly

4475368
opera	firefox
you get the correct result in webkit firefox 4 and opera 11.11

4475368
opera	firefox
but you get this in opera 11.0 and firefox 3.6

4475399
versioning	upgrade
i ve released a lite versioning of an app that i want to then sell the pro upgrade for - without having to release a totally new versioning

i m using a fragment shader to change 16bit unsigned integer data to 8bit bitmap using window level and window hight linear ramp and display on screen

4475432
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it on google-chrome 8 and firefox 4

4475434
imei	udid
maybe apple has a private database containing udid to imei mappings

4475504
post	get
if i understand the linked post correctly this does not necessarily mean that it will work now probably not but you will get an exception giving you more details about the problem

4475505
width	height
i know i have to find the width of each rectangle which would be the distance between a and b divided by the amount of intervals the height can be calculated by using the equation y x 2 where x would be where each interval is located on the x-axis

4475505
width	height
to find the area of those rectangles i would multiply the width which would be the same for all rectangles times the height

4475540
integer	unsigned
for example an array of 32 bit unsigned integers of which all 32 bits available for each integer

4475540
integer	unsigned
padding bits are user-accessible in an unsigned integer type

4475545
serializable	deserialization
if your object implements the iserializable interface you can control all the data that is stored serializable yourself and you can control the deserialization

4475560
wav	ogg
ok i have some progress i can play ogg files but not wav dunno why

4475585
min	max
traversing the container finding min max find next prev sort of

ssl	https
don t forget the https part - git will send your password hashed but unencrypted over the wire so be sure to use ssl

4475609
pbkdf2	salt
when encrypting the private key use something like pbkdf2 with salt and some fairly large number it iterations

4475613
hide	show
to show all checkboxes but how can i hide someone

4475617
translation	localization
just create a new folder with suffix like values-cs and put the xml with czech strings in it and the whole app will be translation to czech if you have set czech localization in your phone

4475672
width	height
it works fine except the width and height

4475672
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this on google-chrome and firefox

4475689
int	chars
if you want to be portable either only use unsigned chars fixed-sized int a c99 addition or determine the number of value-bits programatically

4475689
integer	unsigned
in case of unsigned types the resulting integer has 32 value bits and a precision of 32

4475689
integer	unsigned
now if you access a 32-bit signed integer as an unsigned integer which is explicitly allowed and does not violate the c99 aliasing rules the padding bit becomes a user-accessible value bit

4475728
inherited	properties
when you setup inherited for entities the parent entity s properties are inherited

4475738
width	height
i could not reproduce the problem with the most basic page see below so perhaps it s an issue with some other css that s overriding the height and width

4475789
serializable	deserialization
here is a very stripped down version of the stringtype class as well as some tests that show that serializable deserialization work for stringtype by itself but not when as a field on userdata

4475792
width	height
id +id height 400 width 1150 modal false refreshonshow true

4475837
hash	salt
i can t use the best practice of only storing a salt hash of the password in the database

4475890
actionscript	mxml
i want to use actionscript 3 to create mxml flex 4 controls dynamically and automatically taking care of layout

4475893
put	get
you ll have to loop trough all elements preceding the first h1 including and put them into intro str intro then get everything up to the 2nd h1 into chapter1

4475900
int	double
error cannot convert â double unsigned int int n + -0x00000000000000001 + 1 â to â double â for argument â 1â to â bool checkarray double â

4475903
width	height
so what i have now is those gif images scaling with the height and subsequent width of the browser

4475939
google-chrome	firefox
i have it working in firefox google-chrome but not in ie

4475973
hex	binary
to do this i found the string stored in the binary file and replaced the ascii for e with a at the offset in the binary i assume it s the data section where the string is stored using vi s hex editor

4476013
maven-plugin	pom.xml
add maven-plugin to pom.xml

4476068
typedef	struct
typedef struct dato

4476085
addition	modulo
make sure you use a modulo addition so the texture wraps nicely

4476089
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i put the following code in touchesbegan as well as in touchesmoved

4476122
children	parent
essentially float the parent so they re next to each other don t float the children so they appear vertically as a list does by default

4476136
versioning	upgrade
the problem you encountered now is just one of the problems and there are many more problems specially around the issue schema changes done during an application versioning upgrade

4476137
width	height
the midpoint y co-ordinate and also the height of the top is 5 + 7 2 or 6 and the width is 2 so the area is 12

4476200
configobj	configparser
i recently switched from configparser to configobj and i m thrilled to have done so

4476212
put	get
it calls http get method and rest service code shown below will get inventory data of specified id database primary id and i put the ajax responsetext into the div id inventoryitem

4476220
google-chrome	firefox
the last one is under the first one but under ie7 firefox google-chrome

4476266
macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew	fink	macports
other options are to install a python 2.6 using macports fink or homebrew or build it yourself a little tricky to get all the batteries included

4476268
tcpdf	fpdf
i have one for fpdf but i can t get it to work in tcpdf

4476289
int	double
although you ve subsquently said that you actually have a double available to store the information i thought i might still share some thoughts on doing this with a 32 bit int

4476289
integer	unsigned
the largest number that can be represented by an unsigned 32 bit integer is 4 294 967 295 and we we have a score range of 0 to 1 000 000

4476292
primes	modulus
check the modulus of n with respect to a list of small primes

4476307
querypath	phpquery
while this is a case where regexs would work okayish the general consensus is that you should use querypath or phpquery or alike to extract html

4476315
width	height
width height is the texture size in pixel

4476356
iboutlet	ibaction
however it s appropriate to hook one ibaction with multiple iboutlet

4476366
int	chars
as i think every programming language compares an int and a chars on behave of ascii value of chars

4476373
post	get
post or get

4476397
scheme	prolog
he seems to recall the basic prolog unification backtracking algorithm is very straightforward an exercise in a late chapter of a popular scheme text perhaps

4476426
rss	feed
is there any tools available that automatically notify you by email or rss feed of any change in a page by authentifying and checking if the value of a specific field changed

4476437
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
but are you sure you are using touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended from the appropriate view ie not the view you want to move

4476452
post	get
look into the msdn documentation and examples about system.net.webclient doesn t lend itself as well to post favours get for quick usage methods

4476481
getter	setter
now we want to add custom methods to the jaxb generated classes so that the object would know more about itself rather than being a simple pojo with getter and setter

4476488
put	get
for some reason when i put my header file in i get this error expected init-declarator before int or void

4476497
multicastdelegate	delegation
the standard multicastdelegate wouldn t be suitable for dispatching events since each subscriber should receive a different unsubscription delegation but unsubscribing events wouldn t require a linear search through an invocation list

4476499
glut	sdl
is there any cel shading tutorial out there that uses glut sdl

4476508
background-color	transparency
and the default for background-color is transparency

4476508
background-color	transparency
the image should still show up though if it s found so i m guessing it s not and instead the transparency background-color is being shown

4476526
gif	png
should i use or for loading svg files into a page in a way similar to loading a jpg gif or png

4476547
move	drag
something like windows explorer right click move slightly and you get the adorner to indicate a drag drop in operation

4476577
glut	sdl
try the linux glut or linux sdl versions

4476644
hash	salt
hash the password sha256 with salt i use the same salt for every password

4476654
for-loop	loops
while there are a couple of problems with the code you ve posted the biggest issue is using a for-loop where it would be more natural to use a while loops

4476717
hash	salt
this means if the salt is compromised so are all the hash values

4476724
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
hash a combination of the username and password md5 password + salt + username

4476726
rational-numbers	integer
if you limit yourself to rational-numbers you can express the steps with integers and divide the integer index by a single denominator as you convert each entry to a float if you have to have it in that form

4476735
udp	tcp
this client api uses normal tcp sockets udp sockets c++ namespaces and parts of the stl like std map and std vector and will be published as a set of header files and .a and .lib files to link against

4476735
g++	gcc
does it make sense to use gcc g++ under windows

4476788
udp	tcp
so_sndbuf i think only matters for tcp in udp whatever you send goes directly out to the network

4476804
octal	decimal	octal	hex
when using scanf and its variants the format specifier i will accept data as hex prefixed 0x octal prefixed 0 or decimal no prefix so for example the strings 0x10 020 and 16 are all converted to an integer with decimal value 16

4476804
octal	decimal	octal	hex
in case you might be wondering i am implementing an expression evaluator and i would like allowed integer operands to be hex octal or decimal using the c c++ prefix convention

4476810
post	put
not sure but i believe this is because of prototype using post tunneling to achieve put method

4476810
post	get
also even though ajax is being called my java file with jax-rs annotated witn post is not even being called get version is working with separate data so this is the right file since the first line of its method that spit message is not showing up so i suspect my ajax statement has some bug or there is something beyond my thinking

4476826
swt	swing
i can see though that if i scaled out my application to an enterprise level mvc design requiring richer interactions with users that using swt and jface may not be as suitable as using swing

4476870
getter	setter
maybe another thing is getter setter

4476881
executable	upx
you may try upx - ultimate packer for executable

4476898
many-to-many	one-to-many
having two one-to-many relationships in opposite direction is not the same thing as having a many-to-many relationship

4476919
imap	nntp
technically it supports both imap and pop as well as nntp but not all capabilities functions are available for pop

4476965
jobs	cron
now when i compile and login as an admin local development dashboard doesn t show cron jobs link

4476973

i use preventdefault in my jquery functions to prevent submit buttons from submission the normal way

4476977
submit	submission
in that script i don t submit the form since i normally want to check over the submission first

4477029
inherited	properties
the purpose of the extends keyword is for when you want secondclass to inherited the properties and methods of firstclass

4477076
post	get
i am trying to get popular post using the coment count

4477142
implements	extends
think of it as the abstact class that hibernate s jpa implementation eclipselink extends implements

4477165
int	double
value types in c# are either user-defined structs enumerations and numeric types such as int float double decimal etc. see the documentation on value types for more information

4477240
getter	setter
besides this kind of object typically consists of just getter and setter and can be written very quickly .

datamapper	activerecord
especially with rails 3 orms are pluggable - you can easily use datamapper or sequel instead of activerecord

4477467
concave	angle	concave	convex
remember that you can use a dot product to determine how sharp an angle is and a vector product to distinguish between convex and concave angle

4477479
jobs	cron
used on some bdd the host only provides some php script jobs no cron and mail are sent to gmail

4477480
google-chrome	firefox
for that i got error in ie that says invalid argument interesting that in firefox and google-chrome that aproach worked

4477554
versioning	upgrade
you ll also need to increment the productcode and packagecode to reflect that this is an upgrade versioning of the application

4477563
pop-up	dialog
pop-up dialog and blinking should be used very sparingly

4477569
sorting	grouping
note if you don t need the sorting with grouping by you can add order by null to improve performance

4477630
g++	gcc
then you can compile your api with mingw g++ gcc on windows using msys

4477633
integer	unsigned
size_t is an unsigned integer type guaranteed to support the longest object for the platform you use

4477658
yacc	bison
the traditional tools to use to do that are lex and yacc or their somewhat more modern cousins flex and bison

4477661
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
this is mainly useful for malloc calloc realloc

4477684
datamapper	activerecord
if you don t want to use activerecord at all then i would encourage you to look at either datamapper or mongoid

4477684
datamapper	activerecord
datamapper provides much of the same functionality as activerecord and some have been known to prefer the syntax

4477714
hex	binary
i forgot and also how to convert from hex to binary

4477720
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 534.7 khtml like gecko google-chrome 7.0.517.44 safari 534.7 gzip gfe user agent note that gzip gfe is added by appengine front end

winpcap	libpcap	winpcap	wireshark	libpcap	wireshark
wireshark leverages libpcap on unix platforms and its port winpcap on windows

4477748
packets	pcap
this library provides an api to capture packets wireshark is also able to capture frames but i haven t found in pcap docs that pcap is able to do that

4477748
winpcap	libpcap
libpcap or tcpdump on unix depending on how low-level you need it to be and winpcap or windows filtering platform on windows

4477758
post	get
the request-too-large.php file will probably get a standard get request - any post parameters will be lost but you can look inside and to see if there is anything else left over from the original request

4477768
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
no errors in firebug and same picture in all browsers opera ie google-chrome firefox

4477789
hex	binary
to read hex and convert to binary you can do

4477842
jobs	cron
this handles well all cron jobs

4477860
folder	directory
the dropins folder can be used much like the plugins directory was used in the past

4477872
inherited	subclassing
since java doesn t support multiple inherited subclassing multiple classes what would you do if you had more than one import in your class

4477896
google-chrome	safari
yeah that s a mouthful.....my point is...i had a very strong grasp on css2 screen media covering ie6 7 ff2 safari opera....i don t even think google-chrome was out yet...i m rambling....my confidence and perceived knowledge plummeted as soon as i moved forward

4477915
put	get
i have the main view controller and the data is received back and put into a dictionary then that is looped through to get a couple of arrays of data

4477917
onstart	ondestroy
i guess i need to save some info with ondestroy and restoring it again with onstart but i do not know how to accomplish this

4477918
hex	binary
update hex - binary conversion

4477988
put	get
also this version of state doesn t have get and put actions and we don t export the constructor

4477993
hash	salt
i ve got a salt hash password for sha256 ssha256 sha256 password + salt + salt

4477993
hash	salt
when a user logs in need to separate the salt from the hash to hash the supplied password with the salt and compare the result to the one retrieved from the db

4477993
hash	salt
i don t seem to have the right unpack template separate the hash 8-bit binary fixed length in this case 32 byte from the salt 8-bit binary variable length

4477993
hash	salt
my question is how can i unpack this hash after it has been base64 decoded to get the fixed length hash in one and the variable length salt in another variable

4478004
getter	setter
it can be edited unless marked as readonly or given a getter but no setter

width	margin
i wanted to set the size of the button and it shoud be centered in the souther position of the jframe but it shouldn t have the full width of the jframe and it shouln t be completly on the bottom of the jframe it should have a margin

4478021
width	height
it would be also possible to set a absolute pixel position of the button because the jframe has a fixed width height

4478021
width	height
at the moment the button has the full jframe width height

4478079
folder	directory
your href mystyle.css should have a correct reference by using .. dot-dot just like .. foldername in case your css file is one or more directory away from you main folder

hash	md5
if you don t need the original file names as a handy way just calculate md5 or sha1 hash of the file content and rename the file to it

4479166

i ve been trying to get my django application to post all new news stories to the application s facebook page

4479166
post	get
it works posting to feed but if i try to post to links with the access token given like this i get the following error

4479169
width	height
also perhaps not relevant shouldn t you be setting the data width and height attributes for each image after you change their dimensions

4479169
width	height
remember that width and height return the actual content width and height regardless of css properties so those values should only be captured once the content images or whatever have been fully loaded

4479172
minimum	max
hint for x 2 the minimum is clamp 0 xmin xmax 2 and the maximum is max xmin 2 xmax 2

4479172

in longer if you connect over ssl ie use https it will become much harder for casual observers to see what s going onâ but it would still be possible for someone to for example use an https proxy and sniff the connection that way

4479501
atof	strtod
the standard library function strtod handles the exponential component just fine so does atof but strtod allows you to differentiate between a failed parse and parsing the value zero

4479508
xslt	xquery
note hofs will become a standard feature of xpath xslt xquery with the forthcoming version 3.0

4479521
post	get
the problem is here and get send_reset in my opinion you are trying to post parameters when your conntroller expect get method

4479538
post	get
if you can t get it to work post a simple example of what you have and what you are trying to do and someone might be able to see what part is tripping you up

4479583
post	get
use jquery s get or post function

4479639
getter	setter
getter are usually called to retrieve data in the view for instance a jsp file while setter are used to insert the data from the view

4479639
getter	setter
in case you use nested objects it will call the getter on the object and then a setter on the property

4479681
put	get
if we put a wrong port we do get a timeout error as well

4479739
pull	push
or if it is better to pull the remote changes first merge them locally and push the

4479739
pull	push
note that if you do a hg pull first your local changes aren t touched so you can inspect the remote changes side-by-side with your local ones and you can still decide not to merge and do a hg push -f anyway

4479771

you need to set width and height attributes on both the object and embed tags

4479989
width	height
google results and the jquery documentation indicate that jquery s height and width methods make no effort to maintain an element s proportionality

4479991
setinterval	clearinterval
setinterval returns an id that you can pass to clearinterval to stop the repeated calls

4479999
setinterval	clearinterval
you have to use clearinterval on the id you get when you call setinterval

4480004
avro	thrift
avro is an apache project that is designed for cross-language rpc see thrift for its spiritual predecessor

4480007
width	height
if you set only the width or only the height of an image it will automatically maintain it s proportions

4480013
width	height
if you set only the height of an image the width is adjusted in proportion and vice versa

4480059
post	put
json_data is a literal with an array inside that you put as parameter to the post and will be sent as encoded array in the post request to the server

4480116
memcpy	memmove
yes memmove is really memcpy with the ability to handle overlapping blocks

4480128
memcpy	memmove
however there is a difference between memmove and memcpy because memmove can treat correctly the case when the buffers overlap so it is recomended in these cases

4480128
memcpy	memmove
however because of additional checks that memmove performs when the buffers are small and surely does not overlap memcpy is better

4480146
memcpy	memmove
the difference between memcpy and memmove is that memmove is always safe to use regardless of aliasing between source and destination

4480146
memcpy	memmove
if you know buffers cannot overlap memcpy is fine and may in any given library use optimizations that allow it to be faster than memmove

4480146
memcpy	memmove
in another library memcpy may actually just be memmove

4480155
postgresql	mysql
i recently switched from mysql to postgresql and i noticed one additional query after following many regular queries

you can use a view s method setvisibility you can hide or show views using setvisibility int visibility

4480590
button	checkbox
i ve added a checkbox to a table view cell which is a custom button with two images

4480590
button	checkbox
the problem is when you click the rest of the row it still selects the checkbox button

4480614
post	get
it appears in your post that you are providing the session as a parameter...which would make me assume that you would need to provide the session as a parameter in your get as well

i think you need to mark it protected or public to be readable by your descendent

4480839
cos	sin
x cos theta x - sin theta y

4480839
cos	sin
y sin theta x + cos theta y

4480839
cos	inverse	cos	sin
in your case let s say that theta is the angle of the ground you want to do the inverse rotation so with angle -theta to make the ground horizontal this is why the sign is different from the formula above cos -theta cos theta and sin -theta -sin theta

4480917
post	get
in general i d suggest using post instead of get assuming you re getting your variables from a form element

4480937
free	malloc
if you want to allocate an array of something you need malloc and free which deal with pointers to memory spaces

4480938

lisp	scheme
you should know that common lisp does not require tail recursion from its implementors unlike scheme

4481088
textarea	textbox
i ve been using keyup to detect when content in a textarea changes but somehow facebook can detect a ctrl+x event in a textbox immediately when the x is pressed down

4481098
keydown	keyup
i would guess they make a bind to the keydown and set some sort of state variable when the control key is pressed then when they receive a keyup event they check the state variable and act accordingly

4481125
button	checkbox
i was wondering just like ocr can detect a scanned document s text tables and even form elements is there any product that can take a very accurate and clean by nature screenshot and create the html that will put text fields drop downs checkbox radio button and labels in the same layout as the source screenshot form

4481127
put	get
if you just want it to happen right away when the form loads then put your code in the onload event of the form instead double click on the form title bar to get to the onload event

4481179

4481205
profiler	shark
if you find no solution then you may try out some other profiler like shark

4481243
ienumerable	iqueryable
since you don t need to add to the input list all you actually need to do is enumerate - so use ienumerable - then your method will also accept other types which implement ienumerable including iqueryable linked lists etc.

4481248
ienumerable	ilist
an ilist can be thought of as a particular implementation of ienumerable

4481257
lisp	scheme
the various lisp or scheme literature should describe that

4481292
multiplying	division
on many machines the only differences between signed and unsigned numbers are the way in which magnitude comparisons are performed and the way in which shorter values are converted to longer ones note that many processors multiplying operations effectively convert shorter types to longer ones and division inherently performs magnitude comparisons

4481308
move	drag
if the user move the mouse slow enough the expected behaviour the faces get colored by the mouse like a brush but if the user drag faster and this isn t really fast the entire mesh will be colored

4481761
etsy	ebay
ebay uses tables and etsy uses divs

4481764
lxml	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup is pretty slow if you want better performance use lxml instead or if you have many cpu s perhaps you can try using multiprocessing with queues

4481787
accessor	properties
from my understanding of core data all that is necessary for primitive accessor to work is the dynamic directive for the properties name as well as declaring primitive accessor for that properties within the entity implementation

4481787
accessor	properties
for some reason when using the generated primitive accessor the setstate method is not modifying the state properties

memcpy	memmove
as other answers mention memcpy can use optimizations techniques that aren t available to memmove because memcpy doesn t support memory regions that overlap while memmove does

4482176
memcpy	memmove
one thing you might want to consider is to still use memmove instead of memcpy by default unless you re working on an application where copy performance is critical

memcpy	memmove
in the kernel the optimized x86 memcpy we use is actually a memmove because while performance is really important so is repeatability and avoiding surprises strictly speaking we have two the rep movs version for the case where that is supposed to be fast and the open-coded copy version

in your app you are trying to implements some kind of a super class

4482350
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
if you want to get really fancy use an nsoperation to encapsulate the download then you would use the a synchronous variant of nsurlconnection because the operation itself is already executed asynchronously the nice thing would be then if your parsing of the json string takes longer also this is performed in the background and your ui will stay responsive

dictionary	map
is anyone aware of some sort of library or utility i could use in node.js js without having to define my own map dictionary such as below

4482401
typedef	struct
to my taste the easiest and clearest way is to do forward declarations of the struct and typedef to the struct and the pointer

4482401
typedef	struct
using the same name as typedef and struct tag in the forward declaration make things clearer and eases the api compability with c++

4482448
range	minimum
this is guaranteed by the minimum value range

4482466
uploadify	swfupload

sidenote if you re new to rails it might be a good idea to learn how to use it with activerecord before trying on datamapper

4482597
ubuntu	debian
there are plenty of pages explaining how to do it but if you re on ubuntu or debian it can be a bit of a mystery

4482621

webclient	httpwebrequest	webclient	webrequest	webclient	ftpwebrequest	httpwebrequest	ftpwebrequest
basically webclient is just a wrapper for webrequest ftpwebrequest httpwebrequest ... to make it easier to use

4482669
min	max
your cashback column is varchar which is a text type therefore min max etc all operate on alphabetical sorting which is normal therefore b aaaa and of course 5 100

4482716
min	max
string 5 is greater than string 40 in other words if you arrange 5 and 40 as in a dictionary 5 comes after 40 hence ther result max - 5 and min 40

4482716
min	max
if you arrange 46 and 44 as in a dictionary 46 comes later than 44 hence max 46 and min 44

4482740

pylons	pyramid
now the problem is there s pyramid and it would seem pylons would be replaced by it soon

4482879
pylons	pyramid
also given that pylons itself was a very successful platform judging from its high-profile deployments do you recommend pyramid as a good replacement

4482896
google-chrome	firefox
this is supported in some browsers now firefox and google-chrome for instance and support is set to improve

4482904
portrait	landscape
the opposite to landscape is called portrait

4482904
portrait	landscape
if you want your application to work well when the user rotates the phone you need to design your user interface so that it display well in both landscape and portrait modes

4482908
portrait	landscape
landscape and portrait - are device orientation

4482908
portrait	landscape
in landscape mode we have 480x320 resolution and portrait resolution is vice versa - 320x480

4482916
getter	setter
you can use a property to wrap a getter setter pair for the seats

4482925
getter	setter
note the complete lack of getter and setter you don t need them

4482969

if you simply want to get a screenshot though just press the home and top button together which will put a screenshot in the photo album each time you do it

4483114
onclick	onmousedown
try using the mousedown event instead change onclick to onmousedown

4483160
hash	md5
since the introduction of rainbow tables and using only hash passwords e.x md5 to stored passwords in database is not the best secured way

4483160
hash	salt
when people talk about salt hash the always use it in this way hash password

4483160
hash	salt
salt or even hash hash password

4483174
ninject	spring.net
note i do not know much about ninject but i worked with spring.net that is much more complicated

4483177
hash	salt
edit just to be clear given that the salt is provided in plain-text as well you would still only have 100 000 000 possibilities to try to attack any one hash

4483177
hash	salt
without a salt an attacker could create a dictionary of 100 000 000 possibilities and then know all the passwords in a database given only their hash

4483177
hash	salt
without a salt you could compute the hash of every possible password before you get access to the hash themselves

4483185
hash	md5
you should hash the conten on the serverside using md5

4483205
hash	salt
hashing multiple times does not protect you without a salt because rainbow tables work by chaining hash together in exactly the way you describe hash hash password

4483205
hash	salt
as an added benefit two users with the same password will hash to different values if a salt is used

4483205
hash	salt
your idea of iterating the hash is still good but you need the salt too

4483205
hash	salt
the salt hashing algorithm and iteration count do not need to be secret and can be stored in your database alongside the computed hash

4483205
hash	salt
you can choose a fixed iteration count and hash algorithm but the salt must be randomly generated for each user

4483217
int	chars
conversion from string is actually o 1 as well because during parsing of it it s enough to consider only a bounded number of chars 10+1 in case of 32-bit int

4483231
hash	salt
both iterating the hash and using a salt increase the security of password hashing

4483236
apache	lighttpd
in a production environment we just use lighttpd or apache to translate from http to https

4483257
min	median	min	max	median	max
median max ar1 0 ar2 0 + min ar1 1 ar2 1 2

4483257
min	median	min	max	median	max
now size is 2 so median max ar1 0 ar2 0 + min ar1 1 ar2 1 2

4483257
min	max
max 15 13 + min 26 17 2

4483302
width	height
it works by making a bitmap with the resulting width and height 1 insamplesize than the original thus reducing memory consumption by insamplesize 2

4483306
margin	height
because padding and or margin depending on the browser are non-zero for html and or body by default and padding and margin wrap around the content height

4483307
hash	salt
the user enters their password which is then hash with the salt and sent back

4483320

it does not generate a uniform distribution over all permutation sequence but it can gives good permutation that is not easily distinguishable

4483633
sequence	permutation
second though it does not generate all permutation sequence it does generate part of them

4483633
sequence	permutation
if column permutation is also include it is exactly equal to so it is almost impossible to get the same sequence

flex uses an older less capable version of the osmf platform for its videoplayer

flex	osmf
the videoplayer i will implement is in a second project that does not duplicate the package names of either the flex sdk or osmf

4487496
flex	osmf
the conflict is between the flex sdk and osmf not between the classes i would build and either osfm or the sdk

4487496
flex	osmf
my project needs to access classes in the osmf project not those from the flex sdk that have the name package class names

because the flex sdk is based on osmf flex has left the package and namespace identifies intact thus the naming ambiguity

qstring	qbytearray
if you re doing cross-platform coding you could use qt4 s qstring qbytearray

4490559
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
you can then implement the message box anyway you wish either using the windows system message box or nicer still use your own view viewmodel to display the message perhaps using the caliburn.micro windowmanager.showdialog

4490610
width	height
note it do not stretch on ie due to the code uses the css3 property background-size and you need to set your own width and height of the image in the code

you ll need to create a vector between the two sprites normalize it multiplying that normalized vector by how much you want the sprite to move per frame then add that vector into the sprite you are moving s location

4490706
children	parent
it works because rii child_first iterates over the children before the parent element

4490711
webkit	gecko
i m trying to check if an html element is scrollable.only gecko support is needed and webkit support would be nice but not necessary

my chart width is 968 and height 432

4490765
folder	directory
if you actually moved the exe file to the desktop you also need to move any resources that it needs so if it wants a folder named datasources you would have to move that folder as well or set the current directory when you start the application

4490806
for-loop	loops
from my basic understanding its seems i ought to be able to do everything a foreach loops does within a for-loop

4490837
subtract	add
so if you take the top right left and bottom-most value add subtract a little or to make it fit a power of ten

4490841
inherited	properties
instead you can make the class a non-static singleton and allow implementations to inherited the class add properties to it and set the inherited version as the singleton instance

4490911
swt	swing
you re already mentioned swing s jfilechooser but you may want to consider swt for your widgets instead

using the same code as jobi joy from the question i linked you can change the button in datatemplate_level2 to a checkbox and bind ischecked for it to value instead since it will point to the ref class otherwise

4491134
int	double	int	chars
all you need is two int one chars and one double if it s not a must to use arrays so this is the code for you

4491167
scrollable	panels
which does not actually work to scroll the listbox it will only affect the position of the control when it is embedded in a scrollable container like panels

4491172

4491424
min	max
i am using the following code to calculate the min max date and will then select all records in the table that are clear to update them

4491458
super	self

carrierwave	paperclip
i tested paperclip vs carrierwave vs attachment_fu with rails3.0.3 for a project i am working on

4491571
inherited	properties
well you can do it simpler because the datacontext properties is among the few that are inherited which means that when set on an element somewhere in the tree all child elements get it implicitly if they do not override it

4491591
screens	hdpi
the best way is to have all device configurations listed here including the samsung galaxy tab simulater large screens hdpi available here in your development environment and test your app on them

4491611
google-chrome	safari
i use sys.browser.name for borwser detection but google-chrome detected as safari

4491644
ant	maven
i m not sure of the reasoning but without this option maven wasn t running pre-test code that ant was

4491669
hide	show
i basically hide the button and show a loading gif but that apparently is not enough.

4491708
jobs	cron
when i remove any print statements cron runs the jobs normally and does not terminate

4491724
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
but it s case-sensitive how do i do case-insensitive sorting

4491727
for-loop	loops
a foreach loops works with ienumerator when a for-loop works with an index in i is the index

4491727
ienumerable	ienumerator
so actually the big strength of the foreach loop and the underlying use of ienumerator is that it applies to any type which implements ienumerable implementing ienumerable just means that you provide a method that returns an enumerator

4491727
for-loop	loops
so the for-loop can generally be considered as a specialized foreach loops

4491727
for-loop	loops
edit there is an other case where the for-loop is useful when you need indexing to go through a list in a special way or if you need to modify the list when in loops

4491727
for-loop	loops
you need the for-loop here because mylist cannot be modified from within a foreach loops and we need to go through it backwards because if you remove the element at the position i the position of all elements with an index i will change

4491756
jobs	cron
for jobs started by cron

4491770
persistent	transient
if you only want to serialize part of your object just set specific fields as transient marking them as not to be persistent and implement serializable

4491805
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseleave event differs from mouseout in the way it handles event bubbling

4491816
rss	feed
you can use pubdate for those rss feed where it is provided

4491832
fadein	fadeout	mouseover	mouseout
my problem is that when i am using fadeout on mouseover and fadein on mouseout on a li component i am not getting the results that i am expecting

4491832
fadein	fadeout	mouseover	mouseout
what is the proper way of using fadeout and fadein with mouseover and mouseout

4491872
system.in	system.out
the workaround that i use is to just use system.in system.out instead of console when using eclipse

4491878
google-chrome	safari
that is because you re checking for webkit which happens to exist in both safari and google-chrome

4491878
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 534.10 khtml like gecko google-chrome 8.0.552.224 safari 534.10

4491903
width	height
to make a thumbnail out of a large res photo do i just resize the width and the height

4491912
post	put
it might be possible to use javascript cookies to retrieve the raw cookie data and put it into a post header or ajax call for some purpose but i believe the javascript cookie mechanism has the same expiration restrictions as the browser

4491914
folder	directory
i have this piece of code that searches for a folder given a starting directory

4491923
folder	directory
just go to your django installation directory browser to django- contrib- admin- directory and copy paste the media folder to your django projects media directory

4491930
requestfactory	gwt
use requestfactory which comes along with gwt 2.1

4491932
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
using mouseenter mouseleave will solve most of the problems caused by mouseout mouseover

4491932
mouseleave	mouseenter
hover wraps around mouseenter and mouseleave to provide even better handling

4491981
draggable	droppable
i ve got a draggable thing outside an iframe and a droppable target inside it

4491981
draggable	droppable
i use some jquery ui draggable droppable to do stuff

4491981
draggable	droppable
the draggable become draggable and the droppable is successfully a drop target

4491987
ant	maven
also maven is quite possibly using a different classpath to ant - referring to jars in it s own local repo

4491988
int	chars
so first of all i m declaring a struct with three arrays of chars and an int

4491988
int	chars
after that i declare a function which takes three pointers to chars and an int value

4492019
portrait	landscape
i have everything looking nice in portrait of course but then when i go to landscape mode by hitting that arrow in the top-right corner everything gets all messed up

4492019
portrait	landscape
now because of the way the view is laid out i need to align 3 buttons along the bottom of an image view in portrait and then in landscape those three buttons need to be symmetrically aligned along the right side

linefeed	delimiter
and it s up to your query to properly escape any characters that could be confused with a delimiter or a linefeed

4492075
hash	salt
if the salt is based on the value to be hash then you lose the value of the salt

4492075
hash	salt
if a password hash salt is based only on the value of the password then two users using the same password is very visible in the database for example

4492112
width	height
in your code just set the tooltip s height and width property to double.nan to have the width and height adjust dynamically

4492128
mouseup	mousedown
on the mousedown or mouseup event i want to capture what color the pixel is immeidately under the mouse pointer

4492136
tabs	tabpanel
i haven t tried this myself but i imagine that you could create a tabpanel with empty tabs and size the tabpanel so that only the tab strip is visible

4492236
pull	push
you don t necessarily need a script to pull the changes - developers could just push them to a separate branch then invoke a script to test that branch

4492248
min	max
im having a few problems with the code i have written to check my database on refresh if all record dates on the database are between the specified min and max values

4492293
google-chrome	safari
also - anytime you are working on performance issues like this try running some sample code through jsperf - it will help you test two different methods .parent .find td vs .siblings .children for instance this test shows that the siblings .children method is 78 slower than .parent .find td .not when using google-chrome 38 slower in safari

4492329
daemon	cron
i think the cron daemon is stuck somehow

4492329
jobs	cron
when i try to add new cron jobs they don t register as going off and it won t send emails to my email address when a cron should go off

4492329

i access cron jobs in my cpanel x

4492332
min	max
will update all records if one tupel is not between min and max

4492335
colorbox	thickbox
thickbox colorbox prettyphoto etc

4492362
width	height
if you create a layer that is the full width height of your page and give it a higher z index than your whole page you can create this effect

4492372
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox ie8 google-chrome opera.

4492411
folder	directory
if you just added the clubinformationtracking folder yourself and did not configure it to be an iis application or virtual directory via the web hosting provider s control panel then that is the problem as asp.net is looking for any dlls in bin or perhaps public bin depending on how things are setup

4492411
folder	directory
from the web hosting provider s control panel make the clubinformationtracking folder a virtual directory or iis application

4492435
width	height
the arrows will stretch or compress the width and height and the bars |-| preserve distances from the top and bottom

4492438
sorting	filtering
for ex functionalities of listviewwebpart like sorting filtering export to excel are unavailable limited in functionality because of xsl limitations

4492458
onresume	onpause
use onpause and onresume instead

4492520
folder	directory
when i build my project in intellij and then start jboss the ear file does not appear in the deploy directory so i assume that there is some magic that intellij does so that jboss reads from a different folder

4492529
versioning	upgrade
in the case of going to a more major release you need to consider the api changes that could cause the upgrade to a new versioning of a library to take longer

4492542
pkcs#12	pfx
with other module types the user would need to load the certificate from pfx pkcs#12 file

4492563
portrait	landscape
we need to support both portrait and landscape orientation and retina-resolution iphone screens

4492679
post	put
you couldn t put it in the template itself as that would then need to be sent back to the server via a post for the next request

4492686
google-chrome	firefox
i m having trouble getting ie7 to float my elements correctly firefox and google-chrome work as expected

4492686
google-chrome	firefox
i get similar behavior on firefox and google-chrome if i remove the outer span the one with class right

4492712
sorting	filtering
if you use server-side processing all sorting filtering and paging needs to be handled by you on the server

4492712
sorting	filtering
if you configure datatables correctly it will request data from the server any time there is a paging filtering or sorting event

4492718
google-chrome	firefox
flex - scroll wheel ok using ie but not on firefox or google-chrome

4492718
google-chrome	firefox
switching between browsers during debugging and noticed the scroll wheel does not work in firefox or google-chrome but is fine in internet explorer

4492721
hash	salt
if you have a model like uploadedfile activerecord base for each file you can just use the id of the model or if you want a string you can hash it with some string added as salt

4492722
portrait	landscape
set the dimensions to the correct size portrait 320x460 or 640x920 and landscape 480x300 or 960x600 and move the crop screen to the bottom of the image

4492734
move	drag
so if i have a textbox of say 150 wide 35 high postitioned on my form and the bottom left drag handle changes the width to 200 wide the right hand of the text box remains unchanged but the left hand edge move to the left

4492786
mvp	presenter
the algorithm runs in a presenter mvp pattern using a backgroundworker - enabling the view not to freeze

4492811
for-loop	arrays
the search method includes a for-loop that checks whether what is being searched is in an arrays

4492811
for-loop	arrays
now when i cancel the nsoperation by calling cancelalloperations the for-loop continues to run through the arrays

4492865
g++	gcc
gcc g++ resolves symbols from left to right during linking so despite your code having the function defined a copy of an object containing the __stack_chk_fail symbol needs to be on the linker line to the right of libgurobi_c++.a

4492866
sharepoint	splist
you can use sharepoint object model to achieve the same splist class will provide you all informations you need refer the attached link

4492877
pull	push
my current development flow now goes like edit code git commit -m comment git push fab deploy master production - this pull master from origin onto the server

4492905
min	max
this approach also works with other aggregate functions like min max avg sum.

4492940
folder	directory
by open the folder do you mean open a file dialog for the user to select something inside of the given directory

4492941
xstream	xom
but if convenience is more important than efficiency yes you probably should consider a tree model not dom necessarily xom is better for example or data binding jaxb or xstream

4492941
children	parent
there are no accessors for children or parent because there is no guaranteed way to get to them as that is not necessarily possible considering current stream position

4492953
firefox	safari
updating the .net framework fixed the firefox and camino issues but not the safari problem

4492958
getter	setter
also i have another small question suppose i port everything to jstl would i have to import the corresponding mydto and mydao packages to access its getter and setter for each dto

4492970
children	parent
i would like to create a cascading tree list of n number of children for a given parent where a child can also become a parent

4493023
put	get
so i tried this code below to go through and get all the elements that are suppose to be in the drop down box and put them back

4493025
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the main catch is you have to do it in viewdidappear or similar because the movieplayer view sets itself up somewhere inside didmovetowindow or didmovetosuperview which happen after viewwillappear

4493065
put	get
for example print repr request.get is a helpful thing to put in a view function so that you can see the get dictionary

4493087
width	height
e.g rectangle i.e rectangle 100 150 50 50 as x y width height

4493101
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the simplest way to accomplish this is to put your loading code into viewwillappear instead of viewdidload

4493101
viewdidload	viewwillappear
while viewdidload may only get called once when your view is initialized viewwillappear is called any time your view controller is about to be presented whether it be in the tab bar in a navigation controller etc. which gives you a nice hook to implement loading and layout functionality

4493106
vxworks	qnx
make sure that os has a simulator that runs on pc win or linux typical embedded os with simulator include vxworks î¼c os-ii qnx uclinux .

4493129
post	get
another solution would be to use something like fiddler to analyze what exactly is being sent to the web site and then code that using the standard java http post get functionality sending a post request using a url

4493136
background-image	background-position
in your css set your background-image to the image in question background-position right and add the width of the image to the right padding

4493149
folder	directory
i have two folder where i store my templates and i would like to use extends -function across these two directory without having to do stuff like .. templates template.tpl or using absolute paths

4493277
opera	firefox
if you visit the same page with firefox and then save that page and reopen it in opera it works fine.

4493295
google-chrome	safari
but in google-chrome or safari you will see 1 3 5 7 .

4493299
post	get
the form data is apparently being sent to the moderate function within the topics controller using post and get methods simultaneously

4493317
cos	sin
sin and cos take a parameter in radians

4493358
inherited	properties
just the properties are being generated the inherited are not being generates

4493401
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
parand - it s not necessary because ie has a different box model than firefox or webkit which is the engine that powers google-chrome safari among others

4493406
happy	cup
i will be happy to hear more insights regarding what causes the extra time to elapse - 10msec sounds as eternity for a modern cpu - though i am not familiar with the specs of the ipod cpu it s ipod 4g and wikipedia says the cup is powervr sgx gpu 535 200 mhz

4493429
maven	pom.xml
maven won t let a child module be the parent pom.xml of the top level pom.xml

4493475
datediff	difference
datediff now dob will give you the difference in days between two dates

4493499
zsh	tcsh
if you use other sh-style shells sh ksh zsh etc but not csh or tcsh don t use bash-only features and want the same setup no matter what shell you re in you should use .profile

4493499
bash	subshell
non-login interactive bash shells subshell source .bashrc instead

4493518
children	parent
what is the best way to fire a method in many children by calling the parent s method

4493523
super	self
if you re using django 1.2 create another database connection in settings.py call it read_only and create a custom manager that returns querset using that connection like def get_query_set return super readonlymanager self .get_query_set .using read_only and mark the connection read-only

4493551
post	get
this method is called to uh initialize each request handler with the current request and response objects before the appropriate get or post or whatever methods are called

4493558
post	get
for example if you had a delete action method and get just asks for confirmation you might call the get method confirmdelete and the post method just delete

4493589
google-chrome	firefox
if i set cache-control to no-cache google-chrome and firefox correctly send a request to the server for the xap but use the cache if a 304 is returned

4493589
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
setting cache-control to must-revalidate again works correctly in google-chrome and firefox but safari always downloads the xap again while ie8 always uses the cache

4493592
hide	show
i also want to show tool tip when ever that corresponding input field get focused and hide when get blurred

the default install path for handbrakecli is in program files x86 handbrake x86 only in 64bit obviously however program files isn t in the search path as far as i can tell

4493898
vb.net	vb6
although vb.net supports try...catch type exception handling it still has something similar to vb6 s on error

4493944

google-chrome	firefox
i ve posted an example here that works for me in firefox google-chrome

4494066
disk	ram
if for example the sql server has not much ram and access only to a single disk forcing it to do multiple queries in parallel may lead to more seek activity on the harddisk which can dramatically slow down the overall read rate

4494091
querypath	phpquery
or a more reliable html parser with a readable api like phpquery or querypath

4494167
atof	strtod
there is indeed no way to make the stock number-parsing routines atof strtod process a number in the format you have

4494188
magento	oscommerce
import the csv from oscommerce into magento using the import tool

4494195
put	get
to check if components get registered properly you can put a breakpoint in the line after you call install and see what components were registered and if that s what you were expecting

4494220
inherited	properties
now everything compiles fine and the mixin stuff seems to work - until i try and save the component to a stream using tstream- writecomponent where the inherited properties eg tlabel.width height etc. don t get written

4494236
strtod	strtok
how about using strtok and strtod it should do it for you quite nicely

4494250
salt	md5
even with salt if you re using md5 or some other fast-hashing algorithm which aren t designed to solve this problem by the way

4494260
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
i tried to do it by making properties accessor for hud but was not able to get around the line mbprogresshud alloc initwithwindow - and i don t want to keep on alloc ing an ivar

4494270
hash	salt
now if the kiddie has your database and of course the code - there is no point in keeping the code secret he she can only guess passwords calculate the salt hash and compare

4494276
hash	salt
salt hash sha1 username + salt + password

4494276
hash	salt
even though the attacker has the salt and hash pairs it s not possible to use rainbow tables because all the possible hash will need to be computed anyway using the salt that they ve been given so it s a brand new brute force attack for each user

4494276
hash	salt
salt hash bcrypt username + salt + password

4494294
width	height
if i only have a few bars in each graws the width is too big compared to the height

4494294
width	height
and unconvenient way is to specify the height and width output of the paper and manually i adjust it for the number of bars in the plots each time

4494295
cells	tablecell
i have table and inside the tablecell i have a pickerview and some textfields in other cells

4494296
hash	salt
this makes it that even if someone does get to your database they can t just re-generate the hash they have to calculate a hash table for each salt that you used

4494319
accessor	properties
i guess the moral would be never remove a binding that updates a properties from the set accessor of that properties

4494358
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to use the javascript onbeforeunload event to ask the user if they want to exit the page but i don t want the event to fire edit the event being the dialog box that pop-up asking the user to click ok to leave the site or click cancel to stay on the current page if the user hits the back button since they will be most likely be staying on my site

4494358
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

on my view i want a tabcontrol with a tabitem for each object in the categories collection

4494374
tabcontrol	tabitem
how do i need to structure the xaml so that when the tabcontrol is being bound a datagridcollectionviewsource object is created for each tabitem so that the datagridcontrol that is generated within the content of the tabitem can be bound to it

4494397
width	height
specify width and height for img tag

4494400
rss	feed
i believe there is a way to retrieve at least some icons via one of the many app store rss feed perhaps more easily via a custom feed

4494412
gridbaglayout	miglayout
most gui s even fairly complex gui s can be made with a nesting of jpanels each using a simple layout manager or barring that gridbaglayout or miglayout not part of standard java but free when i last used it and fairly easy to use

4494435
int	double
since the structures you are copying seem to contain that many int double pointers

4494489
winpcap	libpcap	winpcap	jnetpcap	jnetpcap	libpcap
libpcap winpcap that jnetpcap uses provides this reliably on at least windows and linux from my experience

4494489
winpcap	libpcap	winpcap	jnetpcap	jnetpcap	libpcap
i have experience with libpcap winpcap but not with jnetpcap

4494489
winpcap	libpcap
tshark also uses libpcap winpcap actually

4494492
width	height
if you know the height and width of your image position it absolutely set top left to 50 and margin-top left to negative half the height width of your image

4494514
ssl	https
i just checked and i think you re going to have a really hard time accomplishing this because gmail runs on https so even once you get the packet sniffer running you re going to have to decrypt all ssl communications

4494521
rss	feed
i figured it out import the rss kml feed into a map overlay

4494544
google-chrome	firefox
so far i can get the content to cache in google-chrome and internet explorer but not firefox

4494544
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and ie7 do not request the images css and js after the first request while firefox requests them every time

4494546
width	height
how can i set the dimensions of my root layout in the xaml to 100 width and height of the tag that houses the silverlight app

4494546
width	height
i have tried specifying 100 but the width and height properties only take unit literals exact pixels

4494563
int	double
i m not familiar with com and i just know some basic types such as int double etc.

because the function you are defining is the callback function for which will always be called when you get a response from post

4494896
folder	directory
copy your new files into it don t copy the .hg folder from the new file directory

4494904
width	height
if you re not already and assuming the images are fixed-height and width it s proper to specify the width height of an image

4494936
sorting	filtering
note inline data for headers pseudo sequence parameter for filtering and sorting modes not for processing the same element in different way but for processing different elements in the same way also

4494973
helpers	actioncontroller
it looks like it stems from the fact that behavior overrides actioncontroller base#config with its own method really just to provide a helpers that has the same functionality as behavior.config.

4494974
children	parent
with those rules properly specified when you delete the parent row all children rows will be automatically deleted by rdbms

4494992
photoshop	fireworks
if i could i would use photoshop craft a killer design and then use fireworks line up my slices and export as mxmxl with the assets.

4495008
post	get
the other option you have is to make your scripts into handlers and simply get or post to the relevant urls

4495078
public	protected
method visibility in ruby public protected and private methods has been well explained in places like this blog post

4495078
public	protected
for example public controller methods are action methods protected methods in the application controller are used for helper methods that need to be accessed by multiple controllers etc

4495091

i d suggest you set up a bare repository somewhere that you both push and pull from rather than pushing directly into a repo that has a working copy

4495491
integer	unsigned
u means that you want the argument formatted as an unsigned integer which cannot be negative

4495577

that would work for safari 3 or later google-chrome opera 10+ firefox 3.6+ and internet explorer 9 or later

4495751
inherited	properties
i suspect the streaming system relies on this count and that s why inherited properties are not being written out in your setup

4495775
uiview	subviews
of course the uitableviewcontroller s view shouldn t take up the entire screen ipad project so i put it as a subviews on a regular uiview instance with the frame set to a pretty size

4495789
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i would like to know whether the same exists for firefox opera google-chrome and safari

gridview	sqldatasource
other possibly-relevant details the gridview is bound to a sqldatasource

4495794
gridview	sqldatasource
update3 i ve been poking around some more and although it complicates my code i was able to get things working by declaring a deletecommand in the gridview s sqldatasource that just does the simple row record deletion and then in the rowdeleted handler calling the additional stuff i had in my stored procedure that needs to happen along with the primary deletion

4495815
getter	setter
hybrid of the two - hardcoded properties for some items - have their setter getter call metadataitem

4495815

4495950
stateless	stateful
when people talk about stateless serverside stateful client side what do they mean

4495965
width	height
one method would be to bind the height and width of the textbox to the height and width of the window for example

4495965
width	height
there may be a different property that might want to bind to or you might want to use an expression so the textbox isn t exactly the height width of the parent window

4495984
int	chars
since the chars is 9 bytes long it needs 2x8 bytes to store it and the int even if taking only 4 bytes on 32bit machine will use 8 bytes

4495996
int	double	int	chars
it is likely that the payload is 21 bytes int 4 double 8 chars 9 but that your compiler adds padding between int and double to make the double 8-byte aligned

4495996
int	double
...it is likely that the need to add padding between int and double disappears and sizeof params_traitment_mmf may go down to 24

4495998
width	height
for example you could load it with file_get_contents use some regular expressions to find the img width and height and then use those values when echo ing the iframe

4496015
free	malloc
then you have to override new and or malloc delete and or free to return memory from to this buffer

google-chrome	firefox
this code works properly in firefox but not in google-chrome if you need more of the code i would be glad to provide it a button changes a background image

4496198
put	get
with blobs you can put datatypes into the database so you can easily get them back out plus i believe it is much more efficient that way

4496208
hide	show
it s all great but when i hide left radpane and click on it again to show it it doesn t appeared until i click on anything else to lost focus may be not focus but anything state

4496237
serializable	deserialization
since i m using json.net to do my serializable deserialization i d like to disable the default modelbinder from doing this extra parsing

4496260
versioning	upgrade
the answer was to upgrade to the latest versioning of jquery 1.4.4 and this sorted out the issue

4496321
serializable	deserialization
if you have control over the serializable deserialization on the java side your best bet is to use a cross-platform serializable protocol such as protocol buffers

4496338
division	multiplication
multiplication and division have the same left-to-right precedence

4496345
touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchescancelled	touchesended

4496405
typedef	typename
typedef typename allocator_traits allocator size_type size_type

4496423
int	chars

there is a difference between inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged

4496511
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this should work properly in firefox 3.5+ safari 4+ google-chrome 4+ opera 10+ and internet explorer 8+

4496514
int	chars
now this seems a good idea but i wonder if the standard allows for the case where the alignment requirements for chars are more restrictive than that for int

4496514
int	chars
in other words is it possible to have a four-byte int which is required to be aligned on a four-byte boundary with a one-byte chars it is one byte by definition see below required to be aligned on a sixteen-byte boundary

4496519
folder	directory
just copy both files into your project folder and use #include mylibrary.h or set the appropriate directory settings so you can use without copying the files each time you want to use them

scheme	racket
anyway i also started to play with scheme in racket and though there are a lot of involved it still had a lot of simplicity

4497106
lisp	scheme
the only thing i am finding is that there are a lot of scheme lisp dialects

4497106

if you re just starting out understanding the get post methods there is a nice pattern that you should understand that will help you not get in situations where data is posted again and again by users who constantly refresh the browser after a post

4497743
int	boolean
for instance a typical 32-bit int can store 32 boolean values

4497793
gtk	fltk
either use a real toolkit there are a lot of them qt gtk wxwidgets fltk fox.

4497793
glut	glfw

min	max
hi i am trying to find min and max values of x and y how can i find this min and max functions is not working correctly

4497817
stdout	stderr
for testing purposes i would like to save stdout and stderr separately for inspection by subsequent code

4497817
stdout	stderr
for example a test run with erroneous input should result in output to stderr but nothing on stdout while a test run with correct input should result in output to stdout but nothing to stderr

4497817
stdout	stderr
to be able to debug the test after the fact i also need to see stdout and stderr in the sequence they were output

4497817
stdout	stderr
is it for example possible to redirect stdout to stdout.log stderr to stderr.log and both of them to output.log in the same command

4497817
stdout	stderr
or to use a synchronous tee command separately for stdout and stderr

4497817
stdout	stderr
or to save a copy of stdout and stderr to separate variables

4497829
