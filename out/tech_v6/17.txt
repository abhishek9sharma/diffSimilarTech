setinterval	settimeout
there are native javascript functions setinterval and settimeout for doing stuff on set intervals

700137
inherited	subclassing
indeed being able to subclassing class a and call the same method on class b and have it do something else is the entire point of inherited in languages

700163
post	get
it should not be economical for a spammer to post links because most users could not successfully get to the page

700258
printf	strncpy
however is there any difference in using either printf or strncpy

700302
min	max
it used intervals with the notation min max and implemented range-based arithmetic

700304
strdup	malloc	strdup	strncpy	strncpy	malloc
instead of using malloc and strncpy just use strdup - it allocates the buffer bin enough to hold the content and copies the content to the new string all in one shot

700305
printf	strcpy	printf	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
the printf line is functionally correct but for what you re doing strcpy as opposed to strncpy is from what i can see and know of the code the correct choice

700309
swt	swing
glazedlists was created to support mostly swing or swt based uis

700309
swt	swing
in this url you can see that the documentation mentions that it can be used with swing or swt out of the box but no html mentioned

700310

i ve found it useful to get self-adhesive slightly-rubbery plastic hemispheres and put them on the bottom of my laptops - particularly after the feet they come with fall off

700396
ant	maven
after all installing some jdk s maven or ant and eclipse|netbeans is easy enough hell there even is documentation somewhere i m sure

ok it might sounds dumb but i couldn t figure out a way to pass int chars into this system call

700555
subtract	add
take a look here add subtract using bitwise operators

700601

you can do this with vsto i m not so sure if it works exactly the same way with the shared add-in technology but maybe it does help

700607
rss	feed
using feedparser or some other python library to download and parse rss feed

700623
firefox	safari
this works in ie firefox safari and so on so no need for the messy browser detection too

700669
put	get
the advantage of using generics is that it increases the type safety - you can only put in the correct type of thing and you get out the correct type without requiring a cast

700688
ienumerable	ilist
i have used ienumerable and ilist when i ve been converting an object reference and didn t know the type to cast it to at compile-time - so non-generic interfaces are useful sometimes.

700702
cos	math.h
math.h or cos pi

700774
post	get
you didn t post any information on mytype so i ll assume you ll need to alter my code to get the calculator instance

gridview	onclientclick
this function just gets the row by giving it the id of the row in a gridview used for the onclientclick event to change the color of the row

700856
mouseup	mousedown
hook your event handler up to the button s mousedown event instead of the click or mouseup event

700918
client-side	server-side
they are very separate things jquery is a javascript framework that has the ability to do some rudimentary ajax functionality while asp.net ajax is a more fully-featured ajax framework that encompasses .net controls and server-side aspects as well as client-side aspects

700939
pop-up	dialog
the reason we re using an iframe is to alow us to host the pdf in a page that also runs some scripts and has some more controls on if a certain condition is met we pop-up a modal dialog using the modal dialog extender but we ve switched that behaviour off and the problem is still occuring

700967

701321
post	put
so in a sense tomcat will already do rest for you if you put your server pages as resources could be the resource for your car to which you could use http post or put to change the details of it

701322
int	chars
the method i came up with is to turn the int into a string find the 1st chars of the string then turn it back to an int

701331
post	put
that way you can post or put to that resource without affecting other related resources and without having to parrot them back to the server

701331
put	get
if you had to manipulate everything from the parent think about what happens if one person does a get modifies one sub-item and then does a put of the whole thing with that sub-item changed

701332
opera	firefox	width	height
in firefox 3 and opera the table is 112 x 100 px so for some reason the border is added to the table width but not to the table height

701558
division	modulo
random in bash is a special variable that returns a random number then use modulo division to get a valid index then index into the array

701657
decoder	encoder
note however that utf-8 words are always 8-bits one byte in length though characters can be multiple points therefore there is no problem with endianness. if the encoder of a stream of bytes representing unicode text and the decoder aren t agreed on which convention is being used the wrong character code can be interpreted

701711
children	parent
the problem is that if you lose reference to the topmost node then the topmost node still holds strong references to its children and all its children also hold a strong reference to their parent

701711
children	parent
thus if the topmost node goes out of scope as in the previous example then while it holds strong references to its children its children don t hold strong references to their parent

701744
postgresql	mysql
i d like to migrate an existing mysql database around 40tables 400mb data to postgresql before it gets bigger

qtkit	quicktime
qtkit the objective-c api for quicktime is new with leopard os x 10.5 and is very good

701814
postgresql	mysql
the translation from mysql to postgresql is not simple unless your schema is trivial

701814
postgresql	mysql
but doing it yourself you have the chance to take advantage of features in postgresql that aren t present in mysql as well as the chance to make the kinds of improvements that only come from having the chance to do something a second time

701825
inherited	properties
also i know that someone will suggest composition over inherited in this case but that s truly not feasible because i m relying on the ability to extend parent functionality and member properties are populated so that all properties are accessed in the exact same manner

701847
inherited	properties
the fontsize properties of the container should be inherited by child controls unless they explicitly override the properties

701847
inherited	properties
the listbox and the button do not inherited their background setting from the parent although they do inherited font properties

701866
post	put
put post operation based on the revision state or should it just post sth and everything should be handled server-side i believe it not restful api then

702166
webclient	httpwebrequest	webclient	ftpwebresponse	webclient	ftpwebrequest	httpwebrequest	ftpwebrequest	ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
for http and ftp resources the httpwebrequest ftpwebrequest and httpwebresponse ftpwebresponse classes will work fine as will webclient but if you have other schemes that you have to support you will have to find specific providers for that scheme

702179
django	turbogears
but with turbogears 2 coming out which brings wsgi support and after reading up on the religious debates between the django and wsgi camps i m really torn between doing it the right way learning wsgi spending valuable time writing functionality that already exists in django and other full-stack frameworks as opposed to using django or some high-level framework that does everything for me

702179
django	turbogears
if the latter i would appreciate a suggestion as to whether i should give django another try stick with turbogears 1.x or venture into some other framework

702188
addition	multiplication
the loop currently takes 11ms which i assume is mostly due to accessing the byte arrays values as the calculation is pretty simple 2 multiplication and 1 addition

the former selects all descendant para elements that are the first para children of their parent

702233
perforce	svn
in perforce you can issue a sync to none command to remove files from the client but leave them untouched in the depot or repository in svn lingo

702242
post	put
it s not enough to have one generic command like post put revisions for all cases starts a new revision resume the previous one

702343
gridview	repeater
repeater gridview etc i always implement the ondatabinding method for field level controls if i need to do anything that isn t built in out of the box eg

702343
gridview	repeater
edit note i am not talking about assigning a value to a control that is just on the page but one that is being databound to because it exists in a repeater template or gridview item template etc.

702441
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
actually i prefer to use the aspx for controls that you would expect to bind like listview gridview repeater and other similar controls

702460
implements	extends
and then each of your threads will extends notifyingthread and instead of implements run it will implements dorun

702460
implements	extends
note that better would be to implements runnable rather than extends thread for notifyingthread as extends thread is usually discouraged in new code

702461
put	get
put all of the spawned threads into a separate threadgroup and poll the activecount on the threadgroup and wait for it to get to 0

702488
subtract	add
well if you can guarantee that the character set is ascii then you can just subtract the char from a and then add 1 only add one if you want to start counting at 1 instead of 0

702535
ant	maven
are there ant plugins that wrap maven so that i can make use of its dependency management features to download jars for me and place them in my ant build s lib folder

702571
children	parent
is the only solution to ensure children cannot be more restrictive than their parent using generics ie myset child

mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
point is being changed between mousedown mousemove and mouseup so it has to be a parameter of a abstract tool

702728
inherited	subclassing
say the thing uses single table inherited so there are fancything and scarything subclassing

702762

702980
daemon	cron
more importantly i m frightened by the fact that my daily runs of git-cvsimport which i intended to put into cron or even write a daemon to run every five minutes or so might miss commits in the future

703017
getter	setter
i would have a private int field for the nhibernate persistence and a public getter setter property for the flag enum that read and write to the int field

703063
iboutlet	ibaction
in my controller i would use one ibaction connected to both controls and two iboutlet one for each control

703063
min	max
as said by peter hosey a formatter may be useful on your text field at least to take min and max values of stepper into account

703158
merb	ruby-on-rails
however especially larger ruby projects often have their own infrastructure merb datamapper and of course ruby-on-rails

703173
jfreechart	piccolo
if piccolo doesn t perform the plotting for you i would perhaps use jfreechart for the actual plotting since it s widely supported and very capable

703189
width	height
you give it an array of x points normalized of course you can convert your x pixels to these by dividing each pixel position by the width of your image and it will return the height of the distribution curve again multiply by your normalization factor

703192
integer	unsigned
so what is supposed to happen if you combine this with an unsigned integer conversion

703204
bazaar	git
i d go for git or bazaar bzr-pqm is an agent that does just that integrate incoming merges

703396
int	double
an 64-bit double can represent int + - 2 53 exactly

703396
int	double
given this fact i choose to use a double type as a single type for all my types since my largest int is unsigned 32-bit

703396
int	double
but now i have to print these pseudo int but the problem is they are also mixed in with actual double

703404
firefox	safari
these errors are not occurring in firefox safari or previous versions of ie

703412
onmousedown	onmouseup
in the window.onload you ll see that i assign the onmouseup and onmousedown events to functions that just call the increment or decrement functions with your initial timeout or the cleartimeout function to stop the counter

703414
udp	tcp
we re doing exactly what jason says except using a direct tcp udp socket listener with a custom payload for higher performance

703419

no combination of width and height works

703493
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
using uitabbarcontroller inside uinavigationcontroller is not supported

703501

all signed integer types have unsigned counterparts with the same size alignment requirements

703564
vim	emacs
should i use gui tools or write it all in vim emacs

703574
quicksort	mergesort
however because it s not random access it ll use mergesort instead of quicksort which will probably mean that the algorithm itself is a little slower

703577
width	height
what i m hoping to do is provide a star value for the height and width of the column and row definitions

703583
floating-point	integer
as to the other part of your question d as a format specifier wants an integer and you re giving it a floating-point number

703612
firefox	safari
this happens in firefox camino and safari

703626
notepad++	gedit
lastly i like colourful code so i like using basic text editors such as notepad++ or notepad2 or gedit to do my web coding

703645
firefox	safari
this works for me in firefox 3 safari 3

703693
rss	feed
feedparser provides an .id attribute for feed items -- this attribute should be unique for both rss and atom sources

703705
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this works in firefox opera and even safari and the resulting markup looks like this

703711
free	malloc
it s up to the runtime which is responsible for the memory allocation in the same way that you can delete an array created with malloc in standard c using free

703713
udp	tcp
so there is no tcp udp ip at all

703746
cvs	svn
i m only familiar with svn and cvs which have a set list of keywords but there would be applications for something like lineno or mylicencetext

703748
filtering	grouping
i m not sure this is necessarily database related since you could have a complex and expensive procedure more than a flag for applying a filtering for a grouping

703753
virtualbox	parallels
however you can get what you want by installing a virtual machine like parallels or sun s virtualbox installing suse on it and compiling there

703808
ant	maven
is there any reason you can t do this during the build process with ant or maven

703820

703873
bmp	png
is possible to resize image proportionally in a way independent of the image type bmp jpg png etc

703885
width	height
first and foremost you re not grabbing the current height and width of the image

703885
width	height
in order to resize proportionately you ll need to grab the current height width of the image and resize based on that

703890
width	height
i think your code is fine but taking in the width and the height as parameters is where you re going wrong in my opinion

703890
width	height
why should the caller of this method have to decide how big they want the width and the height

703903
domcontentloaded	onload
they ll then activate as soon as possible rather than waiting until the page is â readyâ which can take a long time especially on ie which doesn t support the domcontentloaded event so jquery has to wait for onload which only fires after all the images and everything are loaded

703922
width	height
note that the grid will dynamically fill the available area as your code stands and you will only need to apply star values if you define a fixed height and width to the grid and want proportional allocation of remaining space

703922
width	height
star value for the height and width of

703924
range	max	range	min	min	max
re-scaling variables to the range 0 1 by subtracting min variable and dividing by max variable

703944
imperative	declarative
anders hejlsberg also talks about imperative vs declarative programming which is a similar concept

703945
onmousedown	onmouseup
if you display a picture in a timage control that s the obvious first choice after all you can detect mouse clicks with the onmousedown and onmouseup events

703983
post	put
this click event will post some data to an external php script and then it should unbind the click events on all of the links so people cannot rate twice in quick succession. then it should put the data recieved from the php script into a span tag called #status

704017
profiling	benchmarking
profiling and or benchmarking algorithms and implementations in code

704198
salt	md5
i will say though that md5 isn t a very good level of encryption and you should consider something stronger such as encrypt with a custom salt

704209
spweb	spsite
the technical answer to your original question is a qualified no all spweb objects opened from an spsite are automatically disposed when the spsite is disposed

704209
spweb	splist
this means that it is not safe to use that spweb reference or any sp object created from it splist etc outside of your foreach loop

int	double
now in form a there are two fields required that allow data input one is for quantity int and the other is price double

704523
int	double
you can t cast a string to an int or a double you need to use int.parse or double.parse

704528
int	double
it s a string and you can t cast from string to int or double

otherwise having a single boolean isadmin field or an int enum in a role field is probably ok

704743
put	get
in the message sink before the call is put through to method is there someway to get hold of the test type so i can query the custom attribute timeout

704748
jlabel	jseparator
in your case you can have separate methods for adding jlabel jseparator etc. so that you don t have to repeat the information and can have differing arguments

704847
post	get
the way to get around it is as suggested in the post and to use an ivalueconverter

704888

bazaar	git
an incredibly rough eye balling of the numbers they posted showed bazaar to be 2-4x slower than either git or mercurial in the use cases tested

706457
bazaar	git
that being said the message conveyed on python-dev was that all of them git mercurial bazaar are better than subversion for the most part they are fast enough and the choice of mercurial over git bazaar was mostly based on the gut feelings of the bfdl and the attendees of pycon2009

width	height
if you want your custom component to resize in a way other then simply stretching the height and width values you need a public setsize function

708072
width	height
now this works great when your resizing the component in flash but once you actually publish your swf file you will notice that it switches back to stretching width and height rather then using your setsize function i dont know why but thats what it does

708072
width	height
to fix this in your oninit function you need to take the width and height feed them into your setsize and then reset the scalex and scaley values back to 1

it s available natively in safari google-chrome firefox and opera and available by using explorercanvas in ie which is a simple wrapper that makes ie s vml language accessible from a canvas compatible interface

710140
folder	directory
in order to share controls between web apps the only way i found was to either rewrite them into server controls or to use virtual directory to make the user controls actually in folder be in each project

710144
cassini	iis
this requires you to use iis for development not cassini and visual studio won t believe that the controls really exist but it will work at runtime and you can build just fine with only warnings about blahblah.ascx or blahblah.master path invalid

710150
richtextbox	textblock
make richtextbox look like textblock focusable false borderthinkness 0 borderbrush white ....etc

710273

public	protected
you can set the option to only generate documentation for public protected classes but i do not know if that will fit your scenario

710322
interpreted-language	compiled-language
however it is also important to note that .net is not an interpreted-language but a jit just in time compiled-language which means it runs natively on the machine

710379
http.sys	httplistener
using httplistener will wrap http.sys which will give us some of the performance statistics we require out of the box

710386
implements	extends
does object specify methods that classes extends it must implements in order to be useful

710403
factors	mean
on the other hand if there are certain factors that could change the behavior of this business logic then you should probably provide a mean of changing it such as xml configuration files that alter its behavior

710426
width	height
the big problem i found with programmatic skins is that the button refuses to measure the width height

710438
datamapper	activerecord
lastly if you have the freedom to choose your language you could try ruby s activerecord a rails package or datamapper or sequel

710442
spaces	delimiter
i would use logparser.exe you have a spaces delimiter entry that could be converted to a csv and then use import-csv in powershell to recreate a powershell object

710493
int	double
this prints derived.foo double - even though the compiler knows there is a matching method with a parameter of type int and the argument is type int and the conversion from int to int is better than the conversion from int to double the fact that only the foo double method is originally declared in derived means the compiler ignores foo int

710558
ironruby	ironpython
the dlr does sound cool and interesting but i m not sure i d end up using it much at least in terms of interoperating with ironruby ironpython

710570

710713
submit	submission
it sounds like you re expecting the alert dialog to happen on page load because you think the submit function is actually submission your form

it is an odd behaviour seen only on solaris that when i try to copy a symbolic link with the cp -r -p command to some other folder with a different name it copies the entire directory file it s pointing to

710959
jruby	mri
mri has pretty lousy threading concurrency support so if that s what your aiming for jruby is probably a better place to go

710966
rss	feed
now i want to send a rss feed to the webmasters when a comment is posted

710967
ereg-replace	eregi
your ereg-replace solution is wrong because the ereg eregi methods are deprecated

710967
spaces	linefeed
but what it does most of the time is replace two or more consecutive newlines along with any horizontal whitespace spaces or tabs that lies between them with one linefeed

710978
pivot-table	crosstab
what you are looking for is a pivot-table or crosstab report

710996

profiler	hprof
your kit java profiler is able to read hprof snapshots i am not sure if only for memory profiling or for cpu as well

711044
nsxmlparser	nsurl
i m not sure if you re doing iphone programming or not but for the record in the nsxmlparser class reference in the iphone 3.0 beta 2 sdk initwithcontentsofurl nsurl url does not appear to be deprecated

711052
implements	extends
in other words because bar only implements ifoo by virtue of extends foo you cannot use explicit implementation

711058
postgresql	mysql
you can t expect everyone that runs firefox to have mysql or postgresql installed on their machine

711079
postgresql	mysql
rather than bundling a huge db engine like mysql or postgresql with your deliverable sqlite is very lightweight and easy to include with your finished app

711100

i m trying to find a simple tcp udp debugging tool

711129
oledb	dataadapter

711435
firefox	safari
if you don t want any text this works in safari and firefox didn t test ie

711467
stringbuilder	stringwriter
one of the constructors of a stringwriter object is stringbuilder

711510
copying	overwrite
i m using synctoy 1.4 as my sync tool and it seems to work fine when it s copying new documents from clearcase to sharepoint but it s throwing an error when i try to overwrite a file with a new version or try to delete an existing file in sharepoint because it s deleted in clearcase

711511
inherited	properties
this would really only make sense when you have a model hierarchy inherited where the view is showing the common properties of the various child models

711628
children	parent
the easiest of course is just to have your parent class object have multiple instance variables being the children

711633
rss	icalendar
rss and icalendar support

711674
google-chrome	safari
strangely enough this happens in google-chrome but not in safari

711687
subtract	add

711704
firefox	safari
it works in safari and internet explorer but i haven t seen it work with firefox

711707
google-chrome	safari
i checked your page in safari which uses same engine as google-chrome webkit and the page works fine

but we can also use a short int or even a chars

711949
switching	screens
you create complete screens in code or as .nib via interfacebuilder switching between them using uinavigationcontroller or a uitabbar

711956
daemon	cron
also i m making the assumption that this job is only being run by the cron daemon so we can use the execute bit to determine whether or not cron should run the job

711969
exponent	modulo
in any case most rsa key pairs use 65537 as the public exponent and the modulo is always carried as part of the private key

711976
folder	directory
as this is presumably the admin screens of your application you probably don t want to make the directory an application in it s own right - if you do you d lose access to the main application below it which isn t what you d want and you ll possibly also have to have a seperate bin folder under there with the admin .dll in

712014
int	chars
on the powerpc there s usually a massive performance penalty involved in using anything other than int or whatever the native word size is -- eg don t use short or chars

712023
apache	nginx
is it possible to set fine-grained permissions using either apache or nginx

712026

712043
invokerequired	begininvoke
the only way i can think of is to use the invokerequired and begininvoke methods that are built in to ui elements to help you ensure that all code modifying a ui element is executed from the same thread used to create the element

712054
haskell	sml
it is semantically influenced more by java sml haskell and a very obscure oo language called gbeta

712154

if you use getter setter you can perform logic upon changes or access

712180
jobs	cron
are you able to run any other cron jobs for root successfully

712189
sudo	passwd
the first sudo will require an administrative passwd

712190
udp	tcp
the number of locations time as well as the way the location information is transmitted is it tcp udp etc will help determine the optimal approach

712195
getter	setter
i m assuming you mean exposing properties that would otherwise use getter setter - obviously there s a big difference if you leave all your attributes public

712208
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it s 100 ajax -- supported in ie firefox safari and google-chrome

712228
httprequest	httpresponse
these include httpcontext httpresponse httprequest and httpcookie

712264
put	get
definitely try to boil this down to a minimum three-line program or so compile from the command-line then put that class into your ide and see if you still get the error and if not then change add one line at a time until you have the original failing program looking for what causes the problem

712297
put	get
edit to get the rendering time on the page would be relatively hard because by definition the page can t be done rendering until your time is put on the page and you can t have the time until the page is done rendering

712302
stdout	stderr
try just sending stdout to the log file instead of both stderr and stout

712378

summary an embed with 100 width and height pushes its parents size to be 100 width and height of the grandparent

712459
width	height
how do i get the embed element to collapse all the white space around it so that it fits the width and height of its parent perfectly

712459
width	height
the video is of unknown size so how do i get rid of this whitespace while leaving height and width at 100

712468
post	get
i think the best you can get around this is by using ajax post whenever the user clicks on the submit button you can hook in that event create a json array of the things you want to persist and send it across

712468
post	get
the other way of course is to get all the information from the formcollection object in the post action

712514
disk	ram
i m not completely sure what classifies as activity on os x but if it s anything like linux i expect that network or disk io would count as would processes in the running state - that is to say crunching numbers or shuffling data around in ram

712532
installation	upgrade
oh and make sure you factor in patching scenarios upgrade installs with or without administrative permissions if applicable unattended installation multiple language support in the ui.

712535
superclass	subclassing
if you have a superclass and a subclassing you can hide the methods in the superclass from the subclassing by making them private

712535
superclass	subclassing
if you cast the subclassing to the superclass then the public methods on the subclassing are no longer visible

712556

right now we re using mysql 5.0 myisam tables innodb was killing on space usage alone and suffering greatly on #6 and #4

712626
postgresql	mysql
we re definitely moving to at least mysql 5.1 if we stay with mysql for the next release but strongly considering postgresql

712626
postgresql	mysql
indexing is really our main beef with mysql and it seems like postgresql may help us out through partial indexes and indexes based on functions

712626
postgresql	mysql
postgresql has long been labeled more advanced but slower - is that still generally the case comparing mysql 5.1 to postgresql 8.3 or is it more balanced now

712626
innodb	myisam
note on myisam vs innodb for us

712634
sudo	passwd
with the advent of sudo we seldom need to use a root passwd any more

the problem is that your code has an int as the first argument and c++ doesn t know whether to promote it to a double or long double

712640
pop-up	dialog
what happens if the ide pop-up a modal dialog for some reason

712644
innodb	myisam
myisam is probably even faster than innodb for retrieval but perhaps slower for indexing index repair

matrixvariable const qstring name int rows int cols double fill_real 0 double fill_complex 0 bool isreal true

713044
serializable	deserialization
the biggest bottleneck is likely to be serializable and deserialization of the data

713053
nsstring	nsobject
nsstring firstname will store aaa of a nsobject subclass

713091
indesign	framemaker
if you need very fine control over typography you re better off with tex or a proprietary tool like framemaker or indesign

713145
ssl	https
use https or tcp over ssl depends on your communication channel

713145
ssl	https
i d say stick with https tcp + ssl

713148
sorting	filtering
for example you may want to add filtering searching and sorting operations at which point you will need to switch to list from collection

713148
ilist	icollection
a different plan would be to inherit from icollection or better still ilist t and then delegate to a private collection member

713155
hash-collision	key
therefore unless you are performing a lot of key based operations on huge dictionaries with many hash-collision the speed of key to key comparisons will not be a major factor

713159
g++	gcc
afaik all of the code in classic text the c programming language second edition can be compiled using a standard c++ compilers like gcc g++

713161
websphere	ibm
we re running a fairly complex app as a portlet on websphere portal server 5.1 on aix using ibm jdk 1.4.2

713169
postgresql	mysql
you need for example partitioned tables which are in stable postgresql releases since at least 2005 - in mysql it is a novelty

713180
csv	tsv
because it is diffculties to understand the csv tsv

713180
csv	tsv
marc will u give us a sample for doing it .v now ony heard the terms csv tsv

713189
serializable	deserialization
or the serializable deserialization or the actual client server processing beyond the data transmission

713199
httphandler	httpmodule
maybe you should use httpmodule instead of httphandler

713215
csv	tsv
probably the easiest route is to export individual tables as csv tsv

713223
octal	decimal
the hexadecimal or decimal or octal is just the representation of that value in the source code

713228
tcpclient	sslstream
luckily this is as simple attaching an sslstream msdn to your tcpclient

713308
websphere	ibm
once we had a project that suffered major gc problems websphere and ibm jdk due to heap fragmentation

713315
put	get
to put it shortly use decimal 25 13 and you ll be fine with all calculations - you ll get precision right as declared 12 digits before decimal dot and 13 decimal digits after

713361
implements	extends
so you can implements several interfaces and interfaces can extends several other interfaces

713388
codeigniter	cakephp

width	height
height 200 width 400 status yes toolbar no menubar no location no

713539
post	get
if the only way you can get to that layout is through the form submission then you d need to attempt to do post to the server - however asp.net will generally refuse a postback from a different site - the viewstates etc will fail validation

713539
post	get
if you do have access to the code of www.vankampen.com then you could look at providing a mechanism to provide direct links to those pages or all a get rather than a post

713546
post	get
i can t use acceptverb.get on some asp.net mvc actions because when i use ie sends post instead of get

713558

hide	show
the other thing worth mentioning about the sstab is the way it show hide controls

714147
folder	directory
rather than doing getfiles and doing a brute force search you could most likely use getdirectories first to get a list of the first sub folder loop through those directory then repeat the process for the sub folder looping through them lastly look for the xml folder and finally searching for .xml files

714147
folder	directory
the following code snippet will search a directory structure and find all xml folder inside the entire directory tree

714192
spaces	delimiter
assuming your words are delimiter by a spaces you can do something like this

714328
lan	localhost
i have a lan but no proxy server and the c windows system32 drivers etc hosts with 127.0.0.1 localhost are there

714347
cvs	svn
cvs svn git etc

714361
postgresql	mysql
which i found useful because it s a little more portable mysql postgresql etc taking into account the differences of course

714383
cpython	ironpython
it shouldn t do things that are impossible for ironpython and jython to copy. i ve seen reports that this is what kept the cool parts of stackless from being merged into cpython

714399
width	height
there s really no way to guarantee the width height of a nice non-monospaced font unless the application will be used in a very strictly controlled environment

714424
printwriter	bufferedwriter
printwriter and bufferedwriter by default both use the writer they are constructed with as the lock

714439
hide	show
and the following jquery function that triggers hide show on click for an element that is either video or text

714497
haskell	scheme
i programmed c++ for quite a long time but when i started learning scheme python and subsequently haskell a whole new world of thinking opened up to me

714574
hash	md5
i am thinking that md5 hash would be a good way to tell

714625
min	max
unless you are sure that the first and last on each line is smallest biggest you ll need to use something like list util s min and max

714646
put	get
i also cannot figure out how to put a bounty on this question but i would really really love to get this issue solved

714675
elf	dwarf	elf	coff
it s usually in coff or elf dwarf i get those two mixed up format

714703
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
according to this tiff is supported by adobe flash player and adobe air together with bmp gif jpg and png

714710
rdiff-backup	unison
to summarize i recommend you combine unison and rdiff-backup for an all-round solution to keeping your data safe and reliably in sync

714798
sorting	grouping
maybe let a couple users learn basic crystal principals grouping sorting summing etc and you write the stored procedure and they format it with crystal

714814
public	protected
package-private is stricter than protected and public scopes but more permissive than private scope

714864
tao	jacorb
we use remedy it for our support needs both tao and jacorb

714873
comparator	comparable
you might want to improve this class so that instead of the abstract isgreaterorequal method the sort order would rely on java s comparator and comparable interfaces and also would make the class use generics.

714889
subtract	add
now you can reference calculate add and subtract just by their names

714938
post	get
in this case it will be empty on post back and you get your exception

714955
vb.net	vb6
majority of time is spent debugging enhancing legacy apps c++ vb6 with vb.net applications this is why i m applying for a junior level posision and would be willing to take a slight paycut just to be able to do new development with guidance from a good lead developer

714981
hide	show
it will now control a div tag in the .aspx page to show or hide the records - because the onclick points to a client side javascript function

714981
hide	show
the result is show hide functionality of data with out doing a postback

714986
sorting	filtering
note that you have a range filtering condition over user_offtopic_count that s why you cannot use an index over this field both in filtering and in sorting by other field

715003
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	svg	vml
google uses svg in firefox opera google-chrome and other browsers that support it and vml in internet explorer so you don t need third-party plug-ins

715014
min	max
you can then do a simple check on the min and max x y values to see whether the whole of the cube is visible

715024
dreamweaver	aptana
dreamweaver seems to be popular but i prefer the free aptana as i ve always wanted to get my hands dirty with code to get the feeling of being in control

715024
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
your site will work better when the change to ie7 comes or a change to even something better like safari google-chrome firefox opera or basicly anything other than ie

715095
post	get
which means sending initial get request to extract all form field and then creating a post to simulate the post back

715095
webclient	httpwebrequest
there are plenty of samples on how to use httpwebrequest or webclient for screen scraping including simulating logins and such

715095
post	get
send a get request get data preserve cookies extract form fields create a post request recreate headers including proper referrer form proper post body reassign cookies and you should be set

715124
onclick	onchange
i removed the onchange trigger and attached a onclick trigger to the label but now the trigger fires twice when the label is clicked once does enyone know why

715143
disk	ram
can i set up an iis server so that it will cache the most frequently used static files binary from disk into ram and serve from ram on request

715156
disk	ram
set up a ram disk if you have lots of ram

715156
disk	ram
but ram disk will help if you have a known problem

715160
disk	ram
what nate bross said is probably the most reliable way to keep them in ram assuming the ram disk is dynamically created from a real disk somewhere at boot

715197
put	get
the best way i ve thought of to get around this is to put the candidate rpms in a completely separate rpm repository but this also gets complicated because we have multiple rpms coming from the same repository that are on different release cycles so we ll be trying to pull the release candidate version of rpm a from the new repository while still wanting to get development snapshots of rpm b from the development repository

715221
firefox	safari
safari seems to browse each item in a sorted order instead of firefox where it s browse each item in the order of the added elements

715256
put	get
i have my team review the project specs requirements and put together a basic preliminary structure to get them already thinking through the application and working out specific questions

715313
versioning	upgrade
per the debian policy manual my postinst script is getting called at upgrade and configure time as postinst configure old-version where old-version is the previously installed versioning possibly null

715313
versioning	upgrade
i want to determine new-version the versioning that is currently being configured upgrade to

715335
post	get
what is the difference between get and post for ajax requests

715351
post	get
basically the difference between get and post is that in a get request the parameters are passed in the url where as in a post the parameters are included in the message body

715355
post	put
post and lesser-known friends put and delete are designed for modifying data on the server

715355
post	put
you should always design your server so that operations that modify data are called by post put delete

715355
post	get	post	put	put	get
other comments have links to rest which generally maps c r u d to post or put create get read put update delete delete

715358
datamodel	relational-model
in some domains those that would be better rendered with a fully object-oriented datamodel and that map poorly on relational-model you ll find that the two diverge quite significantly

715370
post	put
so if you re just getting a resource by id this makes sense but if you re committing changes to a resource you should be using put post or update for the http verb

715398
put	get
if i don t put a namespace in my classes vs.net 2008 which namespace do my classes get built under

715400
post	get
the difference is the same between get and post whether you re using ajax html form s or curl

715404
config	ini
the apache config will need to be set up properly for ini overrides to be effective

715429
try-catch	exception-handling
my question is how come funcb does not need to do a try-catch block around this java api method that throws an exception-handling

715509
ant	maven
i know ant offers that but i have not used maven myself

715530
googletest	gmock
i have chosen gmock which includes googletest

715552
firefox	safari
you could use the html5 workers api but that will only work on firefox 3.1 and safari 4 betas atm

715574
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
below exception there is runtimeexception also an unchecked-exception

715590
hide	show
you ll want to hide the click event item on mouseover so it doesn t show as well

715609
disk	ram
they are individually started via java -jar batch1.jar or some such. therefore sharing library .jar files only saves you disk space not ram

715630
folder	directory
the service account being used to run access the website directory security settings in iis has full control permissions on the folder and the xml file

715652
teamcity	nant
i then commit everything to svn and let teamcity run the nant script that executes msbuild.exe to compile the project and zip the output but the output is created in bin release and the zip file is empty because it looks in bin x86 release

715661
google-chrome	safari
on webkit based browsers safari google-chrome and others you can use the web inspector

715663
www-mechanize	lwp
make sure your lwp and www-mechanize modules are fully up to date

715670
boost	stl
it s just the right mix of close-to-the-hardware low-level grunt work to help you learn what s really going on with memory pointers and streams on one end combined with object design using high-level constructs like stl collections and garbage collection boost shared pointers etc on the other

715690
post	get
namely fake post requests require javascript to be enabled on the user side while fake get requests are still possible just with img script tags

715694
ssl	https
https via ssl is a tested method of doing this and it s a pretty easy fix

715757
grizzly	netty
it s minimalistic compared to grizzly mina and netty

715789
width	height
problem the build server has a basic video adapter and causes the forms to be truncated down to the resolution of the basic adapter rather than the height and width in the form itself

715789
width	height
one workaround that we ve discovered requires going into each form s load event and manually setting the height and width properties to the observed sizes in the form properties window

715789
width	height
1 where in the code project etc do i find the height and width of the form as shown in the properties window

715789
width	height
neither does opeing the .frx file and converting a known height or width to hex then searching

715836
vim	emacs
i would recommend trying out vim or emacs

715908
sudo	passwd
how do you set it so that sudo doesn t prompt you for your passwd every time

715932
sudo	passwd
this is generally a bad idea though as any user who gets access to an account that run commands through sudo without a passwd may be able to compromise the system

715932
sudo	passwd
also sudo should remember your passwd for a period of time

715940
sudoers	visudo
it explains all about nopasswd and the sudoers file which you should edit with visudo

715998
put	get
when following this method you have to consider all the available design elements that you can use to implement your mock up and make sure that you put them together in a well designed and semantic nature not just something that will get the job done

716021
folder	directory
the scenario to imagine would be something like joe sends you a large working copy with lots of nested directory and associated versioned .svn folder

716067
httphandler	httpmodule	isapi	httpmodule
in this mode asp.net httpmodule s basically have nearly as much power as an isapi filter would have had and asp.net httphandler s can have nearly equivalent capability as an isapi extension could have

716101
client-side	server-side
the deployment scenario introduces the potential to upgrade the server any server-side module the client and any client-side module independently

716104
ubuntu	debian
i would say that the easier to use and more complete free distros are fedora debian and ubuntu

716104
redhat	fedora
i switched to fedora when that project started it s simply the free open version of redhat

716105
innodb	myisam
although if you want to maintain the contents of your databases at all you re better off just using one of the disk-based storage engines innodb or myisam and just giving your server a lot of ram to use as a cache

716174
listboxitem	textbox
since the preview events bubble down the listboxitem will process the event as soon as the user clicks the textbox combobox or any other control you set the event on

716175
put	get
so i put one button on main window so when user clicks the button the datagrid on selected tabitem get processed

716226
firefox	safari
the above code seems to work correctly in safari 4 and firefox 3 i m not sure how it would work in ie

716243
for-loop	loops
enumeration is used when we use vector hashtable etc while iteration are used in while loops for-loop etc

716249
subtraction	addition
if the b operator models subtraction it really shouldn t be ambiguous but if it was addition it might be ok

716252
put	get
you can use the tostring method to get the string representation of a guid value so that you can put it in the form

716270
ienumerable	ienumerator
the .net framework provides two important interfaces relating to enumerators ienumerator and ienumerable

716333
punctuation	words
as such you have to be aware that funky punctuation and stuff can make it in--it s not just words

716360
free	malloc
what is the difference between new delete and malloc free

716388
for-loop	loops
a python for-loop has an unusual else clause which is executed if loops goes through all of the elements without a break

716398
public	protected
to make this work you would have a public or protected property on your page called showlabel which returns a boolean

716400
width	height
the height and width are stored in twips a device-independent unit of measure so you have to divide by screen.twipsperpixelx and -y to get the proper value

716412
post	get
there are some post about this matter but i didn t clearly get when to use object-oriented coding and when to use programmatic functions in an include

716414
google-chrome	firefox
contenteditable works tested in firefox and google-chrome on elements which are foreign to html xhtml if i use this doctype

716438
implements	extends
the second example here has some premisses that is that all car classes will either extends an abstract class or implements an interface

716438
implements	extends
both allow you to force extends or implements classes to define a specific function such as drive

716438
implements	extends
that is because they re extends an abstract class containing the drive method or implements an interface forcing the drive method to be defined

716438
implements	extends
so as long as you make sure that all your specific cars either extends the abstract class car or implements an interface such as canbedriven both of which must declare the drive method you can just call the drive method on an object which you know is a car but not what type of car without fear of it not being defined as php will throw fatal errors at you until you define those methods in your specific car classes

716453
drive	createfile
becuase it is a drive letter the usual way of reading and writing to a usb drive is to use file-system functions such as fopen or the windows createfile

716495
spaces	delimiter
it takes each line in the filehandler and splits it using spaces as a delimiter

716516
groovy	gpath
thanks to the improvements made in groovy 1.6 grails is quite a bit snappier than jruby on rails and you get amazingly good xml support via gpath

716516
vim	emacs
i use vim and emacs mostly because i can t stand using ides

716524
freebsd	linux
specifically i m looking for ways to be able to write and test a web-based application written in either ruby or python complete with a back-end database that i can then wrap up in a convenient set of platform-independent packages of some type for deployment on windows linux os x and freebsd

716543
jruby	mri
also something i m not clear about besides mri and jruby how many different implementations are there and why do i as a ruby programmer need any implementation except the mri

716543
jruby	mri
are there any other times i might need to look into an implementation besides the mri or jruby

716557
rss	feed
i used the tag to add the rss icon and it leads to a page that provides a valid atom feed according to the w3c validator

716572
cvs	svn
i m not positive this use case is even relevant in git but noting a file s path and or revision numbers in the patch header included with cvs svn give me a warm fuzzy that the patch that i have received or created is diffing against the correct source or revision

716572
cvs	svn
i understand that revisions aren t as meaningful in git as they are in cvs svn due to the distributed nature but am i the only one who wouldn t mind seeing at least the abbreviated commit signature of the files in the header

716593
rss	feed
i ve worked with rss not atom feed in the past and have never had to change the header as long as the feed was formatted correctly

716625
mri	rubinius
rubinius is a ground-up reimplementation meant as an alternative to mri with a much cleaner foundation

716641
subtract	add
access speed is virtually identical to an array with the additional advantages of being able to add and subtract elements to a list although this is an o n operation with an arraylist and that if you decide to change the underlying implementation later on you can

716648
int	chars	int	boolean
don t forget that java has a fixed data types boolean chars int long float and object this include all objects even an array is an object

716658
strcpy	strdup
use my functions and copy information using strcpy or strdup

716674
versioning	upgrade
the migrations allow you to upgrade or downgrade the database schema from any versioning and to any versioning incrementally

716763
lisp	scheme
a usual programming exercise for students learning scheme a lisp dialect is to write a simple object system using closures

716780
post	get
then using the curl library in php you can make a get or post request to that url

716787
int	double
if you know in advance the number of elements and don t need flexibility an array of millions of int or double will be more efficient in memory and marginally in speed than a list because indeed they will be stored contiguously and accessed instantly

716787
int	chars
that s why java still uses arrays of chars for strings arrays of int for image data etc

716794
udp	tcp
generally the nat in front of the client at the tcp level will be able to determine that the connection at the udp was create

716794
udp	tcp
if the udp connection is created after the tcp connection by the server opening a socket to the client to a known udp port then upnp might be worth looking into it will allow you to automatically set up your port forwards on your nat that is only if your nat supports upnp as is the case of dsl routers

716794
udp	tcp
a work-a-round would be to client to open both tcp and udp sockets to the server

716794
udp	tcp
since the client behind the nat initiated the connection the states of both tcp and udp connections will be added to the nat s connection table

716819
mouse	keyboard
synergy doesn t allow you to move windows between machines that would require a silly amount of work behind the scenes but it does allow you to share a keyboard and mouse between two machines so they appear to be all one machine but actually run separately

716821
mouse	keyboard
it only forwards mouse keyboard events from one set of physical devices to different computers

716830
width	height
it says the height and width are stored in twips as angry jim observed

716830
width	height
don t ever set the height and width of the form at run time

716830
width	height
the vb6 runtime calculates the appropriate height and width from those

716874
rss	feed
you will keep refreshing all of your development rss feed all night

716891
many-to-many	one-to-many
by this i mean figuring out that foreign key relationships are a relationship one-to-one one-to-many or many-to-many of some kind the type mapping etc

716891
put	get
with sql it s easy because you can write a single query or a small number of queries to get all that data in one hit and put it in a custom value object just for that purpose

716910
put	get
put 74.50.106.245 into yougetsignal and you ll get a list of hostnames that previously resolved to the dailywtf server when people queried them not anything to do with the reverse dns ptr entry

716920
ready	each
qcodo is a mvc framework of code generator a lot of codes are ganerated from your database design and produce ready to use search edit form for each of your database table

716920
many-to-many	one-to-many
it also handle the database table relationship to pre-generate a set of methods for one-to-many many-to-many relationship between tables

716926
ubuntu	debian
same problem with debian unstable ubuntu jaunty both ship zsh 4.3.9

716968
jar	war
if you have a war file not yet deployed you can extract it using the command line tool jar or get a file listing from it

716968
jar	war
don t forget to copy the mysql jar file into web-inf lib before creating the war file

716970
google-chrome	safari
it goes wrong in a bizarre way in safari google-chrome and fx - the cell s size is calculated before the text is rotated

716974
google-chrome	safari
the new css transforms in the latest safari google-chrome and fx don t quite work either includes example

717008
post	get
you might want to first check that you can make get and post requests to the server first

717038
integer	unsigned
the vector s size is typically an unsigned integer

717044
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
my advice is to use mozilla as your 1st choice testing browser and every now and then test the page on other browsers ie6 ie7 ie8 opera google-chrome and safari at least

717059
integer	unsigned
as size usually returns an unsigned integer it should be quite safe to typecast it to a signed one

717123
shadowing	named
there s less code to read there s no unnecessary local variable introduced and no potential named clash with another local or shadowing of any variable with the same named in an enclosing scope

717128
disk	ram
my current development machine has four 3ghz processors in it 8gb of ram and 750gb of disk space raid 1 so it s really double that and two 19-inch flatscreen monitors

717174
button	checkbox
i am coming from a qt background and in qt i would use a stretch element between the button and the checkbox to push them apart dynamically

717231
webrat	cucumber
bdd is a testing paradigm shift especially if you start using cucumber and webrat but it s fantastic once you get into it

717237
uiview	calayer
i might suggest an alternative approach where you create a new uiview or calayer for each drawing operation

717363
many-to-many	one-to-many
there are a couple of additional lessons here about what it means to have a a one-to-many relationship or a many-to-many and what it means to to make an fk nullable or not

717367
subtraction	multiplication
my impression is that the above algorithm is better than the classic one because the multiplication tend to restore the loss of precision of the subtraction

717373
post	get
i m not terribly familiar with the difference between a javascript date and a vb.net date in terms of format but if you post an example i m sure we can get a basic conversion going

717385
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i have a property that changes to invalid as i move between viewdidload and viewwillappear

717385
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i don t do anything between viewdidload and viewwillappear

717444
postgresql	mysql
i am developing a php application that uses sqlite as database management system mysql and postgresql etc

717457
hide	show
the separation is not entirely clear in fact you can show hide view components or change then and that can be seen as altering the view

717471
gridview	sqldatasource
here is my markup in my .aspx page the sqldatasource is feeding my gridview

717489
try-catch	exception-handling
in this case the try-catch in methoda just elevates the exception-handling but doesn t really handle it

717524
itunes	iphoto
not document-based generally library-based like mail itunes iphoto create a subclass of nsobject instantiate it and make it the application s delegate and in the delegate s applicationdidfinishlaunching method create a window populate it with views and order it front

717541
lxml	beautifulsoup
what s my best bet for parsing html if i can t use beautifulsoup or lxml

717552
hide	show
this textbox will then have the + symbol on it and clicking will show hide the your month-by-month breakout the hidden columns

717576
stdout	stderr
here s a related question using c++ -- cross-platform linux win32 nonblocking c++ io on stdin stdout stderr

717600
bitconverter	binaryreader
you could either use binaryreader around a stream or bitconverter with a byte array to convert an integer at a time or use buffer.blockcopy to copy the data from a into an

717633
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

717638
servicebus	masstransit
servicebus - for example masstransit

717662
freebsd	linux
i ve also looked at the linux and freebsd source but they are quite large and will take time to understand

717675
google-chrome	safari
however in webkit based browsers google-chrome safari etc the menu doesn t have a background and it seems like the padding is not being used

717681
for-loop	loops
why cannot i use foreach loops instead of for-loop .

717701
alloca	malloc
for example the arm realview rvct compiler s alloca uses malloc to allocate the buffer referenced on their website here and also causes the compiler to emit code that frees the buffer when the function returns

717703
post	get
the server confirms that post requests are coming through from ie yet it would get the post data only occasionally

717710
post	get
also i don t believe that post calls would ever get cached but just in case try setting the cached to false

717720
post	get
i can select the subject the original author the number of replies but what i can t do is get the username topic or date of the last post

717764
unsigned	short
because in vssapi.lib the first argument to shouldblockrevert isnâ t wchar_t itâ s unsigned short

717764
unsigned	short
once thatâ s done the lpcwstr macro is defined to unsigned short name mangling matches planets align and you can link

717815
for-loop	arrays
this function could take an arrays which could be nested into a 100 levels while you writing a for-loop would then require you to nest it 100 times

717859
tftp	telnet	ftp	telnet
curl supports following protocols http https ftp ftps scp sftp telnet ldap ldaps dict file tftp

717887
post	get
and hateos isn t limited to just traversing links using http get forms using post or some other method if the browser just happens to support it can be though of as describing a representation to send to the server

717983
udp	tcp
these are two different things socks is a protocol that allows you to route tcp and udp socks v5 through a proxy server and it s for outgoing connections routers dont have anything to do with this except they are acting as a proxy too

717994
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
i ve considered just storing the numbers with 1 subtract so for example 1.0001 would be stored as 0.0001 - but the problem is that to multiplying them together again i have to add 1 and at this point i lose precision

717994
multiplying	add
to address this i could use bigdecimals to perform the calculation convert to bigdecimal add 1.0 then multiplying and then convert back to doubles afterwards but i have serious concerns about the performance implications of this

717996
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
this means you can store the numbers with 1 subtract and instead of multiplying just add them up

equals	compareto
i ve just written some code where i needed to implement compareto and override equals to get my program to work in a sane manner

717999
next	except
from the mozilla perspective the purpose of these changes except for adding more capabilities for use by web developers is to lead up to javascript 2.0 that is being developed as the next revision of ecma 262 revision 4 tc39 workgroup

717999
google-chrome	safari
also it may be interesting to note that webkit the engine developed by kde and used by safari google-chrome and several free software browsers supports javascript 1.7

718010
addition	multiplication
logarithms conveniently reduce multiplication to addition

718026
opera	firefox
what is more information on support in ie firefox and opera and their respective versions is available on all of the appropiate pages

718061
equals	compareto
this includes equals hashcode compareto etc

718086
folder	directory
you just have to convert all print statements in the console.py and platform_ info.py files under the python1 folder in your netbeans installation directory to use parenthesis

718154
folder	directory
maybe you don t need different folder in build directory

718174
mouseover	mouseout
the e in each of the functions represent the event object for the mouseover and the mouseout event respectively

718196
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
after researching it a little bit it seems that monodevelop was started as a port of sharpdevelop which is an open source .net ide for windows

718239
postgresql	mysql
i just want to re- familiarize myself with these different sql dialects and compare techniques and timing to the mysql and postgresql i do have installed

718247
tostring	compareto
i usually implement the compareto method as well as the tostring method

718256
vmware	virtualbox
for sql server you will have to get windows either as a separate os or in a virtual machine like virtualbox or vmware

718267
post	get
if you need to get data up to a server use a post

718291
many-to-one	one-to-many	children	parent
it seems a little backwards from an oo standpoint and obviously i realize that relational is way different from oo but i guess it s the only way to represent one-to-many relationships which feels like it should be more accurately described as many-to-one as the one parent doesn t reference the many children it s many child entries that reference the one parent

718293
system.in	system.out
x y via system.out and read in text via bufferedreader system.in but you don t have any control over what appears in the console as a result of user input

718300
many-to-many	one-to-many
in many-to-many relationships and one-to-many relationships with attributes ternary relationships etc. you have relation tables

718328
strstr	substr
if the number of options is small and you don t otherwise want need the extra flexibility and complexity of a parser you could simply search for each potential replacement substr using strstr

718356
move	drag
you can monitor the direction of a drag and move your sprite accordingly

718363
gif	ico
worse it tries for both ico and gif format for each

718370
multi-tier	n-tier	multi-tier	soa
web services is essentially soa service oriented architecture which can imply a multi-tier n-tier model

718407
equals	tostring
on objects that are used primarily for holding data rocks i find tostring and the equals hashcode contract to be invaluable

718407
equals	tostring
this is because rocks are typically passed into and extracted out of collections all the time most notably the hash set map collections which require the equals and hashcode contract and it is very easy to see these objects in a debugger if tostring is implemented

718446
equals	tostring
effective java has a chapter on how and when to implement tostring equals hashcode comparable etc

718508
post	get
it basically involves lots of ajax post get requests from each user to the server - which in turn translates to database reads and writes

718508
post	get
i know optimisation is quite a tricky specialised area but what advice would you give me to get maximum speed of operation here - speed is of paramount importance but currently some of these post requests take 20-30 seconds to return

718508
post	get
also do the ajax post and get requests incur the same overhead in terms of speed

718537
width	height
i would say a policy on images sizes pixels height and width is necessary as you seem to indicate that only some have problems

718581
int	double
don t forget to cast your int to double

718593
opensuse	linux
the easiest way now to get monodevelop is running opensuse linux under virtualbox

718596
equals	tostring
for data value classes i have an abstractpojo class which uses reflection to implement equals hashcode tostring and asmap

718596
implements	extends
i extends this class for all my data value objects so i don t implements this each time

718624
ilist	iqueryable
but to handle paging for findall i m debating whether or not to expose iqueryable ilocation instead of ilist to simplify the interface for circumstances such as paging

718625
ienumerable	ilist
i recommend using ienumerable instead of ilist with it you will have more flexibility

718650
children	parent
that encoded the parent of each node in the children

718697
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
an object is a variable of any type or a memory area allocated with malloc calloc realloc

718697
integer	unsigned
looking at things at a lower level a pointer is typically implemented as an unsigned integer

718697
integer	unsigned
in most modern environments this then becomes the same thing as checking for overflow with unsigned integer arithmetic

718728
typedef	struct
in order to have a nice struct i want to have a typedef to this function pointer

718792
firefox	safari
i am having this problem using safari 4 firefox 2.0

718793
firefox	safari
in firefox safari etc

718807
ironruby	ironpython
you could use a ironruby or ironpython script and utilise the system.net.networkinformation namespace although it would prob be easier to whip up a quick c# or vb.net console app

718811
post	get
is it because you re not rebinding the event because you only populate your list and therefore wire up your event on the buttons - i can t see where your wire-up is occurring on a get as opposed to a post

718862
children	parent
addlogicalchild will not result in logicalchildren returning our children automatically it only sets the parent

718934
firefox	safari
since the web site will be launched in about a year from now we skip support for ie6 and focus on ie7 ie8 firefox 3.x+ and safari version to be decided

718938
bash	tcsh	jline	readline
people familiar with the readline editline capabilities for modern shells such as bash and tcsh will find most of the command editing features of jline to be familiar

718949
google-chrome	safari
ie7 8 ff3 safari 3 and google-chrome

718966
perl	tcl
does anyone know of a library for any of the major scripting languages tcl perl python ruby lua or less major ones newlisp for example which implements bignums in different radices with handling for radix point

718996
pow	sqrt
if you need more things like sqrt log or pow this workaround will get too complex and you should really look for a library

719040
codeigniter	kohana
i am using kohana but this question applies to rails codeigniter or any other mvc web development framework

719043
boost	stl
however is there a less obtrusive stl or boost equivalent to writing

719064
ssl	https
in order to set up ssl and https i need to obtain and install an ssl certificate

719067
disk	ram
do you know what tools they have what architecture they want to compile on how many cpus they have how much ram and disk might be available to them

719108
int	boolean
for other data types the compiler can catch this as an expression like has an int value so it can t be used in the if statement but an expression like has a boolean value so the compiler has to accept it

719152
width	height
there s no reason to define the width of your layout according to the height or width of a typeface

719159
lisp	scheme
their development environment was written in allegro common lisp and it included a compiler for a scheme a lisp dialect variant

719163

do you make different controllers for get and post requests

719163
post	get
i personally see js requests just like get post or any other type of request

719170

also all addition and subtraction on that fixed-point variable was also fixed-point

719172
put	get
to get the maximum out of bricks just put them together

719180
x86	64bit
on the mac for example the 32bit version and the 64bit version runs on both powerpc and x86 from a single application

719187
sunos	aix
on the other hand autoconf used to be far more important when the target platforms were more heterogeneous and linux aix hp-ux sunos ... and a large variety of different processor architecture had to be supported

719227
fink	macports
the only issue is that if you use macports or fink these will probably not see that you have ghc installed and try to install their own version of it

719228
lisp	scheme
plt scheme is probably the lisp with the most work done on making it easy to write and distribute a little game or graphical app. they include many examples of games in the base distribution and their flagship ide drscheme is written in their own graphics framework

719260
versioning	upgrade
in general you don t need to upgrade binutils unless you run into some bug fixed in a later binutils versioning or need new features such as linker build-ids

719291
inherited	subclassing
inserts will still be to the separate table usertype and usertype2 but then in oo programming ctors aren t inherited either and two subclassing of a common based don t necessarily have similar ctors

719322
free	malloc
you re calling free without calling malloc

719359
post	get
i figure i don t need to post the creation of three dropdowns when i can t get even one dropdown to work

i think you ve already seen the question about tools for migrating vb6 to vb.net

719392
implements	extends
i m wanting to implements some custom reusable and efficient scroll behavior in an iphone app so i m extends uiscrollview with my custom control and wish to track scroll movements

719397
vpn	lan
you can do this for any lan machine or for any remote machine connected to your lan via vpn

719431
postgresql	mysql
every single time i thought i had them working i would get some random error involving the postgresql or mysql setup or the paths were screwed up or some other command line error not recognized as an internal or external command or something

719441
gif	bmp
i have an application that generates a replay of air traffic and i need to allow the user to capture parts of the canvas so it can be exported as a bmp of gif

719445
folder	directory
in this case you need to include the php folder or directory path to the all the global paths available in command line interface

719468
subtract	add
just add and subtract your codes

719468
subtract	add
note that it does not necessarily have to be add or subtract

719494
debian-based	ubuntu
in my experience ubuntu and other debian-based oses are much more trouble-free developer environments for almost everything except c# and .net stuff

719497
bytearrayinputstream	urlconnection
then create a bytearrayinputstream with it and process that stream in place of the stream you got from the urlconnection

719508
rss	feed
for example by using appshopper s rss feed

719535
postgresql	mysql
for ror and django consider not using mysql and postgresql at this time

719537
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
that all works fine in ie fx opera - the code registers a document.onkeypress event handler when the box is shown then tests the event keycode to see if it s the escape key or not keycode 27 but this doesn t seen to work in webkit based browsers google-chrome and safari 3 though other keys can be captured this way

719545
firefox	safari
renders pixel-for-pixel the same in safari whose baseline i trust and both firefox and ie7 check out as good

719547
keydown	keyup
catch keydown keyup instead

719599
profiling	benchmarking
you can benchmarking in firefox using firebug s profiling and by writing out to the console like this

719629
put	get
i believe all macs sold in the last couple of years have been core 2 duo anyway and will all support at least 2gb - but it does pay to get one that will let you put 4gb in

719631
nsis	uninstaller
how do i require user to uninstaller previous version before installing a new version with nsis

719642
profiling	instrumentation
that being said instrumentation can be very valuable for the goals profiling is meant to address

719666
pop-up	dialog
asp.net pop-up dialog

719672
pop-up	dialog
the basic idea is to have the click function on the button pop-up the dialog then return false to stop the normal action

719676
kde	gnome
except in rare situations your keyboard and display are managed by a window manager x11 gnome kde carbon cocoa or windows

719695
getter	setter
define getter and setter if you want to access them externally

719709
libjpeg	libpng
libpng libjpeg and others are good for loading saving images at a low level but there are probably other higher-level image libraries as well

719713
bazaar	trac
if i would like to use a vcs like bazaar and use loggerhead instead of trac then right now there isn t really much choice beyond launchpad which has its warts

719742
aptana	radrails
aptana radrails is only as accessible as the eclipse ide and i imagine you would not interested in it...the k-force is weak in this one

719742
emacs	textmate
i m not sure what textmate e-text editor s counterparts are in nix emacs

719763
daemons	systemd
sqlite is the speed daemons of choice for systemd that don t make heavy use of concurrent connections and complicated database features

719763
postgresql	mysql
you might also want to take a look at mysql postgresql or mssql ce or express both free

719763
postgresql	mysql
edit based on your comments you will probably need something that runs on a server like mysql postgresql or mssql express

719788
inherited	properties
so if i want to use the memory management inherited by a synthesized properties i d use something such as

719797
awt	swing
shouldn t take you more than a day or two to learn the language but you might have to spend a few weeks on the class library how to use collections the concurreny package reflection logging swing awt dynamic proxies mbeans etc

719799
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the code works perfectly in safari firefox and google-chrome

719799
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
anyone have any idea how to get the page to popup in ie preferably with code that works in safari firefox and google-chrome too

719816
getter	setter
properties are just setter and getter for ivars and should almost always be used instead of direct access

719816
getter	setter
it s easy now to distinguish between ivars and getter setter

719827
mouseup	mousedown
the other tricky bits are handling mousedown and determining if its time to start dragging mouse move while dragging and mouseup for end of dragging

719836
actualheight	actualwidth
i could use an ivalueconverter on a binding object to calculate the exact center given it s actualwidth actualheight and translatepoint to find the upper left corner

719839
hide	show
this function looks at the state of the model member properties state and enables disables hide show whatever

719847
put	get
understandably you cannot put a lot of information into 5 minutes so hopefully this will give you enough to get going but if you have further questions please feel free to ask

719851
nsis	uninstaller
here is how i use nsis to uninstaller the current version while installing a new version of the same application

719862
post	get
request the form s action url with net http or something can t recall the exact module and include the forms fields as a get post parameter whichever the form calls for

719870
subscript	superscript
and superscript and subscript respectively

719879
altera	xilinx
you can trace activity on signals in a running fpga design using embedded logic analyzer software tools like altera signaltap or xilinx chipscope

719950
firefox	safari
because of the defined width select is cut off from showing their full values unlike in firefox safari where they are automatically resized to show the whole length of the value

719976
folder	directory
i created a folder devweb under the document root but instead of copying all the files i configured the server so that if a requested file didn t exist in the devweb directory it would look for it under the document root

720082
cvs	svn
currenltly we have cvs git and svn implementations

720133
hide	show
i am trying to trigger a show hide of one div at a time

720140
inherited	properties
in context of oo if you are working in a single inherited model there is an excellent case to be made for preferring interfaces over classes for defining your object model since that single super class pathway is fairly precious and you want to save it for something more substantial than defining properties that are exposed on an object or methods

720195
equals	gethashcode
generally speaking if you re overriding equals you want to override gethashcode

720195
equals	gethashcode
by overriding equals and gethashcode you can report equality based on internal values rather than the objects reference

720235
int	chars
the basic data types like byte short int long chars and string implement a good gethashcode method

720281
nsstring	nsobject
why is object declared as an nsobject if it s supposed to be an nsstring

720282
equals	gethashcode
when overriding equality you should always have a matching equals and gethashcode for two values if equals returns true they must return the same hash-code but the converse is not required - and it is common to also provide operators and often to implement too

720291
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
it works in firefox 1.5+ opera 9+ safari i don t know what versions and ie6+ using vml instead of canvas

720294
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
from everything i can see the uiviewcontroller s self.navigationcontroller is designed to always return the appropriate uinavigationcontroller as long as the uiviewcontroller exists within a uinavigationcontroller s stack

720326
inherited	subclassing
for example if one method in job2.pm needs to be customised i might create a subclassing customjob2 which inherited from job2 and contains only the method to be customised

720355
put	get
a variant way of doing that is for the constructor to get the current database handler and put a reference to it in an instance variable

720356
decoder	encoder
update i tried decoding fakebytedata using an online decoder encoder and could not load the image

720371
filesystems	ntfs
note that if you set a deny permission in the filesystems ntfs for a group like users then it will override all other permissions such that an administrator would be effected by the deny permission

720373
jobs	cron
i know that there is cron jobs for this on linux but that is not available on windows

720483
put	get
the closest you can get is to put a series of text boxes in the header and arrange them manually into a table

720495
width	height
i need to center align images variable width and height inside block level elements of fixed width and height

720539
width	height
it s not an object that can actually do anything or have any properties other than a width and height

720607
maya	blender
big names in the 3d modeling tool domain include 3d studio max maya blender lightwave and modo

720667
firefox	safari
i ve tried under both firefox and safari with the latest 2.0 download installed

720699
firefox	safari
also on each page i looked at these were written as html tags but were rendered as text by firefox and safari

720746
boost	stl
i would really recommend using stl vector or boost multi_array containers for this

720780
width	height
then you can access the stage s width height using

720780
width	height
note that there is no underscore before the width and height properties

720785
hide	show
i think i have sinse found a small plugin which allows show or hide the full path

720826
versioning	upgrade
this would allow me to display a message to inform them that they re running an old versioning and that they might want to upgrade

720826
versioning	upgrade
when one of my visitors is using such an old versioning basically i would like to encourage not force them to upgrade

720829
folder	directory
if you are used to creating a virtual directory pointing to the folder where your service resides that no longer works

720839
bibtex	latex
while it is possible to use make to do most of the work a specialized tool can handle the intricacies of latex such as rerunning bibtex a number of times to get all references sorted and things like that

720842
mouse	keyboard
the controller interprets mouse and keyboard inputs from the user and maps these user actions into commands that are sent to the model and or viewport to effect the appropriate change

720843
put	get
for such cases - this is what i do - i get rid of the code behind and simply put that code in my aspx ascx file itself

720873
opera	firefox
i also tried setting the option explicitly it s supposed to be the default. i ve tested in firefox 3 and opera 9.6 so doubt it s browser specific

721024
int	chars
enum causes c++ to choose an unspecified integral underlying type for you -- it could be as small as chars if your enum contains only small values though empirically most compilers by default will use an int

721207
int	chars
for asc you can cast the chars to an int like this

721207
int	chars
and for chr you can cast back to a chars from an int like this

721224
int	chars
given chars c and int i and functions fi int and fc chars

721224
int	chars
from chars to int analog of vb asc

721224
int	chars
explicitly cast the chars as an int i int c

721224
int	chars
from int to chars analog of vb chr

721224
int	chars
explicitly cast the int as an chars c chars i fc chars i

721224
int	chars
an implicit cast is disallowed as an int is wider has a greater range of values than a chars

721237
cdr	cons
you re checking whether the second cons cell cddr l has a cdr or not

721363
children	parent
i could save the parent first and then add the children on to it but this would introduce more work

721387
int	chars
error 20 error lnk2028 unresolved token 0a0002cf public bool __thiscall rcsclient resumechannel chars int __int64

721398
put	get
i need to be able to do common tasks like using the up one level button or put the control in file search mode get the active item etc

721431
factors	matrix
it doesn t sound like you d benefit a lot from a full digestion of a linear algebra course which goes into eigenvalues matrix factors other stuff

721444
hash	salt
it s encryption and from the sounds of things this is really more of a salt or cypher not real encryption. a hash is one-way by definition

721458
des	aes	des	rsa	rsa	aes
pycrypto supports aes des idea rsa elgamal etc

721470
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
does firefox opera safari complain when you run it in any of those

721493
pop-up	dialog
as i think about it more you could probably use javascript to load the pages as pop-up and then open the print dialog for each of the loaded pages

721503
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
i want the photos to be stored in a thumbnail grid fashion when the user clicks on the photo it should bring up the photo on a separate page. - i would think any asp.net repeatable control that supports templating of the item element such as datagrid gridview repeater listview in asp.net 3.5 etc should do the trick for you here

721503
width	height
just set the image or asp image height and width as appropriate for your thumbnails

721563
gridview	repeater
maybe a repeater is better but you will be fine with a gridview if you are familiar with it

721608
subtract	add
all you need to do is find the sheet index of the starting page and the sheet index of the ending page subtract them and add 1

721609
versioning	upgrade
but i wanted to know a thing if i make a change to one of the dll files and upgrade it s assembly versioning from 1.0.0.0 to 1.0.0.1 but do not change the publish versioning it still is 1.0.0.0

721637
pop-up	dialog
i want to implement a logon dialog box that accepts a username password so obviously i don t want the user to be able to dismiss the modal pop-up

721738
post	get
one of the major benefits of going the wap web application projects route rather than wsp website projects is that you get the ability to have post build events

721840
put	get
to get aroud it have all the pages inherit from a base page and place put the master page reference there

721863
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
when you create an environment you pass the pointers to your own malloc realloc and free

721865
profiling	debugging
accelerating application development cycles with code assist quick fixes sql to java round-trip debugging and profiling tools

721872
mouse	keyboard
they also give you the opportunity to build your own and make use of the framework to handle mouse keyboard events and stuff

721878
dictionary	map
brute forcing use something like owasp dirbuster ships with a great dictionary - also it will parse responses therefore can map the application quite quickly and then find resources even in quite deeply structured apps

721900
lan	localhost
if you are using firefox and doing localhost testing or maybe even on lan you may want to try editing the network.dns.disableipv6 setting

721903
int	double
of course if operator+ makes sense in general for your struct then you d want to add overloads for using smystruct on the left as well and or make them templates so that you get functions for int float double long etc

721984
put	get
office workers are much less likely to report a vulnerability and are often incredibly sloppy in their security habits -- passwords get put into wikis and written down on post-it notes stuck to the monitor road warriors don t encrypt their laptop hard drives and so on

722003
folder	directory
my puzzle is that when i run the application via the ide and get it to print the current working directory system.out.println system.getproperty user.dir i expect the console output to be bin - instead the value printed is the projectroot folder without the bin suffix

722003
folder	directory
if i were to navigate to the bin folder directly and execute my java class the current working directory is printed as i expect it to be

722029
hide	show
then if rad3 is clicked menu2 hide and img3 show up but rad3 is still selected

722030
gridview	repeater
before you say it i m perfectly aware that a data repeater could do it but i m looking for the solution using a gridview

722056
hide	show
this becomes pretty easy if you use jquery s built-in methods such as show or hide

722079
vsts	tfs
since i do have vsts 2008 installed with the tfs client of course i find it odd that ssms express doesn t include support for it especially with the 2008 version

722100
integer	unsigned
operand with unsigned integer type

722100
integer	unsigned
then the operand with unsigned integer

722100
integer	unsigned
to the unsigned integer type

722118
versioning	upgrade
you need to update to the newest mvcfutures when you upgrade to the released versioning

722131
firefox	safari
firefox does not load external dtds nor does safari

722147
ant	maven
then use ant or maven to script the creation of separate ear files for customer a and b using the different properties files

722228
lisp	smalltalk
that s where smalltalk got it from possibly - since lisp had images already before smalltalk existed

722261
aptana	radrails
you might find that radrails aptana is an excellent choice - note make sure you look at the features and comparisons tab as radrails has many compelling features

722284
spaces	delimiter
what this does is first split the string using a spaces as a delimiter

3dsmax	blender	maya	3dsmax	maya	blender
most of the engines to my knowledge have the ability to import models that have been made in other software like maya 3dsmax blender etc but i think the importing of textures may leave a little to be desired i could be wrong and looking at some of the demos people are making magic happen

i agree with doing this outside of the database that way other applications with different length restrictions can make their own decisions on what to show hide

722578
pull	push
your shared scripts can be handled as another independent branch in your main directory which your external partners can pull from and push to as a remote branch

722656
config	ini
his solution for the client command-line is good but the ini files don t always do the trick depending on config

722671
post	get
the solution is a pattern commonly known as post redirect get

722685
inherited	properties
to answer your other comment also this seems to have an effect on the text alignment of enclosed elements which requires tweaking to fix. that s the nature of how css works setting a properties on an element affects all of its children unless the properties is overridden by one of them assuming the properties is one that is inherited of course

722725

free	malloc
malloc and free are similar to new and delete malloc allocates new memory and returns a pointer to that memory

722993
free	malloc
free makes that memory available again so long as it s memory that was allocated using malloc

722993
free	malloc
the important thing with malloc free is to decide on and consistently maintain a disciplined use

722993
free	malloc
try to malloc and free a chunk of memory within the same scope if possible

722993
free	malloc
when you can t make it clear that what you re returning is malloc ed memory so the caller can free it

firefox	safari
however my simple solution turned out to not be so simple because the table also contains a tag which is not being displayed in firefox safari works

723433
post	get
mvc will require you have a better knowledge of the basic tenants of web development get post request html css javascript the result will be much better

723472
put	get
i also need to put a value in there to begin with since the date is loaded from a db once i get this code working that is

723472
google-chrome	firefox
i also tried google-chrome firefox and ie7 same behaviour.

723494
map	quadtree
more optimal then using a grid as your spatial data structure might be a quadtree because it logarithmically breaks down the map

723549
mockups	balsamiq
interface design can also happen in parallel and here too you should use mockups either on paper or using some tools balsamiq mockups is my favorite

723579
error-handling	exception-handling
the lack of implicit memory resource and error management garbage collection raii automatically-called constructors destructors maybe exception-handling force c users to write a lot of initialization error-handling and cleanup code

723579
free	malloc
you can only write so many malloc free pairs before you start to analyze the lifetime of every single variable you come across in every single language

723592
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
you can try it with this document admittedly not pure html but that document works in desktop safari and google-chrome and firefox 3

723696
post	get
finally once we get this working mid may i will post video if able too and show you all

723714
inherited	subclassing
since with private inherited you don t have is-a no one will be able to use a baseclas pointer to a derived subclassing and you won t get the slicing problem when passinfg by value

723720
inherited	base-class
inherited privately instead of publicly as above and add wrapper functions into the derived class that call the implementations of the base-class

723742
put	get
and i had tried to open up two connections one for each server and using get and put to move it from server to server

723802
hide	show
because of this most people immediately understood that they could move between tabs we used javascript to hide and show the divs and a save would save changes to all of them

723903
lxml	elementtree
you can do this with elementtree which is included in the standard library or with lxml

723948
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
then you use objectoutputstream and objectinputstream to write object

724010
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
what you want is to use the objectoutputstream and objectinputstream classes

724010
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectoutputstream has a method writeobject and the objectinputstream has a corresponding readobject method

724021
put	get

gcov	lcov
use gcov to create an executable that generates profiling output and then use lcov to generate nice html output for your code

724130
icmp	tcp
note that if your program is running with insufficient privs to do icmp ping then java will resort to using a tcp echo request to port 7 which will still suit your needs

724133
prepare	execute
many programmers tend to like the prepare statement approach as it allows them complete control over the query that is being execute while dbas like the stored procedure approach for the same reason

724163
int	double
and let s suppose the method in either variant takes an int and a double and returns an int

724220
udp	tcp
these are two classes i made to somewhat abstract the work needed for tcp and udp socket protocols

724287
draggable	droppable
one of the most used plugins is that which relates to improving the user interface is called ui and includes draggable and droppable as functionality

int	chars
you don t really have an int a float and a chars in that union - at the physical level you ve just got 32 bits which could be viewed as an int a float or a chars

724309
vb.net	vb6
what you can do in the mean time is wrap the function in vb.net and use c# to call the vb.net method which calls the vb6 method

724313
int	chars
the int float and chars all occupy the same place in the union they are not consecutive so if you need to store them all it s a structure you re looking for not a union

724321
free	malloc
don t settle for the standard malloc free

724321
free	malloc

you are saying take a piece of memory big enough for the biggest among an int a chars and a double and lets call it myabc

724327
int	double	int	chars
in that memory now you can store either an int or a double or a chars

724327
int	double
if you store an int and then store a double the int is gone forever

boost	allocator
my aim is to change allocator of data with some different allocator like boost.inter process allocator or boost.pool allocator boost ublas matrix and vector classes takes allocator as a template parameter .and give only a single class and factory method to create appropriate allocator under cover.a virtual base class could be sweet but i couldn t handle how to use it with templates.what kind of design patterns or solutions do you offer

727264
switching	screens
sprite sheets are great because the fewer textures that the gpu has to switching between when drawing to the screens the better performance

727283
webkit	gecko
it seems to me that with so many open source layout and javascript renderers released like webkit gecko and chromium + v8 that someone must have made a tool for downloading a page and rendering its javascript without having to run an actual browser

727313
x86	64bit
a service that calls a 32-bit dll is required to have a platform target of x86 to run on a 64bit os

you need to incapsulate your pem to pkcs#12 format use openssl and then add pkcs#12 container to ws configuration

727426
onclick	onfocus
you are using onclick - while that may work i think what you want is onfocus

727435
gridex	janus
it depends whether the button is internal to janus gridex or not

727452
put	get
one way i can think of doing this is to get notification of the call immedialety end it wipe it from the log put up your pbx or cell dialog and then place the call again in the way the user requested

727460
int	boolean
as long as you provide an automatic conversion from int to boolean it will be arbitrary so it really doesn t matter which numbers you choose

727489
nlb	iis
using client affinity in the nlb configuration allowing the postback to go back to the iis where the process was generated the price was to loose all the nlb.

727502

consider a numeric class - you can perform multiplication division addition subtraction etc

727636
fadein	hide
the easiest way to do this is to append all the images into your document hide them and then fadein them one by one and hide them

727758
post	get
this post at php.net gives you sample code to get that information and the rest of the page is a treasure trove of php configuration options

727782
webkit	gecko
it is possible to use an embedded not-displayed webkit or gecko engine for this then after a suitable loading delay to allow for script execution just dump the dom contents in html form

727854
awt	swing
swing was an extension because awt was the original ui api

727934

i then rehashed the code to put the items into a dictionary object against the session id and i get those smae errors

728093
postgresql	mysql
postgresql compared to mysql is as any other pair of dbmss compared

728093
postgresql	mysql
as someone who was once in exactly the same position my guess is that you ll quickly pick up postgresql and might even hesitate to return to mysql

728098
spweb	spsite
the main thing to realize is that this delegate runs under a separate application domain which basically means that you want to use a spsite or spweb you must re-instantiate them within the delegate as shown below

728116
hash	salt
the basic idea is that the page making the ajax request should generate server side a unique token which is typically a hash of unix timestamp + salt + secret

728120
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
observablecollection implements both inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged

728120
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
if you want to implement your own observablecollection -like collection class it seems the proper way to implement both inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged

728193
post	get
but if i go through the intermediary form on uni s site that does a post i don t get that message

728207
pop-up	dialog
one could use a modal dialog for a login form edit form etc where you want to have a pop-up for user interaction but not allow the user to return to the window that opened the pop-up

728211
actionscript	mxml
then reference those either via binding in mxml or through simple assignment in actionscript

728426
sorting	grouping
i d make the recordsource a regular select statement and use the report s sorting grouping

728426
filtering	grouping
certainly if your select with grouping by has no where clause it s going to be a lot more efficient if you run the report with filtering values

728466
width	height
edit it seems likely that your width and height are off by a little bit

728498
rss	feed
using the rss feed output of a list i was able to get the custom fields of the list into flash as xml

728508
jruby	mri
is there a particular type of java functionality that people are using jruby for or is it mainly because of the performance advantage that jruby gives versus the mri

728565
mouseleave	mouseenter
instead of hover you can use the mouseenter and mouseleave events which do not fire when child elements get in the way

728574
public	protected
the closest is declaring objects with package scope which is done by omitting a public protected or private

728595
rss	feed
if you find that crawling the internet becomes to dawnting a task you may want to consider building an rss aggregator and subscribing to rss feed for popular event sites like craigslist and upcoming.org

728595
rss	feed
there are opensource libraries like rome java that may help with the consumption of rss feed

728623
onclick	onchange
you might have to use a combination of onchange and onclick to get the behavior you re looking for

728631

at my workplace we ve been writing applications for windows ce 5.0 using c++ and atl wtl

728716
width	height
unfortunately using nsstring -stringwithfont forwidth linebreakmode doesn t work - which ever wrap mode you choose the text wraps with a width that is less than the current width and the height becomes 0 on any overflow lines

728752
textarea	textbox
instead of a what it should look like any suggestions on how i can make the textarea normal asp.net textbox with the mode set to multiline display the html as it should look and not the code

728765
post	get
i ve seen blog post describing this but cannot seem to get it to work

728783
implements	sealed
string class is sealed so you can t inherit from it hence you cant implements an interface on top of it

728800
textarea	textbox
you can not display html result in textarea textbox control

728808
post	get
it s probably worth a full blog post but this should help you get started it s caching lookups in session variables just as a sample of how you could improve performance since a full cache sample would be too long

728847
integer	unsigned
however i m a little confused shouldn t there be an arithmetic overflow when subtracting a larger unsigned integer from the other

728867
jmenubar	jmenuitem	jmenubar	jpopupmenu	jpopupmenu	jmenuitem
i can only add jmenu and jmenuitem to a jmenubar jpopupmenu and other jmenus and jmenuitem

728871

basically this parameter should be able to contain the sorts of things you d find in json a few primitives strings int boolean null or lists of zero or more items or maps of zero or more items

728895
free	malloc
edited i looking for some open source in c or is there some api like malloc and free

728903
unsigned	short
if it is smaller than int say short int then the operands are converted to int and you get -4000 but on a 16-bit system uint16_t could be unsigned int and conversion to a signed type would not happen automatically

729016
vim	emacs
the coding form is recognized out of the box by gnu emacs but not vim yes without a universal agreement it s essentially a turf war

729043
equals	gethashcode
you need to override equals and gethashcode in your class mytype

729056
width	height
so if the image is an image of width 100 height 50 you ll traverse from a to b in 100 steps and from a to c in 50 steps drawing 50 lines of 100 pixels in the area formed by abc in their rotated state

729062
equals	gethashcode
the easiest thing to do is to override equals always update gethashcode to match the logic in equals

729083
mouseover	mouseleave
i have a couple of divs with a class of .box_panel and i have it so that they on mouseover they go from 50 opacity and back to 100 opacity on mouseleave

729083
mouseover	mouseleave
the code i m using for the mouseover mouseleave effects is

729108
free	realloc
there s no need to free realloc at all

729110
keydown	keyup
yes many controls have keyup keydown propertys

729133
swt	swing
you might also consider using java with swt or even swing instead of c# but that will probably not be an option you re willing to consider

729166
keydown	keyup
it seems that what you need to do is to handle the textinput event rather than the keyup keydown events

729183
daemons	launchd
if you believe you installed it but it isn t working you may find that your sql server full-text daemons launchd service is disabled

729183
daemons	launchd
find the sql server full-text daemons launchd entry right click and select properties then enable it and start the service

729193
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome they line up fine next to each other but in ie the select box sits higher than the text box

729203
implements	extends
when implements the userdetailsmanager interface you have to implements five methods of its own and one which it inherits from the userdetailsservice which it extends

729220
postgresql	mysql
i do not know of any database that supports this sql server mysql oracle postgresql

729237
put	get
basically you use a regex pattern to get convert the functions into compatible strings and put themin a private member

729256
uilabel	uitextview
i use sizetofit with uilabel and it works just fine but uitextview is a subclass of uiscrollview so i can understand why sizetofit doesn t produce the desired result

729264
nfa	dfa
though the ecma standard does not specify the algorithm an ecmascript implementation should use the fact that the standard mandates that ecmascript regular expressions must support backreferences 1 2 etc. rules out the dfa and thompson nfa implementations

729393
queue	fifo
begininvoke on a winform control to make a call across threads will use the window s message queue which is fifo

729405
mouse	keyboard
i want to map a keyboard key press onto left mouse-button double-click and am looking for very simple tools or control panel extensions to do that and map key presses onto single mouse clicks too.

729437
try-catch	exception-handling
one reason which is important to me is that when i read a try-catch control structure in a software i maintain or debug i try to find out why the original coder used an exception-handling handling instead of an if-else structure

729518
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
enhanced for each loops the for-loop syntax is extended with special syntax for iterating over each member of either an arrays or any iterable such as the standard collection classes specified by jsr 201.

729518
versioning	upgrade
upgrade of jaxb to versioning 2.0 including integration of a stax parser

729518
sorting	filtering
many gui improvements such as integration of swingworker in the api table sorting and filtering and true swing double-buffering eliminating the gray-area effect

729533
min	max
any min max solution on c may not give you null as i think you want

729611
hash	md5
better use an unique hash md5 mt_rand

729618
cassini	iis
on iis not all calls will be processed by the asp.net handler unlike cassini the development server unless the call ends in .aspx .ashx etc

729677
dictionary	map
aside i had originally assumed that the dictionary stored a map from each case to the an index into another map for the return values

729775
ienumerable	ilist
think ilist inheriting from ienumerable

729791
inherited	properties
interface inherited increases the number of methods and properties for each level of inherited

729792
qtcpsocket	qnetworkaccessmanager
subclass qnetworkaccessmanager and integrate the subclassed qtcpsocket somehow this might involve subclassing even more classes the qhttp ones

729865
google-chrome	firefox
i have developed the code and it works fine in firefox 3 and google-chrome however it just doesn t work for internet explorer 7 8

729905
addition	multiplication
the user will give some input values for a and b and will choose what operation to perform letâ s say that he can choose to compute addition or multiplication

729905
addition	multiplication
the methods that compute multiplication or addition will be implemented somewhere no idea where

729921
setinterval	settimeout
is there any difference between using settimeout and setinterval

729942
for-loop	loops
though in performance critical parts of your application you should benchmark these functions versus the trivial for-loop because often loops are still faster

729943
setinterval	settimeout
they essentially try to do the same thing but the setinterval approach will be more accurate than the settimeout approach since settimeout waits 1000ms runs the function and then sets another timeout

729951
setinterval	settimeout
apparently the difference is settimeout calls the method once setinterval calls it repeatdly

729951
setinterval	settimeout
here is a good article explaining the difference tutorial javascript timers with settimeout and setinterval

729990
getter	setter
there s been a getter and setter ticket open in the djangoproject for a couple years now but no luck

729990
getter	setter
put your model field at a different name say image_field and write a getter setter pair using python s property syntax called image in your object that queries that field

729990
getter	setter
this will work for casual use by your functions but any calls from within the framework itself will obviously ignore your getter setter

729999
folder	directory
i have the following function that loops through a directory and checks for a specified folder and file

730028
hide	show
when i click on the visible row for a table i want the rest of its rows contents to show hide

730032
min	max
i want to validate an asp.net texbox with min char 3 max 10 and no special characters

730058
post	get
you can t issue a post request using jsonp only get because gets the resource

730068
min	max
be strict with specifying dimensions when using aggregation functions like min max mean diff sum any all .

730072
bids	ssis
alternatively if you built your ssis package in bids you can go to the menu choose file save copy of packagename.dtsx as ... choose sql server as the destination and fill in the server name

730129
folder	directory
what you can do is in the sharpbits.base folder that you download from codeplex there is a dll you can reference in the bin directory

730155
width	height
if changes in one editor need to be reflected immediately in another currently visible part of the app you could fake it by using a rectangle say where the fill was a visualbrush referencing the active editor and the rectangle s width and height were bound to the editor s actual width and height

730173
integer	unsigned
you can also get the first two bytes as a 16 bit unsigned number and assign it to an integer

730187
yacc	bison
since you said in a comment that you aren t using flex and bison which versions of lex and yacc are you using

730201
getter	setter
that leads me to believe i should create a getter setter for each piece of data

730201
getter	setter
unfortunately the getter setter pattern doesn t force the user to enter the data and without it characterization of the object is incomplete and therefore useless

730213
accessor	properties
if you need the validator only if the control is loaded with some data then you add it right after the data has been loaded be that onload or some properties accessor

730217
getter	setter
create a builder class which contains all of those getter and setter with a build method that returns an object of the class that you re really trying to construct

730235
many-to-many	one-to-many
note that if you re using many-to-many fields rather than a one-to-many there s built-in support for creating custom intermediary tables to hold meta data with the through option

730236
getter	setter
this will let you use getter setter without worrying that the characterization is incomplete

730259
x86	64bit
and if i had vista 64bit it d probably be under program files x86

730273
rss	feed
i m parsing an rss feed which has the time and date as utc i need to convert this into a unix timestamp

730337
min	max
i want to validate a texbox with min char 5 max 20 allow alphabet and numbers and only 3 special characters

730367
setinterval	settimeout
both setinterval and settimeout return a timer id that you can use to cancel the execution that is before the timeouts are triggered

730395
next	except
this is fine except i also need to display the number of minutes and seconds until the next refresh

730396
asterisk	freeswitch
my first idea is to use asterisk opensips or freeswitch for the server and sip communicator minisip or linphone as softphone clients

730435
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the fact that i cannot find other mentions of this behaviour causes me some worry that i am doing something wrong - but my sites all work in firefox google-chrome safari across windows and mac and previously worked well enough in ie7

730505
ienumerable	icollection
the class currently implements ienumerable idisposable icollection and iserializable

730579
innodb	myisam
i am fairly inexperienced with the innodb engine and never experienced this issue with myisam

730599
webkit	gecko
all desktop agents use a specific rendering engine that is already built into web browsers thunderbird uses gecko earlier versions of outlook use internet explorer mail.app uses webkit etc which makes them virtually indistinguishable from the browser itself

730678
cvs	svn
if you use svn though you can also use cvs checkouts of drupal and other modules themes and the svn cvs metadata will be able to live beside each other happily

730678
folder	directory
for bulky folder like the files directory use a symlink in the proper location to point to a server-side directory outside of the webroot

730685
fitnesse	dbfit
there is a great tool built on top of fitnesse called dbfit which seems to take all the pain out of unit testing the dblayer

730813
division	modulo
of course modulo calculation isn t done like that it s done with division and a remainder

730813
put	get
in the library sense when you get to the shelf and the slot number you wish to put a book in there s already a book there

730832
cassini	iis
note the code runs differently depending upon whether you are running it under iis or cassini -- under iis the initial identity is the anonymous user

730857
equals	gethashcode
when testing for value equality is desired such as when using objects in collections you should implement the iequatable interface override equals and gethashcode for your class

730857
equals	gethashcode
if you implement iequatable you should also override the base class implementations of equals object and gethashcode so that their behavior is consistent with that of the iequatable.equals method

730870
post	get
the trick won t work very well if the chromeless window url is the result of a post or does a get that modifies state in some way on the server

730913
free	malloc
note i have also tested with new delete replacing malloc free without success either

730913
boost	allocator
if using boost it will automatically clean the allocator upon the end of the function so i won t get a public array with boost right

730915
apache	lighttpd
just get apache php and apc or use lighttpd with xcache

730936
fgets	feof
the same is true in c with fgets feof et al

730938
free	malloc
if you write programs on c++ - use new delete instead malloc free

730950
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this works wonderfully in safari firefox and opera

730959
portrait	landscape
in my case i am using didrotatefrominterfaceorientation to check if the last orientation was portrait and if so load the view i want displayed in landscape mode

730971
free	malloc
there is no memory leak there but you should use new delete instead of malloc free

730989
post	put
i noticed that you rahkim commented on greg s post that you wish you could put his idea keeping the saturation and value constant and just varying the hue...a good idea into code

731003
google-chrome	safari
it s so very much not like a web widget set that i actually ported it to the desktop - - using webkit the same engine in adobe air google-chrome safari etc.

731020
imperative	declarative
what i want to do is to create a declarative and imperative binding so i can write

731049
hide	show
while i realize that i could just show the form off-screen and hide it along with many other forms of winforms hackish wizardry i d rather stick with the zen path and get this done right

731100
filtering	grouping
you may well want to grouping assemblies which implement similar functionality - colour contrast together while keeping them separate from very different kinds of filtering edge enhancing

731117
post	get
the certificate is a required part of authentication otherwise i get the error mentioned in this other similar so post

731205
codeigniter	cakephp
if you want to stay in the php world check out some of the common frameworks such as cakephp codeigniter or symfony

731205
postgresql	mysql
for example try picking up postgresql to have as an alternative to mysql and python django as an alternative to php

731233
activemq	rabbitmq
we d be interested to hear any experiences with the pros and cons of activemq vs rabbitmq vs zeromq

731251
fink	macports
launch is in fink and macports too

731263
webclient	httpwebrequest
i m looking to understand when to use a wcf services instead of just using webclient or httpwebrequest

731269
post	get
on post back and on initial request for that matter controlparemeter s view state is evaluated only to see if it changed so that the onparameterchanged event could get fired

731289
webclient	httpwebrequest
i m currently using wcf for most of the things that i would use webclient or httpwebrequest httpwebresponse in the past

731301
inherited	subclassing
inherited and implement the abstract method calculate in each subclassing here you ll see that both methods are the same but let s continue

731336
inherited	properties
i think that the common properties are inherited from the parent container so if you change the font size and style in the parent form it will change the default to the new child controls

731451
cassini	iis
are you using visual studio and cassini locally and iis remotely

731491
int	chars
int values are easier for sql server to deal with then chars values

731546
firefox	safari
it is coming out as desired in firefox and ie but oddly enough safari is acting up

731546
firefox	safari
now it looks fine on safari on my macbook but not on safari on my pc or in firefox for that matter

731587
getter	setter
this assumes that your bean has getter and setter for a city property which you have already implemented

731589
equals	gethashcode
i ve overridden equals and gethashcode in an abstract base class to implement value equality based on an object s key property

731611
google-chrome	safari
i haven t got safari so i cannot test although i m using google-chrome but the problem is probably coming from the

731613
equals	gethashcode
so there is no need to override equals and gethashcode because this is the same identity you want to implement

731625
setinterval	settimeout
for example if we represent a call to settimeout setinterval with

731625
setinterval	settimeout
in terms of browser compatibility settimeout predates setinterval but all browsers you will meet today support both

731626
ienumerable	ilist
observablecollection doesn t have a constructor that will take an ilist or ienumerable as a parameter so i can t simple new one up

731632
post	get
according to this usenet post you only get redirection if you have a console

731652
django	turbogears
this is easy to do in python -- use django or turbogears or any python-based web framework

731657
hide	show
note that i know audiences can also be used to hide show web parts but that is not something i am interested in

731673
serializable	deserialization
or another way to put it data mapping binding is not quite the same as object serializable deserialization latter tries to preserve more of object identity

731693
activemq	rabbitmq
testing of activemq rabbitmq etc

731695
hash	md5
with server 2000 domains there s an option for store passwords in reversible format - that will allow a domain controller to calculate md5 hash of the password to compare against your presented md5 hash

731695
hash	md5
ldap signon should select md5 digest as the authentication type supply the username and then supply the md5 hash of the password

731747
children	parent
a better solution would be for all of your grandparents parent and children all be the same class with two extra methods- hasparent boolean and haschild boolean

731844
mouseover	mouseout
the code basically sets alternating table rows to have a different css class and adds a mouseover and mouseout event change to a third css class highlighting the row under the mouse

731857
integer	unsigned
interpreted as unsigned integer it is +4 but we have to interpret it as signed integer -4

731862
subtract	add
add one to the magnitude of all even numbers subtract one from the magnitude of all odd numbers

min	max
there are some cases where this won t work -1 max or min int but it works a lot better than anything else suggested so far

731864
floating-point	integer
for instance numbers should be stored using integer or floating-point types not strings because you can do math with numeric types but not with strings although it s easy enough to parse a number into a string that this is not a big deal

731871
mouseover	mouseout
2 attaches a mouseover and mouseout event to the row so the row changes background color when the user mouses over it

731879
mouseover	mouseout
mouseout row - the reverse of mouseover restores the old class name and background colour

731974
gridview	sqldatasource
if i bind gridview to sqldatasource and also set autogenerateeditbutton to true and if i then try to update a field this field being a primary key in database then database should return an error and thus sqlexception should be thrown

731989
int	boolean
that means i want proper int boolean and nulls and i don t want extra object wrappers or something that tries to capture the entire xml infoset

731993
stackless	multiprocess
people told me to use the multiprocess package i checked it out and it looks good but i also heard that processes unlike threads can t share a lot of information and i think my program will need to share a lot of information. additionally i also heard about stackless python is it a separate option

732001
gif	png
this microsoft article has some information about gif files that should be relevant to png also

732116
put	get
a server is another architecture where multiple client processes get and or put information into a central server

732126
hide	show
you best bet is probably to create a custom control by inheriting from the gridview class adding the required columns and exposing a meaningful property to show hide a particular column

732132
rowdatabound	datalist
i prefer to do all my rowbinding type methods in code behind as opposed to inline so i then consume the rowdatabound event of my datalist and simply bind the url property accordingly

732164
post	get
if the adminuserposts and ordinaryuserposts are written to the table post and the type column is correct you should get the subclass behavior you expect

732216
profiling	debugging
it sounds like you are looking more-so for debugging or profiling tools such as gdb and its various front-ends xgdb ddd and and gprof

732216

cyberduck	winscp
then you ll be able to connect with any client that supports sftp cyberduck on mac winscp on windows

732434
client-side	server-side
from your comment on craig s mention of jqgrid you re either going to want to go with jqgrid flexigrid or another client-side alternative and wire it up server-side yourself or you will be better off with a non-jquery based commercial ajax grid component

732451
3-tier	n-tier
i don t agree with you that entity objects make the code harder to maintain actually the whole purpose of this architecture is to make it to easier to maintain and modify your code and this is what i see in practice i wrote spaghetti code for a long time didn t use 3-tier or n-tier architectures so i know what i m talking about

732466
disk	ram
if that is the case get a faster disk but first check that you re getting the most out of your existing one...some linux distributions don t optimize disk access out of the box hdparm stage the data into memory say by copying it to a ram disk ahead of time or be prepared to wait

732475
webkit	gecko
you can also write your client using c c++ with an embedded browser like gecko or webkit within it

732494
disk	ram
you might try minimizing the amount of time you spend reading from the disk by reading large amounts of data into ram then working on that

732494
disk	ram
sorta like the way cpu cache minimizes the time the cpu actually goes back to ram you could use ram to minimize the number of times you actually go to disk

732528
postgresql	mysql
for a db mysql is the sexy pick but postgresql is superior

732528
innodb	myisam
with mysql some features you want are in innodb and some are in myisam

732528
postgresql	mysql
postgresql performance has greatly imnproved with the version 8 release same as mysql now and has a nice windows installer finally

732540
joystick	keyboard
if you want to go for polling the joystick just because you are not able to capture the keyboard event i think you need to re-work your strategy

732542
comparator	comparable
look into the comparator and comparable interfaces

732542
comparator	comparable
your sort method should take comparator or you should specify t extends comparable so that the comparable interface can be used

732554
mouse	keyboard
use something like ahk auto hotkey it is a simple language that can be compiled to an exe and is designed for automating the keyboard and mouse

732559
joystick	wii	joystick	keyboard	mouse	keyboard	mouse	joystick
use something like ahk auto hotkey it is a simple language that can be compiled to an exe and is designed for automating the keyboard and mouse i m not 100 sure how well it works with a joystick but i m sure it s possible they managed to write some stuff for the wii remotes

732560
merb	ruby-on-rails
i am learning ruby-on-rails and have very little idea about sinatra merb

732574
turbogears	web2py	pylons	turbogears	pylons	web2py	web.py	pylons	web.py	turbogears	web.py	web2py
pylons and turbogears offer enormous flexibility and focus on best of breed components web2py appears to have a very cool dal orm that i m itching to dig into and web.py and werkzeug amongst others are minimalistic and don t try to dictate how you should build your app

732591
prepare	execute
now when you execute you will insert the number into the space reserved for your prepare statement

732595
merb	ruby-on-rails
merb is being merged into ruby-on-rails so pretty soon there shouldn t really be any reason to use one over the other

732602
g++	gcc
gcc v4.3 vs g++ v4.3 reduced to simplest case used nothing but simple flags

732608
g++	gcc
the g++ compiler must be doing something different from the gcc compiler

732609
profiling	instrumentation
instead i want to track allocations so i can start tracking down the issue and on a mac i d use instrumentation which gives a detailed profiling of what objects have been allocated and by whom but on windows what would i use

732617
free	malloc
i want to make my own malloc free so i can make a precise copying allocator

732620
int	double
off hand i thought that double could represent all int within their bounds exactly

732632
g++	gcc
when compiled with gcc and g++ the only difference i see is within the first 4 lines

732640
prepare	execute
the speedup comes when you prepare a statement once and then execute it many times

732701
getter	setter
if i extend it do i then also have to make sure to overwrite the actual delegate getter setter

732708
rar	zip
zip rar have overhead to store things like filenames

732722
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
it doesn t have things like getelementsbytagname or getelementbyid but if you know xpath you can still do that kind of thing with simplexml

732725
mp3	wav
so on your wav mp3 file you are at best going to be able to hear up tp 22 khz frequencies

732725
mp3	ogg
formats like mp3 and ogg are have to be decompressed before you can work with them

732749
gif	png	tiff	png
bitmap gif png and tiff are some of the common image types supported

732803

a sample can be represented as an int number usually 8 12 16 24 or 32 bits or a floating point number 16 bit float or 32 bit double

732837
mvp	presenter
of what i know of the mvp pattern the ui is simply that appearance and all the heavy lifting is done in the presenter

732863
hide	show
if you need to go the extra mile do as the other suggested and hide disable the link also in the tag and use jquery to show enable it

732870
inherited	subclassing	implements	extends
and then you have a subclassing b which extends a b cannot implements because b already implements inherited from a and a class cannot implements an interface twice

732935
equals	gethashcode
if you override equals you must override gethashcode as well

732995
maven	cobertura
in our project we run both junits and cobertura using maven

733017
firefox	safari
some of the most end-user visible innovation has come from a new browser war examples would be html5 several vendors canvas apple xmlhttprequest microsoft s outlook web access team input range safari s built-in rss reader and the video element firefox --these came from the proprietary level on up not from the standards tower on down

733075
profiler	gprof
it might interest you to know that an execution profiler like gprof does exactly what you re asking about - it tracks the amount of time spent executing each function

733102
keydown	keyup
this is easy enough by handling the keyup or keydown event however how does one determine if it is toggled on or off even if a key hasn t been pressed

733170
g++	gcc
i also do not want to install cygwin for g++ gcc

733188
hash	md5
if you use an md5 hash of the image data as the file name for example you can prevent people from uploading duplicate images and you also don t have to think of a way to generate unique names for the images

733241
preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder	postorder	inorder
what you need is a basic tree traversal function preorder inorder or postorder -- this doesn t matter and a filter function

733277
listview	gridview
how to create a gridview like view to the wpf listview if i dont know the column names at the design time because the collection will be created at runtime and the collection will be of type datatable and it may contain a no.of columns.i can do it with wpf datagrid but i want to achieve this with wpf listview and i want to achieve this without code behind

733306
lisp	scheme
it depends on what you mean by scripting language. it isn t commonly viewed that way but many scheme implementations seem to fit the bill as well as python and lisp is sort of the archetypal functional language

733310
implements	extends
your application must then implements a class that extends the midlet class

733317
button	checkbox
as it is stated there glui is a glut-based c++ user interface library which provides controls such as button checkbox radio button and spinners to opengl applications

i had a problem on the server side and after analizing the output with firebug i noticed that the request turns out to be a get instead of a post

733359
post	get
note from the documentation the method type is in uppercase get post

733419
opera	safari
check the site quickly in safari and opera to make sure design has no flaws there

733474
int	double
a c++ version probably bending the rules somewhat but works for all numeric types floats int double and even class types that overload the unary minus

733616
ssl	https
ssl https will encrypt this request for you to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks

733673
merb	ruby-on-rails
as mentioned already merb 2.0 and ruby-on-rails 3.0 are going to be the same thing

733673
merb	ruby-on-rails
the newly-combined merb and ruby-on-rails core teams are already at work on achieving that

733673
merb	ruby-on-rails
if you re dead set on using an orm other than activerecord for example you might start with merb now and update when 2.0 ruby-on-rails 3.0 ships

733673
merb	ruby-on-rails
right now merb is generally accepted to provide a better framework for varying one s components than ruby-on-rails

733673
merb	ruby-on-rails
sinatra looks like a brilliant solution for a web app that has low interface complexity and somewhat lower model-level code than would be normal for merb ruby-on-rails

733673
merb	ruby-on-rails
again with ruby-on-rails and hence merb soon now sitting on top of rack there s no reason not to include baby sinatra apps into the solution they can live together

733686
portrait	landscape
the thing i want is the first view will always be portrait no matter how u rotate the phone especially when back from second view and it was in landscape

733715
profiler	aqtime
you ll need to narrow it down by using a profiler such as jetbrain s dottrace or automated qa s aqtime

733725
width	height
i ended up using clearfix this allows me to set the desired width of the container and it s height will be adjusted automatically depending on the contents this works in all browsers

733754
inline	inlining
in the cases where the function call is unambiguous and the function a suitable candidate for inlining the compiler is smart enough to inline the code anyway

733757
wan	lan
your questions helped me to get around the problem when i change from lan to wan

733761
min	max
this assumes acthec is the same for all tasknames otherwise you ll need to pick a rule such as min or max

733777
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql is often sufficient

733787
inherited	properties
so if possible i would need a way to define that everything that inherited from entity will have the id properties and that this will work with the linq to sql datacontext without cheating

733788
globalization	localization
easy localization and globalization with the .net framework

733794
unix	bsd	unix	solaris	solaris	bsd
my case in particular is with solaris servers but generic unix bsd tools are more than welcome

733828
gridview	linqdatasource
i have a gridview with linqdatasource

733886
srp	principles
following srp and kiss principles i designed an object with properties only but i need methods to work with the objects

733921
int	boolean
at once into c arrays especially for the int and boolean

733925
free	malloc
to reset the state of the heap you have to call free for every malloc call

733936
gridview	detailsview
you may want to look at gridview detailsview repeaters etc

733968
pop-up	dialog
button on the .net framework components tab in the dialog that pop-up might take a few seconds for it to show

733972
postgresql	mysql
if you want a fast free alternative to ms sql then postgresql may be a good choice - it is fast reliable and has a more open licence if you use mysql for a commercial project you ll want to read its dual licence very carefully

733972
postgresql	mysql
the only downside to postgresql is that it shares some of the same dba guru requirements as oracle where as ms sql can often be managed by a regular it person and mysql doesn t need much management besides restoring the old backups everytime it decides to become corrupted and lose your data

733995
x86	64bit
the application did work on the 64bit platform we just needed to specify x86 for the cpu which sort of defeats the purpose

734018
folder	directory
this can happen if you use import existing projects into workspace that are folder in the file system without the copy into workspace checkbox checked or if you create a project using an existing directory

734049
width	height
_pub.html img width this.width height this.height constrain true can_resize false

734071
hid	keyboard
this should show you the list of things you can get out in of a keyboard through hid

734088
passenger	thin
at the minimum you should consider using the rack middleware to make life easier for you - connect your app to rack and use rack to host the site through passenger thin mongrel etc

734147
uiview	uiwindow	uiapplication	uiwindow
am i right with my understanding that an uiapplication object uiwindow object uiview object or any uiview subclass is an responder object

734147
uiview	uiwindow
uiwindow uiview and all uiview

734149
dpkg	apt
if you want an apt interface onto open source projects look at fink a dpkg system for mac os x with various open source packages

734207
ubuntu	debian
it is only available on some linux-based platforms like debian and ubuntu

734207
fink	macports
mac os x has two similar utilities fink and macports

734243
versioning	upgrade
general rule seems to be that a new versioning is an upgrade and is thus worthwhile

734243
versioning	upgrade
upgrading compiler versioning could well be a project in its own right make sure you have stable code and good tests before you do an upgrade and when you finish prove that it is still working the same

734256
folder	directory
i have several branches in my svn sometimes it is very small branch and it is nice to have it in the same directory but sometimes these branches grow big and it is nice to move the whole thing to another folder

734266
getdate	datepart
print right datepart year getdate 2 --string with leading zero

734266
getdate	datepart
print convert int right datepart year getdate 2 --int

734266
getdate	datepart
print datepart year getdate 100

734405
unix	aix
once at a unix shop aix iirc developers would work via nfs mount and checkin checkout via rcs.

734455
accessor	properties
i have a class called inparams with two fields a string and a long and their corresponding properties accessor to the fields

734476
fgets	fgetc
get the data with fgetc or fgetc_unlocked instead of fgets

734482
prng	random
so let s assume we have a prng that produces a random number between 0 and 31 and you want the smaller range to be 0 to 9

734500
prng	random
if prng is generating uniformly distributed random numbers then the above looks good

734501
prng	random
if you have access to a prng function say random that ll generate numbers in the range 0 x 1 can you not just do

734529
powerpc	i386
it may be better to simply compile with both -arch i386 -arch x86_64 which will allow the user to choose at runtime which one to run you can also include -arch powerpc -arch ppc64 if you want to support older powerpc macs

734559
typeerror	attributeerror
many times catching an attributeerror or typeerror is simpler and apparently faster

734621
post	get
this can be especially bad in an asp.net application where the input comes from post get

734638
imperative	declarative
declarative verbose and i find a imperative style much more succinct

734668
sorting	grouping
i m thinking that sorting either way may have no effect - a pebble landing at random on a wheel containing different sized by fitness slices will have exactly the same outcome chance whether the larger slices are grouping together or not

734741
gridview	linqdatasource
in an attempt to add additional search criteria i have tied in to the selecting event of the gridview s linqdatasource and am trying to add additional items to the whereparameters collection of the linqdatasourceselecteventargs

734780
accessor	properties
normally i use the public properties with some exceptions where i may want to avoid any extra code written in the properties accessor

734795
getter	setter
sometimes you will write getter setter that do important pre-processing for any realistic interaction with the field

734795
getter	setter
for example if a string field has a constraint that it must always be lowercase then at least one of your getter setter methods must make a call to .tolower or .tolowerinvariant and in your class code you probably want to use this to make sure that the constraint is enforced

734795
getter	setter
i think the bottom line is that it depends on what kind of logic you are using at any given point in the class and what kind of preprocessing exists in the getter setter

734795
getter	setter
if you are ever unsure or it seems like it doesn t matter it is probably better to use the getter setter public property so that you write more maintainable code that will follow constraints added later

734798
width	height
but an easy alternativ would be animate the height width

734805
rss	feed
i m wondering if there are any projects out there to create a standard for subscribing to notification of software updates in a way that can be easily aggregated rss feed

734824
gif	png
i ve changed some of the graphics from png to gif but it is just as likely to say it s waiting for somegraphicsfile.png as it is for somegraphicsfile.gif

734824
versioning	upgrade
when we upgrade to the latest versioning of jquery ui 1.7.1 and replaced the destroy s with disable s for the datepickers the problem went away or mostly went away - if you do things too fast while the page is loading it is still possible to get the n items remaining status

734898
agile	sprint
our contracts hasn t changed since we switch to agile the client still want to receive build at major milestone and is too far to be directly involved at each end of sprint

734903
translation	localization
as other s stated you will obviously have other localization issuse such as translation or date currency formats as well

734942
stdout	stderr
so if i don t manually clear the stdout and stderr buffers my code will hang

734943
width	height
record_id filename path width height

734947
put	get
start documenting the code reviews put in a wiki a company sanctioned wiki -- don t get into trouble now just document it for now -- it s not yet time to pass judgement you re just gathering data

734950
getter	setter
more generally using setter and getter insulates you from changes

734967
boost	stl
stl boost and others who have a lot of header files to include they provide you with independent tools and you can use them independently

734988
int	chars
for int chars etc it is 0 for arrays it is t

735170
pop-up	dialog
this dialog box pop-up and basically hangs the test run as it requires manual intervention

735174
filtering	grouping
you can t filtering it sort by it or grouping by it

735199
opera	firefox
actually the above code sometimes looks like it works in firefox never looks like it works in opera

735292
google-chrome	firefox
everything seems to work fine in ie7 but in firefox and google-chrome i am getting the strange behavior

735295
post	get
according to this post sleep isn t available on windows xp and you have to download the windows 2003 resource kit in order to get it

735304
pop-up	dialog
if you happen to have ms visual studio on your build machine it will catch application errors and pop-up a dialog box

735334
opera	firefox
works in ie 6 7 8 opera 9.6 firefox 2 3

735334
google-chrome	safari
does not work in safari for windows 3 4 or google-chrome

735396
boost	stl
using boost s bind and function are much better but it is impressive which can be done with just stl

735453
mouse	keyboard
i believe this gets around the problem with the exclusive lock which you would encounter for example when trying to open a handle to a device that windows considers a system keyboard or mouse

735469
spaces	delimiter
classes are spaces delimiter so if you want them hidden by default.

735493
glut	soil
i m trying to make a simple textured rectangular in opengl using soil and glut

735609
ocl	uml
some of the things i ve read about and are considering include z state machines uml 2.0 possibly with extensions such as ocl petri nets and some coding-level stuff like contracts and pre and post conditions

735625
uiview	subviews
you can animate any view root view or subviews just by changing supported properties within a uiview beginanimations commitanimations block

735647
unix	solaris
sorry didn t mention the code is cross-platform linux windows solaris and a few other unix flavors mostly using gcc for compilation

735664
fileoutputstream	filechannel
if you want to do that use a fileoutputstream get the filechannel and directly write the floatbuffer since it s a bytebuffer

735665
x86	64bit
edit for gcc-only code you can use __i386__ to check for 32-bit x86 chips and i suggest trying __x86_64__ or something similar to check for 64bit x86 chips

735665
x86	64bit
note it has come to my attention that the previous answer involving __ia86__ is actually a different chip not a 64bit x86 chip

735696
put	get
what you could do instead is have the 2009 and 2010 in a table and beside them put the names of the ranges then do a vlookup to get the range name

735708
internationalization	localization
the development of multilingual software currently goes through two phases the first phase is internationalization and the second phase is localization

735729
ocl	uml
some of the things i ve read about and are considering include z state machines uml 2.0 possibly with extensions such as ocl petri nets and some coding-level stuff like contracts and pre and post conditions

735758
post	get
you can send post or get data with that request and it will function just like if a form sent that information

735768
stdio	gets
if you have to work around this then you need to wrap your current socket opening code so that if it gets an file descriptor in the range 0..255 then it calls dup2 to create a file descriptor in the range that stdio won t use - and then close the original file descriptor

735806
client-side	server-side
i have a datamember that is a nullable enum type on the server-side however when i generate a client-side proxy the type in the proxy is non-nullable

735815
onclick	onsubmit
i ve seen reports of some odd bugs in ie7 where confirm didn t execute in an onclick or onsubmit event handler

735832
int	chars
if i have a chars or an int or a long and those sort of things should i use equals or is sufficient

735835
tabcontrol	tabitem
when the user click on the small button i remove the tabitem from the tabcontrol

735848
int	double	int	chars	int	boolean
even and especially if those objects are the primitive wrapper types byte chars short int long float double and boolean

735865
rss	feed
unfortunately it looks like itunes does not make this information available if it even uses rss feed to handle podcasts

735926
versioning	upgrade
the problem you will run into is that if you ever need to have an app use a different versioning of the dll all the others will have to upgrade or downgrade

735994
hash	md5
but even in this case a common hash function as sha1 or md5 will be of little use because modifying a single pixel or metadata such as the author will change the hash and make it impossible to identify the two images based on a common hash function

736005
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you may need to resize the view before adding it to the window and call viewwilldisappear viewdiddisappear viewwillappear and viewdidappear on currentview and the new view controller before and after they re removed added

736048
post	get
we then do our http get post and use a bsf assertion and javascript do complex validation of the response

736062
affinity	processors
the openmpi project has a library to set the processors affinity on linux in a portable way

cpu	processors
on these intel xeon processors two cores on each cpu share their l2 caches i do not remember whether the processors has an l3 cache

736123
hash	md5
what i do is put the md5 hash the mysql query and store that as the key for the memcached data

736161
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this is a bug in firefox and apparently safari 3.5 win and opera 9.5 win iframes reload if moved in the dom tree

736169
binutils	newlib
i used this blog of anthony green as a guideline where he describes porting of gcc newlib and binutils

736232
int	chars
you can hash int chars plain ascii full unicode bytes longwords etc etc

736263
put	get
put the two together and you should get what you asked for

736269
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
she uses touchesbegan and touchesmoved to determine swipe direction then sets the animation based on the direction in touchesended

736320
for-loop	loops
i changed the for-loop for...in loops and it worked

736330
children	parent
in essence the responsibility of the children s destruction is passed to the parent object

736365
atomic	lockless
the individual reads of a and b are atomic and all writes elsewhere in the code to these two memory locations are also lockless atomic

736409
x86	64bit
if you are targeting x86 you can use the 64bit compare exchange support and pack both int s into a single 64bit word

736424
int	chars
int getopt int chars const const chars

736432
tapestry	wicket
i was hoping to find something like wicket tapestry or barracuda for the scala language

736454
int	chars
myself i d probably end up using something like pax s suggestion but actually use a union of chars 1 and void and int to make the common cases convenient and an enumed type flag

736466
post	get
here it is i can understand why you might want it pure scala but you haven t stated that s necessary and with the techniques defined within the blog post and there is another blog which also helps you should be able to get it close enough to what you desire

736470
pdfsharp	itextsharp
how about pdfsharp or itextsharp

736499
apache	nginx
i ve got nginx reverse proxying requests to apache 2 with mod_php

736499
apache	nginx
i checked nginx and apache s logs

736502
websphere	ibm
ibm s websphere real-time

736537
awt	swing
the latest version 2.1 is compliant with jdk1.5 so you should have swing awt available

736568
inherited	properties
my structure is made up of various object types with different properties but each inherited from a base abstract node class

736568
children	parent
like i said before each node has a unique guid identifier but right now nodes reference their parent children directly and do not store their ids

736568
serializable	deserialization
the following is what i m planning to do for serializable and deserialization of this structure

736614
mouse	keyboard
in a non-web interface the controller handles the inputs from things like the keyboard and mouse choosing which views to render and what changes to make in the model based on those inputs

736665
public	protected
and is your foo class methods declared public protected or private or package local

736665
public	protected
perhaps less obvious is if they are package local no public protected private scope then you can only override them if you are in the same package as the original class

736665
public	protected
if you declare the original a method in foo public or protected you will get the result you expected

736701
vim	textmate
i just recently set up my vim environment from textmate after becoming addicted to its modal input

736701
vim	textmate
picture comparison between textmate left and vim right

736789
listview	gridview
i am using a wpf application in which i placed a listview control which has 3 gridview columns

736792
tinyurl	bit.ly
is there an expiry on bit.ly or tinyurl shortened urls

736797
public	protected
access modifiers private public protected

736835
listview	gridview
from what i see the wpf gridview is just a view mode look n feel for the listview control.

736878
pecl	pear
hint pear classes are pure php pecl packages are modules

736893
pecl	pear
if you can t or don t want to user pear and pecl you still can use the diff utility called by exec

736898
google-chrome	firefox
for example software such as ie8 google-chrome or firefox might all be tagged browsers to categorize them on a download page

736900
serializable	deserialization
in addition i ve created a static class in informa for serializable deserialization

736900
serializable	deserialization
my serializable and deserialization methods are below

736920
quicksort	heapsort
for general-purpose sorting the answer appears to be no as quicksort merge sort and heapsort tend to perform better in the average- and worst-case scenarios

737020
pop-up	dialog
this handler does close every alert or confirm dialog that pop-up up but first it gets the text shown by the dialog and stores it

737230
int	chars
performance is also better when indexing and traversing int than chars columns

737294
public	protected
this refactoring process is obviously made much easier if you are already using properties in place of public protected fields

737294
getter	setter
will implement the necessary backing field and getter setter code for you

737294
vb.net	vb6
vb6 already did this for com-exposed classes and i see absolutely no reason for vb.net and c# not to do the same

737307
createelement	each
2 use createelement setattribute and appendchild to create and add each div

737312
ready	each
this would allow to have copy n paste ready examples in the config file plus you could nest them to explain various points in each example

737323
implements	extends
you can see it wraps and changes the httpservletrequest object to the securitycontextholderawarerequestwrapper class which extends httpservletrequestwrapper which implements httpservletrequest and feed it back to the standard servlet filter dofilter chain

737329
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
use a normal inputstream fileinputstream wrapped in an inputstreamreader and then wrapped in a bufferedreader - then call readline on the bufferedreader

737334
config	ini
in fact the current suggestion is no longer ini files but the registry for small parts of the config and xml files in appdata if you ve got a lot

737369
ant	maven
think of javac ant maven etc

737382
implements	extends
if not implements a class extends the authentication interface on which you can put your authentication parameters

737409
getter	setter
i think getter and setter are evil if used excessively by that i mean when it s not necessary and would break the business model but why shouldn t we have a function called getbalance

737409
getter	setter
now in some sense getbalance may not be relevant enough to argue that getter and setter are good because it doesn t or maybe shouldn t have an accompanying setter and speaking of which a function called setbalance float f could be bad in my opinion because it would imply to the implementer of the function that the account must be manipulated out side of the class which is not a good thing

737421
ostringstream	std
an example in std ostringstream is the str function

737421
getter	setter
the standard library often follows a pattern of using the same function name for a pair of getter setter functions - str being an example again

737437
getter	setter
for less typing you can implement trivial setter getter as inline methods

737437
getter	setter
and don t forget that getter and setter are somewhat evil

737438
getter	setter
the legwork is not more if you implement just the default setter getter inline in the class declaration which i tend to do - more complex setter move to the body though

737474
nunit	typemock
at my work place we are using typemock and nunit for our unit testing

737489
accessor	properties
the cf jit compiler does not perform the same optimisation as the desktop jit compiler and does not optimise simple properties accessor so in this case adding a simple properties causes a small amount of code bloat over using a public field

737519
put	get
the only way to get it right for sure is put everything yes that too in one big file

737552
getter	setter
getter and setter are evil

737552
getter	setter
use of getter and setter is in opposition to the fundamentals of object oriented design data abstraction and encapsulation

737552
getter	setter
overuse of getter and setter will make your code less agile and maintainable in the long run

737552
getter	setter
you ll need to change the private data field the getter the setter and all the client code of this class that calls these getter and setter

737552
getter	setter
this not to say that getter and setter don t have their purpose

737552
getter	setter
the getter and setter make it more difficult to fix the problems since the client code dostuffwithaccount is now bound to the data-type we used to implement the account balance

737552
getter	setter
granted you could have changed the internal type to float and still supported the getter setter idiom

737552
getter	setter
but it doesn t take long to realize that the getter setter arrangement is doubling your workload and complicating matters as you need to support both the code that used ints and the new code that will use floats

737552
getter	setter
the overall point though is that you must be careful with getter and setter

737552
getter	setter
do not get into the habit of writing getter and setter for every data-member

737596
getter	setter
that s fairly common in c++ after all if it doesn t take any arguments we know it s the getter and if it takes an argument it s the setter

737617
versioning	upgrade
you either have to backport the sqllite module from python 2.5 to python 2.2 or ask your web hoster to upgrade to the latest python versioning

737622
keydown	keyup
alternatively you could handle keyup keydown events

737799
affinity	processors
for example you might want to limit an application to using no more than a given number of processors to take money for using each processors - you will use bit shifts to count bits in the affinity mask

737931
ferret	sphinx
i ve no idea how applicable to your situation this is but evan weaver compared a few of the common rails search options sphinx ferret a port of lucene for ruby and solr running some benchmarks

737960
folder	directory
the result of this wizzard is a discomap and wsdl files that are put in the app_webreferences folder of your site in a directory structure based on the namespace you ve chosen in the dialog

737996
folder	directory
this gives me a bit of a problem since if i run the program from another directory with the command . folder folder program for example my program will not find the text because the working directory isn t correct

738005
mouse	keyboard
i figure tracking my keyboard and mouse is a good way to see when i left and arrived

738005
mouse	keyboard
have a system wide callback for every mouse and keyboard press

738053
config	ini
config reader setter which reads the config from ini xml file and sets the environment of the application

738078
super	implements
i searched many years for the paste command knowing this is a super basic operation someone must already have implements something to solve this problem

738092
aptana	radrails
how can i run my carpet applications directly from aptana with radrails

738118
rss	feed
i d like to be able to collect rss feed online as an alternative to collecting them on a desktop machine using a regularly running process

738134
nswindow	nscursor
try using nscursor directly the nsview cursor rect methods depend on things such as a properly sized and visible nswindow to work properly which aren t necessarily the case in full screen mode

738266
opera	firefox
it should select the empty paragraphs so i edited my code to the following but it doesn t show in firefox it works in opera

738317
disk	ram
it would be a shame to be storing a bunch a data on disk and waiting on slow-ass disk i o when the user has 8gb of ram

738336
agile	sprint
the development process is agile style with several sprint already completed

738336
globalization	localization
our globalization framework is good and localization efforts have been successful so far

738359
kde	gnome
the kde window manager as well as gnome and all wms that follow the freedesktop standards support the extended window manager hints ewmh

738359
kde	gnome
i have never worked with kde but gnome provides such functionality so i assume that kde has it too

738362
udp	tcp
i have a couple applications that communicate over tcp udp sockets

738406
kde	gnome
newer gnome and kde

738406
kde	gnome
freedesktop wanted to make the ewmh as broad as possible apart from gnome and kde

738431
folder	directory
if you have multiple vhosts on the same server it s pretty common to have each site in a directory under var www and each of these have a htdocs folder which is mounted as the web root

738462
equals	compareto
objectsâ equals and compareto methods

738494
getter	setter
i hardly ever use getter and setter in my own code

738494
getter	setter
if you insist on having getter and or setter you can use macros to cut down on the boiler-plate

738541
mp3	ogg	mp3	wav	wav	ogg
i am looking for a cross-platform .net and mono on windows macosx and linux way to decode wav mp3 or ogg files such that i can then play the decoded streams through directsound or openal as desired

738541
mp3	ogg
a solution that can decode either mp3 or ogg would be sufficient -- decoding both is not necessary

738541
mp3	ogg	mp3	wav	wav	ogg
if it or another solution can decode wav as well that would be ideal but isn t strictly necessary since i could potentially convert my wav files to mp3 or ogg

738568
children	parent
other things i ve tried that haven t worked is applying a class or id to the parent li class top-level or li id top-level --that didn t stop the sifr it still grabbed the children

738608
put	get
if it s a commonly used dll put it somewhere in the folder structure searched by loadlibrary and it ll get found

738630
geocoding	geocode
in my situation i was comparing addresses and trying to prevent duplicates since we would geocode any new address and each geocoding cost

738738
pop-up	dialog
when i use the grid in a pop-up dialog the only way for the user to leave is via a button either close or ok

738784
qimage	qwidget
if you want to render some graphics from inside your dll function without passing in any pointers to qimage or qwidget type things probably the thing to do is use opengl

738790
mouse	keyboard
we can capture the mouse events but how do we track the row lost focus triggered by the keyboard

738814
serializable	deserialization
soooooooo seems like the best solution is to have each implementation pass a list of node types it uses to the serializable and deserialization methods in the framework project

738819
gridex	janus
the gridex control from janus systems can do it but honestly i d really stay clear of doing things like janus systems do so it s better you should find your own way

738826
pop-up	dialog
i have this annoying problem where my exception window in visual studio 2008 is replaced by a windows pop-up dialog box see images below

738836
opera	firefox
i need solution that works for ie6+ firefox 2+ opera 9+ .

738846
free	malloc
this will segfault because you are trying to free c which is not something that has been malloc ed before

738856
hdd	floppy
i need to know if my program can write files to the disk hdd floppy flash cd from where it is running

738877
mouseover	mousedown
you ll also find that the mousedown and mouseover states for the control will be fixed as the default style

738880
cpu	affinity
the things which actually make the most difference to how threads get scheduled ie thread priority and thread cpu affinity are already exposed by apis and support for numa aspects are starting to appear in mainstream os apis too

738892
put	get
get the javascript code from and put it in the tag

738897
int	chars
the chr function returns a chars given by the int for the corresponding ascii chars

738904
int	chars
the function chr would convert chars to int values and would be no use here

738925
postgresql	mysql
i know very few who support derby but they support mysql postgresql firebird and others.

738929
pop-up	dialog
the goal is when information dialog window pop-up it can always go to the specified url

738977
width	height
my understanding is that unless the canvas contains one or more displayobject children it will always report its width and height properties as 0 regardless of the percentage sizings you may have applied to it

738981
versioning	upgrade
one more reason for upgrade to newer windows versioning

738996
readonly	temporary
when an ie user clicks the link of a file residing in sharepoint and user selects readonly access the file is copied to temporary internet files my application is opened and passed that filename as a parameter

739049
width	height
width and height are documented to be the values actually in use - there are even events for when they change

739077
folder	directory
i want all new vc project created to automatically include i the directory and link to the shared .lib dll in that shared folder

739175
maven	pom.xml
look at the maven parent pom.xml for an example

739176
awt	swing	swt	swing
i take it this is a client gui application swing swt awt but beyond that i think we re going to need more details

739205
hide	show
you could add remove the label from the layer to hide show it just retain the label instance for later retrieval

739288
qstring	qfiledialog
i think its probably some mismatch between the qfiledialog the qstring its passing back and the string the my python expects

739306
kde	gnome	kate	kde	kate	gnome
if you re not running gnome but are still using linux kde you might be able to use kate

739395
processors	work-stealing
my uneducated guess would be that there is a run-queue per processors and a work-stealing algorithm when a processors is idle

739395
freebsd	solaris
i m still reading design impl of freebsd with solaris internals being the next on my list so all i can do is make wild guesses atm

739419
hide	show
how would i set the binding to show and hide the respective panels

739452
hide	show
by the way this is probably just be because you have abbreviated the model code but if you want to show and hide dynamically your model will need to implement inotifypropertychanged

739470
vim	emacs
then i imagine there are ways to configure vim to work nicely with matlab i m an emacs person these days and there are solutions for emacs

739475
public	protected
what are the differences among private protected and public declarations in a class

739507
hide	show
i would like to have a button used to expand retract the height of the cell when it is pushed you know show and hide

739510
int	double
works on positive and negative int of any size double and ratios too

739530
for-loop	loops
if adding items then the for-loop may skip some silently while the foreach loops will throw

739536
width	height
have you tried binding the width and height of the canvas to its parent

739578
dictionary	map
how do you map rudimentary data structures tree dictionary in an orm such as nhibernate

739581
accessor	properties
i m getting sublayers of a calayer with this properties accessor

739610
stdio	getc
given the buffering inherent in all the stdio functions i would be tempted to read the stream character by character with getc

739694
organization	naming
i have been trying to clean up the naming and organization conventions of our projects unit and integration tests

739694
organization	naming
it seems that if there is one best practice for unit test organization it is that the layout and naming of the test classes and namespaces should mirror those of the code under test

739734
implements	extends
you could extends the foreign class assuming it s non-final and make that class implements the interface

739738
int	chars
with hn the first chars of the variable name is i for int l for long w for word etc

739748
printf	fgets	printf	atoi	fgets	atoi
sizeof is a keyword because despite it s name and usage it is an operator like + or or rather than a function like printf or atoi or fgets

739751
int	chars
if you look up the c standard you will find that fundamental types include int chars etc but not size_t

739794
free	malloc
6945 address 0x7 is not stack d malloc d or recently free d

739794
free	malloc
6945 malloc free in use at exit 4 bytes in 1 blocks

739794
free	malloc
6945 malloc free 1 allocs 1 frees 4 bytes allocated

739794
free	malloc
when running this application you would not longer get a segmentation fault emitted by the kernel but a warning from glibc the owner of malloc and free

739794
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
if you would run this in valgrind which operates by replacing the free malloc realloc .

739794
free	malloc
6955 malloc free in use at exit 4 bytes in 1 blocks

739794
free	malloc
6955 malloc free 1 allocs 1 frees 4 bytes allocated

739824
folder	directory
i want an app that would route the subdomain to a folder inside the directory

739862
profiling	debugging
nhibernate profiling nhibernate debugging tool

739879
opera	firefox
the blog runs fine on firefox and opera but when i open it in ie7 it shows javascript error.clicking on that little triangle doesn t show any information..how to remove that error

739891
folder	dir
when i create this and view the folder windows has set the dir as read only

739945
int	double
even if you re given a positive int it s not hard to get it to a double

739945
int	double
going from a 32-bit int to a double should provide adequate precision

739953
profiling	instrumentation
a managed implementation of a code profiling is not possible same for java as well as then the profiling would instrumentation itself

740021
backtracking	greedy
the difference is instead of first expanding the match to the maximum and than doing backtracking by decreasing the match one character at a time greedy the lazy modifiers will first be expanded to the minimum match and than be increased one character at a time

740026
serializable	deserialization
update i realised a minor issue with the optimization flags i was using was causing the serializable data to be written incorrectly which resulted in the inconsistency of deserialization times

740067
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
i haven t used git but i used svn and bazaar which is similar in philosophy to git so i can answer you in general terms

740149
elf	coff
you can parse the coff elf whatever format file from the build and this gives you the information you need to work out the names and types of the variables in your object

740175
squeak	visualworks
i was aware from the beginning that smalltalk has several dialects perhaps dialect isn t the best word but by this i mean visualworks squeak and dolphin to mention just three

740175
squeak	visualworks
so far i have limited my foray to visualworks and squeak

740211
innodb	myisam
however due to various and maybe obvious reasons i want to switch from myisam to innodb as i need transactions at some places

740253
rss	feed
once you use xslt to transform the rss feed into html it is simply treated and thus rendered as a standard html document

740285
gridview	linqdatasource
i have a gridview that is bound to a linqdatasource control that is returning a collection of customers

740310
rss	feed
a lot of sites have rss feed for updated and new apps on the apple iphone app store

740310
rss	feed
however apple s rss feed generator only shows feed for the top 100 free paid apps

740327
opera	firefox
as you ll be able to see at this demo page everything pretty much works at least in opera and firefox save for the gradient being ever so slightly off at the end hover to be shown the hex value

740382
folder	directory
zipoutputstream can handle empty directory by adding a forward-slash after the folder name

740404
xsl-fo	xslt
what s the difference between xslt and xsl-fo

740405
int	chars
the standard is not clear about the use of a chars here the examples are with int short and long but they mention the underlying integral type and that would include chars as well

740410
xsl-fo	xslt
xslt formatting objects or xsl-fo is

740410
xsl-fo	xslt
xsl-fo is part of xslt

740412
xsl-fo	xslt
xsl-fo stands for extensible stylesheet language formatting objects and is about formatting and now is known as xslt to avoid all confusion

740414
xsl-fo	xslt
xslt is used for transforming xslt which is the same as xsl-fo is used for formatting

740419
children	parent
internally controls that are children of a naming control gridview have their full ids built by appending ids of their parent using

740422
width	height
here s an excerpt from some code i wrote that given a x and y calculate the screen boundaries sx sy and sw with screen width and sh for screen height

740432
xsl-fo	xslt
one would therefore take a load of data in say an xml format and then use xslt to convert that data into a document consisting of xsl-fo that in turn is rendered using an appropriate tool in say pdf for print or other means of distribution

740534
serializable	deserialization
edit the requirement that the structures be mutable doesn t really affect much with regard to my answer - i still think that serializable and deserialization is the best solution to this problem

740534
postgresql	mysql
the only case in which a database would be better is if you have a system where multiple users are interacting with and updating a central data repository and for a case like that you d be looking at a database server like mysql postgresql or sql server for both speed and concurrency

740538
children	parent
capturing starts catching events at the parent elements as it moves down the chain of the children until it reaches the element where the event was triggered

740558
int	chars
i m using sql clr integration with the idea that we store data with general types like chars int but then contextualize the data with constraints specifically check constraints

740612
google-chrome	firefox
it is supported on most browsers ie firefox google-chrome and stream live video feeds

740671
superclass	subclassing
then you can make later versions of the cards be new subclassing of card the stuff that stays the same is in the superclass the varying parfts are the subclassing s business

740674
allocator	stl
search for stl allocator and memory pool

740704
ssl	https
as it s internal you don t need a paid ssl certificate if cost is the reason for avoiding https - i can t think of any other good reasons - you should be able to use a self-signed one

740711
sctp	tcp
note that sctp implements a 4-way handshake with cookies built into the protocol to protect against syn floods while allowing more information to be stored in the cookie and thus not having to limit the protocol features supported because the size of the cookie is too small in tcp you only get 32 bits of sequence number to store all of the information

740717
super	self
super worker self .__init__

740721
multicastdelegate	delegation
a multicastdelegate has a linked list of delegation called an invocation list consisting of one or more elements

740725
filesystems	ntfs
but if your filesystems is ntfs be prepared to spend a few months learning about all the data structures that you ll need to update

740748
google-chrome	firefox
it shows up fine in firefox google-chrome

740755
erlang	lisp
are there fewer vigorous complaints about the readability of erlang lisp syntax because there is only one way to write code in them

740773
folder	directory
i deleted the folder library application support iphone simulator in my user directory

740784
hide	show
i m using css hover to do my show hide if that s relevant

740787
gridview	detailsview	gridview	formview	formview	detailsview
for controls such as the gridview detailsview and formview controls data-binding expressions are resolved automatically during the control s prerender event

740791
gmail	hotmail

children	parent
in the stitch you ll either update child tables foreign keys in the insert by doing a subselect on the new parent or you ll insert children and do a separate update to fix the foreign keys

742616
children	parent
in addition you could write a super-naive algorithm to confirm this isomorphism by attempting all possible mapping functions and ensuring that for every node in the first tree that gets mapped to a node in the other the corresponding mapping happens with the parent and with the two children

742730
codeigniter	kohana

742754
width	height
what would you call some of your attributes in terms of color of hair height and width etc

742760
codeigniter	kohana
since kohana does not use eval for templates it is possible that it is just left over from codeigniter days

if you re using other xss preventing methods provided for codeigniter or kohana there s no necessity to use this

742794
disk	ram
to me this doesn t seem like a good idea if the system goes down the ram disk is destroyed

742794
disk	ram
i would focus on simply allocating the ram in a helpful manner and keeping the os files on disk

742822

rss	feed
the only problem is that the links that are returned by the rss feed have the completely wrong domain name in the links

742974
rss	feed
servername in apache was set to the domain that i was seeing being used by the rss feed to build the urls

743010

in particular i m interested in how the panels handle child objects that have width or height set to auto and horizontal or vertical alignment set to stretch

743126
pull	push
i would also look at other tools to push pull the data into other formats

743151
boost	stl
note you just need to make the swap a no-throw method this is relatively simple if you are using stl objects as they all define a no-throw swap just for this situation as does boost and all good libraries so you should follow suite

743160
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
one way is to use nscalendar and nsdatecomponents

743173
udp	tcp

but that s not something i d ever suggest to anyone who hasn t had to write compilers or parsers before without the benefit of lex yacc bison or other similar tools

743316
imperative	declarative
it s not an imperative language i guess so that means it s some sort of declarative functional language but i m no expert in language taxonomy so what should the d language officially or semi-officially be classified as

743335
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i found some examples that implement checkbox in dropdownlistfor but nothing involving the autocompleteextender

743349
disk	ram
ram disk is a great idea in principle but you might not gain as much as you think

743349
disk	ram
if it s similar to what you have with vmware + ram disk it would be much easier for you to maintain

743388
super	self
put your self loadobjectsfromplist before super viewdidload

743434

743508
pop-up	dialog
this is the same dialog that pop-up on clicking an icon displayed to the extreme left before anything else on the perspective bar

743544

is there a good implementation in stl or boost that anyone can point me too

743598
many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-many	one-to-many	many-to-one	one-to-many

743649
put	get
but when i try and put a filter into it for the company i will get an error at runtime when the company is null

743656
accessor	properties
however you can t just synthesize this properties you would have to write your own accessor because the compiler has no idea where you want to get this value from

743659
getter	setter
in this case you could declare these as properties and implement the setter and getter yourself using the objc_ runtime methods above

743669
inline	inlining
if inlining a function duplicates the code in the place the function is called then the static and local variables are duplicated for each function calling it and if there is only one thread running the function that calls the inline one at the same time then the code is thread-safe

743683
post	get
scott stevenson explains in his blog post a quick objective-c 2.0 tutorial part ii how to get public properties with private setters

743939
hash	md5
md5 sha1 or any long hash function seems too heavy for a simple task i am not doing cryptography

743940
try-catch	exception-handling
and while it is true that you should avoid try-catches when they aren t necessary check instead of letting x throw nullreferenceexception you will find that especially on web applications there are tons of times were try-catch statements are absolutely required because sometimes you will lose connections or the user will do the wrong thing and exception-handling will be thrown whether you like it or not

743997
min	max
it can validate credit card numbers dates min and max characters and many other features

744042

mouse	keyboard
and finally such automation relies on taking control of the entire ui including i o devices such as the keyboard and mouse

744237
aggregate-functions	sum
also there is no product aggregate-functions in sql so of course you can just do sum log x or exp sum log x to get the equivalent of product x

744237

svg	vml
one important question first why specifically should the output of the wysiwyg editor be in vml svg

744394
svg	vml
1 if you re intent upon vml svg one library i know that can bring the two together is raphaeljs which has some degree of text support but i m really not sure how sophisticated the degree of manipulation of the text is

744502
typedef	struct
here s a good tutorial on typedef for struct

744516
installation	upgrade
now hacking a joomla installation is not really a good idea since upgrading will become hard and a not upgrade joomla installation is a great security risk

744536
typedef	struct
typedef for struct seemed to be the solution would it be the same for array declaration and assignment

744562
getter	setter
warning the syntax for defining getter setter apparently is not something that ie doesn t implement nicely

744571
profiling	benchmarking
if you re really concerned about performance should should benchmarking profiling the code before you decide to make a design decision based on those performance worries

getter	setter
you don t have to synthesize numberofsides if you re planning on implementing the getter and setter

745226
getter	setter
you ll need to declare the getter setter in your interface accordingly

745226
getter	setter
btw another approach would be to use the synthesized getter setter and add a separate method - bool isnumberofsidesvalid which performs this check

745227
mouse	keyboard
if you are using winforms and will only deploy on windows machines then it s quite easy to use user32 getlastinputinfo to handle both mouse and keyboard idling

int	boolean
under the hood this does an implicit conversion from int to boolean

745380
jsf	wicket	jsf	seam	wicket	seam
i believe that you can use seam with jsf wicket and gwt

745670
noscript	meta
you can have a noscript block in the head element with a meta refresh tag in it

interpreted-language	compiled-language
so the workflow in python is much more similar to that of an interpreted-language than that of a compiled-language

745795
innodb	myisam
if it is more read than write then you should stick with myisam if its more write than read you should look into innodb

745795
innodb	myisam
if you want to know the difference between innodb and myisam then wikipedia has a great list of their differences

745795
innodb	myisam
myisam uses table-level locking on writes to any existing row whereas innodb uses row-level locking

745837

since cron runs jobs time-based not interval-based there s no blindingly simple way to do it

745963
innodb	myisam
that said a very hot table lots and lots of select s will benefit from being migrated to innodb because myisam does not support concurrent read

anyone has done adding tabitem dynamically to a tabcontrol

746203
16-bit	64bit
you can extend this idea to 64bit int s or trade off memory for speed assuming your l1 data cache is large enough and reverse 16-bit at a time with a 64k-entry lookup table

746207
bazaar	git
let s suppose right now i want to support bazaar and git

746207
bazaar	git
so of course i can make bazaarlogfilereader and gitlogfilereader and hard-code them into the program but i want it to be set up in such a way that adding support for a new version control program is as simple as plopping a new class file in the directory with the bazaar and git readers

746207
bazaar	git
so right now you can call do-something-with-the-log --software git and do-something-with-the-log --software bazaar because there are log readers for those

746215
rss	feed
asp.net rss feed

746217
width	height
is there any api to get the out layer width height of a string in a certain font

746371
firefox	safari
firefox however doesn t have extensive scripting capabilitiesâ if you are willing to use safari there is an applescript command available to inject javascript code into a document the do javascript commandâ look it up in safari s scripting dictionary available from within script editor

746411

post your results if you get a chance

746606
udp	tcp
a great many applications that use udp use it because they need the low-overhead low-latency nature of it much more than they need the precise reliability of tcp

746606
voip	sip
think about sip in voip telephony for example

746694
equals	tostring
the equals hashcode and tostring methods should be generated

746705
jlist	jtree	jlist	jtable	jtree	jtable
that way you can have jlist as well as jtable and jtree display massive amount of cells without having to instanciate components for each cell

746705
jlist	jtree	jlist	jtable	jtree	jtable
just as neil coffey said you can add your listeners to the jlist jtable jtree instead and use the helper methods locationtoindex ... getcellbounds ... to dispatch which cell was affected and thus deal with cell specific logic

746724
equals	tostring
create a constructor for those fields as well and also implement equals hashcode and tostring methods

746735
std	ostream
i have to know whether there is some kind of ostream which accept an instance std string and write on that instance

if you want a rounded border rather than just a rounded solid background the above can be tweaked using border negative margin position relative absolute width and background-image position so it works but can t remember off the top of my head how

746910
post	get	post	put	put	get
if you have wfetch or fiddler or live http headers then i would show the client side request as well and highlight the absence of view states and highligh the post get verbs put delete if you are using wfetch

gif	png	tiff	png
i wouldn t want to attempt tiff png gif or jpg in fortran without the help of external libraries however

747020
getter	setter
if you do not want to hardcode calls to each getter and setter reflection is the only way to call these methods but it is not hard

747020
getter	setter
can you refactor the class in question to use a properties object to hold the actual data and let each getter and setter just call get set on it

747031
arp	tcp
based on your comment below if you want bypass disable the arp handling of the tcp ip stack then winpcap should let you do that

747059
min	max
because of this all your checks will work perfectly because you don t do any checks that check the actual data valid e-mail address min max username length etc

747101
width	height
but it has to keep the factors between the width and height

747109
aggregate-functions	sum
we have aggregate-functions like sum avg and so on but not the basic math operators

747120
width	height
there you can skip either of the parameters height or width and it will resize correctly

747138
width	height
really you should have a target width or height then adjust the other dimension by the same proportion

747221
nsmutablestring	nsstring
so i made currentelementvalue an nsstring instead of an nsmutablestring and i can get the proper intvalue

747245
dictionary	map
if you have absolutely no idea what fields can be in each element your only choice is to create a property bag map dictionary of key value pairs

747286
postgresql	mysql
my problem is when i need to query a relational database - i m only really concerned with postgresql and mysql - i ve been struggling a bit

747289

747310
put	get
unfortunately when i ve verbally asked folks how they go about debugging on linux i typically get the following answer oh i just put a bunch of print statements. omg

747310
centos	linux
since it is on linux and will be working with c++ code on the centos 32-bit os i am hoping here is a preferred opensource solution

747310
centos	linux
so i guess i asking for the preferred opensource ide for c++ code on centos linux

747323
bresenham	dda
you are looking for line drawing algorithms something like bresenham or dda you can find some reasonable implementations here ofcourse instead of drawing a complete line you would move your ball along that line but the way of finding the set of lines to move on is the same

747335
nsmutablestring	nsstring
intvalue should work identically nsstring and nsmutablestring

747362
anjuta	gnome
anjuta is a really great ide for gnome

747379
icmp	udp
rather than listening for icmp responses to your failed udp sends why not send a brand spanking new icmp echo request

747394
hash	salt
i was wondering if it was a common practice to salt and hash a password like

747394
hash	salt
e padding || hash salt || password

747394
hash	salt
to eventually decrypt a record in this database the server will know the length of padding and simply take away padding to reveal hash salt || password

747399
lisp	smalltalk	lisp	prolog
for example learning prolog made me truly understand recursion for the first time smalltalk and ruby helped me understand the beauty of dynamic typing lisp just blew my mind and c made me realise what was going on behind the curtains.

747420
hash	salt
having a good salt would prevent someone doing a standard lookup and it would also strengthen the hash against dictionary attacks

747420
hash	salt
if the salt and the password are combined within a hash it would greatly reduce the use of offline attacks and you wouldn t need to take any special precaution of protecting it

747455
children	parent
a task object can have one parent task and several children task objects

747455
children	parent
the estimatedhours startdate and enddate properties of a task which has children is a parent depend on those properties of its immediate children

747455
children	parent
the parent task s startdate is the earliest startdate of its children

747455
children	parent
the parent task s enddate is the latest enddate of its children

747455
children	parent
the parent task s estimatedhours is the sum of its children s estimatedhours

747455
children	parent
the parent s properties are a reflection of its children so any changes to children may require the parent s properties to be adjusted to reflect the changes appropriately

747455
children	parent
a parent task would listen for these events on its immediate children task objects and make appropriate changes to its own properties when those events occurred

747472
put	get
- you get many templates for your like i use it a lot when the database return no result you can put a message here to inform the user instead of showing blank screen

747586
client-side	server-side
remember that no matter how much client-side validation you do you still need to do server-side validation

747594

showwindow with the intptr from findwindow and 0 sw_hide

747628
superclass	subclassing
you need to work out the relationship between them -- are they superclass-subclass or are they peer subclassing of some other superclass

747628
superclass	subclassing
you may have proper superclass subclassing relationships

747628
superclass	subclassing
one choice is to have a superclass table with an optional fk reference to the additional information in the subclassing

747628
superclass	subclassing
one choice is to have a subclassing table with a mandatory fk reference to the superclass information

747631
ant	maven
it is simple to get maven to run arbitrary ant scripts as part of the build

747631
ant	maven
this question has an excellent description of how to run an ant script with maven s process-sources build execution phase

747635
folder	directory
with tools we ve used previously it s been possible to set up a reference directory or folder on the network which stores the latest revision of everything that s been checked in so that people can easily browse the latest versions without having to use a dedicated tool

747740
post	get
a more complicated way would be to test if the variable exists in the get array if it doesnt then its post

747806
udp	tcp
using this paradigm you can use udp tcp http peer-to-peer msmq - all using the same 3 core concepts

747820

you may consider switching id to an unsigned integer so you can get up to 2 32 bits available i am guessing criteria is never negative as you are assigning it to an id column

748271
sorting	filtering
the downside is that the sorting filtering of these data are exceedingly difficult.not only that when the data size is large it s very slow to read them from hard disk into memory

getter	setter
property getter setter in javascript

748331
post	get
i can see the view when calling the get edit action method but the strongly typed post action method receives only a viewmodel class with null parameters and i can t figure out how to retrieve the post parameters

748341
children	parent
alternatively if your database supports recursive sql queries you can use that and it will only select the nodes that are children of your parent node

748347
getter	setter
to add on- you need to closely inspect your setter and getter and see if they return a different value on different calls

748384
implements	extends
the reason you re properly using interfaces is due to the fact that you cannot have all your classes that needs these methods extends a base class that contains these yet you need to know that specific classes promise to implements these

748518
equals	compareto
by convention you should either implement the equals method to be consistent with your compareto method or clearly document your class to note the inconsistency

748518
range	max
if you want to include max in the range add one to diff

748555
cunit	cppunit
pick a good platform i like cunit and cppunit and go from there

i ve got a listview control bound to an observablecollection of items and i ve set it s view to a gridview with columns bound to properties data

748639
width	height
also after i click dismiss to the error box that pops up the images do load afterwards but are then set to the size of the actual image not the width and height i set the component to

748653
gendarme	fxcop
as well as fxcop gendarme is another tool to look at it is mono s version of fxcop but they are different in approach and the errors that they actually find

748656
gendarme	fxcop
gendarme for mono is similar to fxcop

how about - in your code behind file .xaml.cs reload the image into a new image control and take the width and height from that

748798
put	get
or on some hosted sites that you re allowed access to you need to put in a ticket to the service center or help desk to get them make it an app

for more details on what i m trying to accomplish and why see my question here http get post request and google geolocation api

748848
pull	push
if i am doing all initializing and synchronizing programatically with rmo like here does it matter if it is a push or pull

748848
pull	push
if i can it seems that even though pull is favored for merge replication i would want to use push to make the server bear the brunt and easier management

748857
children	parent
i would add a node to the tree and each node contains a parent and a collection of children

748873
put	get
any information i can get would be better than nothing so please feel free to put in partial answers

opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
if you open different brwosers at the same time such as firefox opera google-chrome and ie you ll have to log in in all of the browsers independently

749063
pop-up	dialog
when you right-click and choose run as administrator do you get any kind of pop-up dialog at all

749063
pop-up	dialog
if you get no pop-up dialog at all then my guess is one of the following has happened

749071
keydown	mousedown
you could also store the selection in other events such as mousedown or keydown which are known to be triggered before a change

749097
boost	stl
this is the easiest solution that comes to my mind as neither the stl nor boost contains anything to do it easier

749136
ssl	https
you need to get a cdn that supports serving files over https then use that cdn for the ssl requests

749206
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	shellsort	heapsort	shellsort
while people have spent careers worrying about which is the best sort algorithm for very large databases for small n it really doesn t matter whether you use quicksort heapsort radix sort shellsort optimized bubble sort unoptimized bubble sort etc

749218
cpython	ironpython
this is also the approach taken by python or at least cpython the most common implementation. the jython and ironpython implementations also take this approach but compile to the bytecode for the java and c# virtual machines resepectively

749218
cpu	processors
in some cases this can actually outperform native compilation as it is free to perform runtime analysis on the code and can use specific features of the current processors while static compilation may need to compile for a lowest common denominator cpu

749221
min	max
also good for selection algorithms finding the min or max

749284
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
i m not sure how opera google-chrome or safari handle sessions

749439
richfaces	icefaces
regarding drag-and-drop i ll suggest that you look at richfaces or icefaces

749458
implements	extends
the object htmlinput is abstract thus on runtime time it is always implements by an object that is extends htmlinput

749469
mouseup	mousedown
now when you mousedown inside the span move the mouse anywhere outside the frame and mouseup the span stays gray forever -- css considers it active forever

749505
int	chars
instead of a bool you could use an int chars or string for your answer if the questions are multiple choice

749528
stdout	stderr
also ensure that you do not have stdin stdout or stderr being intercepted by the java process

749548
children	parent
this departs from the classical adjacency list in that instead of children holding the parent_id the parent holds two children ids or null

749553
xslt	xquery
i am studying computer science and we have to do a programming project which must be strongly related to xml and using xsd and xslt or xquery xpath at least

749580
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning 1.6.x

749614

i want to click a button show a loader image execute a time-consuming function hide the loader image

749666
hide	show
how can i distinctly show the loader image update the screen run the function hide the loader image

749682
hash	salt
and that is the hashtype salt hash

749682
hash	salt
is it the password and salt combined and then hash or is something else entirely

749686
crypt	md5	crypt	hash	hash	md5
hashtype is either sha1 default md5 or crypt -- the algorithm used to perform a one-way hash of the password

749686
hash	salt
salt is a random string used to salt the raw password to create the hash

749686
hash	salt
as the documentation describes the hash is the salt algorithm and password hash

749703
hash	salt
then the algorithm name the original salt and password hash are concatenated separated by s to form the digest

749757
istream	getline
i m sure i need a loop in my code that reads line by line but since the class has different types i guess i can t use std getline and also maybe that approach wouldn t use the istream method i implemented

749757
boost	stl
by the way i know that the boost library has a great serialization class however i m trying to learn how serialization would work using the stl library for now

749758
internationalization	localization
these are the primary options that i am exploring and i would consider using different tools for different portions of the project but what i m mainly interested in is if anyone has any experience to share with regards to localization internationalization

749758

profiling	debugging
the reason i m doing this is to better debugging a windows service and allow easier profiling of the code

749853
firefox	safari
your only way to get painting to occur will be to split up execution of your function or move the function onto an html5 worker thread -- and they only work on the betas of firefox and safari or more generally any sufficiently recent build of webkit proper

749898
width	height
instead controls in winforms provide their own width and height properties so this code should work

749906
width	height
writing to the properties width and height of this copy makes no sense because it is just a temporary copy and not backed by memory anywhere

749957
many-to-many	one-to-many
relations may be one-to-one one-to-many many-to-many

749957
many-to-many	one-to-many
you ll see that a many-to-many relation can in fact also model one-to-many and one-to-one

749957
many-to-many	one-to-many
e.g. if you model a one-to-many relation as many-to-many what lies can be recorded

749972
width	height
how about a bar plot with time on the horizontal axis where the width of each bar is the length of time your computer held a particular ip address and the height of each bar is inversely proportional to the width

750003
subtract	add
but it allows you all sorts of wonderful date functions to add subtract and decompose intervals of time which you can t do with an int without re-writing all those functions yourself

750032
google-chrome	safari
i m most concerned with safari and google-chrome at the moment but i m open to suggestions for any other browser

750064
dreamweaver	fireworks	photoshop	fireworks
i am completely new to web programming and i have taken a couple day classes in photoshop illustrator dreamweaver fireworks and indesign

750070
debian	linux
the man page on debian lenny agrees with mitch and jonathan ...does bsd really diverge from linux on this

750070
free	realloc
the linux and solaris man pages are very clean and the 89 standard realloc ptr 0 works like free ptr

750075
realloc	malloc
if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the

750075
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call

750075
free	realloc
to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

750075
realloc	malloc
if ptr is null realloc behaves like malloc for the specified size

750075
free	malloc
if the requested size is zero then you get back whatever malloc 0 might return which is often usually a null pointer but might be a non-null pointer that can also be returned to free but which cannot legitimately be dereferenced

750099
udp	tcp
a sock_dgram socket uses udp underneath which is entirely packet-oriented as opposed to stream-oriented like tcp

750145
prng	random
i am trying to make a java implementation of the park-miller-carta prng random number generator

750152
postgresql	mysql
start with the free ones like mysql or postgresql then.

750152
cvs	svn
learn to use source version control systems such as cvs svn and vss microsofts unfortunately not free -- the first two are

750173
preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder	postorder	inorder
you pretty much have a choice of preorder postorder and inorder

750184
floating-point	integer
ok so the essential problem is that you need to do floating-point division not integer division as others have pointed out

750184
int	double
if you absolutely insist on using park-miller-carta i d at least wrap it in a random subclass and let java.util.random take care of converting int to double etc-- after all that s what extensible libraries in an object-oriented language are for.

750242
firefox	safari
update i also tried the code in firefox 3 via firebug and it behaved just like safari

750280
python-mode	pymacs
it uses pymacs and python-mode to do just what you are looking for

750299
opera	safari
so far opera has been the best on mobile browser followed by iphone safari pocket ie was the worse and blackberry browser was too old except for new devices such as storm

750313
strncmp	strcmp	strncmp	memcmp	memcmp	strcmp
you will have to use one of strcmp strncmp or memcmp

750350
realloc	malloc
however realloc is only guaranteed to work on arrays allocated by malloc and similar functions containing objects without user-defined copy constructors

750371
hide	show
a manually show and hide the image

750371
hide	show
using this the element will show hide for any request

opera	safari
so do many mobile browsers including iemobile opera mobile and safari on the iphone

750484
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
the set of c functions malloc calloc realloc free are raw memory operations

750484
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
c++ does not have an equivalent of realloc but only typesafe equivalents to malloc free through the use of new new and delete delete

750495
lodash	underscore.js
there s also lodash underscore.js s _.partial when you don t need or want to mess with bind s thisarg

750530
getter	setter
for example in c# a property can be given setter and getter like this

750542
int	chars
you could store the hash alongside the data in the database to allow fast checks - but if you do that you should pick your own hash algorithm for chars since it isn t guaranteed to stay the same - perhaps just convert to an int for example - or to re-use the existing implementation

750603
profiling	debugging
using dtrace to profiling and debugging a c++ program

750643
sorting	filtering
well that would only test the database api it wouldn t take in to account any of the features you might be using in the report filtering sorting aggregation etc

750706
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller application and i want to have a uinavigationcontroller in one of the tab so how can i achieve this thanks advance for help

prior to making get post requests with the qhttp i create a rctcpsocket add it to my ratecontroller and use qhttp setsocket qtcpsocket

750748
unix	aix	unix	solaris	solaris	aix
there is any amount of legacy oracle unix kit still in production and vanilla installs of solaris aix or hp ux tend to be much more spartan than linux

750763
int	chars
create table id int not null primary key abbv chars 4 name varchar 64

750763
int	chars
but it s not a key it doesn t hash like a int key it takes up four chars compares and a look for the null terminator to compare it to edtr as opposed to one subtraction to compare two int

750765
pull	push
i ve already tested and on my end i can clone ok but i m afraid of what might happen if we both access the same repo push pull at the same time

750765
pull	push
also i know we can just push pull from one to another but we are required to have the code repo on the share for back-up reasons

750765
pull	push
but due to the fact we are doing this often i am afraid about file repo corruption if it happens that we both push pull at the same time

750822
width	height
there are certain things in css that become hard if not impossible in variable width and or height situations

750823
jquery	simplemodal
i am using the simplemodal plug-in in jquery

pull	push
this call fails with rpc_s_cannot_support the requested operation is not supported and never reaches the server side and the push pull primitives of the supplied pipe are never called

750912
ropemacs	pymacs
there is a bit of installing packages pymacs autocomplete rope ropemacs rope mode yasnippet and setting up but in the end i hope it will pay off

750913
put	get
apparently where you put the above code makes all the difference to vs.net so it may take a few tries to get it right

750928
jython	pypy
alternative implementations of python jython ironpython and pypy are officially discouraged but tolerated

750997
put	get
i put some tracing into global.asax and i get into the application start event but not into the session start event

folder	directory
if i have the right to create a new file in the program directory i want to create the file there if not i want to create the file in the program s appdata folder

751204
post	get
you should generally use post not get use a form not an a href for anything that is changing data in your system

751220
uilabel	uitextview
assuming the text is static use a uilabel instead of a uitextview uilabel is not a subclass of uiscrollview

751224
affinity	processors
also you may have different settings of sql server memory assignments and awe memory threads maximum query memory processors affinity priority boost

751236
many-to-many	one-to-many	entity-relationship	diagram
my knowledge level when it comes to databases is however i would guess quite basic - i can model data relationships correctly with entity-relationship diagram connection tables handling many-to-many one-to-many etc etc

751440
pop-up	dialog
have the click handler that pop-up the dialog return false so that the postback doesn t happen from that button click

751515
stdout	stderr
that sort of approach is only likely to work if your ide outputs information to stdout stderr etc

751515
stdout	stderr
the script launches your ide and captures stdout and stderr which will give you both normal output and any errors

751550
interbase	firebird
the interbase dbx driver doesn t support firebird 2.1 you ll have problems with certain field types - blobs for example

751623
subtract	add
clutching at straws perhaps add the number of rows+1 then if that works subtract the number of rows -s

751626
profiling	benchmarking
i can use various profiling and benchmarking tools for that

751627
switching	screens
whatever to resume it we can see video tv stream video in a reduce mode and if we click on the screens it switching to a full screens mode

751688
draggable	droppable
when the mouse is released the draggable happens to fall on both droppable divs two droppable events are fired

751688

what i would like to happen is that in this scenario the draggable will fall on only one droppable and nother other

751702
google-chrome	safari
when using a form with many text input webkit safari google-chrome submits the form when enter is pressed in any input element

751724

you can either push or pull the data

751734
outputstream	inputstream
i m sure you can loop over inputstream to copy it to outputstream then close

751784
invokelater	invokeandwait
i reccommend you use invokelater rather than invokeandwait on the init method although you can t do this if you use start stop methods

versioning	upgrade
i have a bad edit was hyper-conservative dba who won t upgrade the dev server to the same versioning as the production one so i can t just use apply and be done with it

752031
hide	show
alternatively you can always do this in server-side code and can then show hide any controls that runat server depending upon any criteria you like

752043
javassist	cglib
if you need similar runtime compatibility with classes i suggest you take a look at cglib or javassist opensource libraries

union	distinct
union forces a distinct to occur and there s little slower than distinct

752147
union	distinct
union -- yes i need a distinct list

752193
draggable	droppable
you could use the data method on the droppable elements to store a reference to the draggable they ve accepted so far

752193
draggable	droppable
every time you hover a draggable over one of these droppable the system will check to see if that droppable s id is already in its mysite.dropped_items array

752196
button	checkbox
but when i check some checkbox and hit the button after postback all checkbox

multicastdelegate	delegation
is it at all possible to extend delegation multicastdelegate

752475
multicastdelegate	delegation
however every time you create a delegation type that automatically derives from multicastdelegate

752477
hide	show
if you wish to enable disable show hide controls based on the role this would be nothing more than security by obscurity since switching off styles or setting a browser to a specific css file to override what is actually served would easily display all that is secret

edit ant has correctly pointed out that on error goto -1 is a vb.net statement and isn t valid in vb6

752814
getter	setter
the next step might be to use this struct or class in the object itself...but since you re using getter and setter the decision of how to represent it internally will be transparent to the users of the class anyways so this decision will relate more to how complex the class is than anything

752847
hide	show
what i wish to accomplish is use the anchor tag to toggle between the two div tags hide the one and show the other and vice versa

client-side	server-side
since jquery treeview is a client-side component you can t access it from the server-side

753400
getter	setter
but if the data is non-trivial enough that you really do need setter getter then it is non-trivial enough to need error handling as well

753400
getter	setter
so in those cases your getter setter should be returning some kind of error code or doing something else to indicate something bad has happened

753455
objectdatasource	formview
i m using a formview with an objectdatasource and binding using # bind whateverprop - and all of my nullable columns are coming back with default values of the type in them

if a user clicks on a button that does a post lets say it has username and password in the post and those credentials get authenticated successfully

753917
put	get
if i did a redirect to a completely different application so i can t carry session etc and i use a get with the username and password in the querystring i could even use basic encryption if that helps but regardless and then when it gets to the page i check to make sure it came from the page i expected it to come from pull the values from the querystring put them in a session variable and then do a redirect back to the same page removing the querystring values so they can t be viewed by user

753926
put	get
it s not really a good idea to put username and passwords in a get request even encrypted because

753945
hash	salt
also think about using salt hash for the passwords instead of just storing it plaintext if that s not the case already

753945
hash	salt
added as mehrdad correctly comments ...even in case of salt hash it s still vulnerable to replay attacks.

754545
cassini	iis
perhaps testing it on iis if not cassini with a 64bit application pool is causing a context switch somewhere which causes the mock identities if they get assigned as a thread s identity to get marshalled across a boundary like that - the lack of a serializable attribute will probably cause a typeloadexception

754557

we can t tell bind_param that a parameter is a boolean the format string only understand string int double and blob so bind_param will convert the boolean to an int which works for us

755150
getter	setter
by doing this your saving yourself tons of lines with getter and setter in your backingbean

this draggable can be dropped on my droppable time and time again it doesn t get consumed if that makes any sense

755410
draggable	droppable
when a draggable is on top of two droppable currently the jquery behaviour is that the draggable will hit both droppable

755410
draggable	droppable
my expected behaviour the draggable should fall on the first droppable only and should not get triggered for any other subsequent droppable which is around

755410

755805
rss	feed
however testing it out on the phone s built-in rss reader i realize that without the ability to password protect the feed or otherwise restrict access to it i stand little chance of being able to develop this idea further

755805
rss	feed
update i should have explained that i already have placed folder-level permissions on the parent folder which brings up the normal authentication dialog when the feed is viewed in a browser but which just results in a failed update with no explanation or warning in the phone s rss reader and is indistiguishable from the file being missing when i next try and refresh the feed

755806
public	protected
const-ness like access restriction public protected private benefits the programmer more than it assists with optimization

755820
rss	feed
private rss feed

755836

edit my website is using asp.net and there is a rss feed there

756203
rss	feed
i would parse the rss feed of the quote website assuming that it has one and display the quotes that way

756226
rss	feed
first and easiest would be to grab the quote via their rss feed if available

756226
rss	feed
if the site doesn t provide an rss feed you ll need to implement some sort of screen scraping script to grab the relevant portion of the page you want

titlebar	window
without completely understanding everything i was hoping to get and deal with whatever is drawing the window s titlebar something about the rootpane it seems

757088
hide	show	mouseover	mouseout
css contains display none for all submenus and my optimistic idea was simply to show proper ul elements when mouseover is fired on first level entries then to hide them when mouseout is fired on the submenu the ul element

757088
mouseover	mouseenter
no change using mouseover or mouseenter

757135
richfaces	tomahawk
we are currently using myfaces + tomahawk + richfaces + some of our own components but we are at a point in which we can move away from richfaces if needed

the most you ll be able to get is msie firefox opera x.x

757330
getter	setter
besides if you throw another libs into the mix like some json-converting lib or beanmapper or dozer or other bean mapping cloning lib based on getter setter properties you ll have the guarantee that the lib is in sync with the persistence manager both use the getter setter

757356
n-gram	words
for performance reasons index all these words as trigrams or bigrams so that when you are performing a lookup you convert to n-gram and lookup via hashtable or trie

757356
metaphone	soundex
use a phonetic key soundex metaphone to index the words and lookup possible corrections

757371
inherited	subclassing
these classes all inherited from a common base class but that base class doesn t define a couple methods that are common to all subclassing

757781
google-chrome	firefox
one of the great things about web development is that most often when you see a site and think how did they do that it s very easy to look at the code and find out and also to test it out - tools like firebug for firefox the developer tools in ie 8 f12 and google-chrome will all display nicely formatted source and css and will let you modify it in situ

757782
width	height
note no height or width specified

757798
kde	gnome
in fact most of desktop applications web browsers word processors desktop environment itself like windows explorer kde or gnome are written in compiled languages with careful thinking about resources.

757807
width	height
if you really wanted to make it perfect you would need to write some javascript that would read the original picture width and set the ratio accordingly to specify a height

bibtex	latex
then i removed the line and compiled the bibtex again hoping to have a working latex file again

757886
put	get
note in the past the option of ndoc may have seemed more appealing - and some people still use it - but sandcastle seems to be the official and recommended method at this moment especially given that it s reasonably stable and complete enough for almost any purpose. see the sandcastledocs website to get started this was unofficially put together by one of the developers at microsoft i believe

757911
bibtex	latex
i think you are tripping over the multi-pass nature of latex plus bibtex

757911
bibtex	latex
that s why the complete set of steps includes an initial latex call a bibtex call and two follow-up latex calls

757957
put	get
is there any way to put the main.col2 condition in the sub-select which would get rid of the full table scans

post	get
grab the get variable here all within class radiogridadmin as described above in my initial post

758037
superclass	subclassing
it s all about the contract of superclass and about subclassing implementing this contract

758037
superclass	subclassing
in short words it comes to the question if you really can safely use your subclassing as superclass taking into account that superclass is defined by its contract which is not only code

758086
queue	fifo
the simplest way of implementing it is not by recursion but rather with a fifo queue where you add the neighbor elements to the one you are testing at the end and extract the first element from the queue to perform the next check

758130
telerik	radcombobox
btw i m using a telerik radcombobox but this scenario is not specific to the telerik control

vim	emacs
komodo spe vim emacs are all editors ides with python integration and will all work very well - which you prefer depends on your tastes and workflow

758312
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
i prefer to minimize dependencies on 3rd party libs so it s usually boxlayout for dialogs and gridbaglayout for complicated layouts

758352
hide	show
in your system tray icon event handler call show or setvisible true on your window and optionally hide your tray icon

758395
entity-relationship	diagram
this would produce a class or entity-relationship diagram with traceability back to the domain model

758413
folder	directory
one reason is that the app.config file is in your app s folder under the program files directory and everything in program files is read only for standard users by default

758442
postgresql	mysql
a couple of virtual machines or even a single virtual machine for all the products perhaps an ubuntu box for postgresql mysql and a windows 2008 server machine for the remaining products - i like one or two vm s because this is a more portable environment for running the tests when on the road off-site as my laptop would probably crawl to a halt running 8 or 10 small vm s

758485
jsf	seam
you might find it easier to use jsf with seam which simplifies much of how you work with jsf and replaces jsp with facelets which is a great improvement

758491
inherited	properties
the properties of anonymous boxes are inherited from the enclosing non-anonymous box in the example just below the subsection heading anonymous block boxes the one for div

758526
rss	feed
i am looking to test an rss feed i have created and i am looking for some good rss feed applications to test with

758635
post	get
if you are using a post request to submit to the shopping cart a good idea then the post-redirect-get idiom mentioned by bobince will strengthen your application further - the user won t be prompted to resubmit the form if they use the back or forward buttons to get to your shopping cart page

758654
gdal	ogr
many projection libraries such as proj.4 and libraries using it like gdal ogr will allow you to specify an elevation

758761
onresize	onscroll
so far two non-optimal solutions have been to set or to call invalidate during onresize and onscroll

758767

758946
inherited	properties
in the drive s security properties add administrators if it s not already there and in the privileges for administrators give full control and enable all inherited

759012
int	boolean
and occasionally this mixing of int with boolean can come out really handy like this build_assert.h

759014
floating-point	integer
can i compare a floating-point number to an integer

759024
profiling	debugging
a profiling debugger for analyzing code running on a distributed system allowing you to debugging step through these hosts and there network interactions from a single runtime would be really neat and with the popularity of distributed systems is going to be a must

759111
post	get
get and post requests work ok

759114
stdout	stderr
i just redirect stderr and stdout to dev null so your

759145
octal	decimal
the 377 is octal - its decimal value is 255

759150
int	double
as the others have pointed out comparing eg 1.0 1 will work out because the int 1 is type cast to double not float before the comparison

759160
move	drag
how do i move drag a grid panel inside a wpf window

759201
int	double
can a double of a given number of bytes with a reasonable mantissa exponent balance always fully precisely hold the range of an unsigned int of half that number of bytes

759201
int	double
can an eight byte double fully precisely hold the range of numbers of a four byte unsigned int

759202
int	chars
the error message is quite clear you re trying to do a comparison between different types hence the chars varying int notice

759218
int	double
an ieee754 64-bit double can represent any 32-bit int simply because it has 53-odd bits available for precision and the 32-bit int only needs well 32 -

759223
int	double
a float or double is guaranteed to exactly represent any int that does not need to be truncated

759223
int	double
for a double there is 53 bits of precision so that is more than enough to exactly represent any 32 bit int and a tiny statistically speaking proportion of 64 bit ones too

759370
int	double
use of double for intermediate calculations will push all rounding and precision loss out to the conversion back to float or int

759371
mvp	presenter
look into mvp model view presenter

759390
opera	safari
so to complete your list you have dragonfly for opera and webinspector for the browsers based on webkit like safari

759698
put	get
i have my own list that i ll put on the wiki when i get around to reorganizing it

759753
int	chars
if you really want to know the difference cast each pointers to a chars and then to int and then subtract

759753
int	double
casting each pointerpointer to an int and then subtracting gives the same answer as the unecessary double casting above

759818
action-filter	onactionexecuting
you will need to do this either in the action method or perhaps more appropriately in an action-filter or the onactionexecuting etc method s

759819

width	height
issue not able to resize an image to its original height and width

759856
width	height
the image losses its original height width

759897
hide	show
i would get to grips with a javascript library like jquery as it will take care of all the cross-browser issues for you and has such useful methods as toggle to show and hide elements

759897
hide	show
also if you wanted to hide previously show submenus you would use this

759930

760173
post	get
use post to upload and get to download

760187
ienumerable	icollection
the for-loop is a nice alternative but if your ienumerable collection does not implement icollection it is not possible

760207
stdout	stderr
basically you need to redirect both stdout and stderr to your file

760211

hide	show
listing works i extended it to a foldable solution to show hide directory contents

std	ostream
can anyone suggest a way to have a truly null std ostream that avoids doing any work at all on the parameters passed to it with

760397
rss	feed
an rss feed of the last 15 errors

760402
jboss	resin
we support bundled applications servers including tomcat resin jboss and others

760514
getter	setter
i had students in my design patterns class doing it for an assignment adding removing javabean getter and setter

760548
idictionary	icollection
for some reason i was glued to the idea that i wanted to stick with an implementation of icollection that wasn t an idictionary probably because i m refactoring classes that were originally meant to be used with nhibernate mappings

760561
dictionary	map
i would also strongly recommend that you reorder your type parameters - pretty much every dictionary map whatever i ve ever seen with key and value type parameters has put the key type parameter first

760575
int	boolean
you could implement these either as boolean flag columns or have an int column that acts as a bitmask

760631
post	get
before deciding to implement your own protocol take a look at http libraries like libcurl you could make your server use standard http commands like get for download and post for upload

760631
post	get
i m mentioning this because in java you ll probably be able to make a servlet to do exactly the same thing using http get for download and post for upload with less than 100 lines of code

760665
postgresql	mysql
i m testing out dblinq-0.18 and dblinq from svn trunk with mysql and postgresql

760669
codeigniter	cakephp
is this achievable or should i go with cakephp or codeigniter

760717
move	drag
problem when cursor move out of the child view during mouse drag obviously i am not able to track the event and hence i cannot resize the rectangle

760759
stdout	stderr
the server writes stdout and stderr to files maybe in logs

760872
hide	show
of course i could put the 4 steps in one page and show hide but that s not my point with the question

760877
getter	setter
as an aside in c++ it s an especially good idea to give both the getter and setter for a member the same name since in the future you can then actually change the the pair of methods

760888
innodb	myisam
no database guru but have you tried using a different db engine innodb is slow try myisam and making sure the data you are selecting is indexed

760922

from withing a uiviewcontroller that is tied to a uiview drawn in a nib file i try to add another view as a subviews to the first view

760922
uiview	subviews
the uiview shows up and the graphview subviews is instantiated correctly its properties are there and i can access its methods

760932
equals	gethashcode
with nhibernate entities you are meant to override equals and gethashcode

760972
put	get
the above code means get me text of first syslistview32 control hence 1 at the end from application which title starts with windriver and put it in ouputvar variable

761008
bids	ssis
you could possibly even just use ssis package editor in bids itself for the job and incorporate a facility in your application to execute the package

761046
width	height
there doesn t seem to be a drawpoint drawpixel whatnot but instead you can use drawrectangle with width and height set to 1 to draw a single pixel

761130
width	height
after a user inserts the width and height in the textboxes on the ui the size object should be created

761163
postgresql	mysql
in mysql or postgresql

761182
width	height
table-based layout evils aside should i be worried about deprecation of all the width 100 height 100 attributes to html and iframe tags

761208
put	get
i know its something simple i just don t know about so i put up a bid on elance to get someone to solve it for money even

761214
inherited	subclassing
edit on another note i wouldn t even use the phrase subclassing or the inherited phrase to describe classes that are defined to implement an interface

761237
jlist	jlabel
i abhor visual-based gui creator editor software but am getting a little tired of manually instantiating jpanels and boxes and jlabel and jlist etc.

761306
persistent	transient
i would like to know if it is possible to map a transient object to a persistent object

761306
persistent	transient
or something to update the persistent object with the use of an transient object

gridview	sqldatasource
i have an sqldatasource object linked to a gridview which receives data from a database when executed

761310
pull	push
i pull data in and push data to from the following

761311
ant	maven
the advantage here is that you dont get the overhead and transition cost to maven it uses ant targets so will work with your current set up

761328
post	get
unfortunately in many organizations you can t honestly have a post project discussion of what went wrong and how to prevent that next time without getting into a finger-pointing blame session that causes people be quiet rather than get bad marks against them for their performance appraisal

761363
robocopy	xcopy
if i copy xcopy robocopy the files files to the virtual directory s physical directory should i stop and start the web publishing service on the server as part of script

761367
post	get
you should be using a post request rather than a get request if it is important that a certain action changes something on the server

761367
post	get
responses to post requests are never cached although if you do post-redirect-get then the get after it may be but that s another story

761372
richfaces	icefaces
by the way adding ajax to facelets is easy if you use something like richfaces or icefaces

761386
mechanize	hpricot
bankjob uses mechanize hpricot as suggested in other answers to scrape a website with a table in it and produce csv output it also produces ofx which is irrelevant to your need - since it s bank-statement data but the csv should work for any kind of data

761396
put	get
to a person all the development managers wish we would get more qa people rather than configuration management because we have found that qa is extremely valuable to us and configuration management only causes projects to get farther behind while we wait for someone to put the new code out on the release schedule rather than when it is ready to go

761398
children	parent
you could still style this however you want to give it the appearance you want although it may not be as easy if you really are displaying tabular data about the parent and children

761398
children	parent
if changing the code from a table to a list is not possible desired but you have access to the server-side code that presumably generates this table you could at least make things easier then by giving all the children a class with the id of the parent and giving all the parent a common class

761402
opera	firefox
why can t ie work as well as firefox or even opera for god s sake

761440
children	parent
better would be to have the child nodes defined as actually children of the parent td then jquery can simplify things for you

761461
codeigniter	cakephp
i have used codeigniter and cakephp both of which are php mvc frameworks

761472
lisp	smalltalk
other dynamic languages such as common lisp and smalltalk can compete evenly with static languages in many use cases because dynamic lookups modifications are more controlled

761542
nunit	moq
i have been writing unit tests using nunit and moq with my silverlight code for some time now

761573
migrate	upgrade
this also gives you the ability to replicate migrate or upgrade the machine without reconfiguring and reinstalling

761573
ubuntu	debian
also run your lamp configuration on an operating system without a gui debian ubuntu fedora etc

761581
postgresql	mysql
since postgresql is a lot more sane than mysql there are not that many tricks to report on

761596
codeigniter	kohana
and a thing about codeigniter i asked some time ago people about it and most says that kohana based on codeigniter is better

761602

761849
hide	show
for the page that initially show the control the javascript in the control works fine but for the page that initially hide the control the javascript doesn t work

761854
public	protected
resharper suggests changing the accessibility of a public constructor in an abstract class to protected but it does not state the rationale behind this

761864
public	protected
therefore the only types that should have access to a constructor are its derived types and hence protected makes much more sense than public

761932
csv	tsv
i need to be able to parse both csv and tsv files

761938
rss	feed
also i suggest subscribing to ado.net related rss feed

761965
csv	tsv
in a well-formed csv or tsv file the number of commas or tabs respectively per line should be constant no variation at all

761991
put	get
i m using ibm s .net classes ibm.wmq to put a request message and then get a response message

762063
drawrect	touchesmoved
however this is still calling drawrect within touchesmoved which is giving me the effect i want but is way too slow on the iphone

apache	lighttpd
lighttpd for video instead of apache

762080
apache	lighttpd
lighttpd for video instead of apache

762096
comparator	comparable
if all objects in the graph implement comparable - you can just call comparator

762116
mktime	strtotime
you can look into using strtotime instead of mktime

762189
joystick	keyboard
poll the keyboard joystick whatever and cache the last direction entered by the user

762221
hash	md5
function genkey given a string q this may be a md5 or sha hash and a seed string the function must generate a new string p

762239
cassini	iis
can anyone explain this and preferably suggest a way i can have the same web.config file to run the service in cassini and iis

762239
cassini	iis
cassini therefore runs under a domain account and iis 5.1 under a local account

762239
cassini	iis
the situation sounds similar as fails when the server is running under a domain account which is my situation with cassini - running as my normal domain user account and works when running under a local account which is my situation with iis

762308
apache	mod-jk
if you have the capability to do so i would recommend using either mod-jk or mod-proxy-ajp to pass requests from apache to jboss

762340
feedback	review
they are doing his annual review and want feedback on the product of his work for the last year

762372
width	height
could you not just expose 2 properties - width and height from your model along with a size property

762372
width	height
the width and height would appear in your binding expressions and then when you want to get the size property it initialises based on these two fields

762377
stdout	stderr
or first join stderr and stdout and then grep out those specific errors

762378
cassini	iis
are the iis and cassini servers running on the same box

762394
width	height
i know the height width is available via window.innerheight and window.innerwidth

762416

762469
versioning	upgrade
not all users will necessarily be in a position to upgrade some users may be accessing your site from their workplace where the it department mandates a particular versioning of ie

762524
getter	setter
anyhow you can add the intercepting code to getter and setter of each property too

762592
width	height
a width height measurement of 0x0 is often indicative of the component in question not having been fully laid out at the time of the reading including child components

762614
put	get
to hopefully get around this i put all the data that needed to be decompressed into a memorystream and then read to end with a deflatestream

762640
stdout	stderr
you could read the stdout stderr of which into a variable or an array using backticks rather than checking for an exit code

762677
accessor	properties
this doesn t work because the verifyget method needs to know the return type of the properties accessor and i can t figure out any way to insert it at runtime you ll notice my lame attempt to use object which crashed and burned

762696
wordpress	joomla
the only other option i can think of is to simply replace your existing cms with a more robust one like drupal joomla wordpress which you could then extend with modules

762707
teamcity	nant
teamcity supports nant msbuild ant and am sure any other build platform you can install on on the buildagents

762764
put	get
my model expects a blob so when i put in the image as img then it throws a fit and i get

762791
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari which behaves the same is trying to parse it as an html document but fails because it is non-whitespace text content outside the document element html which is not allowed

762791
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and ie manage to apply their â œfix up text outside any elementâ broken-html-rule to save you but google-chrome doesn t

762791
google-chrome	safari
but beware the mimetype parameter is not supported by google-chrome or safari

762805
getter	setter
- i like this pattern for setter getter

762846
width	height
when the browser s html parser sees a canvas element of a given width height it needs to allocate an onscreen pixmap to cover that area

762873

763119
bazaar	git
sounds like a distributed version control system like git or bazaar might be what you are looking for you can keep all of your code locally setup the repository on your external storage device but you still get the option of branching and merging

763137
multiplying	add
in 32 bit integer math basic math operations of add and multiplying are computed implicitly mod 2 32 meaning your results will be the lowest order bits of the add or multiplying

763137
modulus	bigint
if you want to compute the result with a different modulus you certainly could use any number of bigint classes in different languages

763137
multiplication	modulo
but i ve been told that there are special tricks for efficiently computing a b mod c when c is of the form 2 n -1 or 2 n +1 that don t use 64 bit math or a bigint library and are quite efficient more so than an arbitrary modulo evaluation and also properly compute cases which would normally overflow a 32 bit int if you were including the intermediate multiplication

763166
16-bit	64bit
this can require 64bit computations or you can split a and b into 16-bit parts and compute on 32-bits

763178
mbunit	nunit
and does support nunit mbunit and xunit.net

awt	swing
no gwt doesn t support layout managers from swing awt

763267
awt	swing
swing awt is pixel-based while gwt renders to html

763267

my approach is a bit more generic putting the filtering parameters in tables and then using grouping by having and count to filtering the results

763723
bitblt	gdi
to get the lightening fast drawing speeds you really need gdi and bitblt which is a serious pain in the but to use with gdi+ especially if you are in managed code hard to tell if you are using managed c++ or straight c++

763764
apache	nginx
it seems to be common wisdom that if you are deploying django on an apache server then you should still put an nginx server in front of the application to serve static files at which nginx is more performant

763764
apache	nginx
if instead of apache for the django code i would like to use nginx + fastcgi to host the django application is there any reason to configure a second nginx install to sit in front of the nginx server that is serving dynamic content to handle static content as well as redirection to the dynamic content

scheme	prolog
not everybody is comfortable expressing their ideas in an object oriented design say c# or java as functions and closures scheme as logical derivations prolog -- there are some problems for which it fits

764196
ant	maven
if you have problems with doing that in maven itself try using ant create two different deploy tasks one per server and another task which has them as dependencies

764196
ant	maven
done this you need to integrate the new ant tasks into maven which isn t difficult at all using the antrun plugin

764209

prop	each
in our display object list program each character prop and npc has two parts a resource database assistant and a character instance

764972
bash	zsh
you can t expect zsh to be able to run the bash commands in your .bashrc so you should convert it into a new .zshrc instead of trying to run .bashrc from .zshrc or copying the former into the latter

764972
bash	zsh
though - and i d first misread this part of your question - you shouldn t experience errors from bash when running your .bashrc unless you put zsh commands in there

764972

slideup	slidedown
it seems to use target s initial position where it was before the expansion contraction which makes sense since both events are initiated at the same time but even when i try to pause scrollto and wait until the slideup slidedown transition is over it still behaves the same

766451
opera	safari
if i remember correctly some older versions of safari and maybe opera didn t support todataurl but the more recent versions do

766459
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
normally if you get the style to work in both firefox and google-chrome safari ie is only a few corrections away of being correct

766477
solaris	aix
however the function is only available on linux and i need equivalent implementations on windows aix solaris and hpux any suggestions

766478
put	get
when you take the object out of the collection you get the integer that you put in

766479
inherited	properties
multiple inherited makes it easier to compose classes from small mixin base classes that implement functionality and have properties to remember state

766491
firefox	safari
there is a great site position is everything that details how firefox ie and safari conform to standard css

766515
children	parent
changing the number of children updated the counter cache as it should and removing the counter_cache true from the child would let me update the value on the parent

766574
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
update i deleted the clientaccesspolicy.xml file and kept just the crossdomain.xml file in place and bingo everything worked

766580
serializable	deserialization
for example a large part of our system based on hadoop is based on a mapper that handles serializable and deserialization of items to json and applies a number of processors that each take an item of content and either modify and return it or return null to reject

766587
rss	feed
i thought about using kodak s image of the day rss feed but i m having quite a time figuring out how to parse it

766587
rss	feed
i also tried the astronomy picture of the day via this rss feed but it s just the original page s html stuffed into cdata.

766595
ssl	https	tunnel	packets
for example you could tell the ssl tunnel to listen on port 443 https and forward all decrypted packets to port 80 http

766614
listview	gridview
the listviewupdatedeventargs object that s passed in to the itemupdated event handler for the listview does not have a keys collection like the gridviewupdatedeventargs object passed into the rowupdated event handler for a gridview

766621
for-loop	loops
merge sort algorithm aside nested for-loop with iterator s is just as valid as nested for loops with two variables i and j

766629
getter	setter
i like how groovy makes all of your instance variables and class variables public and writes getter and setter on your behalf

766646
getter	setter
i use netbeans which has tools to write getter setter auto implement abstract methods and various other shortcuts

766648
versioning	upgrade
the lack of backwards compatibility makes 3.0 a much harder sell than a seamless upgrade because you have to adjust your thinking and discard some programming techniques to use the new versioning

766649
getter	setter
in this kind of situation an ide which can write the getter and setter for you can be your friend

766649
getter	setter
i find that having to write the getter and setter are the most repetitive and un-interesting part of writing new classes

766649
getter	setter
with an ide like eclipse which can automatically generate the getter and setter for you it can reduce the pain of writing the redundant code

766664
getter	setter
but as others mentioned eclipse and netbeans will easily create the getter setter so if you don t have to do anything special with them then it should be pretty easy

766664
getter	setter
i tend to put my properties in their own class which is just getter setter then i don t have to look at the verboseness as well as equals and hash methods if needed then in my other classes i just use that and hide the boring extra coding

766683
getter	setter
no getter no setter no hassle

766722
cvs	svn
one of the great things about tools like cvs and svn is that it is quite easy for developers to end up with an unofficial personal branch from things that are not properly checked in merged etc

766810
libjpeg	libpng
so far i ve made sure i ve installed libpng and libjpeg with darwinports i m running on os x leopard but that doesn t seem to do the trick

766838
memcpy	malloc
man memcpy man malloc etc

766912
unsigned	short
i could just pass the number pf_packet represents it s an unsigned short

766917
versioning	upgrade
i ve found that vendors generally provide a reasonably straightforward upgrade path from versioning to versioning and upgrading becomes more problematic if the upgrade must skip a few versioning .net framework 1.1 - 3.5 sp1

766917
versioning	upgrade
if these upgrade are not done the new application being developed is limited to using old versioning and consequently will add to the time and cost of future upgrade

766936
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
client application has some field number a and number b and label for result and some possible actions represented by the buttons add subtract multiplying divide etc

767060
int	chars
if you have a very straight forward method signatures methods that takes and returns primitive types such as int chars void .

767060
boost	stl
however if your class methods uses modern c++ programming techniques such as boost shared pointers and stl containers then it is a very different story

767107
innodb	myisam
personally i d use the innodb plugin and the file per table option but you could also use myisam if you fully understand its characteristics and limitations

767132
perforce	svn
most of them have a way to handle different versions of a project for example perforce svn etc

767174
for-loop	loops
i don t see incrementing iter or it in the outer for-loop invalidating the logic in the later for loops the point in 1

767185
cvs	svn
based on your experience of a scm tool svn git cvs etc can you please tell me what features from below list is supported by that scm tool

767250
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
however on vista it throws argumentexception s and invalidoperationexception s on certain files and on win7 it throws fileformatexception s and ioexception s

767268
super	self
i believe calling super a self .__init__ will call the superclass of a which is object

767276
hash	salt
i know we hash and salt passwords but that s another story as we do not really need password originals

767300
hash	salt
the best scenario is to hash the email address with salt

767328
children	parent
changes made to a parent process only propagate to newly-created children

767352
width	height
next up is all the advert details fetched out image location as an url height and width of the advert - and lest step calls a separate stored procedure to test if the advert is allowed to be shown is the campaign expired by either date or number of adverts allowed to show

767371
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
nunit or mbunit instead of mstest

767371
mbunit	nunit
with the given oss alternatives subversion nunit mbunit i don t see any disadvantages using them

767398
gridex	janus
i ve been working with janus gridex for web for a few days

767446
goto	break
to be sure there is still goto in java - it s now called break continue and throw .

767448
getter	setter
1 user object should be plain object with just getter setter methods this would facilitate passing object across tiers - from data access tier to business tier to web tier

767453
profiling	benchmarking
if you re trying to measure your code execution there are profiling or benchmarking for java

767461
expander	grid
the reason that you can t simply use a grid or dock panel with the textblocks in to control the alignment is because the default template of expander left aligns the header content instead of allowing it to stretch

767553
allocator	stl
i also was using a lot of stl so i created a custom allocator google for stl custom allocator - there are loads of links

767621
packets	multicast
it s possible that your switch is multicast aware but if igmp is disabled it won t notice if any attached hardware subscribes to a particular multicast group so it wouldn t forward those packets

767651
versioning	upgrade
having put a lot of faith in jquery already especially their techniques for cross-browser compatibility i will either upgrade to versioning 1.3 and use their function providing that upgrading doesnâ t cause too many problems or use this suggested method directly in my code

767697
rtsp	rtmp
afaik it is not possible to consume an rtsp feed in the flash player so i m thinking that we would need some sort of a converter on the server that takes the rtsp stream and converts it to rtmp so we can consume the feed in our flex app

767719
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to tomcat 6.0 or downgrade the servlet jsp jstl versioning

767818
google-chrome	firefox
use the title attribute to get your desired result on ie firefox google-chrome

767931
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
do different browsers firefox safari ie opera have different limits on the length of the name attribute of form elements

767962
post	get
my rule of thumb is to use ajax when the context of the view isn t changing but a full request get post when a new action new context is invoked

767969
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can use the mouseenter mouseleave events to do this

767970
gridview	objectdatasource
if you use the objectdatasource as your gridview s data source you don t have to do those code-behind methods - it s all handled for free

767980
gif	png
does it become a gif png etc

768009
vb.net	vb6
this served as well when ms decided to axe vb6 in favor of vb.net

768107
tablelayoutpanel	numericupdown
the program consist of one form with one tablelayoutpanel tablelayoutpanel1 one numericupdown coins and one button flip

768237
portrait	landscape
for example a device may be designed with a portrait square or landscape screen

768237
portrait	landscape
this will reset the device back to portrait when your application gets focus if anyone changes it to landscape

768268
hash	md5
is there a way to calculate the md5 hash of a file before the upload to the server using javascript

768272
quicksort	mergesort
functional quicksort and mergesort

768272
quicksort	mergesort
here s a linked list with quicksort and mergesort methods written in a functional style

768278
gwt	icefaces
there are a couple of frameworks which implement this securer server driven ria one is it mill toolkit based on gwt and icefaces should also be one to my knowledge

768288
hash	md5
there is a couple scripts out there on the internet to create an md5 hash

768310
decoder	encoder
if this is how your data is encoded there are plenty of snippets around that will tell you how to decoder it and many languages have the encoder and decoder built in or in an included library

768315
post	get
the system of adding page parameters to a url is know as http get as distinct from http post and some others less commonly used

768318
short	base
in short it s impossible to guarantee consistency with a large enough code base

int	chars
and the people who read his description assumed that by type he meant the actual programming language type int float zero-terminated string chars pointer

768394
g++	gcc
you can use make to compile your c and c++ programs by calling gcc or g++ in your makefile to do all the compilation and linking steps allowing you to do all these steps with one simple command

768401
stdout	stderr
- supports redirection of stdout and stderr

768406
entities	entitymanager
try to use entitymanager s flush method between persisting part and fetching car entities

768455
int	chars	16-bit	64bit	unsigned	short
the integral types are byte short int and long whose values are 8-bit 16-bit 32-bit and 64bit signed two s-complement int respectively and chars whose values are 16-bit unsigned int representing utf-16 code units

768476
min	max
then look at min max and average recordsize columns

768483
gmail	hotmail
for example if you have say 50 aol users 20 gmail users 20 hotmail 5 yahoo 5 misc

768483
gmail	hotmail
- you could argue you are willing to risk that 5 of your emails are rejected - so take the minimum size allowed by aol gmail hotmail and yahoo

768500
pyodbc	adodbapi
i ve used pymssql and adodbapi and when those threw exceptions created issues i swapped out the code and replaced it with pyodbc and it either fixed the problem or gave better error messages so i could debug faster

768527
pull	push
your other option would be running a database server on the machine creating web services that run locally and push pull the data from the database and then call those services from your flash application

768560
mouse	keyboard
therefore if your event handler is intensive when the index changes it will slow down the scrolling as it will run each time the selected index changes each time your scroll with the mouse or keyboard

768594
post	get
if you need to post the data not use get one easy option is to create a form element on the fly attach input elements with the values you need and submit it

768621
post	get
edit i did finally get this working and decided to write a short blog post with complete source code

768641
post	get
i m trying to do an asynchronous http s post on .net compact framework and i can t seem to get it working

768641
post	get
the exact same code works perfectly when i do a simple http get but when i throw in some post params everything fails

768661
post	get
if you happen to be able to sanitize and post the code we might be able to get a bit more insight but realistically i can t see a need for it

768684
width	height
if you have tables like standarea area in m 2 standsize length width height etc - then you would have objects in your model to match these standarea standsize - these could both extend a common base class standdata

768726
profiler	gprof
gprof - profiler

768783
min	max
i m positively scared that by the end of the project i may end up with handling with very a high number of fields - and for each i would have to make sure they follow a very similar set of constraint and behaviours for example i want them to be bounded between a min and a max

768783
getter	setter
i want to be able to increment and decrement both without going through a setter and getter

768783
getter	setter
getter and four setter and maybe a couple resetters too

768783
getter	setter
now i hit in this problem while plugging field into gamecharacter most java textbooks say that each class should have private fields with public getter and setter

768783
getter	setter
are the advantages of encapsulation so massive that i should go ahead and have getter getter and setter getter and so on.

768790
google-chrome	firefox
i have a fairly simple crud web application c# asp.net that runs fine in firefox ie7 and google-chrome

768797
getter	setter
for example if you have strength you could have a strengthmanipulation class that is initialized to a specific player object and then provides getter setter all with appropriate validation and exceptions and perhaps things like calculating strength with bonuses etc

768797
getter	setter
when you access a field in vb at least in old vbs you usually call a property getter and setter and vb simply hides the call for you

768826
getter	setter
it sounds like your main complaint isn t so much with the abstraction of setter getter methods but with the language syntax for using them

768826
getter	setter
direct field access is fine until you need to switch to a getter or setter and then you will have some refactoring to do possibly ok if you control the whole codebase

768840
public	protected
as long as types remain unchanged in their public or protected layout and method signatures are not changed adding methods or types is fine the jit should be able to link the dll just fine

768850
udp	tcp
indy delphi is a library tcomponent for delphi representing the true power of winsock.it provides components for tunelling tcp udp connections and much more

768959
post	get
assuming of course we re working with html forms and get post data backend language agnostic

768974
floating-point	integer
for example a generic structure for adding numbers would not care whether given floating-point or integer arguments but would have difficulty adding q + pi

769008
rss	feed
i subscribe to a number of rss feed mostly from within my own timezone uk currently gmt+1 a.k.a bst

769008
rss	feed
when i load up my rss reader in the mornings it has gathered all the nz news at once normally around 100 items and i feel compelled either to read them all or to mark them all as read to feed my need for zero-unread-count

769008
rss	feed
i figured a good solution to this would be to time delay the rss feed somehow so i would be drip-fed the stories at their time +12 hours so i could read them through the day as they come in

769017
getter	setter
create a class with those members protect the setter or set them from the constructor and provide getter methods

769043
getter	setter
you could define a bean to hold the values fields with getter setter or use a map for the values

769065
post	put
there are some tools apart from selenium that can help with testing an atom service - have a look at jmeter for example which can help a lot with encoding the put post requests

769129
stdout	stderr
redirects â stderr â to â stdout â at the end makes the command run in background

769130
stdout	stderr
if you want to pipe stderr or stdout to a file you can do that easily

769157
onfocus	onblur
onblur is the opposite of onfocus

769158
stdout	stderr
every unix program has two output streams stdout and stderr

769158
stdout	stderr
the 2 redirects stderr file descriptor 2 to a file represented in this case by 1 which tells the shell to use file descriptor 1 which is stdout

769175
hide	show
is there a way to force a gtk.window object to ignore the window manager s show hide commands such as iconify and show desktop

769265
getter	setter
are the advantages of encapsulation so massive that i should go ahead and have getter getter and setter getter and so on.

769265
getter	setter
imo encapsulation has nothing to do with wrapping a getter setter around a private field

769265
getter	setter
the problem with getter setter is that they create overly tight coupling between the object with those methods and the rest of the system

769265
getter	setter
one of the advantages of real encapsulation is that it reduces the need for getter and setter decoupling your object from the rest of the system in the process

769300
ftp	telnet
indy is a winsock wrapper that provides blocking socket behavior for network internet programming ftp telnet http etc.

769309
pop-up	dialog
when i call a refresh webbrowser.refresh a dialog box pop-up to confirm

769357
regasm	tlbexp
yes you will need to set the comvisible attribute to true and then register the assembly using regasm or regsvcs along with tlbexp

769371
disk	ram
session data is stored in the ram of the server if you have a high traffic site that is going to get full real quick and the last thing you want is that data being swapped to disk

769417
getter	setter
in this way the backing collection is never instantiated if the getter is called without the setter ever being called

769432
httphandler	httpmodule
i ve used both httpmodule ihttpmodule interface and httphandler ihttphandler interface and it occurs to me that i could implement this using either mechanism

769448
httphandler	httpmodule
as stated here httpmodule are simple classes that can plug themselves into the request processing pipeline whereas httphandler differ from httpmodule not only because of their positions in the request processing pipeline but also because they must be mapped to a specific file extensions

769460
post	get
another question to ask oneself is should this resource really be served through get or should it go through post

769460
post	get
post will not get cached

769473
multiplication	modulo
constant space with no additions subtractions multiplication divisions modulo or arithmetic negations

769513
equals	gethashcode
you only need to override gethashcode on reference types if you override equals

769513
equals	gethashcode
if two objects are equals as per equals you need to guarantee that they ll have the same hash code with gethashcode so you should override it

769529
subtract	add
so if i hit 8 on the number pad i don t want numpad8 i want the int value 8 that i can add or subtract or whatever

769547
equals	gethashcode
as for the other questions reed actually beat me to the punch re gethashcode and equals

769588
int	chars
in order to obtain its numerical valaue you should find the chars for the key that was pressed then parse it from a chars to an int

769624
subtract	add
so i create two classes add and subtract

769642
subtract	add
you can expose an interface imathoperation for example with a single method such as compute and then specify types implementing the interface add subtract etc in the di framework config file

769646
firefox	safari
also i m not sure if text-indent works in ie--i m currently on a mac and it works with firefox and safari

769656
jsf	seam	jar	war
i have a fairly typical javaee application composed using ejb3 seam components spring beans and jsf all packaged into several jar and war files inside an ear file

769658
scheme	prolog
what is the general idea of using breadth-first over the default depth-first search scheme in prolog

769683
postgresql	mysql
what s the alternative to show tables from mysql in postgresql

769686
width	height
and the width 2 and height 2 of map will product the following

769686
width	height
granted i have to know the width height of the map in order to make sense of the file

769692
spaces	delimiter
this is part of a process that reads in a spaces delimiter record and writes out a fixed format record

769693
ftell	fread
you will be throwing aways niceties of ftell fread but it will skip a layer of indirection if read throughput is really important

769752
disk	ram
you may want to do a more comprehensive performance analysis running the both programs with different input sizes from different devices a ram disk would be good and multiple times in a row

769768
super	extends
there s some restrictions on what you can use extends and super for in this fashion

769807
fputcsv	fgetcsv
for php use build in fgetcsv fputcsv functions

769827
comparator	comparable
as long as your property class is comparable using the default equality comparator you should be able to take the set union and assign it to the properties collection

769844
versioning	upgrade
does anyone who has already been down the upgrade path from older versioning of browserlauncher have any advice on potential gotchas

769859
post	get
now if you re asking for prevention of duplicate submit the standard way is the post redirect get pattern

769920
for-loop	loops
one of the most obvious primitives there is the parallel for-loop - looks sort of like a for-loop but tries to execute loops in parallel

769943
put	get
finally get a computer and take it apart and put it back together again

770009
vb.net	vb6
for the same reason vb6 programmers needed to understand the windows api to get anything done and vb.net and c# programmers need to at least know what msil looks like you should be familiar enough with javascript to understand what jquery is doing

770044
jquery	simplemodal
it opens a client-side jquery popup using simplemodal the popup itself still needs some work

770047
width	height
most height width properties on tags assume you are talking about pixels so it doesn t know what your character means

770207
tcheckbox	tlistbox
add a tlistbox tcheckbox tedit to the form and run the application

770267
stdout	stderr
the construct is shorthand for that is it redirects both stdout and stderr into the pipeline

770337
post	get
let me know if you manage get this work together as i am myself looking into this subject i actually found this post looking for this answer myself p

770361
perforce	svn
writing a wrapper is a good idea anyways as it gives us the option flexibility to swap the vc system out with svn or git why you would if you can use perforce i don t know...

770367
cvs	svn
svn provides the version number as a macro like cvs

770374
dlsym	dlopen
do you mean dynamically loading libraries using dlopen and dlsym and so on

770401
profiling	debugging
to get the dissassembly window go to debugging | windows | dissassembly i m using the c# developer profiling

770403
rss	feed
it s actually an rss aggregator but since all sharepoint lists have built-in rss feed you can use it just as well to aggregate the sharepoint lists from the different sites

770410
ant	maven
you could also do a similar sort of thing with ant or another tool but this is what i have done using maven

770414
submit	submission
this is probably happening due to an error in the submission handler code - safari will submit the form as usual if there is an exception there

770436
hide	show
i thought about a bunch of panels or divs that i could hide show but not sure i really like that solution

770438
inherited	subclassing
the com.xxx.domain.model.scheme class is a mapped subclassing entity of the abstract fund entity on a single_table inherited hierarchy and i m getting this error for all entities on the hierarchy

770451
post	get
uris addressability and the use of http get and post

770469
uiview	subviews
the main wrapper view is a subclass of uiview and it contains a row of buttons that are added as subviews

770523
single-quotes	double-quotes
single-quotes and double-quotes

770543
typedef	struct
the library allocates and frees memory for an internal struct - which is hidden from the client using a typedef

770544
ant	maven
you can set it up in your ant script we don t use maven for our projects and it bumps the version number automatically

770552
gif	png
the problem sounds like the image is too big in terms of file-size have you tried other image formats mainly gif or jpeg or the other png format png-8 or png-24

770566
typedef	struct
we can treat them as abstract data types or objects if you like and define a typedef ed struct disc program track say to represent each one

770597
inherited	subclassing
another option is to subclassing page and then make your pages inherited from it so you ve got one place with all common functionality

770626
tapestry	wicket
for java take a look at struts2 spring mvc tapestry wicket etc

770642
superclass	subclassing
in objective c if you are subclassing something and are planning to override a method on the superclass should you re-declare the superclass method in your subclassing interface

770685
serializable	deserialization
one problem of this approach is that xml-rpc doesn t support any authentication system and has some lack of performances in the serializable deserialization between the object notation and the xml representation

770691
postgresql	mysql
one thing i like about postgresql over mysql is that it has a slightly more open licensing policy

770770
tail	lsof
perl xargs lsof find grep bash tar gzip tr tail diff patch and bc

770784
portrait	landscape
my aim was to get the application functioning in both landscape and portrait mode and all i could figure out to do it was this code below

770784
portrait	landscape
the app was working fine in portrait but when switched to landscape the text wouldn t expand to the right to fill up the additional space

770790
folder	directory
unfortunately that directory where tomcat is located is in another user s home folder 1 to which i have ony read access

770792
cdr	cons
define z cons car x cdr y has allocated a new cons cell for the head of z

770805
readonly	temporary
this temporary removes the readonly protection for the memory where the iat resides

770883
hash	md5
you need to md5 hash the email address and then put it into a gravatar url

770883
hash	md5
if you want those random drawings that appear you can use an md5 hash to get them

770885
cdr	cons
after define z cons car x cdr y z holds a brand new cons with the same as x and the same car as x and the same cdr as y

770885
cdr	cons
after define v cons cdr x cdr y v holds a brand new cons whose car is the same value as the cdr of x

770885
cdr	cons
the very same cons cell as cdr x

770896
ready	each
i think we should get ready status from ajax call before starting making another call to server except you were creating a new ajax object for each call but i could be wrong

770921
hash	md5
md5 was only broken in the sense that there are algorithms that given a bunch of data a additional data b can be generated to create a desired hash

770923
hash	md5
if you care at all about security it would be better to choose an unbroken hash algorithm such as one of the sha-2 family sha-1 has also been weakened though not broken as badly as md5 is

770923
hash	salt
you can mitigate this attack by storing the password on your server hash with a random salt

770923
hash	salt
you store the pair on the server and send the salt to the client so that it can compute hash password+salt to use in place of the password in the protocol you mention

770923
hash	md5
while the current attack against md5 may not work against the protocol you describe md5 has been severely compromised and a hash will only ever get weaker never stronger

770948
hash	md5
md5 provide more collision than sha which mean someone can actually get same hash from different word but it s rarely

770964
glassfish	weblogic
in an app server such as glassfish weblogic etc spring can use the jta transaction manager

770987
vim	emacs
edit of course some text editor vim emacs mcedit etc is needed

771012
multiplying	addition
the scaling multiplying by begin-end seems to work correctly but the addition of begin does not seem to be returned

771015
centos	linux
etc. my platform is linux based centos 5 with apache 2 and php

771026
lisp	scheme
it uses common lisp which is slightly different from scheme in some aspects but you should be able to get by with it

771032
profiling	instrumentation
a profiling should do the trick or you could build a test version with some instrumentation

771037
hash	md5
presidential election in a file with the md5 hash value 3d515dead7aa16560aba3e9df05cbc80

771037
hash	md5
the md5 hash value is worthless as a checksum because too many different files give the same result

771044
hash	md5
in your example the hash would be of md5 message + time + md5 password and you could safely store md5 password in your database

771122
width	height
the position of a control is within the client area of the parent so first we need to get the width and height of the parent window

771122
width	height
then we get the width and height of the control

771126
for-loop	loops
even if you re not familiar with ruby s c internals it s pretty clear that this function has a for-loop iterating upward to check that the type of all the arguments is t_module and then uses a while loops iterating downward to actually include the modules - so the modules in include x y z would actually be included in the order z y x

771139
ubuntu	linux
i usually prefer linux for programming i program in django on ubuntu

771149
vmware	virtualbox
using vmware or virtualbox you could set up a shared folder so both the virtual instance and linux can look at the same file to test the website locally

771163
vim	emacs
i will admit my bias i use os x i like linux i use vim i like emacs sometimes

771163
vim	emacs
the definitive text editors for linux are vim and emacs both of which are quite often used from the command-line but both of which have quite wonderful graphical versions

771163
vim	aquamacs	vim	emacs	emacs	aquamacs
i personally am a vim man but with a gui that suits my native environment os x i really like emacs well aquamacs especially for perl

771163
vim	emacs
i personally find vim easier to use both as a command line editor and as an ide whereas i never got the feel for emacs as a command line editor

771163
vim	emacs
as a bonus both emacs and vim are readily avaliable for windows and are almost ubiquitous on unix-based platforms

771163
vim	emacs
emacs is open source under the gnu gpl and vim is open source under a charityware license that asks you to feed the children in uganda but that is still very gpl-like

771163
vim	emacs
eclipse is a full-blown ide unlike vim and emacs which have little overhead and allow you to write a quick shell script as easily as a large application and some find that a bit cumbersome for their work but it suits others very well

771165
folder	directory
put the appengines_utilities folder in your application directory the directory that contains your app.yaml file

771188
codeigniter	cakephp	extjs	mootools
moreover you could learn using framework if you have a time be it css framework blueprint 960 etc php framework cakephp codeigniter etc and ajax framework mootools yui extjs etc

771236
children	parent
when i tried this very reluctantly see below as to why it really fell over there were relationships in my l2s entity pointing to children and then the child pointing back to the parent and obviously when enumerating for building the wcf object it could not traverse the tree infinitely in this fashion and to the best i remember it resulted in an overflow exception so what i am basically saying is beware if you go down this road

771246
opera	firefox
use as many browser platforms for testing as you can under linux firefox opera konqueror

771267
getter	setter
so what you might do is on your own custom subclass of exception databaseexception add a triggeringsqlstatement member with a getter and setter and then at the place where you attempt to execute the statement catch the original exception from postgresql create a new databaseexception set the triggeringsqlstatement to be the statement you just executed and call initcause on the databaseexception to set the exception caught from postgresql as the cause of your exception

771332
profiling	debugging
this allows you to build a nicer api improves testability and add hooks for debugging logging profiling

771334
range	max	range	min	min	max
imagine for a range of values you want the min and max returning but you also wish to return the initial data no summary of data

771486
stdout	stderr
see how do i save or redirect stdout and stderr into different files

771505
put	get
put the names in both places clarity is the reward you get for the task of maintaining the signatures in two places

771623
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
we use a couple of different machine images with ie6 ie7 ie8 ff2 ff3 google-chrome opera safari for windows installed on them

771662
expression-blend	silverlight
have a look at jesse liberty s silverlight video tutorial series which includes a couple of videos on expression-blend

771789
vsto	add-in
when creating an vsto outlook add-in there are some restrictions which are a bit annoying

771789
vsto	add-in
maybe an alternate way of creating an add-in without using vsto

771789
vsto	add-in
if i remember correct there are ways of creating add-in by using some different technology then vsto but which one and what are the differences

771794
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	bubble-sort	heapsort	bubble-sort
so this comparer can be used with bubble-sort as well as with quicksort heapsort or any other sort algorithm

771818
versioning	upgrade
you didn t mention your visual studio versioning but if it s 2005 you might want to consider an upgrade to 2008

771825
int	double
the call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties system.math.round double int and system.math.round decimal int

771829
int	double
the problem is that you make an int division results also in an int and a int can be implicitly converted to both double and decimal

771856
integer	unsigned
yes it s safe indeed it s the most effective way of converting a byte into an effectively unsigned integer

771857
teamcity	nant
i have a nant build file set up which works fine from the cmd line but not in teamcity

771892
quicksort	heapsort
average asymptotic order of quicksort is o nlogn and it s usually more efficient than heapsort due to smaller constants tighter loops

771980
post	get
i have post this question before but cannot get a answer so i post it again.is about the movieplayer sample download from iphone developer site when i press the done button come with the movie player control mode the movie was finish and exit to main view at the same time the movieplaybackdidfinish function have been called however when i play the movie again the player screen keep blinking how to prevent this

772003
ubuntu	debian
ps yes i know it just works with debian ubuntu distros -

772009
getdate	dateadd
select date from table where date dateadd d -7 getdate

772009
getdate	dateadd
select date from table where dateadd d 7 date getdate

772009
getdate	dateadd
ck s correct but it should also be noted that the first can be faster because dateadd d -7 getdate is a constant expression it only needs to be evaluated once no matter the number of rows while dateadd d 7 date in the second needs to be evaluated for each row

772013
min	max
the same logic applies if you want to use having clauses on max min etc.

772107
getter	setter
i m trying to get all properties from a type but using typedescriptor.getproperties thistype will only supply me with properties that has both setter and a getter

772111
postgresql	mysql
i am contemplating a switch from mysql to postgresql

772111
postgresql	mysql
see also how different is postgresql to mysql

772111
postgresql	mysql
see also migrate from mysql to postgresql

772162
postgresql	mysql
also converting from mysql to postgresql on the postgresql wiki

772170
postgresql	mysql
basically postgresql is pretty strictly ansi mysql isn t

772170
postgresql	mysql
i d strongly suggest getting your mysql to as strict an ansi compliance as possible before converting to postgresql then checking for any warnings when you run your applications

772196
postgresql	mysql
although bad form in mysql in postgresql an inner join without an on clause can t happen use cross join or the like

772211
springsource	grails
in order of prevalence and support the option with the most commercial support available documentation books and jobs is the plain servlet framework one --and then grails which is owned and supported by springsource a major player on java frameworks

772214
put	get
you have to put the inotifypropertychanged in the viewmodel to get commandsink to work

772216
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
btw whats the difference between wsdl.exe and svcutil.exe

772226
folder	directory
allow directory browsing in iis and download the root folder

772245
vmware	esx
vmware esx is the heavy for-pay solution the big brother of esxi and has all of the high-end goodies needed for a virtualized server environment including live migration of running machines from server to server yes you can move across hardware shared images shared filesystem etc

772355
std	ostream
i want to define myostream which inherits publicly from std ostream

772503
min	max
then look at max min and average record size

772521
int	double
if it does the string is converted to int or double

772524
cpu	affinity
the tsc isn t guaranteed to be synchronized on all cpus so if your thread process migrates from one cpu core to another the tsc may appear to warp forward or backward in time unless you use thread process affinity to prevent migration

772559
folder	directory
i just needed to copy the include file to a folder on my hard disk and set visual studio tools|options|vc++ directory to point to the copied folder

772573
min	max
aggregation queries group by having sum avg max min

772593
icommand	ivalueconverter
you either need to modify your myhyperlink class so that viewmodelcommand is also an icommand or write an ivalueconverter that will find the correct icommand implementation given the command name in your view model

772606
pull	push
i d suggest grabbing a free chat script from elsewhere or if you want to roll your own for fun experience then go ahead but start with a db and build a page that will push and pull messages from the server

772624
hide	show
one of my first ideas was to convert this example into library that i can call from .net application basically my library would contain 2 methods show and hide tooltip

772667
pull	push
if you just want to learn it start with a simple ajax pull app then try to program one using ajax and push

772674
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
they are inherited from the superclass and since they are not declared private they are visible to the subclassing

772692
shadowing	named
what you are doing is shadowing the existing variables defined as x and y meaning that body.x and body.y are essentially overlapping the named for point.x and point.y making the latter two variable completely inaccessible from the body class link to java language specification definition of shadowing

772692
shadowing	named
named shadowing is generally perceiving as a bad practice and a cause of bugs and if you turn up the javac compiler warnings the compiler will dutifully warn you about this

772710
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i upgrade perl from perl58 to perl588 on suse linux.it looks that even though the config.pm exists for the older versioning the newer versioning installation breaks the older version.while the upgrade of perl on other oses like hp and aix does not disturb the older versioning

772710
versioning	upgrade
i am not sure could this be because now the older links after upgrade is been pointed to newer versioning and just linking is not sufficient and need to modify something more on linux

772711
hide	show
as an alternative since you are simply doing a show or hide option you could just use buttons which might provide a better ui

772715
firefox	safari
also they look much better in firefox and safari than in ie

772774
hide	show
and now you can use all of window s methods and properties to move resize show and hide your tooltip as a bonus you can also insert more advanced context into the tooltip images buttons hyperlinks your logo or make it look more intresting

772785
rss	feed
see up of the inbox there are rss feed

772785
rss	feed
but my own rss feed don t see description tag

772872
hide	show
now i am synching this with the other datagrid adg2 to show hide columns

772872
hide	show
but when i show hide columns all the other columns are not rearranged properly despite of having the same sizes as the columns in adg1

772876
int	double
i ve created the following structure which maps unique double values to one or more pairs of int

772901
rss	feed
for example i go to gmail and i click search rss feed i add my own rss and gmail need send request to my own webserver

773001
disk	ram
so i imagine the fastest is to write a program that streams the results from the disk holding in ram only the last valid value and the current one filtering out every value that is equal to the last valid

773029
post	get
this may be a pathetically simple problem but i cannot seem to format the post webrequest response to get data from the wikipedia api

773068
for-loop	loops
i don t know whether it will be faster than the two options you present but it is more standardized than the qt foreach and avoids some of the problems that you may run into with a regular for-loop namely out of bounds indexing and difficulties with translating loops to a different data structure

773078
int	double
unfortunately much of the data is in strings where it should be int s or double etc.

773078
int	double
i thought i d use an extension to the string class and generic s to pass in the type this is because it could be a double or an int or a long

773081
post	get
you seem to be pushing the input data on http post but it seems you should use http get

773084
post	get
you might want to try a get request first because it s a little simpler you will only need to post for wikipedia login

773152
udp	tcp
udp connections are not like tcp connections

773225
hide	show
js for tabs generally does no more than show hide maybe load content

773236
width	height
in order to obtain an image that is rotated angle degrees to the right and scaled down to height x width pixels

773236
graphics2d	bufferedimage
using graphics2d and bufferedimage i will have to do this which is neither readable nor easy to write

773271
quicksort	mergesort
see quicksort vs merge sort for a comparison of quicksort and mergesort which are two of the better algorithms in most cases

773277
mergesort	heapsort
if you re looking for something with good worst case performance i d look at mergesort and heapsort since they are o n log n algorithms in all cases

773277
mergesort	heapsort
heapsort is nice if all your data fits in memory while mergesort allows you to do on-disk sorts better but takes more space overall

773285
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	heapsort
quicksort is usually the fastest but if you want good worst-case time try heapsort or mergesort

773290
cpu	irq
so when a peripheral triggers an irq line the pic interrupts the cpu and tells which vector to jump to as if the corresponding int instruction was executed

773293
vb.net	vb6
dos to vb3 vb3 to object oriented design in vb6 and vb6 to vb.net

773293
vb.net	vb6
finally it is straight forward to make a design in vb6 that is ports over to vb.net readily

773352
elf	coff	elf	omf	coff	omf
there are lots of different formats out there coff omf elf the list goes on..

773356
integer	radix
for example for integers or anything that can be expressed as integer the fastest is radix sort which for fixed length values has worst case complexity of o n

773384
readonly	temporary
the main lesson to take away from that is use const references in readonly loops as it avoids the creation of temporary instances

773385
csv	tsv
i ve got a web site that outputs reports in various formats html csv tsv excel etc

773406
boost	stl
my own guess speculation but it makes a lot of sense is that phobos will become analogous to stl a truly standard library of core functionality and tango will become a utility library kind of like boost as more of its core functionality is absorbed into phobos and or druntime

773414
boost	stl
my implementation is c++ so any stl or boost would be excellent

773417
min	max
instead of doing a min or max on my aggregated group i wanted to do a first

773445
min	max
you are right not to use max or min

773445
min	max
since it sounds like all your really care is that you get exactly one arbitrary record for each group what you can do is just min or max an id field for that record and then join the table into the query on that id

773449
post	put
i can generate new post without any problem but when i want to put comments to my post i can put at most one comment for each post

773449
put	get
when trying to put more i get a classcastexception as follows

773486
typedef	struct
i ve got a library with a certain typedef struct

773499
implements	extends
you will need to extends the web application into a new zone and either implements forms based authentication or use windows authentication with a reverse proxy such as isa server

773558
touchesbegan	touchesended
i m using touchesbegan touchesended to handle the touches

773560
typedef	struct
is not a complete typedef declaration in c as it does not give a name to the type only to the struct struct tags are not in the same namespace as type names in standard c

773586
put	get
that said you could either have those images in a hasharray imagename- alt and get the alt from there or you could put the alt in the value of the radio concatenated to the filename with a separator like | and then parse them out in the function you use to display the image

773593
rel	alt
why not put the alt value in the rel of the input then place that on the image too

773619
gridview	rowdatabound
likewise you will need to read from your saved check state list to re-check the boxes during the gridview rowdatabound event

773638
webclient	httpwebrequest
i ve tried like 7 different ways to create an http request all more or less the same thing different implementation using webclient using httpwebrequest etc

773707
ubuntu	linux
if you use a popular linux distribution like ubuntu you ll have perl and i believe python loaded initially

773707
biopython	bioperl
these are popular languages for use in bioinformatics and have some nice libraries bioperl biopython cpan etc

773738
width	height
height 300 width 300 inlineid myonpagecontent

773738
width	height
change the values of height width and inlineid in the query accordingly inlineid is the id value of the element that contains the content you would like to show in a thickbox

773762
min	max
round-trip ms min avg max med 20 23 37 21

773762
min	max
round-trip ms min avg max med 19 23 38 23

773762
min	max
round-trip ms min avg max med 269 272 275 272

773762
min	max
round-trip ms min avg max med 63 66 73 67

773803
listview	gridview
they specifiy a style to be applied to all s below a table with the class names listview detailstable gridview

773807
rss	feed
i m realizing that pulling in a weather rss feed might be the only clean solution but i am not very familiar with parsing rss feed so it will require a lot of labor on my end since i ll be digging through documentation

773828
rss	feed
looks like they have rss feed and if you register you may be able to get more

773840
keydown	keyup
from keydown and keyup event-handler

773866
hide	show
style it however you want show it when you start loading your content and hide it when you re finished

773867
touchesbegan	touchesended
you should put nslog functions in you touchesbegan and touchesended next time to confirm the behaviour

773885
google-chrome	firefox
okay i had to try it for myself and for me pretty much exactly your code worked in both google-chrome and firefox

773897
put	get
i have a few ideas that may work but thought i d put it up here and perhaps get some better ideas from the php gurus

773973
diffmerge	winmerge
for another example of external tool diffmerge and winmerge

773981
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in firefox safari google-chrome it works fine but in ie6 7 the browser page jumps down to the top of the form when the dialog box is displayed

773982
profiler	aqtime
1 .currently i am using aqtime profiler to profile the application

774098
filesystems	ntfs
the path is provided as a unc path to an ntfs filesystems probably on either server 03 or 08

774116
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
i like to use argumentexception argumentnullexception and argumentoutofrangeexception

774134
aptana	radrails
aptana radrails is one of the best ruby ides out there with rails support html editors etc

774161
filesystems	ntfs
as an aside if you are running under ntfs then file operations are atomic at the filesystems level

774165
inherited	properties
create a custom membershipuser object that inherited from membershipuser and provides my extra properties

774182
serializable	deserialization
cloning and serializable don t interact well with the use of final fields if you need to set the value of that field to something different than what is returned by clone or the deserialization process

774200
int	double
otherwise you specify what class or primitive you return int double string whatever

774221
lapack	mpi
for dense matrices mapreduce is the wrong solution -- you need locality and broad exchange among nodes -- and you should instead look at lapack and mpi and friends

774251
serializable	deserialization
there are lots of little details which this doesn t explain but this is the general idea of serializable deserialization

774289
ironruby	ironpython
you can trivially access clr internals objects and return values from ironpython i don t know about ironruby

774296
multiplying	add
my coworker always says first estimate the project length then multiplying it by two add 1 and then add the next highest units

774335
inherited	properties
there is a data contract personcontract with the same private members and public properties as person and an employeecontract that inherited from personcontract like employee does person with public properties mirroring the entities

774340
opera	firefox
if you are looking for a reusable x-browser solution the following function works for ie firefox and opera

774381
ferret	sphinx
i ve used ferret in the past with few problems although i ve heard sphinx is better

774426
multiplying	add
i am aware of the multiplying and add solution but since these are arbitrary length numbers the multiplying and add operations are not free so i d like to avoid them if at all possible

774426
octal	binary
i have found that this is simple for binary octal and hexadecimal

774458
int	chars
convert chars to int value 0 through base

774474
hide	show
i like to hide the splash screen when it auto starts but keep splash screen show if users manually run the app

774498
instances	transient
the problem is that i get an errormessage object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing. when trying to save

and as long as your app s in versioning control i d do the upgrade in one shot and go through the error messages one at a time

774750
post	get
you may get a clue on how to solve your problem by looking at this post css overriding styles on nested elements

775039
getter	setter
those property setter getter should be private anyway

775056
put	get
to put it another way if a user is logged in and goes to and is an admin user they should get what they would see the same thing as if they had gone to

775066
hide	show
do you have a method that hide everything except the background do the thing that make the page shift and show everything now at the right place

775069
integer	unsigned
using classless inter-domain routing cidr you will have a tuple address prefix where address is a 128-bit unsigned integer and prefix is a tiny 0..128 unsigned integer

775096
junit	testng
junit 4 doesnt seem to support the description attribute for the test annotation like testng does

775104
width	height
you can then call the javascript function from silverlight and pass it the actual height and width

775121
postgresql	mysql
if those limitations aren t an issue for you and you like the oracle approach then give it a shot otherwise consider an opensource server like postgresql or mysql which have none of the aforementioned limitations

775121
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql will allow you to scale your application without any cost other than hardware obviously

775147
children	parent
whenever i try to save parent object the children are also saved but the fk stays untouched

775162
folder	directory
i have a situation where i want to catch 404 errors fired by html pages not just aspx pages but i only have access to the web.config of the root folder of my website and all sub directory note i don t have access to the actual iis server and i cannot create applications or change settings

775169
implements	extends
you can create a completely custom class to function as the renderer given it implements certain required interfaces or in most cases you extends an existing component

775177
allocator	stl
the stl implementations i ve used support an allocator as a template parameter which you could use to make a container use your segregated free list but you d still be writing your own

775178
children	parent
in an inverted parent-children object model you must modify the parent s collection of children objects in order to cause nhibernate to update the child records references to the parent

775179
boost	stl
i don t think stl has anything but it looks like the boost library might have it

775205
typedef	struct
typedef struct

775257
postgresql	mysql
if it s windows i d go with oracle or mysql as i have heard only bad things about running postgresql on windows machines

775268
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
if the public facing apache is left only to serve static content then consider replacing it with something lightweight such as nginx or lighttpd

775313
udp	tcp
it is typical of any udp tcp or config attribute work in any language or environment

775339

775575
getter	setter
as these are property getter and setter using get and set are appropriate

775580
ubuntu	debian
i m looking for a way to interact with the gnu libparted library from python but so far what i ve found a gsoc project from 2005 and an ubuntu debian package that s been dropped from the archive have been disheartening

775646
getter	setter
property getter and setter don t have names starting with get and set because it s some convention reserved for naming getter and setter

775646
accessor	properties
ultimately i think you just need to get over whatever hangup you have about using get and set for things that aren t properties accessor

775697
width	height
drop this xaml onto a brand-new user control that does not have a width and height set

775702

expression-blend	silverlight
i ve been using silverlight 3 and expression-blend 3 since the day they became available about a month now and haven t had any real issues

775719
queue	fifo
the main question is if this low-level sharing is really needed - i am not an expert on linux but i would consider to use for instance a fifo queue for the master shared memory segment so that the os does the locking work for you

775739
put	get
my strong belief therefore is that i need additional fu to parse my eval statement to get the same time i put into the field

775766
int	chars
one effective property of this is that if i have a nil list int i can t interchange it with a nil list chars

775766
int	double
it also occurs to me that the instance of list in the specification of cons is also confusing you be really careful when parsing that whereas cons is specifying a constructor which is basically a pattern that haskell is going to wrap the data into list a looks like a constructor but is actually simply a type like int or double

775771
hide	show
the same way you could also maximize or hide show your window

775786
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
but otherwise the most common filesystems windows ntfs fat linux ext 2 3 mac os x do not store any metadata or other information about files

also i know that there are other requirements for libjpeg libpng etc

775804
boost	stl
including stl boost and tr1

775814
post	put
my intention here is to have a single thread of will-make-you-a-better-programmer-just-for-reading sort of articles or papers or really standup blog post that the writer has put in a lot of effort to distill anything that will take you less than a day to read

775906
prepare	execute
you prepare a statement such as an insert and then execute it with just the relevant parameters

775935
wtl	atl
if you want to wrap the structures with a class i d recommend you try atl wtl first since the structures you re wrapping might already exist as classes there

775962
postgresql	mysql
this will reduce the risk of conflicting configs and also increase the flexibility of running a custom set of vms oracle + mysql + postgresql and not the others etc.

775990
post	get
like on page submit you will get all page data in action method which accepts post verb right

775999

it can read convert and write images in a variety of formats over 100 including dpx exr gif jpeg jpeg-2000 pdf photocd png postscript svg and tiff

776012
button	checkbox
in this example i put one button to check and one button to uncheck gridview checkbox

776020
gif	png	tiff	png
it can read convert and write images in a variety of formats over 100 including dpx exr gif jpeg jpeg-2000 pdf photocd png postscript svg and tiff

776043
tiff	bmp
the exception to this rule would be uncompressed image formats like uncompressed bmp or uncompressed tiff but i doubt you re using that

776054
gif	png	tiff	png
it can read convert and write images in a variety of formats over 100 including dpx exr gif jpeg jpeg-2000 pdf photocd png postscript svg and tiff

776075
put	get
we get paid a lot of money to put them in the right order and make magic happen

776102

however i d like to learn some more advanced features of latex such as editing or even creating my own class files and bibtex styles

776111
post	get
i ll post code when i get it to work but i d be interested if others think this is the right thing to use btw i m vista or greater for os level

776133
versioning	upgrade
if that s not an option then you have to go with the oldest versioning otherwise if you upgrade and don t maintain backwards compatability you ll break existing clients

776137
inherited	properties
another way is to use the fullname properties of the fileinfo class inherited from filesysteminfo see usage below

776158
3-tier	n-tier
i don t have the impression the link you mention is telling something about 3-tier or n-tier

776165
superclass	subclassing
where ichild is the interface for subclassing of superclass

776180
awt	swing
i m using swing components to make the gui but when i looked for the way of making the canvas i only found the class canvas from awt

776180
awt	swing
i have read that using the class canvas from awt with a gui made with swing won t work correctly is that true

776197
awt	swing
as for the question on awt and swing yes it is true that you do not want to mix components from the awt and swing as they differ in the way they render gui components

776197
awt	swing
awt is based on heavyweight components meaning they native windowing for painting the gui while swing is based on lightweight components meaning the gui is drawn by java itself without using native components

776197
awt	swing
a good guide on the difference of awt and swing is provided in painting in awt and swing article from sun

776223
put	get
now what i know so far is that i have to use a dependencyproperty to get the value from the usercontrol and then put it inside a public string

776289
ironruby	ironpython
the dlr may be the complement for this since it can dynamically generate execute code from abstract syntax trees it s used for ironpython and ironruby

776347
rar	zip
if the file is an exe check whether it s a sfx and if it s a zip rar or 7z sfx check the embedded archive

776419
inherited	properties
commandsink is an attached properties so is this attaching the inherited binding that comes from demowindow as the value of the attached properties called commandsink on the commandsinkbinding object

776431
mbunit	nmock
we use visual assist x for refactoring support acceptable mbunit gallio for unit testing the managed classes and nmock or rhinomocks for our mocking framework

776501
getter	setter
there are ides that support code generation of getter and setter methods

776523
integer	unsigned
works for any unsigned integer type not just uint32_t so you could make versions for other sizes

776523
clang	icc
icc but clang doesn t seem to provide them anywhere except in msvc compatibility mode with

776523
clang	icc	16-bit	64bit
gcc and icc not clang also provides __rolb __rorb for 8-bit rotate left right __rolw __rorw 16-bit __rold __rord 32-bit __rolq __rorq 64bit only defined for 64bit targets

776523
x86	64bit
for narrow rotates the implementation uses __builtin_ia32_rolhi or ...qi but the 32 and 64bit rotates are defined using shift or with no protection against ub because the code in ia32intrin.h only has to work on gcc for x86

776523
compile-time-constant	constants
a carefully-written gnu c inline-asm rotate would allow the count to be an immediate operand for compile-time-constant shift counts but it still couldn t optimize away entirely if the value to be shifted is also a compile-time constants after inlining

776613
versioning	upgrade
we also use release branches and we do ocassionally check things into them usually critical bugfixes for customers who cannot upgrade to the latest versioning immediately

776690
ienumerable	icollection
this is sometimes confusing to people especially if you have something modifiable like an icollection returned rather than an ienumerable

776762
division	modulo
the modulo is the compliment to the div operator and returns the remainder of a division of two whole numbers

776779
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
instead of datainputstream you can use objectoutputstream to write and objectinputstream to read

776796
superclass	subclassing
return values are no problem as long as they are more specialized in subclassing than in superclass

776818
actionscript	mxml
now when you create thelist either in actionscript or in the initialize event handler of your mxml component make a new yourcustomeventdispatcher give to it a reference to thelist and add it to itemrenderer

776820
folder	directory
how do i add new views to the site adding in a new folder to the application views scripts directory seems to do nothing

776850
codeigniter	cakephp
here is codeigniter s and cakephp s for starters

776941
bazaar	svn
i started using bazaar after a long camping in the svn field

776941
bazaar	svn
as a result i use the same svn repo structure in bazaar and i perform a physical copy of the trunk every time

776950
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
for example safari 5.1 firefox 7 google-chrome 20 etc

776952
websphere	ibm
i ve also used the rules engine that comes with ibm websphere process server and found that to be quite good as well although pricey

776990
pascal	delphi
i m new to c# been a pascal lover until i found c# in depth.in delphi there is a try statement that is also implemented in c#

777099
jar	war
now as you said preferred ed way to do it using war or jar file

777114
sysml	uml
having said that uml and it s offspring sysml are right now the only game in town

777123
factors	mean
by that i mean remove all the external factors that can have an impact in my problem

777149
bazaar	svn
i have no idea why svn has it that way but basically tags are just a marker at a point in time in your bazaar repository

777153
hide	show
as a site-builder i don t need to create graphicsâ i only rearrange the layers hide ones and show others pick colors widths heights and so on

777164
nvarchar	sqldbtype
the nvarchar sqldbtype maps to the .net string datatype

777183
ironruby	ironpython
managed jscript been really hard to find relative to ironpython or ironruby

777198
photoshop	fireworks
i think the more affordable fireworks can also work in my experience however the only reliable way to open the psd as the designer intended was using photoshop

777245
post	get
there is no ispostback -- everything is either a post or get or other http verb

777245
post	get
if you need to have the same action name do both get post and they actually do different things you can either give them separate signatures or use the actionnameattribute to alias one of the actions so the methods can have different names

777282
post	get
i m not sure if i understood your question correctly but on the controller you would have an action that handles the initial get from the browser and a second action to handle post

777293
tinyint	boolean
mysql tinyint iirc boolean maps to this automatically

777337
hash	md5
if your only purpose is to be able to validate the contents of your business transaction log table you could store a hash value md5 or sha in say an xml file on the application server

777437
mouse	keyboard
machines the result being that once refit is installed the refit menu does correctly get displayed at boot time however is unusable because it receives no keyboard or mouse input no usb drivers loaded

777444
ubuntu	debian
under a debian system i m on ubuntu with apache2 and the deflate module already installed which it is by default you can enable deflate compression in two easy steps

777455
client-side	server-side
i m thinking this would work both client-side and server-side with results being converted to the appropriate language-specific data structure or perhaps kept as json

777461
getter	setter
setter and getter enables you to add additional abstraction layer and in pure oop you should always access the objects via the interface they are providing to the outside world .

777461
getter	setter
consider this code which will save you in asp.net and which it would not be possible without the level of abstraction provided by the setter and getter

777481
hide	show
you can hide it and then show it again w o any problems though

777481
width	height
it could be your left and right positions that make it close -5000 pixels in combination with your width and height 0 pixels

777534
width	height
returns a new cgrect containing the x y width and height values of the view s bounds

777551
width	height
additionally i would like to be able to set the width and height of the table as a whole and have all the text in each row to dynamically resize appropriately

777555
stdout	stderr
in this case you could even just use system and check its return value for being zero while redirecting the stdout and stderr to dev null

777575
rss	feed
i have an application running under jetty and i want the application to return self referencing absolute urls when generating an rss feed so a client must be able to work without a current url context

777581
width	height
i m trying to strip the width and height attributes of chunks html in other words replace

777600
udp	tcp
you will probably have to contact the people there for more information but it basically behaves with tcp reliability but runs over udp

777633
ferret	sphinx
ferret is buggy i m using sphinx thinking sphinx plugin

777640
struts	stripes
struts and stripes are two that come to mind

777675
width	height
want to edit things like div size color positioning absolute height width etc

777747
ienumerable	idictionary
ienumerable does not support access by key the dictionary something part in your code to access data that way you d need your dictionary property to be an idictionary class

777764
boost	stl
general purpose boost loki stl

777767
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
ie opera safari and google-chrome all support this behavior

777772
width	height
i would use a grid and set it s height and width to auto

777837
rss	feed
if it is for you to see not an on-screen counter but something you can look at separately google analytics perhaps with feedburner if you have an atom rss feed

777884
put	get
they communicate via a duplex wcf channel which when i run from within a single network domain runs fine but when i put the server on a separate network domain i get the following message in the wcf server trace.

777946
ant	maven
deploy to a local app server using ant maven

777984
gridview	detailsview
currently i have a detailsview attached to a gridview

777984
gridview	detailsview
when you select an item from the gridview the details show up in the detailsview duh

778046
stdout	stderr
that s like backticks but gives you stdout and stderr separately

778071
hex	binary
this is a bit hacky but you could go via the hex string representation and there to binary with the hex codec

778081
uniq	grep
we use grep cut sort uniq and join at the command line all the time to do data analysis

778093
pyexcelerator	xlrd
i dont see these features in pyexcelerator or xlrd modules

778095
bmp	png
i even tried converting it to png jpg and bmp to see if that makes any difference

778119
onmouseover	onclick
the trick is to suppress the onmouseover event and the subscribe to the onclick event

778146
inherited	properties
where textbox can be any class that inherited from control and text can be any dependency properties

778153
interbase	firebird
in some database interbase firebird perhaps others... your can trigger event

778161
solaris	sunos
taken from sunos 5.9 aka solaris 9 usr bin false

778164
sorting	filtering
this is more of a subsonic 3 solution but have you seen rob s screencast using subsonic3 t4 and the jquery grid to do pretty much most of what you are asking above paging sorting filtering

778183
postgresql	mysql
which is incorrect - the postgresql databases contain schemas and those are the equivalent of the databases in mysql

778195
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works perfectly in firefox google-chrome opera and safari so it s an ie bug

778219
unix	bsd
bsd unix has also a pthread_set_name_np call

778224
aptana	radrails
i m using aptana with radrails when i m on windows but it s not as good

fadein	fadeout
there is a known bug with ie and the fadein fadeout functions and their effect on text elements

778277
getter	setter
getter and setter methods

778287
serializable	deserialization
secondly deserialization must support literally any type that is serializable

778357
mouse	keyboard
the actual behavior of the control is split in two parts where one part is the atl gunk that interfaces with the ole host and the other part is the real meat which just receives callbacks for window attach sizing drawing and mouse keyboard events

778361
folder	directory
i m looking for the easiest solution to implement a folder browse dialog with checkboxes in front of the directory in my c# winforms project

778367
button	checkbox
what i want it to do is that when the checkbox gets checked it deletes the row instead of people having using the remove minus button

778385
post	get
more specifically post calls methoda but get to the same url calls methodb

778425
post	get
this is where rails links the post and get requests to certain actions

778454
g++	gcc
mixing gcc and g++ isn t good

778455
button	checkbox
i can add a style for each type by change the targettype to button checkbox etc

778464
outputstream	inputstream
i presume you meant inputstream rather than outputstream

778467
perforce	cvs
we migrated our version control system from cvs to perforce and our java dev team is using the perforce plug-in in eclipse mac

778467
perforce	cvs
is there a way to configure perforce to continue the versioning where cvs left off

778483
width	height
just make sure it s parent is the document and the document has a width and height of 100

778523
haskell	scheme
a lot of people think the reason languages like haskell and scheme haven t gotten wider adoption is because people are ruined from them by imperative programming

778530
fastcgi	scgi
scgi like fastcgi is a serialized protocol suitable for inter-process communication between a web-server and a web-application

778531
g++	gcc
you just have to make sure you use g++ not gcc

778547
multiplying	add
in all things you want to learn in the order that such knowledge is required such as learning how to add before learning how to multiplying

778568
imperative	declarative
functional programming declarative programming of any kind really on the other hand is a completely separate paradigm that requires a whole new set of considerations performance and otherwise many of which are much easier to visualize if you understand imperative programming first

778570
single-quotes	double-quotes
be aware too that you can use single-quotes instead of double-quotes to reduce the need to escape characters like double-quotes and backslashes

778602
yacc	bison
if you insist then f lex and yacc bison are the tools likely used by your compiler-writers

778608
width	height
you should create one image with a width of 50px and a height of 24px where you have both the play part and the stop part

778647
icommand	ivalueconverter
i can work around this with a fairly ugly hack that involves using an ivalueconverter to instantiate the icommand i need

778647
icommand	ivalueconverter
the hyperlink binds to the name of the icommand it needs from the alert object and the ivalueconverter swaps the name for a new instance of the icommand itself

778687
post	get
instead of a link in the email you could probably just create a form that post the information instead of sending a get request to your site

778688
width	height
i have the reportviewer control set with width of 100 and height of 100

778688
width	height
in ie7 while it takes the entire width of the page it only takes up a small portion of the height

778688
width	height
in firefox both the width and the height are messed up

778712
put	get
you can also use the remove tag to get rid of things you don t want or put everything in a location and tell it not to inherit

778737
websphere	ibm
disclaimer i am an ibm consultant and specialise in websphere esb

778737
websphere	ibm
ibm certainly markets both websphere message broker and websphere esb as products that make it easy to build an esb along with the datapower hardware appliance

778759
client-side	server-side
server-side validation is required simply because client-side validation can be disabled

778786
client-side	server-side
as others mentioned you should keep the duplication as the client-side validation is to help the application react sooner to help the user but the real validation is on the server-side as you should never trust anything passed in until it has been validated

778786
client-side	server-side
you will probably do more extensive validation on the server-side esp if there is a need to check against a data source for example is the username unique would be on the server-side but is the username long enough or an email address could be done on the client-side and server-side

778790
client-side	server-side
what you can do is have the server-side validation logic being run by web services that your client-side validation can call via ajax and also when you post back to your server

778797
stdout	stderr
with system both stdout and stderr will go the same place as the script s stdout and stderr unless the system command redirects them

778797
stdout	stderr
to capture a program s stdout but discard its stderr

778797
stdout	stderr
to capture a program s stderr but discard its stdout

778797
stdout	stderr
to capture a program s stderr and let its stdout go to our own stderr

778797
stdout	stderr
to read both a command s stdout and its stderr separately you can redirect them to temp files let the command run then read the temp files

778797
stdout	stderr
you can also use file-descriptor redirection to make stderr a duplicate of stdout

778797
stdout	stderr
note that you cannot simply open stderr to be a dup of stdout in your perl program and avoid calling the shell to do the redirection

778797
stdout	stderr
this fails because the open makes stderr go to where stdout was going at the time of the open

778797
stdout	stderr
the backticks then make stdout go to a string but don t change stderr which still goes to the old stdout

778797
stdout	stderr
to capture a command s stderr and stdout together

778797
stdout	stderr
to capture a command s stdout but discard its stderr

778797
stdout	stderr
to capture a command s stderr but discard its stdout

778797
stdout	stderr
to exchange a command s stdout and stderr in order to capture the stderr but leave its stdout to come out our old stderr

778797
stdout	stderr
to read both a command s stdout and its stderr separately it s easiest to redirect them separately to files and then read from those files when the program is done

778806
getter	setter
and wrapped in a getter setter property

778807
django	turbogears
you ll want some kind of framework i d recommend django or turbogears

778810

778848
post	get	post	put	put	get
provide a callback as the third argument of the post call that will get the value returned from the method and put it in your textbox

778907
post	get	post	put	put	get
note that because web browsers generally only support get and post rails uses a hidden field to turn these into put and delete requests as appropriate

778983
pop-up	dialog
after switching to ie8 i was able to determine the cause was the ajaxcontrol toolkit s modal pop-up dialog

778991
hash	md5
i m looking for something to do this that is nice and simple as in having a text file with username md5 hash pairs

779069
super	abstract
inheritance is more to do with inheriting members and or member implementations from parent to child aka base to derived super to sub abstract to concrete class

779078
multicastdelegate	delegation
the compiler creates a new type for you derived from multicastdelegate which in turn derives from delegation

779092
jdk1.6	jdk1.4	jdk1.6	jdk1.5	jdk1.4	jdk1.5
i have observed a great difference in sun java performance when code is compiled through jdk1.6 as compared to jdk1.5 or jdk1.4 over 4 folds

779117
profiler	yourkit
using a profiler like yourkit will not only tell you which methods are hot spots in terms of cpu time but it will also tell you where threads are spending most of their time blocked or waiting

779122
multicastdelegate	delegation
from an implementation perspective the delegation class defines the fields used to represent a delegation s function pointer and the multicastdelegate class provides the base line functionality used by events

779138
awt	swing
for examples some schools teach people to build guis using the awt or swing class library that are supplied with java although there are other options

779148
jsf	wicket	struts	wicket
you may not even need to know all lower-level servlet and jsp stuff thoroughly as higher-level frameworks such as struts jsf or wicket have become popular

779166
width	height
don t set width or height or stretch on the path

779172
i2c	spi
acted as communications translators for board-level i o spi - i2c - rs232 - usb

779178
put	get
so sql says yes i have a value for you but it can t put it anywhere so you get an exception

779184
int	boolean
value types are primitives such as int and boolean or structures and can be identified because they inherit from system.valuetype

779283
awt	swing
is there a functional equivalent to swing or awt in c#

779293
apache	nginx
the idea was to keep keep static file serving away from apache by placing a light-weight event-driven http server like nginx in front of the heavy apache processes

779293
apache	nginx
be sure that you re not prematurely optimizing by using nginx where apache + mod_wsgi would do just fine

779293
apache	nginx
nginx is awesome but for a django solution nginx is imho a better fit as a load balancer for many apache instances or a separate server for static files

779354
int	double
the input object can be anything like string or int or double etc. sometimes it can be a multi dimensional array

779367
post	get
this all works fine i get the object post back from the create view - and my method membertocreate.save actually writes what it is supposed to to the database

779399
move	drag
2 allow the user to easily move items around whether by drag and drop or some other method

779407
post	get
then on successive http requests you might send along that guid in an http header or as a value in each get or post request similarly to the way facebook handles their api clients for instance check the timeliness of that value on the server and if all s well carry on

779441
button	checkbox
however there are checkbox in my gui and i can t figure out how to deselect these checkbox when the reset button is pressed

779455

779458
postgresql	mysql
linq to mysql oracle and postgresql dblinq

779504
binutils	bfd
for a system based on formats supported by binutils most of the detail you need can be learned with the bfd library

779504
elf	dwarf
a quick scan of keil s web site seems to indicate that they abandoned their proprietary arm compiler in favor of licensing arm s realview compiler which appears to use elf objects with dwarf format debug info

779516
gif	png
i don t think anybody should ever be editing web graphics jpg gif png directly

779517
google-chrome	safari
the strangest thing though is that this error only occurs in google-chrome and safari

779517
opera	firefox
firefox ie and opera all post the form without a problem

779571
google-chrome	safari
if you have a cfform cfgrid on the calling page you may want to look at the javascript that s generated by cf and test it against google-chrome safari

779585
cherokee	lighttpd
there are however several very lightweight http servers like cherokee and lighttpd

779645
put	get
in safari the only way i can get it to not submit is to put onsubmit return false

779674
ant	maven
there are also plugins for maven and ant that invoke hbm2ddl automatically

779702
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
between ie6 7 8 firefox 2 3 google-chrome safari and the other lesser known browsers and versions it sounds like an nightmare to support across the board

779734
firefox	safari
it is most noticeable in firefox and least noticeable in safari with ie being in the middle

779746
implements	extends
you can achieve this behavior by implements your custom membership provider or extends an existing one

779805
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari will pass a field s value even if the field lacks a name while ie firefox and opera do not

779811
for-loop	loops
ssis actually has a for-loop container that can loops over a set of numbers over the rows in a rowset over files in a folder etc

779832
draggable	droppable
this is an issue when using the jquery ui draggable droppable plugins because it clones dom elements during a drag drop

779832
move	drag
i want to be able to inject data into the dom element that is move during a drag drop operation

779879
strstr	substr	strstr	strncpy
you could build your own replace function using strstr to find the substr and strncpy to copy in parts to a new buffer

779884
strstr	strcpy
you d need to roll your own using something like strstr and strcat or strcpy

779895
postgresql	mysql
after seeing the wiki link to postgresql figured i d edit this post with links for mysql oracle docs not really an optimization guides specifically but both are good resources especially the mysql one

changeset	cherry-pick
however the range of changeset you cherry-pick must be contiguous

779969
hide	show
show hide the trayicon depending on forms visibility

780017
atomic	interlocked
if you have a dual-core system where you have threads on different cores both accessing this value you might have problems doing what you think is atomic without the interlocked

780030
int	double
where idsb are the types of the data you re binding int double string blob

780041
recvfrom	datagram
if sendto and recvfrom only guarantee that 1 byte will be sent or received at a time and datagram can be received out of order how can any udp protocol remain coherent

780044
udp	tcp
but since you can implement all of tcp with udp it has to be possible

780044
udp	tcp
metaphorically think of udp like sending postcards and tcp like making a phone call

780091
stdout	stderr
inside that script i d ensure that i trapped stdout and stderr to a known or knowable file

780111
cout	cin
scanf is faster than cin printf is faster than cout etc

780152
folder	directory
once the user has specified the directory i want to be able to delete it so that when i launch the installer it can create the folder itself such that it gets flagged for uninstall

780152
folder	directory
while it does let the user browse for a directory it s not as intuitive as folder browser dialogues that i ve seen in installers in the past

780156
free	malloc
i am wondering if there is a cross-platform allocator that is one step lower than malloc free

780175
atomic	interlocked
interlocked instructions provide atomic and inter-processor synchronization

780228
free	malloc
c gives you malloc and free c++ adds new delete and and the placement forms in addition to what c provides

780228
free	malloc
you could implement your own malloc free without worrying about the underlying os

780251
udp	tcp
unlike tcp this does not mean that the peer closed the connection because with udp there is no connection

780274
factors	mean
generate some factors that describe each histogram curve mean variance std-dev etc

780280
hide	show
i don t think you need the show hide since it happens so fast

780376
client-side	server-side
retrieve a list of post_ids that you want to show comments for then retrieve all comments for those posts and filter them client-side or you could do it server-side if you had windowing functions i think though those aren t in mysql

780376
postgresql	mysql
if windowing functions ever get added to mysql they re in release 8.4 of postgresql option 2 might become palatable or even preferable

780389
post	get
all you can do is post and get and you can only post 10 items a day significant interactions

780404
post	get
if you want to get all post at once or some subset with a where the following will surprisingly work

780404
children	parent
parent 1 has noo children

780404
post	get
let s increase the number of parent rows to 12800 the number of child rows to 1536 most blog post don t get comments right

780417
stdio	gets
for example in windows a line ends with r n and this gets translated to a single n by stdio since that is the c convention

780417
fseek	ftell
because of this the c standard only defines fseek in text files in a few cases to the very beginning to the very end to the current position and to a previous position that has been retrieved with ftell

webkit safari and google-chrome but firefox and opera have plans to implement similar in upcoming releases

780966
superclass	subclassing
jon in the comment below is correct you can narrow the scope but then you would still follow the protocol that you will return a one should you return a three from three.foo because subclassing will all implement the superclass interface

780997
try-catch	exception-handling
you should try-catch unsupportedencodingexception exception-handling

781007
superclass	subclassing
overriding a method and trying to return a less specific type is a violation of the liskov substitution principle which says that subclassing must fulfill all contracts of their superclass

781040
button	checkbox
i agree that checkbox have more of an implicit true false meaning another point is that for radio button you can force the user to make an active choice by having neither option selected

781045
button	checkbox
we had an experience with customer base of older age group they understand yes no radio button better then checkbox

781045
button	checkbox
and we were forced to remove checkbox and put radio button everywhere

781100
getter	setter
there is a workaround presented there but it requires me at least if i get it right to write a custom interface ifileinfo and provide it with a lot of getter and setter which i want to avoid

781111
prng	random
if i were to use random values i would go for a prng with fixed seeds so that every run actually checks the same numbers

781113
post	get
note that the form element only allows get and post

781128
codeigniter	cakephp
options may include django ruby on rails joomla cakephp codeigniter

781147

then you will have to use your own malloc and free functions to do the actual mallocing and freeing but also keeping the allocation table updated

781155
sorting	filtering
pulling large amounts of data into a web application and doing sorting filtering there is always going to be slow depending on your definition of large

781155
sorting	filtering
if you can apply any sorting filtering on the database server before you pull the data to your web application that should speed things up

you can use javascript something like jqgrid or yahooâ s datatables

781270
tablesorter	datatables
for simpler datatables you can use jqueryâ s tablesorter

781294
width	height
this initializes with the height of our experiment being 200px and the width is automatic

781294
width	height
the reason why i got the widths and height of the element before zero-ing them was if said width 100 and height 100 in my animate it would set it to 100 of the pages width and height...we don t want that

781342
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
they are the superviews of a uitableview which is inside of a uinavigationcontroller which is inside of a uitabbarcontroller

781354
min	max
he makes the point that his implementation doesn t consider min or max dates though

781361
portrait	landscape
my issue is that mainview renders correctly in landscape mode despite the frame passed into mainview initwithframe being in portrait while the child pdfview renders into a portrait frame

781395
nsdatecomponents	nsdateformatter
to convert a string to a date you use the nsdateformatter class or maybe nsdatecomponents if you already know the hours minutes and seconds

781395
nsdatecomponents	nsdateformatter
you can then use either nsdateformatter or nsdatecomponents to get the new time back out again

781507
background-color	transparency
remove the borders of the input and set its background-color to transparency

781578
children	parent
selecting a parent object populates the child pane with its children

781578

781829
javassist	cglib
in practice you can use something like cglib or javassist

781984
javassist	cglib
for more power many have mentioned javassist i haven t used it - cglib and asm have been good for me

782123
cpython	ironpython
can be used with either cpython or ironpython

782375
perforce	cvs
we are considering switching our source control repository at my work from perforce to either cvs or subversion

782375
cvs	svn
i said that i didn t think cvs was as popular as svn recently and was met with a lot of blank stares

782375
cvs	svn
my boss told me that i must still be stuck inside the windows-programming world if i was considering svn because most unix-based developers use cvs

782375
cvs	svn
in addition another coworker said cvs was a lot more popular than svn

782375
perforce	svn
i am really only familiar with using svn perforce and git

782383
cvs	svn
svn vs cvs

782383
cvs	svn
svn vs cvs vs git

782404
cvs	svn
from what i ve seen at multiple client sites cvs has been largely superceeded by svn

782405
bazaar	git
subversion git mercurial and bazaar were developed later

782405
bazaar	git
these vcss namely git mercurial and bazaar have recently got a lot of love by some projects

782449
opera	firefox
copy the following html into your browsers at least firefox and internet explorer 7 but you should try opera too

782449
opera	firefox
this is one solution to the problem tested in opera firefox and internet explorer 7

782452
pull	push
i commit push go to another place pull commit push

782494
cvs	svn
are new repositories being set up more in svn or cvs

782494
cvs	svn
are repositories changing more from cvs to svn or the reverse

782494
cvs	svn
the overwhelming answers as far as i can tell are that many more new repositories use svn than cvs and the migration is all from cvs to svn

782494
cvs	svn
there are arguments for keeping cvs if you already have it but for virtually any other case i d recommend svn over cvs and so would most of the people who use either heavily

782508
cvs	svn
the company i work for is in the process of moving from cvs to svn there really is no competition between the two

782508
cvs	svn
cvs essentially only versions files while svn keeps track of both files and folders

782512
hash	md5
also as a bit of ghost debugging it s very possible that your passwords are md5 hash in the database since you should never store them in plain text

782532
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have tested this in firefox webkit safari google-chrome and it works

782533
post	get

782558
put	get
if i put both times into an epoch calculator online i get the correct date for both currtime and dispdate

782561
button	checkbox
from there you can get the checkbox button cell at the given row and change the cell s drawing style based on it s state

782655
postgresql	mysql
should i use postgresql mysql oracle or sqlserver for storing documents binary files

782663
cvs	svn
i don t know about installed base but from the large number of developers i know from the internet svn is quite popular unlike cvs

782744
awt	swing
since every swing callback like button listener comes in on the awt thread you normally don t have to think about this but for an active rendering situation you have to pay close attention

782749
post	get
right now when the fields get edited php post names instead of

782786
webclient	httpwebrequest
my asp.net upload faq has an article on this with example code upload files using an rfc 1867 post request with httpwebrequest webclient

782899
folder	directory
the app_globalresources folder and the resource file are copied into the bin directory

782962
getter	setter
otherwise you could separate out the getter and setter for the property so that the type required is very clear

783017
gridview	sqldatasource
i know how to have an editable gridview along with a sqldatasource in which each edit update insert delete is immediately persisted to the database using the sqldatasource s updatecommand insertcommand etc

783018
width	height
addition i give the algorithm the picturedatavector the width and height of the picture and a rectangle denoting the region that i want to copy out of the picture

783141
nunit	moq
although they do not have one bundled with the framework here is a link to post containing a download to automatically create the test project for nunit with moq for you nunit with moq

783198
int	double
then they can tag a bunch of resources as belonging to projects take over the world or fix my car. the tags are strongly typed so a tag may store single or multiple string s int s double s etc

783198
sorting	filtering
the problem is that resources need to behave both as tuples for tabular viewing sorting filtering and as tagname tagvalue maps

783211
datediff	difference
i have a report that calculates multiple date difference in business days not datediff for a variety of business reasons that are far too dull to get into

783223
mouse	keyboard
try keynav for controlling the mouse pointer using your keyboard

783285
versioning	upgrade
also upgrade to versioning 1.6 which has better mergeinfo support it writes less of these properties

783359
opera	firefox
i tested this in opera 10 ie 6 and firefox 3 with only minor problems

783400
integer	fractions
if you don t need fractions cents consider storing and manipulating the currency as an integer then dividing by 100 when it s time to display

783404
min	max
when then the element is dragged you may programaticlly increase decrease the max min preff size of your component most likely a jtextarea and let the lym resize the visual apparence of the component

783438
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
for this example i m attaching the event to all anchor tags in the page but you could replace getelementsbytagname with getelementbyid for a specific one

783442
i2c	spi
if your hardware has any other unused serial interface spi i2c .. using them would be easier

783505
getter	setter
i set it up at debug level in the assembly.cs file so that it defaults to logging all method calls that aren t property getter or setter

783526
vb.net	vb6
i m sure most of the time the reason companies go forward with vb.net is exactly as you mentioned - large amounts of vb6 in the organization both in terms of codebase and developers

783526
vb.net	vb6
keep in mind that asp websites and vb6 applications can be migrated to vb.net with little to no pain

783534
vb.net	vb6	vbscript	vb6
i m unusual in that i come from a c c++ background know c# but actually prefer vb.net i severely dislike vb6 vbscript

783534
vb.net	vb6
i say all this because it s important to remember the vb6 is not vb.net

783534
vb.net	vb6
i really hated vb6 but i fell in love with vb.net almost instantly

783534
vb.net	vb6
however vb.net did inherit some things from vb6 and not just a syntax style

783535
vb.net	vb6
completely subjective opinion but i d say anyone who jumped on the vb.net bandwagon would have come from a background in vb6 classic asp

783568
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
a have the interface called math that has add subtract divide and multiplying and then i have a class called intmath that implements math that is optimized for integer math and i have another class called floatmath the implements math that is optimized for floating math and i have a generalmath that implements math that handles everything else

783579
postgresql	mysql
database likely mysql or postgresql - sql jdbc

783581
vb.net	vb6
also some companies who jumped .net 1.0 from vb6 thought that vb.net will be the major language which turned out to be a big mistake after couple of years

783588

you haven t explicitly mentioned unit testing but that should certainly be part of the mix - i don t have much experience outside junit as an actual testing framework but there s also easymock and jmock amongst others for mocking of dependencies

783664
put	get
you could try to put your native dll somewhere in the above mentioned dirs and try if you get better results

783665
jsf	seam
if you are going the with a java back-end i would recommend hibernate for your jpa jsf with richfaces ajax skinning and facelets view rendering templating for your front-end and seam to put it all together

783667

chown	chmod
last time i ran into a similar problem i did chmod 777 or was it chown

783745
chown	sudo
i may need to write a script to locally sudo chown lampp lamppusers each time i use a different machine

783764
children	parent
as aaron has already pointed out you can set delete behaviour to cascade and that will delete children records when a parent record is deleted

783778
cvs	svn	perforce	cvs	perforce	svn
there is a good deal of comparing git mercurial is considered to be ok and cvs svn perforce

783794
chown	chmod
i would advise just setting the whole directory to 777 with chmod chown changes ownership as the user and group each user is in will be different on each machine you can t really do better

783828
google-chrome	safari
if you re interested check out a script i wrote -- it s a cheap firebug replacement that doesn t interfere with any normal console like safari or google-chrome but does extend it with almost all the firebug methods

783840
children	parent
basically no you have to make three delete statements in a transaction children first and then parent

783890
prepare	execute
name and prepare execute that

783916

784073
ubuntu	debian
debian packages should work on ubuntu

784078
rss	feed
rss feed for errors

784081
ubuntu	debian
if you want to make a gcc similar to the one shipped with ubuntu apt-get source gcc and look in debian rules for their configure flags they may be applied on multiple lines

784091
ubuntu	debian
if it is in a debian repository it should would under ubuntu no problem

784246
ccl	clisp
clisp and ccl throw the same error though worded slightly differently

784273
versioning	upgrade
otherwise i d just follow their hard upgrade directions which appear to be functionally equivalent to the usual pg_dump pg_restore approach used to upgrade to a new major versioning of postgresql

784328
allocator	stl
it defines a new std allocator which can provide stack-based allocator for the initial allocator of storage for stl containers

784328
int	chars
for example if the string is going to store a decimal-formatted 32-bit int you know that you do not need more than 11 chars to do so

784329
crossover	mutation
you could experiment with the mutation and crossover thanks nathan algorithms to see which do the best job

784352

edit i tried onclick and onchange

784495
cvs	svn
to be honest svn was supposed replace cvs but it s branching model is very close to vss and thus total shit

784495
cvs	svn
if i was given an option between cvs and svn i would chose cvs

784518
width	height
you will need to empirically determine the exact height and width of the pdf

784531
google-chrome	firefox
update this works on firefox google-chrome but not ie

784538
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
arithmetic operation - like addition subtraction multiplication division except

784578
int	chars
isdigit c should be called on a chars not an an int

784595
hash	md5
md5 hash would be faster than comparison but slower than a normal crc-check

784617
mouse	keyboard
in fact i find myself rather unable to complete even single player games before dissecting their mechanics and gaming them in a specifically read-only not cheats per se mouse and keyboard input only fashion

784647
appfuse	spring
appfuse is a spring hibernate app designed to be used as skeleton for new projects

784657
packets	multicast
i wrote some client software to send out a multicast over the lan with a client computer on the same switch as the cluster so that each node in the cluster would receive the packets and respond

784657
wan	lan
it works great except when i run the client software on a computer that has both lan and wan interfaces

784657
wan	multicast
if there is a wan interface the multicast doesn t work

784657
wan	multicast	wan	lan
so obviously i figure the multicast is incorrectly going over the wan interface eth0 rather than the lan eth1. so i use the so_bindtodevice socket option to force the multicast socket to use eth1 and all is well

784657
wan	lan
and is there some way perhaps an ioctl call that i can have the application automatically determine if a particular interface is a lan or wan

784658
inherited	properties
inherited is a general object oriented programming concept whereby one type can be of the same type as another object but introduce new properties and behaviors a lion class could inherited from a mammal class while javabeans are just java objects that adhere to a set of conventions

784659
implements	extends
when objects extends a class or implements an interface on the other hand the properties methods are accessed via that interface superclass

784662
getter	setter
a java bean is a simple class which contains some properties data elements and getter and setter getproperty1 setproperty1 myvalue to read and write those properties

784662
inherited	properties
inherited is an object oriented principle in which one class exhibits the properties and behaviours of another

784694
put	get
of course this is unhealthy note the necessary omission of override on method1 - if you put it back in you will get a compiler error

784706
inherited	subclassing
it can do that because b is derived from inherited subclassing is-a a

784714
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
here is my touchesmoved which i call in the touchesbegan

charindex finds the positon of a specified character patindex of a pattern substr returns a portion of a string by position

784821
disk	ram
you can certainly load the texture from disk into ram in any number of threads you like but opengl won t upload to vram in multiple threads for the reason mentioned in reed s answer

784935
pop-up	dialog
jquery ui has a decent pop-up modal dialog api and i ve worked with the boxy plugin which is very easy to implement

784951
fiddler	charles
if you use a transparent echoing proxy this can show you all http traffic charles and fiddler are two good example i recommend charles

785007
put	get
you can put a long object in to get it work

785007
getter	setter
when the c++ function contains another c++ class as parameter swig generates this c++ class as java object with getter setter and all c++ functions you want to call

785007
perl	tcl
swig is used with different types of languages including common scripting languages such as perl php python tcl and ruby

785009
hide	show
implement the forms as usercontrols instead put them onto the same form and show and hide the controls as appropriate this can also be achieved by loading the forms stripping form borders and such and setting their parent to a panel or something similar

785028
put	get
i think you are going to need to do some user validation and i would be tempted to put keys to the decryption in a separate database and provide some other mechanism to get that out which should require authentication

785059
getter	setter
and it creates setter and getter automatically

785072
sctp	tcp
if you include sctp in the application itself then that will more than double the number of messages being passed into an out of the kernel which will impact performance when compared with using the pre installed tcp

785072
sctp	tcp
i would seriously consider sticking with tcp unless you are sure sctp is needed or unless you control the hosts your app is deployed on

785073
getter	setter
in this case it creates tells the compiler how to create the getter and setter methods for the member variable

785099
onchange	onblur
is there a situation were onchange would be called but onblur would not be called

785108
onchange	onblur
so really they are almost the same thing but for onchange to behave the way onblur does something in that input needs to change

785115
versioning	upgrade
i don t believe the implementation details are set in stone and so potentially an upgrade to a future java versioning could cause problems

785152
inline	inlining
if used more than once definitely make it a function and let the compiler do the inlining possibly adding inline to the function definition

785205
portrait	landscape
i d also like to see - not currently included in the betas - a decent camera api that allowed us to customize the appearance of the capture screen and as another poster said have it work properly in landscape and portrait mode

785209
hex	binary
either as binary perhaps hex or characters

785240
versioning	upgrade
i know that some companies refuse to upgrade ie unless absolutely necessary but seriously i would no longer support ie6 since the current versioning is 8 and most people should have 7 by now

785261
hash	salt
usually a salt hash of the password is stored and compared

785261
hash	salt
the hash should be salt to avoid duplicated hash if the some users have the same passwords

785261
hash	salt
you can calculate the salt hash of the password and store that within your file

785281
serializable	deserialization
use the xmlignore attribute to mark a property to be ingnored in serializable deserialization

785282
google-chrome	firefox
to paste without formatting to a browser firefox google-chrome at least ctrl + â shift + v on windows linux see below for mac os x

785595
int	chars
colorval chars 8 or int depending on how you re representing colors

785627
client-side	server-side
client-side validation preventing a round trip to find out that there s an error is nice-to-have server-side validation verifying that things truly are in order is a must-have

the point is get the current url parameter and put hyperlink with same querystring parameter

785821
getter	setter
i assume it has a getter setter for access to its datastore is it possible to override this code

785837
tiff	png
basically whenever i do a metafile.loadfile ... and take that to save it as a tiff png etc some areas of that source files are missing

785890
versioning	upgrade
if it wasn t fixed by versioning 4.2 you ll have to upgrade to get it

785948
content-disposition	content-type
i have a servlet that sends a file by setting the http content-type to application zip the content-disposition to attachment and writing it on the response s outputstream

785948
google-chrome	firefox
however when deploying on a clustered jboss server ie hangs on 0 requesting file information for the whole transfer and then fails with an error message stating that the file wasn t available for download even stranger is the fact that with firefox and google-chrome the servlet behaves correctly same way as on localhost

786007
int	chars
that will convert a single hex chars upper or lowercase independent into an int

786021
int	double	int	boolean
while this works for other data types such as varchar int double etc it does not with boolean

786023
pop-up	dialog
you need to pop-up a feed dialog to allow this it s not too intrusive though - it works quite well

ruby has jruby rubinius and others -- but as good as these are they can t match the maturity found in the various jvm offerings

786047
post	get
i have have i need for my post but i am racking my brain to get the comments right

786050
hide	show
my workaround so far for what it s worth is hide the control for a couple seconds after the form loads then show it

786051
debugdiag	debugging
you can use debugdiag or the adplus script hang mode in this case that comes with debugging tools for windows

786800
websphere	ibm
there are a number of mature offerings about which i know next to nothing together with a new product from ibm itself websphere mq file transfer edition which is being actively developed and recently announced an updated version 7.0.1

786812
hash	md5
version 3 and version 5 uuids the least common use the md5 and sha1 hash functions respectively plus a namespace plus an already unique data value to produce a unique id

786840
getter	setter
is it necessary to define a public getter and setter for the data members that you want to make available to the view message in the example above

786844
ready	each
it s up to the image display to show the image as each pass is rendered however and i m not sure if flash does this or waits until the completed image is ready

786901
getter	setter
i think the public getter and setter are needed

786951
unsigned	short
it fails to convert -1 to an unsigned short

786973
post	put
using post isn t a cure for such things as you can put together a form post in javascript pretty easily but it s a good start

787040
wmv	asf	wma	asf
i guess silverlight would work best with microsoft technology so i want to use the asf format with wmv wma encoding

787125
webclient	webrequest
i had to deal with this recently - another way to approach it is to use the fact that webclient is inheritable and change the underlying webrequest from there

787132
ccl	ecl
however my plan is to use ccl to build an application bundle on os x and ecl to build a stand-alone executable on linux and windows

787132
ccl	ecl
my impression is that the fastest but most expensive route to doing application delivery across those three oses is to buy allegro but an alternative more work but cheaper would be to use ccl on os x corman on win32 and ecl or sbcl on linux

787132
glut	sdl	glut	glfw	glfw	sdl
my impression is that the situation is constantly improving callbacks in cffi seem to work on most platforms now which is a big help in interfacing to most c toolkits but i ve been working more with gl glfw glut and sdl though not yet with lispbuilder mentioned by justinhj above which looks cool

787142

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	webkit	gecko
same managed programming interface but is implemented with the gecko engine from firefox and an alternate implementation with the webkit engine from google-chrome and safari

787400
drawrect	touchesmoved
touchx and touchy were instance variables and they were getting reset in touchesmoved before each call to drawrect was complete

787400
drawrect	touchesmoved
therefore if i moved fast on the screen touchesmoved would get called then call drawrect then touchesmoved would get called again before drawrect had used touchx and touchy so the drawing would get out of sync with the boolean array backend

787400
drawrect	touchesmoved
to solve this i stopped using touchx and touchy in drawrect and started deriving the same point by using the dirty rect that was being passed in from touchesmoved

787448
primitive	reference-type
i ve found documentation for marshaling primitive from c++ to c# but i m not sure how to handle reference-type or non-pritmive types such as vmloader or optionlist both of which are classes

787488
wordpress	joomla
just look at wordpress especially the new 2.7 release drupal a very popular cms and joomla another very popular cms

787497
udp	tcp
because it uses udp it won t unduly stress the network via tcp retries and the like snmp clients are or should be architected to handle dropped packets etc.

787500
opera	firefox
this simple code works fine on firefox and opera

787505
winpcap	wireshark
using wireshark installs winpcap which may be overriding the changes the malware made or the malware may simply detect it is being monitored and not attempt anything fishy

787520
int	chars
but going back to the specific case of visual c++ even if you call delete the compiler will realize that it doesn t need to iterate through the array calling destructors when it s an array of primitive types like int chars or pointers

787576
puts	gets
the first query gets all of the news articles and puts them in an array

787578
websphere	ibm

notice that he makes no mention of ienumerable nor ienumerator

787603
nsinteger	double
assign is for primitive values like bool nsinteger or double

787638
pull	push
do developers often push and pull code to and from each other or does everything go via the central repository

787646
gtk	gdk
the step from gtk import gdk suggested by lukasz is necessary and has to precede creation of the pixbuf otherwise you will not get the save method as observed by the original poster

787722
postgresql	mysql
i m switching from mysql to postgresql and was wondering how i can do autoincrement values

787724
outputstream	inputstream	gzipinputstream	gzipoutputstream
jpeg is lossy so if you need the exact same image on the other side you can use a gzipoutputstream on top of the socket s outputstream to send the compressed data and receive it on the other side through a gzipinputstream on top of the socket s inputstream

787726
getter	setter
actually i do the to_i bit in an override of the attribute s setter and reverse the process in the getter

787796

each istream and ostream has its own locale

787834
getter	setter
i have to confess that i tried some other codes and example getter setter type with dispatchevent or without and i can t get over it

787841
post	get
get requests should not have side-effects - all actions should be done using post requests only

787859
width	height
you would want to use this over height width so you don t accidentally scale an image up

787859
width	height
you would just want to limit the maximum height width proportionately

787864
hash	salt
when you generate the hash together in the same statement in 2000 they end up with the same salt random seed number at the beginning which makes them identical

787864
hash	salt
you always have the same salt at the beginning of the hash where as in 2005 its always different

787864
hash	salt
if you can generate the hash with the same salt then you can compare them which means trying a brute force or dictionary attack have a look at this article on how to do it

787869
post	get
looking at the log my post is getting changed into a get

787876

moq	typemock
rhinomocks moq and typemock all depend on things that are not available in .net cf

788011
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it would be really easy with getrange i do not need internet explorer compatibility so getrange which work for firefox google-chrome and safari is ok if the text was plain text

788044
firefox	safari
the user agent switching is not a mode all it does is makes safari report the ie firefox etc user agent -- so navigator.useragent will report the ua of a different browser

788079
multiplying	add
in other words as you process each digit from left to right multiplying the previous total by the base effectively moving it left one position then add the new digit

788097
hex	binary
since four binary digits are identical to a single hex digit you can simply convert each hex digit to binary individually then string them together

788137
jruby	mri
i have jruby and ruby mri installed

788137
jruby	mri
after i installed the rails gem for mri should i have pointed jruby to it or was it necessary for me to also call jruby -s gem install rails

788150
int	double
in the line in sub search that says dtf.keys idx 0 place your cursor after the right parenthesis and backspace you should get a tooltip that says extension elementatordefault index as int as double - index the zero based element of the index to retrieve

788153
nunit	mstest
you have probably figured this out already but with visual studio 2008 professional the best way is to use mstest i m an nunit guy through and through but this is it

788161
qtreeview	qheaderview	qtreewidget	qtreeview	qtreewidget	qheaderview
if your tree widget is called treewidget you should be able to call the header method which is from qtreewidget s parent qtreeview then sortindicatororder from the qheaderview class

788185
udp	tcp
packet may be udp tcp layer 2 frame

788193
cpu	processors
domain-specific vector processors with highly specialized instruction sets like modern gpus for gaming would be able to handle these tasks much more efficiently than a high power general-purpose cpu

788195
jruby	mri
why are jruby and mri different in the way they treat gems

788220
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
for consistency with the enumerable linq operators throw an argumentnullexception not a nullreferenceexception

788228
interbase	firebird
zend framework has support for firebird and interbase in the extras you must download the full package instead of minimum package

788233
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
argumentnullexception or nullreferenceexception from extension method

788240
getter	setter
you should define a class state having two attributes code and name with getter and setter getcode and getname

788253
uninstall	upgrade
after i have installed it how can i upgrade and uninstall it

788301
setinterval	settimeout
the only things i know that will take a string and eval it other than eval are settimeout and setinterval

788354
jobs	cron
many of them allow you to run cron jobs

788411
daemons	launchd
i have a python daemons running as a part of my web app how can i quickly check using python if my daemons is running and if not launchd it

788517
postgresql	mysql
i know this is not what sqlite was designed for i am less interested in a postgresql mysql sql server based solution as i am trying to keep my app a light as possible with a minimal amount of dependencies

788569
nsstring	nsdata
can i get nsstring or nsdata object from it

788572
post	get
now if the request is made as post or anything else than get the first f5 refresh page the user will make the browser will gently ask are you sure you want to do that

788662
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview that has an image and some buttons as its subviews

788676
postgresql	mysql
we help them package their server software which is typically based on php java or ruby together with a web server or application server apache tomcat the language runtime and a database typically postgresql mysql into a self-contained easy to use installer

788696
post	get
consider using ben copsey s asihttprequest framework for generating and sending synchronous and asynchronous htttp requests post and get

788700
queue	fifo
rather than specifically coding in the two variables i implemented them inside of a fifo queue

788716
post	get
you can use this to issue get requests where variables are encoded in the url or post requests where the variables go in the body of the request

788716
post	get
you won t need to download or parse the form itself at runtime if the structure of the form doesn t change you can hard-code the variable names in your program at the point where you construct the get or post request

788722
post	get
the general idea that you have is correct though normally a html form will perform a post back to the server rather than a get

788722
post	get
you can tell is a form is a get or post by looking at the method in it s opening tag

788826
rss	feed
what you are getting is not a webpage but an rss feed

788840
stateless	stateful
web is stateless by nature and desktop is stateful

788881
width	height
if i dont set width and height of b he will resize accordingly to a size up to a certain point where a has scrollbars which is the good behavior

788881
width	height
i can solve it by setting a percent width and height of 100 to b when i do a

788881
width	height
if i remove percent height and width it will be the whole canvas as expected

788881
width	height
what would be perfect is keeping the percent height and width while child width is smaller than parent a width

788882
put	get
is there a different space character that we can put into the accepted result to get the test to pass

788886
int	chars
take a look at the code points at index 2 by casting the chars to int to get your answer

788974
ssl	https
i have an old site that now doesn t have an ssl and i want to block access to all https pages

788975
min	max
also i have several variables for min and max latitude longitude

789006
min	max
if you wanted to you could use an aggregate function ie max min on table2 this would eliminate the duplicate rows from table1 but would also hide some of the data from table2

789020
firefox	safari
unless you re distributing the browser you won t be able to dictate when ie firefox safari etc

789043
folder	directory
how can you move all files except directory in a folder to a folder in terminal

789047
client-side	server-side
we have been using the spaw editor for a few years now which you handle and code via php instead of javascript so its a server-side coding perspective instead of client-side

789085
int	chars
that s why i mentioned of thinking of using 64 chars web-safe alphanumberic non-reserved chars and then some since then i could create seemingly random urls which could be unpacked to a list of int expressing a set of id numbers

789092
inherited	properties
the datacontext properties will be inherited so to speak by all of the inner children

789096
division	modulo
let be integer division whole numbers and be modulo

789118
awt	swing	swt	swing
a bit more specifically things like swing which has those jpanels jbuttons and so on you mentioned as ui components and swt are currently based on awt and work on top of it to render the ui and allow it to work as expected

789118
awt	swing
there s been a lot of reinventing the wheel to achieve swing awt kind of ui creation on the java s web side since it s a clever model like you seem to already know google web toolkit tries to do its part to make web seem more like a desktop application while in reality it merely automates the needed javascript ajax underneath to make the web page behave as if it was a desktop application

789134
x86	64bit
on a 64bit machine the programfiles environment variable will actually point to the program files x86 directory for a 32 bit application

789190
ubuntu	debian
fyi in ubuntu and or debian the scripts are at etc bash_completion.d

789280
versioning	upgrade
and then again jumping major versioning numbers means increased revenue by way of user upgrade

789280
opera	firefox
there are cross-browser development issues between ie firefox opera etc but it s much easier to test and debug than say running a complex application on a desktop system with varying graphics processors anti-virus software or builds

789298
radiobuttonlist	onclientclick
in the case of the radiobuttonlist the onclientclick attribute is rendered on the element but the unrecognized oncluck element is rendered on the enclosing element

789378
bash	zsh
if you re using bash 4.0 or zsh

789388
jboss	weblogic
the application can be deployed on both weblogic websphere jboss

789413
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
this line is from a man page for calloc malloc realloc and free

789416
queue	fifo
a queue consumer processes the messages fifo and sends a response that gets routed back to the web service

789448
unsigned	short
unsigned int short unsigned int

789448
unsigned	short
unsigned int short unsigned int

789476
int	double
also while you re at it there is no need to convert to a string then to a double - you can convert directly from int - double and avoid the string conversions

789499
implements	extends
what if i have a class that both extends an abstract class and implements an interface for example

789503
vim	emacs
the question does not refer to some vim-mode in emacs but to vim inside emacs

789503
vim	emacs
i just want to use vim in emacs

789503
vim	emacs
you can get to vim in emacs with commands m-x term and vim

789503
vim	emacs
how can i get vim properly working in emacs

789511
solaris	aix
is it more a problem on aix than solaris or windows

789517
pop-up	dialog
i have a button on a jframe that when clicked i want a dialog box to pop-up with multiple text areas for user input

789536
tapestry	wicket	tapestry	struts	struts	wicket
some technologies that i have been looking at are spring wicket struts guice hibernate and tapestry

789536
tapestry	wicket
i am a bit wary of tapestry and wicket

789537
inherited	properties
with csla.net all domain classes need to inherited from businessbase which contains non-virtual properties

789571
struts	stripes
very simply if you are comfortable with jsps and servlets then if you want to save some of the drudgery of web programming i would look at stripes or struts 2

789571
struts	stripes
i am very familiar with stripes and only am aware that struts 2 is similar so i will focus this entry on stripes

789571
put	get
on top of that you get if you use their form tags you get nice behaviors when for example they put fred in your date field

789577
gif	png
how it works is simple you have the small youtube image as transparent png or gif and then set the background image as the larger image this will then give the effect of the smaller image being in the center with no extra markup

789595
children	parent
mousechildren means it s children don t register mouse events they just dispatch from the parent

789596
vim	emacs
what you re seeing is that the terminal setting term in your shell vim session doesn t match what the emacs terminal is doing

789618
division	modulo
it s most likely that means integer division by modulo - the result is within 0..360 range

789631
width	margin
but one thing you should remember when floating elements is that they will only take up the space they require this includes margin and padding unless you set a fixed width

789643
vim	emacs
for all purpose editors vim and emacs come to mind but i m afraid they just cannot compete against vs08 resharper when it comes to c# which i m using a lot on this moment

789643
vim	emacs
and like asked on the side how about refactoring in vim emacs

789655
treemap	treeset
a little look into treemap treeset and comparable would have probably pushed you through this problem

789679
bids	ssas
likewise microsoft also uses bids to help developers dbas and analysts create data cubes - multidimensionally joined tables using a specialized schema that allows sql server analysis services ssas to churn through pretty much any combination of data relations in order to provide analytical data

789722
udp	tcp
first you mean protocol in the sense of the available operations â a perfectly reasonable usage but confusing when you confound it with tcp vs udp that sort of thing as i did

789722
udp	tcp
named pipes but then my intuition says you also have the option of local and remote which means you also have the option of udp or tcp

789731
versioning	upgrade
our development process has us leaving dependencies external to the current build at the previous release versioning until a fix requires an upgrade

789744
uicontrol	uibutton
one way of thinking of a uibutton is as a shorthand way of setting up an area of the screen that can respond to various instantaneous touch events the response it makes is defined by uicontrol s target-action system for delivering messages to other objects

789744
post	get
if this still doesn t solve your problem you re going to have to post some code in order to get more insight into what s going wrong

789762
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller is to navigate a heirarchy of views with uiviewcontroller

789781
qmail	exim
common mta s are postfix exim and qmail

789784
vim	emacs
i say it is diverse but in reality the majority of linux development is actually very similar using a collection of common tools gcc gdb grep find vim emacs ctags cscope and some source repository of choice

789793
submit	submission
when submission screen grabs for an iphone app during the approval process is it ok to submit screens that are different than what is represented on the app itself

789803
jboss	weblogic
can t do anything specific to weblogic websphere or jboss

789863
vmware	virtualbox	vmware	esx	virtualbox	esx
i do all my sharepoint work on a virtualbox in our vmware esx server and it works like a charm

789863
vmware	virtualbox
i run both vmware and the new virtualbox software on my laptop but that is just for fun as the performance is below what i would accept in my daytime job

789899
pull	push
do developers often push and pull code to and from each other or does everything go via the central repository

789906
nswindow	nsbutton
i have created a simple nswindow with an nstextfield and an nsbutton in interface builder on leopard

789911
aptana	radrails
plus aptana supports python pydev as welll as ruby on rails radrails in case you come across them in near future

789931
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
i ve heard good things about team foundation svn git bazaar and mercurial

789931
bazaar	cvs	bazaar	svn	cvs	svn
i ve used cvs clearcase mercurial svn and a little bazaar

789936
realloc	malloc
the more appropriate way to hold this information is in a style that is very c like and used in c++ as vectors automatically-resized blocks of contiguous memory using malloc and realloc

789936
qsort	strcmp
since we ve got a built-in implementation of qsort that uses a function pointer all we have to do is wrap strcmp for use with these types and pass the address in

789954
boost	stl
i googled for stl filter iterator to see how to do this and boost filter_iterator came up

790000
mockups	balsamiq
depending on how close you are to implementing something balsamiq mockups may be what you want

790068
versioning	upgrade
they way i do it is to keep the dependencies at the last release versioning until a change actually requires an upgrade to the next snapshot

790070
xna	slimdx
if you don t want some of the overhead of xna i ve found slimdx to be a very nice little framework

790070
xna	slimdx
xna and slimdx give you access to shaders very fine grained control of alpha blending as well as the potential to easily extend portions into 3d later if needed

790073
jar	war
forcing maven to produce a war and a jar in the same module is possible but will cause you problems down the road

790079
keydown	keyup
if memory serves when i implemented this in webkit it was necessary to make the keycode be 229 on keydown for all keys typed in an ime for compat with ie -- but i cannot recall what the behaviour of keyup is

790098
folder	directory
i generally create a separate application folder - complete with its own controller and view directory as well as a public directory for static content - for the entire administration system

790099
keydown	keyup
if memory serves when i implemented this in webkit it was necessary to make the keycode be 229 on keydown for all keys typed in an ime for compat with ie -- but i cannot recall what the behaviour of keyup is

790134
filtering	grouping
it supports filtering mapping grouping etc

790158
opera	safari
safari and opera go to the right place

790159
post	get
is there any way that user submits the form using image instead of the form button while the request made is still the post rather than get

790211
put	get
so you need to learn how to make that request with jquery and put the html you get from the request into the page at the right point

790224
joptionpane	jcomponent
most of the time the message parameter in joptionpane is a string but you can pass in a jcomponent or array of jcomponent as well

790258
width	height
take the greater of width max dx and height max dy

790302
fseek	fread
take a look at fseek and fread from stdio.h

790337
firefox	safari
100 repeatable with firefox no problem on safari i don t have windows installed on this box

790370
opera	firefox
so what i want to know is how to create an object considering browser compatibility firefox opera etc and whether the usages of it are same

790380
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	webkit	gecko
it is not a standard but it is supported at least on webkit safari google-chrome etc and gecko firefox

790394
hide	show
if you need some kind of hot state then you have to use small images which are absolutely positioned above the original image and show hide them using javascript

790422
width	height
width height image decompressed and image compressed length are always the same

790473
rar	zip
it s much better compressing than zip rar

790477
min	max
how can i get max date and min date from a list date column

790503
quicksort	heapsort
i d use heapsort rather than quicksort because you said you only need to look at the top few values

790505
post	get
a cgi program renders the page on each http get post on reload submit etc

790514
mouseup	mousedown
strangely although your click event isn t firing in ie if you change it to either mousedown or mouseup it works as you d expect although you still have your image hover issue

790545
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses a fork of webkit if you didn t know which is also used by safari

790650
elf	coff
2 compile and convert generated elf object file to coff object seems like objcopy of gnu binutils could help me with that

790650
elf	coff
then i tried to convert elf object to coff format and i can t find any information on that

790653
bazaar	git
with a dvcs like git bazaar or mercurial this is dead easy as it requires no changes in the central repository

790670
stdout	stderr
basically what i ve done below is print stupid messages to stdout stderr depending on how much memory is being used

790701
np-hard	np-complete
to be np-hard you have to prove a problem h is np-hard if and only if there is an np-complete problem l that is polynomial time turing-reducible to h ... in other words l can be solved in polynomial time by an oracle machine with an oracle for h.

790729
queue	fifo
this won t have queue fifo characteristics but will allow you multiple consumers in a very easy fashion

790744
rsa	dsa
a practical introduction to gnu privacy guard in windows recommends dsa and elgamal but i would like to know if rsa is good enough to use these days and if so what minimum key size should i use

790758
rsa	dsa
rsa dsa minimum today is 1024 bit actually so elleptical curves becoming more in use since they are faster and using shorter keys

790758
rsa	dsa
email clients using certificates nowadays - so it s separate thing x.509 but for using with rsa dsa most common option is sha-1 somewhat weak now

790767
gridview	repeater
if the problem is getting the id from the checkbox within a repeater then this article might help select all checkboxes in a gridview

790767
gridview	datalist	gridview	repeater	datalist	repeater
you want to access a control that is in a control that repeats layout gridview repeater datalist and the like using javascript

790772
folder	directory
create a folder in the app views directory of your application called shared and store the partial there

790787
rsa	dsa
as for key size whether rsa or elgammel dsa i would recommend 2048 bit keys anyway now

790787
rsa	dsa
the difference is rsa is based on factorial math while elgammel dsa is based on logarithmic math neither can necessarily be considered better or worse to not though i that elliptic curve based stuff is closely related to the logarithms stuff

790846
opera	firefox
firefox and opera work fine so im really not sure what i am doing wrong here

790864
nullreferenceexception	argumentexception
for example throw argumentexception instead of nullreferenceexception for a null this

790914
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko
have look at the mono.webbrowser control - it embeds either gecko as used by firefox or webkit as used by safari into winforms without using activex

790915
emacs	textmate
i m talking about a more thorough sdk experience than just editing files with textmate emacs and copying them over to the device

791021
postgresql	mysql
several have been built on top of open-source technologies like mysql and postgresql but none are available for free

791021
vertica	greenplum
if you are in the buying mood check out these companies greenplum asterdata netezza vertica

791024
folder	directory
look into the repository directory and you ll find a hooks folder with a ton of sample scripts

791093
cpython	ironpython
it s not possible to make object monkeypatchable without deeply messing with the c-coded internals and recompiling the python runtime to make a very different version this is for the classic cpython but i believe exactly the same principle holds for other good implementations such as jython and ironpython just s c java and s c c# respectively

791119
children	parent
as you visit a node you point its left-child pointer to its parent its right-child pointer to the last time you took a right turn on your path which is to be found in the parent s right-child pointer at this moment and store its real children either in the now-redundant parent s right-child pointer or in your traversal state resp

791146
inherited	properties
your implementation is problematic because you re replacing the entire prototype object losing the properties of the inherited function prototype and it would also break or at least make it more difficult the ability to make use of inherited later on if you wrote other classes the same way

791184
put	get
this will work even if you are not root since it only fetch the source code to the app-name and put it in the current directory which is easier than having to track down the source and there is a better chance to get it work since you download the version that should work on your system

791187
inherited	properties
secondly because i m using an abstract method i am forced to go to the o r designer and change the inherited properties of every id field in my system to override

791221
entity-relationship	diagram
just wondering whats the difference between entity-relationship diagram 1 and entity-relationship diagram 2

791249
width	margin
create a wide margin at least the width of your sidebar for your content container

791270
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to set up my wpf application so that when an exception goes unhandled an error dialog pop-up

791270
pop-up	dialog
if i use showdialog the window is usable until it s closed and then the same ...has stopped working... dialog pop-up and dies

791290
getattr	isinstance
you can do introspection in elixir as you would anywhere in python -- get all names of attributes of class foo with dir foo extract an attribute given its name with getattr foo thename check the type of the attribute with type theattr or isinstance etc

791290
getattr	isinstance
module inspect in the python standard library may be a friendlier way to do introspection but dir getattr isinstance c are perfectly acceptable in many cases

791294
visualvm	btrace
visualvm with btrace or the built in trace claims to help with tracing but i haven t been able to find any tool that shows timing on method calls

791294
min	max
i found one of the answers i wanted in the qeurystatistics which reports for each compiled query the cache hits and misses the number of times the query has run how many rows were returned and the average max and min execution times

791306
width	height
honestly all i really want to know is the width and height of the page

791317
width	height
where x and y are the width and height of the window you want

791395
swt	swing
swt is an alternate toolkit for java that has slightly less cross-platform compatibility than swing but is still popular nonetheless

791413
put	get
this dereferences one time too many - myballs is an array of pointers or put another way a pointer to the first element of an array of pointers - just lose the asterisk in front of myballs and now you ll get the pointer from which you can access the struct or alternatively turn the - into a .

791436
comparator	comparable
one option is to implement the comparable interface and then override comparator

791436
comparator	comparable
you may be better of avoiding implementing comparable and create a comparator object and there s a version of collections.sort that takes the comparator

791458
min	max
warning myclass may not respond to +mymethod min max

791465
min	max
however i see that your error message complains about the signature + mymethod min max which also suggests you re trying to send the message to the class rather than an instance of the class

791486
versioning	upgrade
but the versioning of rubygems and rails shipped with leopard are now outdated though so you ll need to upgrade these before you go too far

791486
versioning	upgrade
to upgrade your private copy of rails whenever a new versioning comes along in future it s just this again

791495
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade the rtm versioning of visual studio 2008 with sp1 the entitydatasource control doesn t appear in the data group of the web project toolbox by default

791544
textarea	textbox
it shouldn t matter whether the field is a textbox textarea radio or select

791571
gridview	repeater
i m trying to extend a custom repeater i have in order to display in a tabular fashion reasonably similar to a gridview

791583
hide	show	hide	fadeout
i tried to show an error message using the jquery effect fadeto and tried to hide the message by appending a button and using fadeout but doesn t seem to work

791600
cil	ildasm
for cil msil i can write the code in a text editor and compile decompile with ilasm ildasm

791647
int	chars
255 is being processed as an int literal and causes the entire expression to be int based rather than unsigned chars based

791652
inherited	properties
if you want to access this from outside the listbox then exposing the scrollviewer via a properties should work again through inherited

791669
width	height
if you just need the page width and height i think pageformat.getimageablewidth and

791727
opera	firefox
explorer mozilla firefox opera and

791741
inherited	properties
i m experimenting with textarea and inherited to implement some additional functionality on the protected textfield properties

791775
width	height
for instance the first slide only has a picture in it 400px width 300px height but the next slide has lots of info including pictures text and video content totalling at 400px width and 800px in height

791799
freemarker	velocity
templating systems like freemarker and velocity make it much easier to generate markup

791807
multiplying	add
however because it can perform some combination of multiplying and add it s also used to optimize some regular calculations

791826
equals	compareto
if people subclassing your given class are allowed to add state members then you already have enough of a headache with functions like equals and compareto that clone is jut one more case where you need to require special handling

apache	nginx
so my vote is to skip a night of drinking a month and learn ubuntu servers setup dns vhosts apache etc capistrano deployment svn and mongrel nginx passenger while you learn rails

791836
cpu	processors
the internals of processors inside a single family have changed a lot over the years so that eu reference would need to be clarified with the exact cpu model

791865
asihttprequest	cfnetwork
this doesn t answer your question directly but you might consider looking into ben copsey s asihttprequest library which wraps around cfnetwork classes and includes asynchronous threaded request code that takes a lot of work out of doing this properly

791897
jar	war
i have a j2ee app deployed as an ear file which in turn contains a jar file for the business layer code including some ejbs and a war file for the web layer code

791897
jar	war
the ear file is deployed to jboss 3.2.5 which unpacks the ear and war files but not the jar file this is not the problem it s just fyi

791942
equals	gethashcode
this seems to allow its correct use in dictionary and collection classes that rely on the equals and gethashcode methods for determining if the value already exists

791964
put	get
i don t think i would put either in production unless it was as a stopgap to get something critical out of the door in a major hurry or as a proof of concept or prototype

792028
integer	unsigned	subtraction	addition
modern computers since circa 1970 use a representation of integer data called two s-complement in which addition and subtraction work exactly the same on both signed and unsigned numbers

792032
internationalization	localization
that combined with decent message catalog support makes internationalization and localization pretty easy except for right-to-left languages

792076
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
you ll need a crossdomain.xml or clientaccesspolicy.xml in place on the remote servers to allow silverlight to communicate with them

792092
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i ve updated the color changing methods so that the background color can be animated when called from touchesbegan but not implicitly animated when called from touchesmoved

792160
put	get
i ve put an instance of the client proxy for the wcf service into a property on the app class so i can get it from anywhere in the app

792190
put	get
just to get my program compiling i just want to put placeholders for now

792194
google-chrome	firefox
the following effectively resolved the disabled buttons not showing up as grayed out in firefox and google-chrome

792211
yacc	bison
lex and yacc flex and bison

792212
postgresql	mysql
i m running mysql and postgresql on a netbook

792215
yacc	bison
it is not clear that there is a c++ target but the chances are high that the c target can easily be used with c++. i m still old school and tend to use yacc or bison but that s because i m familiar with it rather than because it is still the best though it is still good

792225
free	malloc
so while it may tell you something about theoretical limits it says very little about the performance of real garbage collectors versus real implementations of malloc and free

792225
free	malloc
a study that i like better took real programs and compared explicit malloc and free with hans boehm s conservative garbage collector

792225
free	malloc
- in real programs originally written to use malloc and free garbage-collected versions run at about the same speed but require twice as much memory

792233
profiling	benchmarking
if you are really worried use a profiling or write a benchmarking

792244
google-chrome	firefox
this effectively resolved the disabled buttons not showing up as grayed out in firefox and google-chrome

792274
bazaar	git
it is often the case that scientific programming requires input output of gigantic files and that kills performances very quickly on every dvcs i know of bazaar hg git

792303
chm	rtf
i have a large number of basic text rtf html pdf and chm files that i store on a usb key as a personal knowledge base

792319
bazaar	git
bazaar is such a fast moving target and presumably so is git that any claims about performance are likely to be out of date by the time you read them

792341
post	get
there are a couple of good post already on how to get the lines of the file so i thought i would add a bit about efficiency

792370
getter	setter
even if the getter or setter just wraps a private field it is good style to have these setter and getter as opposed to allowing direct field access

792394
range	minimum
but i want a substring that range from length 2 to 6 and print the substring of minimum length

792423
google-chrome	safari
oh and don t forget your safari google-chrome and ff2 testing

792460
floating-point	integer
the difference between each floating-point number and its corresponding integer is less than 1 or equal to 1 if you really must

792476
subtract	add
to get the next integer you add the next fp number to your running total round the running total then subtract the integer running total from the rounded running total -

792520
folder	directory
removed .svn lock files from each of the directory leading to the images folder

792520
folder	directory
moved the images directory to home folder and committed deleted images

792525
getter	setter
add your indexed getter and setter too of course

792570
post	get
if you post the code that you tried you may get a more detailed response as to what is going wrong

792572
dictionary	map
this could be a model object or it could just be a bag of values dictionary map hashtable

792599
serializable	deserialization
if your class is enum-like it should mean that it should contain no serializable state - deserialization should be possible from its type alone a sort of an id as you said

792621
pull	push
eventually i realized it would make much more sense to have a separate repository a bare clone that doesn t have any files in it then have computer b push to it and computer a pull from it

792629
ant	maven
what about all those build systems like ant scons maven rake etc

792632
implements	extends
hadoop mapper interface extends jobconfigurable and closeable but i see a big difference because it s a framework that uses user code implements those interfaces versus a service that could have multiple implementations

792634
addeventlistener	onload
from that you can see the relevant part is simply to note a datestamp immediately before the iframe is encountered and then add an event handler to the iframes onload event which will work regardless of the domain of the iframe source and doesn t require modifying the content to take another measurement normally i d add these events with addeventlistener attachevent but you get the idea

792638
queue	fifo
rather than letting those methods directly change state i put their parameters by converting them to a command object in a fifo queue erlang s mailbox and a react method which processes that queue

792649
vsto	add-in
i m working on a ms word add-in vsto

792662
udp	tcp
http commonly used tcp udp

792665
getter	setter
there is relatively little value in making a field private if you are going to add a getter and setter

792714
accessor	properties
yes - getfoo and setfoo are accessor methods for a properties named foo - this is part of the javabeans specification

792714
getter	setter
many people misunderstand the concept and believe that encapsulation just means writing setter and getter for private properties instead of making them public - and then rightfully consider that idiotic

792764
vmware	virtualbox
run vmware virtualbox

792971
post	get
i know i have to style my file input but how to get it to post automatically on file selection

793008
spweb	spsite
notification handlers -- it will be the spweb spsite or spwebapplication that the feature was activated on -- and you could save yourself writing a configuration interface just to have users set which webs your timer job should work with and which not

793015
width	height
as per the title how would i fit text into a uilabel when the width and height are not proportional

793015
width	height
in my application the label has a width of 100 height of 500 and font size of 400

793096
postgresql	mysql
since it sounds like you are going for the classic lamp setup you may as well install postgresql or mysql

793123
nexus	artifactory
we used to use artifactory but ended up switching to nexus a while back

793131
gridview	rowdatabound
on your gridview rowdatabound method check to see if the data item is the dummy row make sure the rowtype is a datarow first before trying to check the data

793146
rtl	vhdl
i recommend the chu pong p. rtl hardware design using vhdl

793193
maven	pom.xml
as of version 2.0.9 maven uses pom.xml order for classpath so you can actually manipulate it now

793204
int	double	int	chars
if you look in the documentation for string format specifiers you can find out exactly what chars to use for each type of replacement int double object etc

793227
ubuntu	linux
elfedit would have probably been a nice tool but i have not found a version for linux in particular ubuntu

793267
organization	naming
rather have a sane naming convention and be consistent with your organization

793285
portrait	landscape
if you want to force it to rotate from portrait to landscape here is the code

793289
int	chars
read will return int but after checking that they are not -1 indicating end-of-file you can cast that int to a chars

793302
subtraction	addition
you can also carry out operations such as addition and subtraction to calculate time between two timespans or to calculate a new time based on a time and duration

793320
stateless	stateful
also they are stateful struts 1 actions were stateless

793342
inherited	subclassing
we create a subclassing of system.web.ui.masterpage and make sure all of our master pages inherited from our specialised masterpage so that every page gets these classes added on for free

793547
inherited	subclassing
this means that your subclassing would inherited the static variable from the parent and thus the instance as well

793559
draggable	droppable
i want to use jquery draggable droppable to let the user select a group of objects each one has a checkbox in the corner and then drag all the selected objects as a group.

793616
width	height
creating a rectangle based on origin and width height mapped against an array index

793637
richfaces	icefaces
i think it makes no sense to mix icefaces with richfaces

793646
recv	epoll
it s strange that after the client has closed the connection epoll still can poll recv and send events

793659
return-value-optimization	nrvo
as others have already pointed out this is the case of the name return-value-optimization nrvo

793679
hash	whirlpool
i m trying to insert binary data a whirlpool hash into a pg table and am getting an error

793712
scatter	graphing
i ve currently got prefuse to plot a scatter graphing where the x axis is the computer name and the y axis is its temperature

793737
getter	setter
for example when you select you want something green it updates a getter setter in the singleton to be green

793737
getter	setter
then when the application needs to know what color was selected it gets the info from the same getter setter

793747
subtract	add
just look at the first or last element and add or subtract 1

793755
httprequest	httpresponse
i m new at using the the libraries webclient httpresponse and httprequest in c# so bare over with me if my question is confusing to read

793804
rss	feed
they provide calendar event feed in rss and custom xml

793857
tiff	png
it is capable of reading writing png s and at least capable of reading tiff writing should be supported too

793902
directwrite	direct2d
is anybody know how to enable direct2d and directwrite features in xp and vista

793902
directwrite	direct2d
direct2d and directwrite were introduced in windows 7

793928
folder	directory
i m assuming you re referring to the web-inf directory in the root of the web application folder structure

793933
min	max
max or min will work on a char field

793943
keydown	keyup
you can do a simple test to see if any keydown keyup events are triggered when you press the buttons

793966
int	boolean
you could create an ivalueconverter which converts an int to a boolean based on the cutoff

793968
folder	directory
if you are absolutely sure the content is in the right folder then it s probably the server that doesn t let anything to be served from the bin directory for obvious security reasons

793995
postgresql	mysql
they are equivalent for all 4 major database systems oracle sql server mysql postgresql

793996
directx	direct2d
direct2d is built on directx 10.1 so will not work on xp since directx 10 is vista+ only

793996
directx	directwrite	directx	direct2d	directwrite	direct2d
direct2d and directwrite technical previews are both currently available in the march 2009 directx sdk

794031
post	get
1 is there a way i can get around having the post method of search without using javascript on the client side

794031
post	get
unfortunately i don t think i can do that from a form without javascript at least . is there a way i can get around having the post without using javascript

794036
vb6	vba
apparently this used to be a way in vb6 and vba to short circuit and execute the first true case

794037
versioning	upgrade
if this still yields the same result you should probably upgrade your versioning

794127
rss	feed
for instance if you have any sort of news or events feed then provide rss feed for those

794243
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox opera safari and google-chrome all work without problems

794244
min	max
i have an array of doubles and need to do a calculation on that array and then find the min and max value that results from that calculation

794314
post	get
i m new to nhibernate and trying to get my head around the proper way to update detached objects from a web application form post

794345
post	get
i m surprised i didn t see this mentioned in the other post but you can use managementfactory in java 5 6 to get at a lot of the memory usage information

794361
int	chars
are you sure that the sizes of chars and int variables are the same between the c and fortran code

794362
children	parent
when the items are checked make them children of the group object when unselected set them back as children of the document body or static parent or whatever

794414
hide	show
an alternative would be to show the dialog hide it immediately show a topmost progress form instead and then hide that but i think showing a single dialog is more seamless an experience for the user

794434
int	chars
the binary number could be an unsigned int two s complement int an ieee floating point number a string of chars or something else entirely

794434
integer	unsigned
so 7 in two s complement notation is 00000111 just as it is as an unsigned integer

794434
integer	unsigned
so yes positive integers in two s complement notation are represented the same way they are with unsigned integers assuming it is a valid integer for the number of bits being used

794464
min	max
now perform a sortof binary search starting with min b max end of the list

794464
range	max	range	min	min	max
if the element at p is greater than p-b+1 recurse on the range min pivot otherwise recurse on the range pivot max

794464
min	max
continue until min pivot max o lg n

794467
sharpsvn	visualsvn-server
has any one tried to access visualsvn-server repositories through asp.net using sharpsvn api

794474
post	get
if you want to avoid it you need to use get method instead of post

794499
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
resizing the input doesn t work in safari or google-chrome just firefox and opera

794513
google-chrome	safari
have you checked the page referenced to see if safari google-chrome webkit have different values for the enter key

794514
return-value-optimization	nrvo
just for completeness with the other answers the standard allows the compiler to omit the copy constructor in certain situations what other answers refer to as return-value-optimization or named return-value-optimization - return-value-optimization nrvo

794584
firefox	safari
it works in safari but not in firefox 3.08 3.1 beta3

794601
trie	tree
i m currently implementing a radix tree patricia trie whatever you want to call it

794686
min	max
using the code below you can get a random integer between min 1 and max 365 then using the dateadd funection you can create random dates in the last year

794693
profiler	yourkit
i used the yourkit profiler to take a snapshot of the memory before the tab was opened opened a tab closed it again and took another snapshot

794708
ienumerable	icollection
as adam robinson points out you could consider implementing some or all of ienumerable t icollection t icollection ienumerable if you want users of your class to be able to for example iterate over items in the queue

794708
ienumerable	icollection
the standard queue class queue t implements ienumerable t icollection and ienumerable implementing at least these would be good for consistency

794716
ienumerable	icollection
a better idea would be for you to inherit from object and have priorityqueue of t implement icollection and ienumerable of t explicitly

794745
ssl	https
adding a ssl certificate https to tomcat6 should not cause these problems

794745
ssl	https
you enabled ssl https

794794
lisp	scheme
other than that lisp is a family of diverse dialects with diverse implementations scheme common lisp emacs lisp visual lisp clojure logo ... and several others

794801
put	get
right now i would have to say the put method is better since it works and i could not get the webservice to work

794823
stdout	stderr
the hard part here is doing the pipes - but a bit of io pipe fork and reopening stdout and stderr and it s not bad

794853
division	multiplication
2.0 with fast - o n log n - multiplication division algorithms

794853
addition	multiplication
addition multiplication comparing

794857
hide	show
i can manually show and hide the tooltip just fine

794902
hex	binary
say i have 8b1f 0008 0231 49f6 0300 f1f3 75f4 0c72 f775 0850 7676 720c 560d 75f0 02e5 ce00 0861 1302 0000 0000 how can i easily get a binary file from that without copying+pasting into a hex editor

794961
sortedmap	sortedset
i want to make a class usable in sortedset | sortedmap

794967
sortedmap	sortedset
this is why all sortedmap sortedset implementations that i know of allow you to pass in a comparator at creation

794984
equals	compareto
effective java recommends that if you don t implement compareto consistent with equals you should clearly indicate so

794998
equals	compareto
if you want to have compareto inconsistent with equals it is recommended that you instead use an explicit comparator by providing a class that implements comparator

794998
equals	compareto
whether or not equals and hashcode are consistent with compareto is a different matter

795004
mockito	easymock
i used the mockito mock framework for the example and typed it quickly but easymock or your preferred mock framework should do it as well

795027
hex	binary
in response to this question asking about hex to raw binary conversion a comment suggested that it could be solved in 5-10 lines of c or any other language.

795027
hex	binary
nb this doesn t mean hex to ascii binary - specifically the output should be a raw octet stream corresponding to the input ascii hex

795033
inherited	subclassing
if your reall really need to have multiple inherited two base classes so that you can get the functionality from both you could have your base class the one you definately need be a subclassing of stream itself

795040
globalization	localization
check out wpf globalization and localization overview

795056
hex	binary
48 55 to get a hex string changed into raw binary

795076
ssl	https
i am pasting the working code to log in to a ssl powered https site using http client 3.1

795124
int	double
you could for example have a struct with an int 32 bit and a double 64 bit

795159
submit	submission
alternatively you can be sneaky and use a hidden submit that should correctly identify a key-pressed for submission but this probably has some significant impact on accessibility

795161
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the code below works fine in firefox google-chrome opera etc

795164
client-side	server-side
php alone can t determine how the form submit event was triggered because that happens on the client-side while php is a server-side language

795229
post	get
and like the comments said you can t just replace a post with a get because that s a bad idea for a variety of reasons

795229
post	get
however you can combine the two let the request be a post but issue a location header redirect which the browser will then execute as a get

795229
post	get
to the user this will look like a single operation but to the browser it will be a post followed by a get which effectively eliminates this issue

795233
public	protected
you can create simple workflow that move new document from public document library to protected one

795294
stdout	stderr
i am trying to redirect both stdout stderr of a unix command and append to a log file in a korn shell

795312
folder	directory
some plugins from the plugins directory some folder from the features directory

795312
notepad	textpad
yes i could just use notepad textpad but there is a project i am working on where a lighter version of eclipse would be useful

795338
vim	emacs
on a related theme - you might want to consider using emacs or vim as your editor but that s more of a personal preference thing

795352
int	chars
while solving this i encountered the fact that chars y.compareto x just returns y - x while int y.compareto x returns -1 0 or 1

795386
background-color	transparency
you can also specify background-color here so you don t need to use transparency

795411
cdr	cons
the cdr of the cons you ve just created points back to itself the definition of order_list used in the second let is the definition being created

795480
cassini	iis
another option for you is to simply skip cassini and debug under iis

795545
punctuation	words
if the character is a non-word character punctuation space possibly more add the current words to the words list in the forward index and clear the current words

795550
autofac	castle-windsor
check out structuremap castle-windsor ninject and or autofac

795567
versioning	upgrade
if you ve got multiple versioning of the class stored in the database it might be pretty tricky to deserialize and upgrade them all to a consistent serialization format in a single pass

795567
int	boolean
just be careful as you add new fields to the class that they make sense with their default values boolean are false objects are null int are zero etc

795592
nhibernate	entityspaces	entityspaces	lightspeed
there are many products of this type you can use built-in .net frameworks such as the entity framework open-source ones such as nhibernate or commercial products such as lightspeed llblgen entityspaces or openaccess disclosure i work for a company that makes a commercial orm

795611
width	height
the img tags often don t have any width or height attributes ie it s often just

795611
width	height
since i rarely have the width and height attributes in the image tag to work with i figured i could use jquery to listen to the readystatechange event of the image and when it s loading pick up the size of the image and properly size the iframe even while the image is still loading

795735
vim	emacs
evil recent vim emulator for emacs

795754
camping	ruby-on-rails
the only significant difference that i m aware of is that camping is based around the mvc pattern like ruby-on-rails and is coupled to activerecord

795779
nfa	dfa
that s exponential space in the worst case though every state in the dfa maps to a subset of the powerset of the nfa states

795779
nfa	dfa
now instead of constructing the equivalent dfa you simulate the nfa

795804
post	get
if i can get this working i ll post an answer up with the basic steps to implementing it it s a little confusing as the documentation is a mixture of sql 2000 and sql 2005 references

795809
rtf	odf
when you add wingdings characters to a word document you re actually changing the font for that character to wingdings. this is possible because most modern text editors use advanced document formats like rtf odf one of the various word formats etc

795862
x86	64bit
both versions require 64bit hardware but the x86 version of the os is still 32-bit -- like running any other 32-bit app

795868
int	chars
i m writing a function using icu to parse an unicode string which consists of kanji numeric chars s and want to return the int value of the string

795907
google-chrome	safari
with ie you ll want to create a textrange object in mozilla you can make use of window.find or a selection object webkit safari google-chrome require yet another method

filesystems	ntfs
i m using windows xp sp 3 and my filesystems is ntfs

796017
google-chrome	safari
which safari google-chrome share

796033
ubuntu	linux
with that said the easiest method is to get setup with a linux distro that is mono friendly such as suse or ubuntu

796033
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
monodevelop was taken as a branch of sharpdevelop and designed to work with the mono compiler from the ground up

796096
width	height
you can then set the width and height on it

dlsym	dlopen
the original dll will still contain the getpid function and you can access that via a combination of loadlibrary getprocaddress on windows or dlopen dlsym on linux

796150
children	parent
what is the rails way to efficiently grab all rows of a parent table along with a count of the number of children each row has

796259
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari	svg	vml
for a good while browsers have had support for vector drawing -- firefox safari and opera support the element as well as svg and ie supports vml

796263
ienumerable	iqueryable
i think your question is better phrased like this what is the difference between ienumerable t and iqueryable t with respect to linq

796263
ienumerable	iqueryable
lucas the different is ienumerable t does in-memory querying and iqueryable t does out-of-memory

796263
ienumerable	iqueryable
meaning once you are in a foreach iterator you are using ienumerable and when you are building your query via either extension methods or using linq from o in object synatax you are building an iqueryable t

796267
post	put
you put general delivery and the mailman is expect to know where the letter goes or you can pick it up at the post office if he doesn t

796336
stdout	fflush
use n and fflush stdout for c-style i o or std endl stream manipulator

796361
ienumerable	iqueryable
your question implies that one syntax is ienumerable and the other is iqueryable but this is incorrect

796361
ienumerable	iqueryable
now about your title with respect to linq ienumerable and iqueryable are very similar

796361
ienumerable	iqueryable
difference being that ienumerable takes as paremeters and iqueryable takes as parameters

796361
ienumerable	iqueryable
to achieve this all he has to do is cast the iqueryable into an ienumerable where he wants the switch to happen

796368
temp	tmp
gettemppath is most likely returning the value of the tmp or temp environment variables which at least under windows xp are typically defined in terms of the short path name

796379
apache	nginx
there s extensions for apache lighty and nginx so there s a good chance there s one for your webserver

google-chrome	firefox
it s likely that you have malformed html that firefox is handling differently than ie and google-chrome

796513
stdout	stderr
well there are two stdout stderr but it doesn t matter here the redirects the output normally written to the console handle to a file handle

796548
firefox	safari
also i m guessing that firefox ignores this issue and just and compensates for it while safari may be more strict in its implementation of the code so it doesn t compensate

796579
vtk	itk
there are also vtk and itk with a huge amount of manifold image processing algorithms

796581
srp	principles
if the single responsibility principles states that every object must have a single reason to change and a single strategy class implemented with the strategy pattern by definition has multiple methods that can change for any number of reasons does that mean that it s impossible to implement the strategy pattern without violating the srp

796631
set	bag
bag like set but can contain elements multiple times

796633
valgrind	glibc
yes there are false positives with valgrind that s why it has suppression files for particular glibc and gcc versions for example

796633
valgrind	glibc
the false positives may arise if you are using older valgrind with newer gcc and glibc valgrind 3.3 with glibc 2.9

796694
keydown	keyup
since the multiple occourrence of keydown is due to the keyrepeat settings of windows i think that you should somehow track the keyup event of that key also to know that the key has been released

perforce	accurev	perforce	plasticscm	accurev	plasticscm
you may want to check perforce purecm plasticscm or accurev

796802
opensuse	linux	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux
then i d install latest mono 2.4 on a linux box opensuse is the one they use so it will always go smoothly for development but we also use ubuntu internally and start playing around with the compiler monodevelop which is quite good since 2.0 and so on

796857

797175
min	max
max and min should still be displayed

797186
client-side	server-side
i don t believe that it s possible to handle a 404 error client-side because a 404 error is server-side

797194
unsigned	short
it s also an unsigned integral type but an unsigned short .

797198
integer	unsigned
for off_t you might need to cast to the largest unsigned integer type unsigned long and use a lu specifier

797203
inherited	properties
it has someitems properties which is an where inheritedfromdo is a class inherited from dependencyobject

797204

you can use the config file as martin mentioned above but as good practise you should definitely set the cultureinfo wherever necessary to invariantculture to cater for data thats being sent through in different locales

797341
bash	tcsh
bash tcsh csh sh etc. etc.

797341
loops	if-statement
however you should never write a script with if-statement or loops in a traditional shell language

797447
versioning	upgrade
you must decide whether or not you want to do patching of your files or upgrade everytime you install a new versioning

797447
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i fortunately do not need to do patching therefore for every upgrade i will just uninstall the previous versioning like this how to implement wix installer upgrade

797464
mbunit	nunit
nunit and mbunit has a rowtest attribute that allows you to sent different set of parameters into a single test

797484
integer	unsigned
the number of items stored in a list can t be negative so why not use an unsigned integer type for it

797527
fast-forward	merge	pull	push
the rebase approach is slightly more evil - you d have to push with --force as your push would not be a fast-forward merge you d pull the features branch from under someone who had cloned it

797528
pull	push
iâ m not quite sure what it is that you want but of course can you pull from a subversion repository and push to a git repository from the same working copy

797547
post	get
not that crazy about seriously complex security for example a simple post or get of a request and an envelope back with results might be good enough

797575
freebsd	linux
i am trying to port a tool to osx which is designed to run on linux and freebsd

797599
firefox	safari
you can use -moz-border-radius and -webkit-border-radius to get rounded corners in firefox and safari enhancing the visual experience of your site but ie users still get the content albeit with plain old square corners and then there are plenty of javascript solutions out there to achieve this for people with javascript enabled

797611
int	chars
if key was a chars or cast to chars in the cout statement you ll see the chars representation of the int

797612
width	height
also only width and height of the body div can be hardcoded

797626
hash	salt
non-random salt for password hash

797645
hash	salt
with this in mind salt suddenly makes a big difference because of this salt the attackerâ s pre-calculated hash the aforementioned rainbow tables are of no value

797646
hash	salt
however salt only protects when one can get the hash from the database

797662
serializable	deserialization
what i want to know is whether the serializable to file and then deserialization when needed would actually load the data faster

797664
hash	salt
a salt is used in conjunction with a cryptographic hash not merely tacked on the front of the password

797664
hash	salt
you don t store the salt password or the password but rather the hash of the salt password

797664
hash	salt
good passwords protect against guesses dictionary attacks salt help protect against someone getting a hold of your hash passwords by making it expensive to use precomputed tables

797665
hash	salt
the real value in a salt is not only in protecting a single record against attack but rather making it so that if multiple users have the same password they will appear different in their hash form

797678
width	height
the image will now fill to the container div s height and scale its width with its aspect ratio

797684
hash	md5
passwords are never stored in a database only the hash is stored md5 sha1 sha2 etc

797684
hash	salt
if you choose a salt then xor the salt with the password hash then the attacker can just undo the xor operation and get the original hash at which point rainbow tables are extremely useful

797688
hash	md5
if i take a md5 hash of an email and change one character the hash changes dramatically i want something to not change too much

797706
hash	salt
if however you use the salt 123456 obviously a random one would be better they will see a hash

797706
hash	salt
even if they are able to compromise the salt when they get the hash you should try to prevent this by storing them separately they will be left with

797740
postgresql	mysql
while i m sure encrypted stored procs are a simple matter of programming in postgresql at least mysql and stored procs do not have a long history together with postgresql s custom languages support i don t see why this would be useful

797860
git-am	git-apply
note from git google summer of code 2009 there is a project to teach git-apply the 3-way merge fallback git-am knows

797860
git-am	git-apply
for various reasons it would be nice to do the entire temporary tree dance directly inside of git-apply as it can benefit say the git-sequence s apply command speed up git-am processing by forking less etc

797872
client-side	server-side
you need to understand the difference between server-side code and client-side code

i m thinking the listview gridview would be more elegant but i still need to create a listview for each cell and then i have to figure out how to style the control in such a way that it looks more like a calendar and less like a table

797921
getter	setter
automatically implemented properties are the way to go if you getter and setter do not require any validation logic

797982

797996
tolower	toupper
try using toupper or tolower on both

798046
floating-point	integer
i know c++ have functions that return largest or smallest integer that is greater or lower than a like ceil or floor.is there a function that implement digit limitation of floating-point variable

798047
hash	md5
by the way a hash like md5 is trying to do pretty much the opposite thing that a metric does so it s hardly surprising that this wouldn t work for you

798054
free	malloc
unless you have a really good reason to do so do not do it as you are very likely to use free on a new-allocated buffer or delete and a malloc allocated one

798061
deselect	multi-select
if the dgv is set up to allow multi-select then you d obviously want to deselect any existing selection

798093

and the beautiful thing is that it would execute each task whenever a core is ready to execute

798574
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu and probably all other children have mono in the repository

798574
ubuntu	debian
however i would suggest version 2 which requires using the sid repository in debian don t know about ubuntu

798590
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
as long as you go with major upgrade from versioning to versioning that works just fine - you can uninstall the old versioning and then re-install the new one - no major problems here

798604
post	get
when the user selects her choices and post s using the submit button i would like for our application to store her selections in the model and then render a page with the id of the model so that the user can get back to the page she created at any point with a simple get request

798619
mockito	easymock
first i needed to realize that i cannot mock webservicetemplate with mockito since it is a concrete class you need to use easymock if this is essential

798734

i have a problem with reading an rss feed in my site

798749
profiling	benchmarking
all the benchmarking and profiling is now in rails which is awesome

798862
put	get
edit how are you going to get the http server to decide whether it is ok to accept a particular put request

798876
stdout	stderr
on further testing it looks like the jvm is putting the message i want to stdout or stderr

798876
stdout	stderr
i believe i would need to capture stdout and stderr to get the error i m looking for unless of course there is a simpler way

798891
int	chars
in some programming laguages a string can hold a sequence of chars and an unsigned int can only hold positive whole numbers

798895
post	get
i ll post the full solution when i get the chance it was enough of a hack that someone else will hopefully find it useful

798925
put	get
so i guess the question is where do i put those parameters so i can get at them with js in a nice cross browser way

798925
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the only interesting thing with this is the difference between click events in ie and in firefox google-chrome and safari

798925
button	checkbox
ie allows anything to have a click where as the others limit click to input elements of type button checkbox radio reset or submit

798960
hbase	hypertable
keep in mind tools like hbase and hypertable are key value stores so don t do ad-hoc queries and joins without the help of a mapreduce cascading app to perform the joins out of band which is a very useful pattern

798975
solaris	aix
get the following all available for windows linux aix solaris etc .

799002
jquery	scriptaculous
was one consideration for us but essentially we ve played with mootools prototype scriptaculous and jquery and have found jquery to be the easiest for us all to understand support

799024
int	chars	int	boolean
the basic types like int boolean chars and pointer are safe to read at any time

799037
factors	mean
dry does not mean limiting your model and you should keep that in sight when factors behavior via inheritance or anything like that

799043
getter	setter
then i use the entity classes from database to generate the xxx entity class which contains all the necessary annotations and getter and setter methods

799051
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
further more you could try to stop it somehow but it appears that firefox 3 ie 8 google-chrome 2 and opera 9 are executing the html attribute handler in the first place and then the one attached i didn t tested with jquery though but with addeventlistener and attachevent

799057
tunnel	packets
in any case the idea is to provide an ssl tunnel over port 443 that our c#.net remoting packets they re http packets at the moment may pass through

799073
datalist	repeater
render the data however you like using datalist or repeater or whatever

799078
udp	tcp
this is because udp is a datagram protocol vs tcp s stream protocol

799142
udp	tcp
udp is ideal for things like broadcasting and streaming audio or video a dropped packet is never a problem in those situations. so if you need to ensure your data gets to the other side stick with tcp

799142
udp	tcp
udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster

799167
inherited	properties
atm it is braindamaged in the way that it does not really distinguish between current instance variables and inherited properties variables

you can use a dictionary to map exceptions against functions to call

799375
coalesce	nvl
i ve also tried some equivalent ones recognized in other databases nvl ifnull and coalesce but sqlite doesn t seem to recognize any of them

799379
icmp	udp
a third advantage of using connected udp sockets is it allows you to receive icmp error messages back to your application such as routing or host unknown due to a crash

799379
icmp	udp
if the udp socket isn t connected the os won t know where to deliver icmp error messages from the network to and will silently discard them potentially leading to your app hanging while waiting for a response from a crashed host or waiting for your select to time out

799389
folder	directory
in target1 i am batching against the identity of the items in pathdir and then performing a transform on item subdirectory which contains the common folder names found in the unique directory to create a new item containing the full paths

your best bet is to get a weekly code review meeting going where you put your code that follows the standards up on the screen and get your colleagues critiques

799403
accessor	properties
in the viewmodel in the set accessor of the group1selection properties i have something like

799403

799407
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade to versioning 5 from 4.2 and it was not an improvement

799429
ssl	https
the second tells mercurial to allow pushing without ssl since hg serve does not currently natively support https

799429
pull	push
mercurial will now allow push from users who can authenticate via http basic authentication and allow pull from everyone else

799464
lxml	beautifulsoup
if that s truly unacceptable you have two additional solutions you can screen-scape the bitbucket page for your repository using a tool like beautifulsoup or lxml or you can wait until bitbucket releases their api which will likely provide this functionality

799494
google-chrome	firefox
is there a predefined interface in ie firefox or google-chrome to pass data between the two windows

799528
mako	genshi
i d suggest using a template to generate the output you can start with the buildin string.template or try something fancier for example mako or cheetah genshi jinja kid etc

799859
metaclass	subclassing
it d certainly be possible to subclassing django s modelbase metaclass and add the functionality you need

799882
capitalize	uppercase
also note that using the set sommand to put the variable in the environment will work as well but nmake automatically capitalize environment variable names even for weird ones like windir which is lowercase in the system for some reason and is case-sensitive so to use the environment variable you must use the variable in uppercase

799971
mockups	balsamiq
i ve been using balsamiq to create mockups

799998
onenote	ms-office
not free but if you already have ms ms-office with onenote installed it s great for stuff like this imho

799999
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
verify that you actually have a nsmutableurlrequest and not a nsurlrequest at this point
