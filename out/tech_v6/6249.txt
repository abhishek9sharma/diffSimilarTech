12516113
versioning	upgrade
i cannot upgrade to the latest versioning right now because there are some customizations we did on the versioning 3.1 plugin code

12516123
hide	show
the questions should hide show based on the selected value of the drop down

12516127
width	height
in other words if either maxwidth is greater than the width of or maxheight is greater than the height of it will return true

12516143
width	height
in that particular example the code is checking if the biggest child dimension exceeds the parent dimension the dimensions being width and height

12516153
children	parent
this keeps the current structure in place of 1 parent many children

12516153
inherited	properties
b i could change the exisiting parent master pom in to a grandparent and inherited the master pom into a new parent pom adding the properties reading jboss deploying facilities to this new parent

12516173
google-chrome	firefox
which works great on google-chrome but then firefox gives an error dta.data in undefined

12516182
getter	setter
getter and setter in my location.java

12516216
move	drag
now the problem i have is when i drag and move the window dom elements will shake

12516264
oncreate	onstart
also when you are in oncreate the activity is not yet created where as in onstart is it

12516292
width	height
the width and height that are given by wpf do not match the actual width and height of the control

12516292
actualheight	actualwidth
when snooping the incorrect values show for the actualwidth and actualheight of the control as well

12516292
actualheight	actualwidth
even further when i snoop the main window which is maximized i get an actualwidth of 1550 and and actualheight of 840 but my screen resolution is 1920x1080

12516292
actualheight	actualwidth
as you can see snoop is saying that the actualwidth and actualheight of the windowsformshost is 486x336

12516311
uiwebview	nsurlprotocol
the application stores encrypted images on disk which are then requested by the uiwebview decrypted on the fly via an nsurlprotocol and then displayed in the application

12516311
profiling	instrumentation
profiling the application using instrumentation we see our real memory is 55mb however our virtual memory is 800 mb which seems quite high

12516322
mouseover	mouseout
gives you the current element which in your case is the on that fired the specified event mouseover mouseout

12516322
hide	show
the rest is simply using the data- elements and show and hide which are pretty obvious

12516472
width	height
the components are added by the user and the user determines the width and height

12516497
put	get
im trying to get it into one array so i can then out put the data - its important that the data stays together but different id s are selerate from each other

12516501
width	height
i tried taking away the height and putting the width at 100 but then it wasn t remedied and it almost made it worst

12516503
int	chars
cakephp only natively supports using int or chars 36 primary keys

12516504
tunnel	vpn
i need to detect if the browser can access server b is in the office or tunnel via vpn so i can decide if i display download the local files on server b or the files on the web server a

12516531
width	margin
but i need to set both the width and margin as a percentage if possible the end result is a sort of timeline where dynamic elements need to be positioned and stretched based on their duration

12516623
int	chars
7.19.1.6.8 -- c if no l length modifier is present the int argument is converted to an unsigned chars and the resulting chars is written

12516645
prepare	execute
this is because prepare and execute with array argument thinks your datas are string by default

12516667
httpresponse	request
however it blows up at this point because the request to the server is asynchronous and apparently you can t put a binary in the httpresponse during an asynchronous request

12516670
width	height
to find the main windows inner stage height and width you can use the stage.nativewindow.stage references stageheight and stagewidth properties which gives inner width

12516731
folder	directory
you have -1 yourself so infact you have actually caused it to -2 from the folder directory

12516732
for-loop	arrays
i tried to add an arrays of textviews which i defined as a public variable but when i run the application it force closes as soon as it gets into for-loop

12516733
content-length	content-type
in the case the params is not in the query string the response is not sent i receive a huge html file indicating an error at the line 401 content-type text plain content-length body.length.to_s unauthorized but i cannot figure out what is wrong

12516772
jar	manifest.mf
osgi bundle is a jar file with some special meta-information in its manifest.mf file

12516775
post	put
when i put post xml to that uri it would show up correctly in request.xml but it would never show up in the params object

12516797
rss	feed
for example reading an rss feed would use below classes

12516803
printf	fgets
i assume you don t need me to give the example of getting a response code i m sure curl would give it to you but it s probably overkill to use curl being that you do not require it s threading capabilities i would fsockopen port 80 printf get http 1.0 n n fgets the first line and close the connection .

12516852
udp	tcp
you will either have to try firewall-traversal techniques which will usually be successful with udp but not with tcp or have a helper that isn t behind a firewall which could be the same as the registration server or something else carry all the data between the devices that wish to communicate

12516857
width	height
fires too often everytime i replace the element so i m not using that to recalculate the width and height

12516861
inherited	properties
the point is to make sure that key is a properties defined directly on myhash and not one that was inherited through a prototype chain

12516861
inherited	properties
using in doesn t automatically filter out inherited properties so you get to do it yourself

12516883
inherited	properties
it may be more to the point if myhash is a new instance of an object with enumerable properties so that methods and other inherited properties will not be listed

12516897
inherited	properties
in that particular case there s no difference but if myhash had inherited properties then those would be looped over too without the hasownproperty check

12516924
oncreate	setcontentview	oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
you typically initialize those in your oncreate some time after setcontentview by calling findviewbyid with the relevant control id

12516962
implements	extends
and that extends x and implements y

12517046
spaces	delimiter
split each line on the empty spaces delimiter

12517064
try-catch	exception-handling
you want to be careful because this will probably throw an exception-handling if there are 0 nodes in your treeview so it would be a good idea to place it in a try-catch block

12517076
google-chrome	firefox
however on firefox its all fine where as on google-chrome and ie there is a small white space between the bottom of the image and the top of the positioned background image

12517136
prepare	execute
i have tried using regular boiler plate jdbc also create connection prepare statement execute statement retrieve data from result_set etc and i found that the vast majority of time was spent looping over the result_set and extracting the data out of it and into some pojos

12517142
put	get
what i am looking for is that i setup project templates for other developers in my firm to you and i would like to know if somehow i can setup a template for a project and put it in my repo for other develpers to get

12517148
switching	accessory
i have a table with four rows each having a title and switching as an accessory

12517164
free	malloc
it would be easy to modify the code to use malloc and free instead

12517223
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
whatever you do on viewdidload doing it in viewwillappear or viewdidappear will give you the result you want

12517237
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
since you are going back in the stack you would want to have the code that you want to trigger in viewwillappear or viewdidappear which is executed when popping from one viewcontroller to the one below it

12517297
post	get
now what should happen is when i click on delete link - it should post get whatever - as i use _request on listener script to php script that will get the id of publisher and delete it from db..

12517298
min	max
the tricky part is getting only one row for each client with the min max values and then the other columns that go along with those min max values

12517303
put	get
put the code you want to run when you get back to it

12517305
mouse	keyboard
i did not want to use moc and with a lot of fiddling i was able to get just enough callbacks such as keyboard mouse paint timer etc... to make a usable submission

12517336
innodb	myisam
if you use insert and update high performance uses innodb over myisam is better

12517336
consistency	acid
the innodb has support with acid atomicity consistency isolation and durability therefore the more select and join is slower but is faster for insert

12517338
openbsd	freebsd
libexecinfo freebsd and openbsd only. required by v8

12517375
children	parent
my code where #div is the parent and children are the elements with the id s i want to gather

12517377
min	max
in the case there are multiple rows for some min or max value for same client i have given you the earliest date that they appear

12517388
int	chars
if chars is used as an int type then it might make sense to specify signedness explicitly but not when it is used for textual chars

12517406
children	parent
your query will get all car entities which are children of given parent entity

12517414
post	get
in the page class i have a method to get the page s post for a specific date and author it looks like that

12517469
sorting	filtering
usually index pages have options for filtering page sorting

12517519
stdout	stderr
but then now both stdout stderr from cmd are coming on stdout

12517519
stdout	stderr
so combined_output contains the both with order preserved but the command-expecting-stdout only gets stdout and command-expecting-stderr only gets stderr

12517519
stdout	stderr
basically i want to log stdout+stderr while still allowing stdout and stderr to be separately redirected and piped

12517519
bash	zsh
is there a way to do this in bash zsh

12517523
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i m having this issue in firefox google-chrome and safari

12517525
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i have a usercontrol in which i have a property inputtype - enum d to have 3 possible options textbox dropdownlistfor or checkbox

12517525
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
however then i can t access the properties of the textbox dropdownlistfor or checkbox as visual studio doesn t know the type - nor can i cast the object - textbox txt -as i don t know which one it ll be.

12517544
folder	directory
rather i find a target folder in the base directory with the scala file

12517566
direct3d	gdi	direct3d	directx	directx	gdi
wpf is builds on top of the directx direct3d instead of relying on the older gdi gdi+ subsystem

12517597
stdout	stderr
fprintf stderr ... still works because that prints to stderr not stdout and the stderr file descriptor 2 or equivalently stderr_fileno does not change during the program so it continues to print out to the terminal

12517603
min	max
you can set the min and max width on the media query

12517605
explode	substr
this line will break explode a string stored in text into array of substr using a string as a separator

12517631
client-side	server-side
i would suggest you to implement ivalidatableobject in the model for server-side validation and do the client-side validation using plain jquery

12517731

just use the procedure which populates the gridview and then call that procedure onclientclick event

12517773
stdout	stderr
first i made a litte script to write on stdout and stderr

12517778
facebook	fbconnect
use fbconnect only if it uses facebook graphapi else other api s wont be working

12517841
jar	war
persistent units can be packaged as part of a war or ejb jar file or can be packaged as a jar file that can then be included in an war or ear file

12517851
serializable	deserialization
you can also try hardcode some tracking into entity itself and record which properties were set during deserialization but it is dependent on serializable if it will work or not because if deserialization sets these values as well it will be useless

12517869
folder	directory
the build.scala file goes into your project directory which you should create in the project root folder

12517894
subclass	abstract-class
you need to create a class which extends the abstract-class and then you can create an object of the subclass

12517911
opensso	openam	cas	openam	cas	opensso
i have been reading about opensso openam cas and other solution but didn t help me as i expected at least so far

12517912
pull	push
which is why i would like to either push from test2 repo to test repo or pull from test2 repo into test1 repo

12517922
int	chars
in the above code the first function calls function add int int the second function calls function add int chars

12517922
int	chars
the third function call should result as error but it calls the function add int chars

12517929
ienumerable	icollection
if your collection is from icollection or ienumerable you can just do this

12517945
int	chars
there is implicit conversion chars to int

12517952
identifier	ambiguous
unfortunately mercurial gives an error ambiguous identifier

12517967
getter	setter
it has properties getter and setter for respective properties

12517982
int	chars
the closest match is the one with int and chars

12517982
int	chars
since a chars can be implicitly converted to an int it still works

12517994
getter	setter
most commonly beans use getter and setter to protect their member variables which are typically set to private and have a no-argument public constructor

12518104
pop-up	dialog
a dialog pop-up containing an edittext prefilled with hello world

12518144
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have searched a lot on google but everyone is talking about clearing the browser cache in safari firefox google-chrome and cookies no one has talked about the iphone browser or the fbgraph api

12518146
submit	submission
you have to extract all the values and submit them the form submission is just regular urlencoded postparams but this is the most unclear if you are just glancing at how to do this

12518162
width	height
i have a div element that has no defined width or height

12518185
min	max
i think the best way is to use the max and min functions

12518200
width	height
if you have jquery available then you can simply use the width and height or outerwidth outerheight methods

12518233
opera	firefox
opera has the same behavior as firefox

12518257
udp	tcp
tcp and udp endpoints are characterized by the ip address and the port

12518268
portrait	landscape
it works but the keyboard blocks the lower half of the screen in landscape and a small portion of the screen in portrait

12518282
folder	directory
you can either do this by putting the folder outside of the web site directory or by setting security settings in the file system or on the web server

12518297
getter	setter
all properties private use getter setter

12518307
automake	autotools
i m trying to build a library from autotools automake libtool

12518335
jobs	cron
if webfaction supports cron jobs you can create your own pseudo broker

12518343
oncreate	onstart
i have also tried this sequence from oncreate and onstart with the same effect - changes are not made visible until the activity gets navigated away from and then navigated back to again

12518355
filesystems	ntfs
the directory in question is an ntfs filesystems with a symlink from an ext4 filesystems

12518362
hex	binary
i think the hex2bin string function will convert a hex string into a binary string

12518417
postgresql	mysql
does it make sense to switch to another rdbms such as mysql or postgresql

12518435
stdout	stderr
if i use pyrun_simplestring line insted of pyrun_string line py_single_input py_dict py_dict it always work and i still get the error messages via stdout stderr

if you want it to fit exactly use width 100 and height 100

12518524
folder	directory
how do i copy duplicate a folder that contain sub-folders and files into another directory within the s3 bucket using php api

12518528
memcpy	strcpy
what its trying to say is that if you need to copy null s you can use memcpy as strcpy will stop at the first null it finds

12518534
google-chrome	firefox
i cannot get this script to work in google-chrome it works fine in firefox

12518599
public	protected
but if i want to synchronize on from a different class say user is my only option to make protected or public

width	height
i have the following code and i want to change with width of the square when i resize the window but if the height is resized i dont want the height of it to change

12518607
folder	directory
make sure your .htaccess works and your style directory is in the right place in the same folder with index.php in most cases

12518661
folder	directory
people get to their home directory first where i placed links to a shared folder with sticky bit set so they can t delete the folder

12518661
udp	tcp
i had an image but as new user i cant post 137 138 139 445 are forwarded all with both tcp and udp for testing now

12518664

i can add the opengl and glut frameworks very easily but i cant find any glew frameworks or something similar

12518829
filtering	grouping
report views support more advanced grouping and filtering

12518874
google-chrome	firefox
while i did change the favicon ico to my custom one but it is not showing up in google-chrome while it does show up in firefox

12518909
spaces	delimiter
this reads only first spaces delimiter string

12518909
spaces	delimiter
you can use this way to read string without spaces delimiter

12518929
hide	show
edit additionally i could handle even setting a flag on the individual form submission marking it as approved rejected and just handling the show hide logic in my code

12518946
portrait	landscape
anytime orientation changed from landscape to portrait the whole body element would be shifted almost halfway to the left when it should be 100 width

12518968
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
make sure you set -webkit-keyframes -moz-keyframes -o-keyframes and -webkit-animation -moz-animation -o-animation the same to cover firefox safari and google-chrome

12518972
implements	extends
i know that you can implements as many interfaces you want to in java but can only extends one other class

12518975
junit	testng
go with junit params or testng which offer much more convenient solution

12518995
getter	setter
maybe it s good idea consider create some class property like parameters and then create setter and getter for this and use it in this way

12518996
getter	setter
if you really want it to be non-editable i do not recommend doing this you could use getter and setter

12519002
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
note that we use jquery s mouseenter and mouseleave events instead of mouseover and mouseout

12519021
rss	feed
i am trying to retrieve the images along with other content from media content for each post in an rss feed

12519021
rss	feed
here is an example of the xml from the rss feed i am trying to grab what is in url this value

12519061
hide	show
then the content will hide or show by clicking on sth

12519085
udp	tcp
i also need to add a udp or tcp header

12519146
width	height
note if want to center the image on a particular location remember to offset those values by half the sprite width height

12519184
for-loop	loops
if you want something to loops a certain number of times it s preferable to use a for-loop

12519193
post	get
i am trying to get the html page back from sending a post request

12519204
hide	show
please note i wan t to avoid the users from having to click on a show hide button

12519204
onfocus	onblur
every input has the onfocus onblur actions

12519210
google-chrome	safari
a strange aside to this is the fact that the desktop version of safari handles the web app just fine as well as an install of google-chrome on the ipad had no troubles accessing the site on off line while the mobile versions of it do not

12519210
google-chrome	safari
updated thoughts v2 seems that this issue is safari specific as i have the web app running online offline with google-chrome for the apple products iphone ipad

12519222
post	get
i m trying to get a scroller with post excerpts to work but it uses fopen but it is turned off on my customers host

12519287
vim	emacs
two popular ones are vim and emacs but they have a bit of a steep learning curve

12519292
postgresql	mysql
they use dirtydb as its datastore if you dont specify a postgresql sqlite or mysql configuration in

12519314
google-chrome	firefox
it works on firefox google-chrome and even on ie8 and ie9 but not on ie7

12519352
hive	hdfs
i am trying to take advantage of map reduce to format and clean up the data in hdfs using my java formatter and then load the output in hive

12519353
vim	emacs
if you aren t familiar with vim or emacs i recommend nano since it s usable by mere mortals

12519408
x86	64bit
now the only solution i have found for profiling unit test is to attach the profiler to a process called vstest.executionengine.x86.exe x86 for me but this could be different for 64bit

12519416
client-side	server-side
hmm...you first need to distinguish between client-side execution javascript and server-side execution asp.net

12519451
multiplying	add
you are basically using seconds but its milliseconds so you want to multiplying by 1000 or just add three zeroes like this

12519482
libstdc++	libc++
from the looks of it you are not using llvm s libc++ but gcc s libstdc++

12519490
pull	push
on my local machine i can pull from the remote repository but not push

12519504
crypt	salt
the salt prefix read the docs is what instructs crypt to use blowfish

12519527
salt	md5
md5 sha1 + unique salt best way

12519586
webkit	gecko
it gives a good idea of how gecko webkit and other major rendering engines evolved and what led to the current state of messed up user-agent strings

12519586
google-chrome	safari
and then google built google-chrome and google-chrome used webkit and it was like safari and wanted pages built for safari and so pretended to be safari

12519586
webkit	gecko	google-chrome	safari
and thus google-chrome used webkit and pretended to be safari and webkit pretended to be khtml and khtml pretended to be gecko and all browsers pretended to be mozilla and google-chrome called itself mozilla 5.0 windows

12519586
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 525.13 khtml like gecko google-chrome 0.2.149.27 safari 525.13 and the user agent string was a complete mess and near useless and everyone pretended to be everyone else and confusion abounded

12519595
getter	setter
i have a form type which has a field that is not in the entity as a property but the entity has a getter and a setter with the same name as form field explaining

12519595
getter	setter
so i m expected that symfony2 call the getter and setter to bind and show the form field but i get this error

12519604
google-chrome	safari
while in google-chrome and safari if i try to login a few times with unexisting username and password i can access setup

12519618
width	height
as you can see i currently have it defined with a fixed width and height

12519618
width	height
what i would like to do is make this width and height definable when i place this control in a different xaml file

12519633
ubuntu	debian
use system-wide installations of packages the debian ubuntu binary for r incl the cran ports will try to use usr local lib r site-library which users can install too if added to group owning the directory

12519633
ubuntu	debian
for the same reason the debian ubuntu package offers softlinks in etc r

12519706
jmenubar	jmenuitem
then i add a canvas3d object to its contentpane and right afterwards i add a jmenubar with a few jmenus and a couple jmenuitem each

12519741
hash	hmac
i think it would be very comfortable to use the user s password hash as the secret for generating a hmac

12519748
hash	md5
most hash algorithms like sha-1 and md5 or even sha-256 are designed to be fast but this makes it an easy target for brute force attacks

12519748
hash	md5
an off-the-shelf gpu is able to calculate about 8 giga md5 hash per second

12519748
hash	md5
it is not for high security sites only and using it can be as easy as using an md5 hash

12519810
eurekalog	madexcept
recommend that they invest in an exception handling package like madexcept or eurekalog that will give them a stack trace in a readable format that you can send them so they can use it to track down the problem

12519815
textarea	textbox
if user is owner of a profile textarea have to be replaced by a label and an other label with textbox have to be added

12520572
mouseover	mouseout
what you want to do is to use separate mouseover mouseout events like so

12520572
mouseout	mousedown
the only problem with this solution is that if you move the mousedown to the image it momentarily slides back up because the mouseout event gets called on .hover

which is working for firefox and google-chrome but does not work on internet explorer 9

12520841

you mean you want to hide .challenge-target when screen width 408 and show it at 408px when screen width is 408px

12520842

12520903
width	height
with respect to width and height in a rule the order is irrelevant but the order the rules appear in can matter as does the specificity of the rule

12520917
width	margin
bumps the submenus over to the right of the main menus. however i don t know of a way offhand to easily make this work for dynamic-width submenus so you ll either have to set the width explicitly as in the rule below or detect it via javascript and set the negative margin that way or find someone who s better at css than i am

12521237
versioning	upgrade
you will either restrict armv6 users or armv7s users - the choice seems obvious to me but to be safe i would recommend branching your armv7 and up versioning as a new project v2 perhaps so users of the old library can continue using it safely until they are able to upgrade their projects

12521247
folder	directory
i finally remembered that the .sbt directory on windows is in the folder

12521289
width	height
it looks like your code prevents skewing the image by locking the height to width ratio

12521289
width	height
if you want the image to get skewed you can simplify the code a lot by simply making the height equal the window height and the width equal the window width

12521319
memcpy	strcpy
the easiest way to convert ascii to utf-8 is strcpy or memcpy .

12521378
int	chars	int	double
you cannot switch over a string instance only int and byte chars short but not long double unless you have java7+

12521389
int	chars
in java you can only do a switch on byte chars short or int and not a string

12521398
int	chars
prior to java 7 only int compatible types short byte int chars can be passed as switch arguments

12521455
post	get
post java 7 a great way to set up loggers which need or prefer static references to the enclosing class is to use the newly introduced methodhandles api to get the runtime class in a static context

12521464
post	get
it looks from your snippet like you are really just using the thread as a timer and you might get better performance out of using a handler to post your runnable on a timed interval which would also allow you to call your audio transition methods on the main thread instead

12521496
google-chrome	firefox
the perfect way to accomplish this is with a fieldset and legand tag however i need to get fancy with the styling anyone have an idea of how to accomplish this while maintaining compatibility with ie7+ firefox and google-chrome

12521801
temp	corrupt
attachment_fu is being used to check mimetypes so we can t encrypt with the before_save callback or the mimetype will get corrupt and attachment_fu uses temporary files so i m worried about co-opting attachment_fu s final save_to_storage method because the temp files will be stored in plaintext before save occurs

the client also doesn t want to use youtube or vimeo as it s on the homepage

12521853
stdout	stderr
what you need to do is grab stderr and discard stdout

12521867
stdout	stderr
the error message you re looking for is probably printed to stderr rather than stdout

12521867
stdout	stderr
causes stderr to be included in stdout and as a result also included in output

12521867
stdout	stderr
even better use proc_open instead of exec which gives you far more control over the process including separate stdout and stderr pipes

12521870
width	height
similar to this question i have a nested div that is the full width and height of its parent

ill post some code below so you can maybe get a better understanding of what i m talking about and then maybe give an example scenario

12522083
superclass	subclassing

floating-point	fixed-point
however there s another option that i don t think you mentioned instead of ieee floating-point use fixed-point math

12522237
addition	multiplication
fixed-point arithmetic is really convenient for mandelbrot generation because addition is exactly the same and multiplication is almost the same becomes

int	double
if my guess is correct c++ cx constructs include ref classes and structs and enum classes and structs and standard c++ types include int bool float double etc

12522586
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
what that means is instead of creating a superclass say workclass with most of the functionality that you need and then two concrete subclassing that inherited from it say aworkclass workclass and bworkclass workclass and use override those functions you should crease two concrese classes with no inherited aclass and bclass which have a workclass as a member variable

just use jquery addclass and removeclass or even better the toggleclass inside your click event

12522810
width	height
in chrome the width is now derived from and since the height is auto the image is scaled according to 64px

12522810
width	height
in ie both width and height are still auto and thus it takes on the default img sizes

12523042
textarea	pre
in a pre tag -and in most other html tags- plain text for a batch file that uses the output redirection characters and will break the html but here is my tip anything goes in a textarea element -it will not break the html mainly because we are inside a control instanced and handled by the os and therefore its content are not being parsed by the html engine

12523232
min	max
track the set of points for which the min and max angles are closest to 90 degrees

12523232
width	height
for example if the point-to-point distances for 3 successive points in the convex hull pts n to n+1 and n+1 to n+2 are close to the expected width and height of the book then you might mark these as known good points and only test the remaining points to see which is the fourth point

nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsmutablestring inherits from nsstring but

12529322
nsmutablestring	nsstring
but an nsmutablestring is not an nsstring

12529322
nsmutablestring	nsstring
but an nsmutablestring can change and nsstring cannot change at all - no nsstring whatsoever can change

12529322
nsmutablestring	nsstring
so why does nsmutablestring inherits from nsstring

12529322
nsmutablestring	nsstring
update some answer will say nsmutablestring can do all things that nsstring can therefore nsmutablestring inherits from nsstring

12529449
for-loop	loops
we have two loops the outer while loops and the inner for-loop

12529478
nsmutablestring	nsstring
but an nsmutablestring is not an nsstring

12529478
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsmutablestring is an nsstring because it can do whatever nsstring can

12529478
nsmutablestring	nsstring
all-in all the reason is that nsmutablestring is able to do more things than nsstring and can do anything nsstring can hence the direction of inheritance

12529480
post	put
when putting the content back should the same wrapping in said property be retained given that it s not actually necessary for security reasons and perhaps conventional json usage idioms might be to drop such nesting for put and post given that they re not necessary to guard against scripting attacks

12529504
width	margin
by removing the float from the .inner div and by not specifying width the the width is dynamic it lets you use padding and margin freely

12529507
inherited	properties
regarding your example of stones and cats of the only characteristic of a stone is that it stands still and the only characteristics of a cat is that it stand still or it can move for suitable definitions of these properties it makes perfect sense to have a cat inherited from a stone

12529574
hash	salt
i m taking the sha1 hash of password as a salt parameter to rfc2898derivebytes

12529574
hash	salt
purpose of salt is to make generation of rainbow tables impossible - you can t pre-generate the hash of p w0rd because it will have a different hash for each possible salt value

12529629
width	height
like where you can set the display width and height and the other tabs they are all missing from the window now

12529630
config	ini

12529870
post	get
you can get the list of activities using the code mentioned in the this post

12530015
hash	salt
using the hash as salt is a bad idea because password x will always be salt with the same value y again defeating its purpose

12530083
put	get
keep in mind that if you want to get exact primary field you need to put table_name and table_schema into the condition

12530092
nsmutablestring	nsstring
an nsmutablestring object knows all this but additionally knows how to alter that stored string so it makes perfect sense to say nsmutablestring extends nsstring

12530092
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsstring is more general as it leaves you the oppertunity to create another subclass of it that could add the altering functionality without using the nsmutablestring s implementation why ever you would want that to do

12530128
put	get
seem very sensitive if i put lossy false i get an indefinite hang.

12530140
put	get
when a user clicks the edit button it will display a save cancel button but they seem to not get put on the same row in ie

12530147
hash	salt
a salt should be unique for each password that means create a random password for every password you want to hash

12530147
rainbowtable	salt
the idea of the salt is that an attacker cannot use a prebuilt rainbowtable to get the passwords

12530154
rss	feed

12530224
put	get
now you haw to get unselected user id form somewhere else which you can put into the else condition

12530269
post	get
second you would want to look in the request.form for post or request.querystring for get collections for your data since they would not be bound to controls

12530276
dynamic-languages	compiled-language
although it was said that ioc framework is not needed to dynamic-languages such as obj-c but people often missed one of the core feature - wiring of class at runtime . they are important for compiled-language such as obj-c

12530326
hide	show
in their methods i not only do the things that stand for that button but also hide show them

12530368
width	height

12530415
ssl	https
what is wrong with normal https ssl connection in internet banking

12530442
udp	tcp
websockets although they appear to be the new hammer for all programmers to abuse at the moment it makes total sense to use in multiplayer games there are many solution out there currently using the tcp protocol though it would be more beneficial to use udp

12530442
udp	tcp
udp is really faster than tcp and the simple reason is because it s non-existent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculatd by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt .

12530449
int	double
but are there any examples somebody can share that do a type conversion from the to say int float or double according to the oid returned by pqftype

12530455
client-side	server-side
your code does not work because you re trying to mix a server-side language php with a client-side language js

12530495
width	height
the problem i am having is that the intrinsic height of the label is alway calculated with the original width of the label the one set in interface builder and not the width of the label that is set from the constraints i have on it

12530495
width	height
if the width of the label in interface builder the literal size in interface builder is less than the width of the view at runtime then the height of the container is too large

12530495
width	height
if the width of the label in interface builder the literal size in interface builder is greater than the width of the view at runtime then the height of the container is too small and lines of text get cut off

12530495
width	height
what appears to be happening is that although there is no constraint on the labels width the label seems to calculate its height and thus the autolayout calculated height of the container based on the original width of the label when it was created

12530495
width	height
however whats so strange is that the text appears to be the correct width and height but the label itself has a frame thats just too big or small

12530525
width	height
it will take up something like width height 4 bytes of memory no matter the image contents

12530543
hide	show
i need to show hide inline del button in some rows but i see a bug with the hide inline del button

12530545

i got it to mostly work on ie firefox and google-chrome safari still giving me some grief but thats another subject. the problem i am having is that ie would run the beforeunload event even when someone is submitting a form which is not something i want to happen because the beforeunload script would cause the information to be reseted

is there any way to push pull to the branch that i m currently working on as long as the remote branch s name matches without explicitly naming the branch in the command

12532949
sorting	filtering
the reason to do this is to make a report that displays data analysis results and also provides basic filtering sorting functions for the user

12532955
children	parent
the problem is that while the parent sprite gives me all the information bounding box scale rotation etc. as it currently is the child sprites stay with their original numbers despite being transformed together with the parent and i cannot figure out the correct way to calculate the real dimensions for the children

12532955
children	parent
so to summarize in order to check whether a touch hit a child sprite i need to calculate the current bounding box of the children based on the parent s transformations

i have the following in my project s pom.xml which i think should display the version of maven being used in the resulting war file

12533333

i am coming from phpedit and in that system it would highlight each parameter as i typed and did not require me to break away from the keyboard to use the mouse which is quite annoying

inspired by my previous question now i have a very interesting idea do you really ever need to use rfc2898derivebytes or similar classes to securely derive the encryption key and initialization vector from the passphrase string or will just a simple hash of that string work equally well as a key iv when encrypting the data with symmetric algorithm aes des etc.

12533549
hash	salt
here is why using salt makes sense when there is a possibility to build precalculated rainbow tables and when attacker gets his hands on hash he looks up the original password as a result

12533553
setinterval	settimeout
you can only achieve this by creating your own confirmation box using modal popup and setting the settimeout or setinterval against it

12533559
google-chrome	firefox
this just on firefox for example on google-chrome it works as well

12533625

alternatively - if you created a customeraddress and contractaddress you can using tph inherited enforce the sourcekey - but currently there s no way to map the nav properties

12533649
onfocus	onblur	onchange	onblur	onchange	onfocus
in such cases you need to save the value onfocus and check the value onblur and trigger onchange manually

int	double
this is because random gives you a double between 0 and 1 not an int of 0 and 1

but it only handles the first so i had to change the code so it will get more than 1 message in the same buffer and put all messages in one message so i can parse it the same way it is

12533840
pull	push
in that state trying to push pull head doesn t make sense since you re not on a branch

width	height
for example let s say your histogram is 500 pixels in width and 300 pixels in height

12536241
width	height
for each data point you calculate the width and height in pixels from the x and y value of the data point

12536241

i would post images of what the page looks like in ie firefox and google-chrome but as a spam prevention mechanism new users aren t allowed to post images.

12536544
subtract	add
perhaps add an extra second here or subtract one from the php side just in case but in all likelihood users will always be at least 20 seconds past the start time by the time the js timer ends due to the network time and page rendering

12536562
onfocus	onblur
one method would be to use onfocus onblur but that has limited effectiveness since most of the computers where this is deployed are dual-monitor machines and they often will keep the dashboard open on one screen while using the clinical information system on the other screen

just use chooser.setpreferredsize new dimension int width int height

12537602
int	boolean
so this is my question i wanna make a function that takes a list and and int it then recursively moves through the list and if it finds an element in the list equal to the int then it should return the entire list with the element removed and a boolean indicating wether something was removed

12537623
equals	gethashcode
this is why a hash based structure dictionary can t rely entirely on gethashcode it also needs a sensible equals implementation to be effective

12537623

of course it s also possible that the creator of the class overwrite either gethashcode or equals and in some way made a mistake that in some way violated the contract for generating hash codes

12537743
int	chars
the + operator of integral types int short chars and byte always returns an int as result

after running pear install -f pear pear 1.9.4 is supposedly installed and running pear upgrade pear indicates that we are at the latest versioning

12538212

i don t use a lot of functions but iirc if you expect min and max to remember their state between calls you need to declare them outside the function and declare the function as impure

12538229
google-chrome	firefox
we use firefox google-chrome driver for testing but have various versions installed on our test clients from 3.6 to 15.01

12538905
division	multiplication
afterwards multiplication and division get more complicated but can be done

12538905

when setting transition-property to all it looks bad when zooming inside the browser window because width and height properties are also being transitioned

12539571
org.json	jackson
this would be jackson s equivalent of your current org.json code

12539571
org.json	jackson
however where jackson really excels is in its capacity to do complex mappings between your java classes pojos and their json representation as well as its streaming api which allows you to do really fast serialization at least when compared with org.json s counterparts

12539622
getter	setter
rather than returning a jsonobject you can either return a map or a java bean with message property that has getter and setter for it

now since the pseudo-element is below all of the floated children the parent div happens or better yet seems to contain the floated children as well - which is really what you want

12540590

12541891
int	chars
when chars arguments are passed to variadic functions like printf they are also implicitly converted to int

12541891
int	chars
however what i m seeing is that explodestr is missing a return statement returning a chars which is coincidentally an int

12541895

firefox handles this better than google-chrome does but neither exactly the way i want

12542339
free	malloc
only free an object that has been allocated by malloc

12542342
free	malloc
because you called free on a variable not allocated with malloc

12542343

you might also want to take a look at lib svm or liblinear you may need to install them if they are not in weka natively

12542655
width	height
the previous approach is not really the good one where you can use only one image and use the advantage of the stretchableimagewithleftcapwidth topcapheight according with a setautoresizingmask uiviewautoresizingflexibleleftmargin of an uiimage allowing to stretch an image by its width and or height without stretching all angles.

12542826
cfstring	nsstring
your filters variable is an nsstring cfstring at the time you call objectatindex - not an array as you would assume

12542835
cos	sin
of course the concept of function is so immense my teacher limited it to basic functions which are composed of continuous basic subfunctions such as sin cos log exponent square root.

12542852
for-loop	loops
the while loops is arguably a bit more readable but people mileage may vary... so i would probably use it if the list was only iterated over once and use the more concise for-loop otherwise

goto profile - api access - grant api permission - input the api caller example may6_1307031077_biz_api1.paypal.com in third party permission username textbos and click lookup button - enable checkbox for issue a refund for a specific transaction and click add button

12542987
width	height
i don t have a link for now unfortunately but the first issue is that occasionally images are stretched without keeping aspect ratio - the images have their height and width defined in the tag then in the css file their width is set to be a little smaller than that

portrait	landscape
now when using the ios 6 simulator all of my subviews are rotated to portrait orientation while the device is in landscape

12549237
portrait	landscape
since this problem also occurs on iphone with ios 6.0 so it might not be related to uisplitview portrait mode. although uisplitview landscape mode is fine

12549237
hide	show
so i focus on the toolbar show hide of uinavigationcontroller and this thread toolbar in navigation controller solved my problem

objects in the sizer can grow in both directions height and width ... this is determined by the proportion parameter give to items when they are added to the sizer

12549346

also children will be destroyed when their parent is destroyed hidden when they are hidden etc

12549346
children	parent
so if panel1a panel1b and panel1c will all appear inside panel1 then panel1 is a your best bet for parent as it is the closest to those children

12549548
put	get
you can query all messages get data from cursor and put to your message object

12549603
for-loop	arrays
my solution however inefficient sloppy is to use a for-loop to compare the contents of each arrays s index at j then assign the lower value to index i of the combinedarray and the higher value to index i+1

12549631
int	chars
otherwise i tried to create a struct as follows struct name_vertex which has two variables a chars vertex_name and int curr_size and changed the code according and i get an error message

12549998
hide	show
if there s a lot you want to free up some memory and replace some content if there s only a few just show hide and don t force the browser to recreate dom elements

12550001
hide	show

floating-point	fractions
if code is numeric and you re looking for the percentage as a floating-point number rather than as a human-readable fractions then you can use

12553229

011 is treated as an octal number not decimal

12553229
octal	decimal
the conversion of 011 octal to decimal is 9

min	max
the explain plans are different a single min or max will produce a index full scan min max whereas when the two are present you will get an index full scan or a fast full index scan

12566879
min	max
when you see index full scan min max in an explain plan that is the result of an optimization that uses the fact that since the entries are sorted you can stop after having read the first one if you are only interested by the min

12566879
min	max
as of now a full index scan has only one direction either forward or backward and can not start from both ends simultaneously this is why when you ask for both the min and the max you get a less efficient access method

12566879
min	max
as suggested by other answers if the query needs critical efficiency you could run your own optimization by searching for the min and the max in two distinct queries

i then thought about listing eash directory file by calling recursively ls with os.system saving the whole string split them on an arrays and implement a for-loop to run os.system cp file1 + des and printing the filename but it looks like lot of work

12571419
nsstring	nsdata
i am converting nsdata to nsstring with following code

12571469

implements	extends
a second approach talks about extends formattingconversionservicefactorybean and create my own converters a class that implements org.springframework.core.convert.converter.converter as described here

12571538
children	parent
in code we do an insert add into the parent table we then do an insert of that children s tables and then finally we do inserts on the children s children

12571538
children	parent
will this cause orphans or children being inserted into the wrong parent right now we don t see this happening but does it have the potential

12571538
children	parent
the code has been updated to reflect that the parent insert is happening after all the children inserts

12571545

you could uninstall the newer version s of bundler though this is a crappy way to deal with the issue or since you re using rvm just create a gemset for rails 3.0.1

12571644
implements	extends
even if you needed to iterate across multiple results you d do better to take advantage of the iterable nature of mongocursor it implements iterator which extends traversable which means you can use it in a foreach loop

12571664
superclass	subclassing
you can subclassing a superclass using inhertance but this is done at designtime not runtime

12571682
uilabel	nsstring

12571750
children	parent

pypdf	pdfminer
pypdf does not seem to have this functionality and pdfminer seems to be an overkill for such simple task

12571908
put	get
it also means if you accidentally put an image or script or style in the wrong place and try to access it you would normally get a 404 it wouldn t get routed through index.php eventhough and would yield the default 404 error page

12571942
udp	tcp
after searching in internet without any success i ended up creating my own implementation - with support of udp and tcp protocols

12571948

12571963
gridview	sqldatasource
another way that would require less code from your part can be accomplished using sqldatasource and setting it as the datasource for the gridview - you wouldn t have to do the resorting paging in code

for encrypted keys the dnn side uses the standard algorithms ie des 3des or aes - depending on your machinekey settings

12572311
qsort	bsearch
in particular the standard qsort function sorts an array and the bsearch function searches over an array

12572311
qsort	bsearch
it s even legal for an implementation to provide a qsort that does a bubble sort and a bsearch that does a linear search -- though i m sure no implementation would actually do something that silly

12572311
qsort	bsearch
for example if you look at qsort and bsearch you ll see that they use pointers and deal with chunks of memory rather than typed objects

12572312

in the screenshot both displayed images are less than 100px in width and different height

12572560
multicastdelegate	delegation
when we look at the implementation of multicastdelegate we can see that the implementation of multicastdelegate.getinvocationlist also creates a new array copies the delegation to be invoked into that array and then invokes them

12572572
imagemagick	mogrify
for example resizing images with imagemagick s mogrify command sometimes stalls and never returns control back to the original process

in case you care about order if the same object has all 3 events set it s onmousedown onmouseup then onclick

12572736
integer	unsigned
an implementation that has no such unsigned type say because pointers are bigger than any integer type won t provide it

12572767
superclass	subclassing
in that case you probably don t want the superclass to know of the subclassing because that would violate the substitution principle

12572834
width	margin
you have a width of 33.3 on each column but you also have a left margin on .fleft and a right margin on .fright of 10px causing the width of all together to be more than the 100 that you want to fit everything in

in a servlet i am building a very large amount of html content in a stringbuilder that at the end needs to be written to the response s printwriter

12573023
stringbuilder	printwriter
in order to use a printwriter it must first call stringbuilder s tostring method to get the content as a string

12573056
java.util.date	simpledateformat
before you do the comparison as the timestamps are still in the string format you need to convert them to java.util.date and the simplest way is to assign an arbitrary date part to both time strings concatenate both time strings to 1 1 1970 then convert them into date using simpledateformat then get time in milliseconds and do the comparison

12573073
fileinputstream	objectinputstream
looking at the source code the constructors for both objectinputstream and bufferedinputstream can throw exceptions which would cause a fileinputstream object to be allocated on the following line but the in variable will still be null

12573079
folder	directory
i put it in root directory it blocks all other folder

12573083
getter	setter
this type calls either the appropriate getter or setter

12573083
getter	setter
obviously as the getter or setter gets called automatically with the . notation you need a way to set the variable without a setter calling the setter in the setter itself results in an endless loop

12573092
stringbuilder	printwriter	stringbuilder	stringwriter
as an alternative you could drop the stringbuilder and use a stringwriter and a printwriter

12573104
accessor	properties
this access mechanism is almost vestigial at this point and very uncommonly seen in modern objc code because good encapsulation requires the use of accessor and properties not touching instance variables directly

i haven t tested your code but looking at the onmeasure method of your custexplistview i see that you have specified a maximum width and height

12573307
public	protected
therefore if myclass is a public windows runtime reference type and getstrings is a public or protected member function basically if myclass getstrings appears in metadata and is callable across the windows runtime abi you need to use pointers

however no matter how i try to encode the resulting nsdata object into an nsstring to send to the server i end up with a string like this

12573631
uipangesturerecognizer	uipageviewcontroller
i found that the cause was replacing the delegate on the uipangesturerecognizer of the uipageviewcontroller a no-no really

12573645
width	height
this will set the content width to be as wide as the txtview plus the left-hand positioning offset and the height to be the same as the txtview s height plus its distance from the top of the scrollpanel

12573651
calloc	malloc
to make this dynamic you will need to dynamically allocate onto the heap malloc calloc

12573665
postgresql	mysql
you can try the query with identical data in sql-server oracle postgresql even mysql and you will get the correct expected results

12573667
google-chrome	firefox
a plugin in a modern web browser like firefox or google-chrome allows execute files use webcamera and other and take more control of pc a plugin not a extension

12573667

rule of thumb when you scale your images for each density watch out for aliasing problems even when the height and width are in integer multiples

12573871
inherited	properties
if you want to change base fields you have to write a module that inherited and modifies the field or hack on the core module s source code to change the properties

12574189
int	chars
i have a simple class consisting of an int and 2 arrays of chars

12574349
min	max
it would be particularly useful if min and max were compile-time constants

12574349
min	max
the third one can be proven in a variety of ways but the simplest is to just observe the behaviour of ecatmur s loop when the loop ends input is min but 10 min so if 10 min max input must be less than max

12574349
division	multiplication
expressing the arithmetic in terms of division rather than multiplication ought to be a habit

i have a landscape only app and when i run the simulator the device is rotated to landscape mode but the screen is trying to display in portrait mode

12574388

post	get
you didn t said if you get any error message but from what you post i think it is a connection problem

12574479
clang	llvm	libstdc++	libc++
libstdc++ does this a lot more than libc++ and the former is the default library for llvm-g++ gcc llvm the latter for clang apple llvm which means a lot of errors will seem to go away when you switch to gcc llvm or just stick with apple llvm and switch your library but your code is still wrong

12574479
libstdc++	libc++
it might do so anywayâ and it might do so with llvm-g++ and or libstdc++ but not with clang and or libc++

12574489
tunnel	vpn
with windows azure virtual network once you configured the vpn connection the connection is available all the time and if by any reason the connection was down the tunnel should typically be automatically reestablished

better than using a random number is to salt then hash

12574661
hash	salt
salt and hash it here and then compare it when the user returns

12574681
fiddler	charles
but for now just handle via the error in the ajax and use charles mac os or fiddler windows or the network sniffers in the browsers for debugging

looking at yepnope.js it uses both onload and onreadystatechange but it also uses a timeout loop to check the readystate property of the script element see here

12574797
capitalize	uppercase
that isn t exactly what you originally had because the first letter is capitalize the data constructor names have to begin with an uppercase letter and the derived show instance will match the constructor names

12574815
folder	directory
i suggest you use links placed in the directory you desire pointing to the folder in the application folder

12574832
jobs	cron
also what is a typical place to place shell files for cron jobs

12574837
tunnel	vpn
adding onto avkash s response azure will attempt to establish a vpn tunnel with your on-premise device periodically so there is no need for manual steps on your device

12574837
tunnel	vpn
to create this tunnel the azure gateway and your vpn device needs to negotiate a series of security associations

12574844
min	max
i thought of restricting the min and max values in the set to achieve stable colors but that would distort the lables

12574856
for-loop	loops
i have this while loops in my program that does not seem to branch into the for-loop

12574983
iboutlet	ibaction
i was hoping if i created a uiviewcontroller subclass put an iboutlet for each imageview and button into it and the associated ibaction for the two buttons then subclassed it when making my vcs i would be able to link it all up allowing me to only have to duplicate the visual elements on each screen

12575001
cpython	pypy
now there are some implementations like pypy rpython which run a static-typing phase and should favor much better than cpython here

12575022

jtextpane	jviewport	jscrollpane	jviewport
i have a jtextpane in a jscrollpane and i want to add an empty filler space at the top of the jtextpane so that the first actual text row in the jtextpane appears at the bottom of the jviewport

12575031
jtextpane	jviewport
i have a vague idea of having perhaps an empty paragraph in the beginning of the jtextpane and modify it s height everytime the jviewport is resized

12575034
spaces	delimiter
it s normally easiest to read into a std string variable - the default is to consider it delimiter by spaces anyway

12575039
irix	linux
you say socket so i m guessing that this is linux it could also be irix but that s a lot less likely and the answer is the same in either case

12575058
portrait	landscape
this is happening because the application wants landscape orientation only but some cocoa touch view controllers require strictly portrait orientation which is the error - not that they should be requiring more then portrait but their interpretation of the applications requirements

12575058
portrait	landscape
portrait orientation but the app is forcing landscape only

12575058
portrait	landscape
in my case i added this to my application s delegate i have a landscape only app this tells the image picker it can display because portrait is supported

for-loop	loops
while loops and for-loop everything written in for-loop can be done

12575391
google-chrome	safari
with google-chrome safari it s less so

12575393
for-loop	loops
a while loops only states the condition under which loops will terminate while the for-loop can stipulate a variable to measure by as well as a counter in addition to this

12575416
for-loop	loops
one occasionally relevant difference between the two is that a while loops can have a more complex condition imposed on it than a for-loop

12575416
for-loop	loops
this i guess would be considered syntactical but i consider it to refute the concept that the for-loop can do anything the while loops can though the reverse is indeed correct

12575685
subtract	add
note that at this point we don t really care if our frame pointer is 5 or 55555 -- we just subtract to reference parameters add to reference our local variables

12575687
innodb	myisam
since innodb does row level locking as opposed to myisam which does table level locking by the looks of it innodb suits your requirements

12575694
innodb	myisam
with the default innodb in 5.1x all things equal you might eek ou a little performance boost from myisam if properly tweaked based on only your limited details

if you set up a situation where your rendering spans multiple settimeout setinterval requestanimationframe calls where you clear the canvas in one call and draw elements on your canvas in the next several calls repeating the cycle for example every 5 calls i d be willing to bet you d see flicker since the canvas would be updated after each call

12575933
min	max
secondly your min and max is not correctly initiated

12575939
min	max
even better than the arbitrary large initial value is to use conditional logic to detect the first time through the loop and set the min and max to the first real value in your input stream

12575939
min	max
that avoids the dilemma around how large to start min and how small to start max which i didn t mention but is basically the inverse problem

12575967
min	max
you are comparing it with max and min

12575967
min	max
hence max and min will store garbage vaues of num

12580338
getter	setter
getter and setter is a way of implementing object oriented principle of encapsulation

12580338
getter	setter
- encapsulation in its most basic form is like having private fields with public getter and setter

12580338
getter	setter
- the most important reason for using getter and setter is to implement validation of the data that is passed to the fields

12580338
getter	setter
in the below example there is no getter and setter so the weight of the dog can be set to an invalid value of -10

12580338
getter	setter
i am now using setter and getter to validate the field weight

12580344
getter	setter
in this case you don t need getter setter but still it is always good to use them

12580344
getter	setter
another simple example you just want to set a value during construction of the element so you just don t implement a setter but you implement a getter as well always set those member variables to private otherwise setter getter are pretty pointless

12580344
getter	setter
so in most cases you probably won t need them but it is still a good idea to always use setter getter imo

12580345
getter	setter
the role of getter and setter is to read and write values from and to these member variables

opera	firefox
edit i should add that i have tried inserting an alert statement into the if statement just to see whether firefox or opera actually register that a two-finger gesture is performed

12580624

the alert is triggered without problems so perhaps the problem is that once firefox or opera has started a two-finger gesture the standard behaviour of the gesture draggring or resizing the page cannot be stopped at least not in this way

12583836
width	height
but if you want to use this feature for so many pages you should define some arrays and a method that finds the center of icons by calculating its center with reference to their origin height width blah blah

12583836
width	height
so i again just hard coded the origin point height width of each bubble with reference to the self.view

the width of the bubble also may vary with height

for-loop	arrays
it doesn t make much sense to use the enhanced for-loop in your particular scenario since your arrays is initially empty

12584248
google-chrome	firefox
i believe browsers render each of these areas as a layer and where firefox would render the border layer on top of the content layer google-chrome would render the content layer on top of all the other layers

i found two caveats when converting myisam tables to innodb row size and support for full-text indexes

12584994
innodb	myisam
i ran into an issue converting some tables from an off-the-shelf application from myisam to innodb because of the maximum record size

innodb	myisam
myisam supports longer rows than innodb does

would it make sense to make the basetooldbhandler a helper class instead contained within the database accessor and provide them a common interface the previously abstract properties methods

12590313
hash	salt
what are the best practices as regards security if i m using a salt or a hash or an encrytion function should that be in an include file

12590313
hash	salt
but whatever salt you use to hash the value should be in a separate file that is not accessible over the web

12590313
client-side	server-side
client-side read javascript validation should never replace server-side read php validation for the reasons you already mentioned

12590313
client-side	server-side
one thing i would do is use the same method for validating server-side and client-side so that you don t have to write your validation code twice

12590319

12590405
int	double
so your int will get tainted with the inaccuracy inherent in data types like double unless you use something more accurate like rational

12590412
put	get
to get around this i simply put my images inside a hidden container div instead of hiding the images themselves

12590433
setinterval	settimeout
you need to use settimeout or setinterval for drawing slow and to avoid browser freeze

12590439
stdout	stderr
as a workaround seeing the answer of anojirox you could catch stdout and stderr from the subprocess and then print it from the main process but you need to use popen and its communicate method due to the deadlock problem stated in the docs

12590450
hide	show
another suggestion - toggle classes to show hide them

12590460
hide	show
i wonder how to show and hide fields p inputtext by choosing the option selectonemenu

you can then call this from either the original get or the post method to repopulate the lists

12590962
jboss	glassfish
the most practical solution is creating a custom folder outside both jboss and glassfish i.e c propertiesfolder then add this folder to the classpath of each server

12590975
children	parent
the parent process was responsible for running a loop to query the database and fork children to perform additional work depending on what data it saw

children	parent
control would go back to the parent who would find their db connection was suddenly no longer valid when they tried to find more data in the database to send off to children

12591002
int	boolean
if you want 32 boolean what not a better variable to use than a single int which is made of 32 bits

12591010
getter	setter	accessor	properties
first let s look at the proper use of declared properties and their instance variables and their accessor methods the getter and setter

12591010
accessor	properties
generally you should set properties using these accessor methods

12591010

strncmp	memcpy
examples of these are functions like memcpy or strncmp

12591536
hash	salt	pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash
you can use a secure key derivation function such as brypt or pbkdf2 and input the stored random salt one per user and password to retrieve the hash which can then be checked to the one stored in the database

12591548
getter	setter
the model object has to provide the getter and setter for this that in turn drive the primitive methods to set get an attribute

12591548
getter	setter
you provide a getter setter along the lines of -objectforkey and -setobject forkey which read and write values

i created the directory social but for some reason my status.txt name its name is socialstatus.txt and the status.txt file is place not inside the social directory but at the same folder where the social directory is i hope i don t confuse you.

12591667

rss	feed
what i am trying to do is get items from an rss feed and store them in arrays depending on their type

12592003

12592209
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this same call works perfectly fine in google-chrome firefox and safari

12592209
google-chrome	firefox
as i stated before this code works fine on google-chrome and firefox

12592249
ceil	floor	int	double
for an arbitrary value v of a floating point type float double long double does c89 guarantee that the mathematically exact int result of floor v and ceil v is a representable value of the type of v

12592259
ldd	otool
on a linux system you can see which dynamic libraries a program depends on with the ldd command on mac os use otool -l

12592282
cout	cin
i would read up on at least these three and if you really don t want to use std cin and std cout i would use qtextstream objects in the same way

12592330
division	modulo
modulo computes a remainder after division

12592330
division	modulo
where x and n are integers div means whole number division and mod means modulo

12592332
multiplying	add	for-loop	arrays
you would need to add an arrays of the category ids and possible use a for-loop to multiplying the code instead of the if statement

12592375
post	get
when you return to the upload index view from the post it is not re-populating the model since your code to populate the model is done on the get

12592384
innodb	myisam
i had the database at innodb but i changed it to myisam in hopes that it would resolve the issue

12592418
folder	directory
in the package explorer right-click on the java directory and select build path- use as source folder

12592418
folder	directory
it looks like you specified the root of your project as the directory that contains the folder sia3-code

12592432
integer	unsigned
numberofrunningactions returns an unsigned integer so to check if there are no actions you would have to check if it returns 0

12592449
int	chars
my first approach would be to split the received string into an array of single chars then make this an array of int by applying ord to every element

12592452
int	boolean
says that sqlite doesn t have a boolean datatype but false is stored as int 0 and true as int 1

12592463
x86	64bit
my guess is the module is compiled for your local architecture say x86 and the server trying to run it is a different architecture say 64bit

12592553
post	get
when i examine firebug from the ui i get the following in the post source

12592572

when debugging with google-chrome and firefox everything is fine

12592608
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
an unchecked-exception is a class that extends either runtimeexception error or one of their subclasses

12592616
maven	pom.xml
the reason for this is that the parent artifact in maven central only includes a pom.xml with no jar

12592616
maven	pom.xml
take a look at the maven docs and you ll notice that for dependency blocks in your pom.xml the default type is jar

12592617
strstr	substr
strstr does what it says it finds the beginning of the given substr

12592617
strstr	substr
so calling strstr with the needle begin takes you to the position of this substr

12592660
whenever	resque
i am running into a problem where whenever i enqueue this task locally resque seems to retry the task immediately without respecting the backoff strategy

12592684
content-disposition	content-type
but you would get a body.write b content-type text plain r n r n on the account_id field which is probably not what you want and have no way to customize the content-disposition for each field still not sure why you would need to

12592720
textview	imageview
i see that one is a textview and that one is an imageview but i assume a dp is a dp regardless of the context

12592736

12592803
decltype	auto
edit also backported for old compilers that don t know about auto decltype proper template parsing vs

12592854
getter	setter
if you used a class then you could implement a kind of bastardized fixed-string by way of your setter and getter

12592863
post	get
lastly .ajax defaults to a get request so you have to explicitly specify that you want to use a post request

12592867
folder	directory
i added the resource directory to the class path by adding it as a source folder is this the correct way to do this

12592868

i was hoping i could get some help understanding the best approach to allowing a user to post a link with an attached image to the walls of a selection of their friends on facebook

12592900
mouseover	mouseout
instead of doing mouseover and mouseout use a bit of css usign hover selector

12592902
google-chrome	firefox
i get a cross-domain error in google-chrome and it seems to fail silently in ie and firefox

12592923
int	double
you could export an function void foo int and a function void foo double

12592923
int	chars	int	double
adding extra chars that makes a foo int different from a foo double

12592938
inherited	properties

have you considered to position the imageview behind the textview

12593041
sorting	filtering
all filtering and sorting is done in javascript using slickgrid s dataview model

12593049
inherited	properties
using the new keyword creates the new object sets up the inherited chain of it to widget.prototype and applies the constructor function on it where you can set up individual properties n methods or create private-scoped variables

12593059
post	get
it s not typical and introduces many problems when you attempt to post more complex objects and graphs through a querystring which is more appropriate as filter options on a get

12593059
post	put
if you are doing a creation of a resource then do a post and put the json object in the body of the request

12593059
post	put

when i scroll vertically i would like the to also scroll to the same position.i have written the below code which is working well in firefox and google-chrome however in ie9 the scrolltop does not align them correctly.sicne each of these divs contain tables with 50 rows each i can see the difference as i continue to scroll more towards the bottom as the rows do not align synchronously

12593108
range	min
after checking str min .startwith input you need to check numerically if any is within the range as ben voight s current answer says

12593108
min	max
then if this modified input is lexically treated as strings between min and max it s ok

12593137
fadein	fadeout
i m trying to add a fadein and fadeout effect so it isn t just a straight up image swap

12593137

how do i force tableview background image to be of 320px width by 480px height

12593255
nsurl	nsstring
so to my understanding i can only send nsstring nsurl

12593269
inherited	properties
you should not do that here unless you want all your weatherwidget instances to share among them the properties values they inherited from this widget instance and only through it from widget.prototype

12593269
inherited	properties
this way weatherwidget instances will inherited properties through the prototype chain but will not share properties values among them because they inherited from widget.prototype through dummy which has no own properties

12593294
min	max
for other uses of this conditional functions the logic test can be replaced numbers strings dates etc and the function can also sum average min max count etc.

12593298

12593346
bonjour	jmdns
if you re particularly masochistic you can write your own java-based mdns bonjour responders i ve done it it s not rocket science but the quickest way to get going is to use jmdns in your http server to advertise its existence

12593374
floating-point	integer
edit apparently gmpy2.isqrt is the same as gmpy.sqrt the integer version of sqrt and gmpy2.sqrt is the floating-point version

12593375
hash	salt
is a random string such as a salt hash of the current time

12593380

12593479
portrait	landscape
the ipad is in portrait however the game is still in landscape

12593482
fast-forward	merge
well if the merge has been fast-forward it won t create a merge commit which is probably what happened

12593490
getter	setter
i m doing this by using the getter setter method combo

12593490
getter	setter
so obviously something s happening between the setter and getter methods

12593517
put	get
once i can get this working i would like to put in place a propositioning and mapping system but to figure out distances between nodes i need actuate timing synchronized on the devices

12593577
hide	show
that way one could hide and show the span upon request

12593579
width	height
2 your drawimage width and height arguments are reversed

12593582

for example this code compiles and outputs false because scala compiler implicitly converts int s to double s instead of creating and this looks strange to me because this can lead to data loss floating-point types are not precise for example

12595686

when you put a double and an int into a list scala decides that the type of the list should be since that is something that both item can be converted to

width	height
canvases have two sizes - the actual pixel grid size in the width and height attributes and the css size

12596033
width	height
this can be done by detecting the default orientation using window.orientation in combination with the ratio of screen width to height

12596033
width	height
the logic is that the default orientation for a device who s width is greater than it s height is most likely a tablet and not a mobile phone device

12596033
width	height
to make it even more accurate you should calculate the ration of screen width to height and ensure it surpasses a certain threshold to make the assumption more accurate and allow you to add a bit more logic to be even more so

sending a message to nsfilecoordinator s coordinatereadingitematurl options error byaccessor method and doing what you want in the byaccessor block with its urltouse and checking error results by looking at the error should work if you already have a valid url to the item in icloud you that you ve been attempting to query for using nsmetadataquery

12596375

what s even more striking is that matlab is most likely doing this with double rather than int -- and it s still beating the pants off the c c++ code

12598485

profiler	visualvm
btw visualvm is a nice free memory profiler but its only useful for finding obvious problems

12600885

i have two questions about this regarding crossover and mutation

ubuntu	linux
however i had to upgrade the outdated linux suse 10.1 on that server and installed ubuntu 12.04

calloc	malloc
then if you use malloc for the first time you will get an equivalent to calloc

12601312
memset	malloc	free	memset	free	malloc
if you write a number cruncher that reuses its memory you do not care what you get in there after malloc because most likely you should be overwriting it and you definitely do not want your flops to be negatively affected by unnecessary memset upon calling free

12601312
free	memset
if you want to be sure that nothing can read the memory after you call free you need to use memset a 0 size before calling free

12601341
getter	setter
but in sometimes we are having corresponding setter and getter methods to access and change the state of the private variable

12601399
srp	principles

12601413

12601638
pull	push
also i have to change it from pull based to push based

12601828
children	parent
this causes all sorts of issues for me because when i call a save and i have to reload all my children the old children are still having their computed functions being fired whenever the parent s observable is changed

12601863
children	parent
when css4 introduces the parent selector it may be possible but for now there is no way to style a parent based on its children

uidatepicker	uipickerview
you can make a pretty convincing replica yourself using a uipickerview rather than using uidatepicker

12601969
uidatepicker	uipickerview	uitableview	uipickerview
as the uidatepicker or uipickerview don t have the ui_appearance_selector and even you can t change uidatepicker contents appearance as its uicontrol and not having any delegate so it has its native appearance whereas in case of uipickerview you can change its contents appearance similar as in uitableview

12601969
uidatepicker	uiappearance
custom ios uidatepicker using uiappearance

12602001

12602235
width	height
so we can overcome that limitation by setting the background-size to 100 width or height depending on the orientation

12602315
post	get
but with jquery you have get post requests firing off and expecting to simply update some portion of the dom

12602315

12606563
min	max
the names min and max are giving it some grief but i m not sure why

also x is used to print in hexadecimal an unsigned integer and you are feeding to it a signed integer - again undefined behavior

set the value of the code signing identity build setting to your develop profiling for the debugging build configuration and set it to the distribution profiling for the release build configuration

12608563
profiling	debugging
xcode initially uses the debugging configuration for running testing and analyzing and uses the release configuration for profiling and archiving

12608563
profiling	debugging
the main reason you would need one debugging and one release scheme is if you needed to run test profiling and analyze your app for both the debugging and release build configurations

12608589
typedef	struct
the problem is that you have the struct ure tag as nodetype but the typedef tag as node

12608589

most of the time it s best to have a constructor that will initialize private variable and to also have a getter and setter for it

12608820
google-chrome	firefox
the script was working fine on the other browsers google-chrome and firefox only my dev machine s ie was problematic

12608824
getter	setter
btw global varible can be misleading cause it may imply that the var is public whereas it is private but accessible outside via a public getter setter

12608833
google-chrome	firefox
the background images show up as expected in google-chrome and ie9 but not firefox 15 or ie8

notice that the requirement not to produce a data race applies only to the standard iostream objects cout cin cerr clog wcout wcin wcerr and wclog and only when they are synchronized which they are by default and which can be disabled using the sync_with_stdio member function

12608937
min	max	range	max	range	min
np.arange was used rather than python s range function just in case min x and max x are floats instead of ints.

12608953
int	chars
so your copy is simply assigning an unsigned int memory address into an element in an array that is designated as a chars

12608953
int	chars
it will truncate that unsigned int 32 bits into a chars 8 bits

12608953
free	malloc
furthermore if you want to actually copy the strings and not just create pointer aliases to each string in the array you will have to either allocate each element of your 2-dimensional array using malloc and then free the memory when you re done using free or choose a fixed maximum size and allocate it on the stack

accessor	properties
well you don t have to use the generated accessor cf creates for you you could roll your own and stick the properties values wherever you like

12609372

you could save yourself for having to write individual accessor for each properties by leveraging onmissingmethod and looking for method calls to getpropertyname and setpropertyname and pass those to a generic getter setter

12609414
many-to-many	one-to-many
this difference matters only for one-to-many associations because one-to-one are always foreign key associations and many-to-many are always independent associations

12609451
grizzly	netty
i actually am able to forward a 500mb file to s3 in a non-blocking way with a very low memory consumption without using iteratees using java + asynchttpclient + grizzly but i guess it would also work with netty

12609473

post	get
this stack overflow question discusses this same concept although in asp not python - response.redirect with post instead of get

12609829

this is not what you wanted since the number was negative you need all ones in the upper half in order for the addition to produce the desired effect after the result of the addition is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by u_int64

12609881
integer	unsigned
6.2.5 9 a computation involving unsigned operands can never overï ow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type.

my experience is that webclient is fine if it doesn t what you need - but it doesn t give you quite as much fine-grained control as webrequest

12610504
put	get
i figure i ll probably want to put this in a clustered stacked bar in the future but if i can get the simple cluster going i can figure it out

12610865
hide	show
also on top of that i made so you can click to show and hide content inside the class to show the content

12610884
width	height
first use a fixed width height for the 83 items and float them all to the left so they naturally form rows of 4 items and will re-flow pop up when some get hidden

12610911
hide	show
this is how i understand it when the show method is called it loops through the contents of the vector checking with equals to find out if this is the name of the appropriate card and if it is it then loops through all the panels of the container to find out which one is currently visible it hide it and then it displays the appropriate card

12611142
for-loop	loops
if you insist on doing this with a while loops here s one that take advantage of python s iteration facilities you ll note that it s essentially a manual version of the above but hey that s always going to be the case because this is what a for-loop is for .

when the formview s linqdatasource only contains one record and i try to update it the update fails because the selected value of the dropdownlist is always empty no matter which value i pick for it

12611347
formview	linqdatasource
when the formview s linqdatasource contains 2 or more records it works as it should

12611366
put	get
assume that put get are the only operations on the map so i won t get cme s via something like iteration and try to ignore other obvious flaws here

12611374
google-chrome	firefox

12611786
getter	setter
the main benefit of properties is the ability to automate the creation of tedious boilerplate code for getter and setter backed by a private ivar

12611786
getter	setter
in your case the property is not backed by an ivar and it sounds like you re writing a manual getter and setter anyways

12611787
apache	lighttpd
i ve found several solutions for finding out a user s home directory of the user running said script however i m writing a small script to make my life easier when creating vhost configurations for lighttpd or apache and would like to follow a scheme like so

12611801
jython	pypy
i m not sure that will actually matter time it and see but if it does other possibilities are to slice out and regex it or write a custom loop orâ on the other hand if that s your bottleneck you might get far more benefit by switching to an interpreter with a jit pypy jython or ironpython â

12611803
keydown	keyup
adding an event listener for keydown or keyup doesn t change anything

the error message which you got suggests that you haven t upgrade to 3.4 yet or that the upgrade itself wasn t done properly the older primefaces versioning wasn t been removed at all

12612144
int	boolean	serializable	deserialization
also the data types stuff may be important here - json represents datatypes correctly int boolean floats strings and xml is storing them as strings so you ll need some additional attributes to set datatype during serializable and determine it during deserialization

12612188
ubuntu	linux
my end goal is to have desktop linux run on it such as ubuntu

12612347
mathml	mathjax
mathjax will recognize the presence of mathplayer automatically and hand over rendering of any mathml

12612347
mathml	mathjax	mathml	tex	tex	mathjax
mathjax will still convert tex or asciimath to mathml first.

12612375

12614575

notice the addition rather than multiplication on the last two values

12614698
innodb	myisam
the main differences between innodb and myisam with respect to designing a table or database you asked about are support for referential integrity and transactions

12614698
innodb	myisam
if you need the database to enforce foreign key constraints or you need the database to support transactions changes made by two or more dml operations handled as single unit of work with all of the changes either applied or all the changes reverted then you would choose the innodb engine since these features are absent from the myisam engine

12614698
innodb	myisam
those two specific engines you asked about innodb and myisam have different design goals

12614698
innodb	myisam
so in choosing between innodb and myisam the first step is in determining if you need the features provided by innodb

12614819
int	chars
so with this usual interpretation after foo has placed an int there we can access it as chars objects so at least one chars object exists within the memory region named c

websphere	ibm
web service runtime ibm websphere jax-ws

12618686
folder	directory
the obvious solution would be to merge the old pages directory with the forum directory but i can t because it would break the folder architecture of zend

12618694
hide	show
i believe the selector you are thinking of is the innerhtml of the span which you could change in javascript once you are finished showing the text so that show activities changes to hide activities and then just write up a little function that does the exact opposite of your show activities code

12618697
feedback	review
i have included a send feedback button in a few apps in the past that opened the email modal without any review issues to date

12618698
post	put
then you can put post action in your controller

12618709
hide	show
this means that in any case you are either trying to show or to hide the scrollbar even when it s already show or hidden

12618715
hide	show
as it is it will always call either the show or hide scrollbar methods

12618716
post	put
this can put the header at the start while transcoding instead of it being a post process

12618721

onkeyup	onkeydown
try changing onkeydown to onkeyup that should fix the problem

12618899

they are exactly the same only one takes a double array and one takes an int array i see some example use iconvertible but i cant get the syntax right

12618902
sorting	filtering
i want to build an complex datatable with filtering and sorting

12618912
put	get
if i were doing it i would use unix time multiplied by 1000 to put it into milliseconds which is straightforward to get out of php and in both php and javascript more intuitive when you re doing arithmetic on it

12618998
int	double
first the method signature it accepts a generic array of type t so it doesn t matter if it s int double bool or strings

12618998
int	double
zero is the default value for both int and double so you can use default t to get the default value for actual type and object.equals for comparison and operators aren t defined for generic types

12619040
submit	submission
to avoid second time page submission take one hidden field and check the value before call submit

12619052

12619258
move	drag
it s now possible to drag the draggable element around using two fingers without having the rest of the page move

12619258
opera	firefox
it s still possible to drag the map with one finger on firefox and opera but this is a minor thing as soon as you adopt a use only two fingers when you want to drag attitude

12619258
opera	firefox
the only small issue is that both firefox and opera seem to jump back and forth between which fingertip they choose to focus on making the draggable element jitter somewhat especially when the fingers are a bit apart

12619299
cos	sin
the problem is that sin cos and tan functions are computationally expensive and also there is quite a big loss of precision along the formula when calculated as 4 byte floats

12619317
pdfbox	ghost4j
not sure about ghost4j i did it using pdfbox imagetopdf

12619323
put	get
however if it is let them think they voted put it in the database and make it as voted but mark the vote as does not count so they will not try to get around your block

12619378

12619437
width	height
but the image pops to width 924 and height 1379

regarding style you could put the images into an array to get rid of the eval

12619507
firefox	safari
this works perfect in firefox and safari

12619513
restrict	shared
preferably you might implement an extension method which i would prefer because it does not restrict you to use this logic in a certain inheritance hierarchy but instead allows you to use it in all classes that shared the type or interface

12619528
multicastdelegate	delegation
a delegation multicastdelegate object is similar to a c++ function pointer that can store

12619536
width	height
i would like set a div s width height values to be the same as a table s cell automatically

12619536
width	height
table column will be dynamic width height

12619544
int	double
just an alternative thought as in java you could create an abstract class named number which int double etc

12619558
for-loop	loops
in the while loops you didn t increment i but in your for-loop you are using

12619563
width	height
anyway by default a div is already fitting the whole width so height 100 is enough

basically in the javascript you first setup variables for the width and height of your container

12619752
width	height
you then set the overlay to have the width and height of your container

12619763
google-chrome	safari
it works fine in google-chrome but safari brings up an error saying

12619799
filewriter	bufferedwriter
also you should consider calling close of bufferedwriter as it is not just delegating the close to filewriter but it does some cleanup like flushbuffer

12619855
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
to retrieve the headers you need access to the underlying instance of xmlhttprequest from jqxhr object

12619882
background-position	background-size
this choice does not matter the final shape of the triangle is determined by the values of the gradient s colour stop location background-position and background-size

12619890

i have a folder in my root directory that is candyfive and it has my html website that is properly working and a domain is pointing to it i have a subfolder inside candyfive that is named portal

12620183
queue	fifo
what i expect is some system that takes the 1000 datasets as a queue and sends them to the 8 cores for processing so it starts by taking the first 8 from the 1000 as fifo

12620196
post	get
finally to add to all of this as you also mentioned in your post you get to use shiny items such as dateinterval easier timezoning easier manipulation and easier formatting etc when you use datetime and it s related object-oriented partners in crime

12620218
innodb	myisam

12620218
innodb	myisam
myisam does full text search innodb doesn t

12620218
innodb	myisam
i have been told innodb is faster on executing writes but slower than myisam doing reads i cannot back this up and could not find any article that analyses this i do however have the guy that told me this in high regard feel free to ignore this point or do your own research

12620218
innodb	myisam
in my opinion the second point is probably the one were innodb has a huge advantage over myisam

12620218
innodb	myisam
- i am reading this book high performance mysql the author says innodb loads data and creates indexes more slowly than myisam this could also be very important factor when deciding what to use

12620596
hash	md5
this article claims machines today can compute the md5 hash of 330 mb of data per second

12620596
hash	md5
sha-1 was developed as a safer alternative to md5 when it was discovered that you could craft inputs that would hash to the same value with md5 but i think for your purposes md5 will work fine

12620607
for-loop	loops
when a for-loop has a small body it might perform more slowly than the equivalent sequential loops

12620701
versioning	upgrade
however i couldn t use this when i upgrade the sbteclipse sbt plugin today - sbt stubbornly refused to even start because it didn t recognise the existence of a settings key that i was trying to set in my project s build.sbt that exists only in the newer versioning of the sbteclipse plugin and the only way i could find to work around the issue was to delete the old versioning of the plugin from the ivy cache and restart sbt

12620711
oncreate	recreate
when going back to that activity and if it had been destroyed android will recreate it by calling oncreate and onrestoreinstancestate which is why you should save volatile data that s supposed to outlive context changes in onretaininstancestate.

12621248
gridview	rowdatabound
you can do it on the rowdatabound event of the gridview

following the pointer from shawnwall s comment to the original question i have managed to get this fixed by doing the presentviewcontroller method call on the root uiviewcontroller and then dismissing and re-establishing the uipopovercontroller either side of taking the photo

12621629
for-loop	loops
the performance difference between for-loop and while loops is not a big issue because modern compilers can generate same machine code for both loops and secondly both loops require same operations

12621653
put	get
maybe thats why you get literaly all php code or the correct value when you only put execresult test as the content of the php file

12621676

the problems gets worse when it comes to extends a class and use it as a super parent constructor

12621683

12621837
for-loop	loops
while loops does not have as much flexibility as a for-loop has and for loops are more readable than while loops

12621837
for-loop	loops
a while loops cannot be used like the above for-loop and today most modern languages allow a for each loops as well

12621837
for-loop	loops
in my opinion i could be biased please forgive for that one should not use while loops as long as it is possible to write the same code with for-loop

12622015
quicksort	insertion-sort
i have read everywhere that for divide and conquer sorting algorithms like merge-sort and quicksort instead of recursing until only a single element is left it is better to shift to insertion-sort when a certain threshold say 30 elements is reached

12622015
selection-sort	bubble-sort
why not bubble-sort or selection-sort both of which has similar o n 2 performance

12622015
insertion-sort	bubble-sort
insertion-sort should come handy only when many elements are pre-sorted although that advantage should also come with bubble-sort but otherwise why should it be more efficient than the other two

12624143
mouseleave	mouseenter
here is your updated fiddle fiddle with the mouseenter and mouseleave methods

12624143
mouseleave	mouseenter
this solution uses jquery s mouseenter and mouseleave methods because of a multitude of issues that ie has with the hover method

12624143
mouseleave	mouseenter
as you may or may not know hover is a shorthand version of mouseenter mouseleave but there are dozens of issues with the hover method stemming all the way from ie6-9 and possibly ie 10 though i have not tested this

when i use it as the allocator for a stl container say a vector it has this weird behaviour in that it sometimes works properly while it crashes with a segfault error some other times

12625523
french	turkish
i believe that some dutch speakers still expect to find ij and y together and hungarians may still respect the complicated collection of digraphs and trigraphs that comprise their alphabet but on the whole complicated mechanical schemes for alphabetical ordering are dying out to be replaced with simple latin ordering possibly complemented with secondary ordering for diacritics french spanish apparently finnish german dictionaries but not telephone books or primary ordering of diacritics spanish ã danish norwegian swedish vowels turkish

12625594
pop-up	dialog
in any case with the appropriate security settings ie9 should allow you to bypass the print dialog pop-up window with the following code

now what i like to do is that when the user select the primary contact in the radio button group this contact will be removed from the other contact checkbox group so the user cannot select the same contact twice

12625613
button	checkbox
the radio button group as well as the checkbox group are dynamically created using rails tag helper

12625646
moq	nmock
nmock is also similar to rhinomocks and moq so i m grouping them in with nmock

12625646
moq	nmock
there are 3 major differences i see right off between nmock rhinomocks moq and the ms fakes framework

12625646
nmock	moles	moq	moles	moq	nmock
the ms fakes framework supplies stubs and moles shims whereas nmock rhinomocks and moq all provide stubs and mocks

12625646
moq	nmock
with nmock rhinomocks and moq you generate a mock object and then use that object to specify stubbed return values or to track interactions whether and how the methods were called

12625646
moq	nmock
to clarify the difference in what the frameworks provide nmock rhinomocks and moq all provide two types of test doubles stubs and mocks

12625646
moq	nmock
forgive me if i ve misunderstood how nmock is intended to be used. this approach really inhibits refactoring and i d highly recommend rhinomocks or moq over nmock for this reason

12625646
moq	nmock
this is another reason why i d prefer rhinomocks and moq over nmock nmock uses the older expectation style whereas rhinomocks and moq both support the arrange act assert approach where you specify you expected interactions as assertions at the end of the test like this

12625669
equals	compareto
i can see equals and compareto but i cannot find any explanation about that

now whenever you click and drag on the picturebox it won t actually move the image within it but the picturebox control within the panel

12626073
getter	setter
if classes like drawing.point had recommended and followed a rule that piecewise-mutable structures should expose their mutable elements as fields rather than properties and refrain from using property setter that modify this then an could efficiently expose a byindex property that returned an indexer struct which held a reference to the dictionary and had an indexed property whose getter and setter would call getbyindex and setbyindex upon it

this is not the case in google-chrome or desktop safari mac

you would want a few more bits to get higher precision for intermediate results but it would be overkill to use a 128bit type when you only want 64bit in the final result

12626285
16-bit	64bit
consider that the data bus at the time when those standards were established was 8 or 16-bit not 32 or 64bit like today

12627079
webkit	gecko
as most browsers follow a pattern of code reuse and the core chunks of webkit or gecko for example may not be aware whether they are on a laptop or a tablet as if those lines aren t beginning to blur anyway it simply loads each media query regardless of whether or not they choose to display it

int	double
from int to long float double or decimal

12627209
int	double
a double can hold any int value

12627215
int	double
there is an implicit conversion from int to double

12627215
int	double
the conversion is implicit because a double can hold the value of an int without losing accuracy

12627215
int	double
there is an explicit conversion from double to int but no implicit conversion

12627215
int	double
the reason being if you store a double in an int there is going to be a loss of value when it cuts off the decimal places

12627217
int	double
an int can be implicitly cast to a double

12627387

12627407
typedef	struct
you must typedef the struct to some name

12627407
typedef	struct
without the name you typedef it to it s invalid anyway and the type still must be referred to with the struct keyword

making a private field does not always make sense if setter and getter contains poor no logics

12627811
getter	setter
indeed a lot of developers think that creating getter and setter and write private fields is encapsulation wrong

12627811
public	protected
so according to me about 99 of cases fields must be private or package or protected but never public unless a framework imposes it...rare and only manipulated by wrapping class methods

12627811
getter	setter
and in most cases it s amazing to notice that 95 of getter setter can be removed since useless

then it does a regular post or get depending on what you call

12628464
width	height
that way each element will have its own height width

12628783
qtimer	qobject
qtimer is actually just a signal-slot wrapper around the qobject starttimer functionality so it will undoubtedly have more overhead associated with it on all platforms it internally implements qobject timerevent -- its implementation of this function is just to emit the timeout signal

12628783
qtimer	qobject
as such a qbasictimer combines some of the ease-of-use of a qtimer with the efficiency of using the qobject starttimer mechanism

12630486
google-chrome	safari
you could build something within your own app where if you have some browser you intercept the url and redirect it but of course this will be local within your app and not when the user uses mobile safari or google-chrome etc

12630493
width	height
just a thought but i suggest you set width and height for that logo image in your css and also try using opacity 0.001 instead of display none in it s style you might find it works better because the image gets a download request the moment the browser hits the img tag not when jquery starts switching opacity

12630514
jar	war
the application is using jboss and has an ear file which contains an war file and a jar file

12630535
int	chars	int	boolean
loads of literal values of types boolean and chars are encoded using instructions that zero-extend the literal to a value of type int at compile-time or runtime

12630535
int	chars	int	boolean
likewise loads from arrays of values of type boolean byte short and chars are encoded using java virtual machine instructions that sign-extend or zero-extend the values to values of type int

12630535
int	chars	int	boolean
thus most operations on values of actual types boolean byte chars and short are correctly performed by instructions operating on values of computational type int

12630564
free	malloc
the best place for the free temp_path is just before the end of the else just check that temp_path is allocated memory if you try to free memory that it wasn t obtained with malloc your e gonna have a bad time

12630567

i understand that viewdidunload is called when ios experiences low memory conditions with a goal of freeing up memory by releasing objects that can be recreated by calling viewdidload and that dealloc is called when the retain count of an object hits zero

12630614
int	chars
unsinged chars unsigned int 32 u_int64 ...

12630634
for-loop	loops
delete the row from data and labels note this will physically remove a row from the matrices which is why we have to use a while loops and check for length 0 rather than a for-loop and simple indices

12630641
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade the ubuntu server to versioning 12.04.1

12630645
monkeyrunner	adb
considering monkeyrunner being very unstable you can directly trigger events using adb shell

12630645
monkeyrunner	adb
adb is more reliable since you get the feedback immediately unlike monkeyrunner which does not provide reliable exceptions in case of any failure in triggering the event

12630675
int	chars
for example notice that each chars is parsed as a hex digit and then is shifted into a 32-bit int without checking for overflow

12630675
int	chars
only eight hex digits fit into a 32-bit int which is why only the last 8 chars are considered

children	parent
how do i get both parent id and all children

12630792
for-loop	loops
but if you must do it this way don t do a for-loop or loops charcount number of times since charcount is the size of the string and you certainly don t want to loops this many times

12630792
for-loop	loops
use a while loops not a for-loop and loops until -1 is returned by the indexof ... method

12630819
width	height
when you try to click the like button the pop up comes up at the right height but the width is restricted to the width of the button

12630826
laravel	codeigniter
the answer given above explains how templating is done in laravel however to gain additional benefits like managing themes organised into a theme directory with ability to switch between themes and having partials and theme resources all together sounds like almost something similar to phil sturgeon template library for codeigniter

12630842
google-chrome	firefox
tested firefox and google-chrome if you want you can find some other way to express opacity for antique ie versions.

12630890

portrait	landscape
currently my uicollectionviewcontroller has two instance variables of uicollectionviewflowlayout each with the appropriate insets for portrait or landscape

12631113

robotlegs	puremvc
the game rules of tictactoe however should always remain the same regardless whether they re used with robotlegs puremvc or whatever other choice of technology you make

12631544
integer	fractions
note that you ll need python3 to have fractions like 1 3 work correctly because in python2 is integer division not float division

12631565
uitapgesturerecognizer	uitextview
the uitapgesturerecognizer works well before the uitextview is not first responder but after it gets focused the tap is not recognized any more

12631572
post	get
contains the data of both methods post and get so depending on whatever method you used it should work

12631583
post	get
your html select should be wrapped in a form with the action to results page if method is specified on the form it is one of get or post if no method property is specified the default is get depeding on that you should use in your query or respectively instead of

12631602
filtering	grouping
you can use group_concat to grouping all the tag names and then filtering on them with like or regexp as follows

12631639

if i have a followup version done and ready for submission can i submit it for review changing the release date of the submitted version

12631648
cos	sin
i m pretty green at c++ and i have to make an infix to postfix calculator that supports sin and cos and it has to be a 2 variable function something like i already got the parser from infix to postfix but i don t know how to implement sin and cos i ve been told that i could set them as operator like + - etc

12631648
cos	sin
and to set a specific token for them like s for sin and c for cos but i don t exactly know how and i don t know either how to implement the variables x y i know that this is not something i should be asking but i m just tired and desperate

do i initially malloc space for the array itself and then have to realloc space every time i add an element to it

12631687
realloc	malloc
how do i set up malloc and realloc to be able to add as many elements of type thing to the array of thing

12631696
dictionary	map
then your base could hold a map dictionary key classname|value instance of its derived types

12631710
put	get
this means that you add the value at index 0 which happens to be 0 to the value at index 1 which happens to be 1 to get the value that you put at the end of the array 1

12631732
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
since xcode 4.4 when you declare a properties the compiler will automatically create an ivar for you and synthesize the accessor methods

12631738
realloc	malloc
using malloc for the first item and realloc for additional items would work

12631769
stateless	stateful
my web application contains a few 2.x stateful and stateless session ejbs

12631820
inherited	properties
custom css properties aren t inherited so must be applied directly to each element even if you use js to dynamically add properties you should do it by adding a class so.

12631822
serializable	deserialization
boost property_tree also supports serializable deserialization to and from json

12631851

of course that violated srp but ci users don t care and are even unaware of such principles

12632029
gruntjs	minimatch
gruntjs uses minimatch similar to bsdglob under the hood to match files but i can t seem to figure out how to do a .gitignore style exclude of a folder

12632067
implements	extends
if you want to extends this to more general dependency injection for your action controllers then i would implements your controllers as factories rather than invokables

12632118
post	get
you could setup a javascript timer on the page load with settimeout and that would get reset with each post-back and optionally by a button click that does not post back and when that timer counts down to zero it would redirect to a logout.aspx ex window.location logout.aspx that handles clearing the session and then redirects back to the login page

12632122
innodb	myisam
i m building a table that will be used for read only which is why i decided to go with myisam instead of innodb but i m open to suggestions

are there benefits to using innodb instead of myisam in terms of load data infile speed

12632131
installation	upgrade
i ve just upgrade my system from os 10.7 to 10.8 running xcode 4.5 and the documentation from this source regarding fake code signing doesn t appear to mention a modifiable iphonecodesign.xcspec file for a xcode 4.5 installation

12632137
mutators	getter
you should also define getter or mutators functions or at the very least a constructor that takes the values you want for those data members

12632206

the page has both lists visible although if i put a breakpoint at the following line in firebug s script panel it does get hit

12632218
portrait	landscape
it seems that the device assumes portrait unless you specify landscape only in settings

12632248
integer	fractions
if you know that the floating point value is really an integer or you don t care about dropping the fractions part you can just convert it to an int before you print it

12632356
google-chrome	firefox
the script works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but in ie 9 and below i get the following error

12632356
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried setting the datatype from jsonp to text json but then it wont work in google-chrome or firefox and while the call is successful in ie i get a null response

12632369
accessor	properties
most instance variables are synthesized and retrieved set through accessor using properties because it makes memory management nice and simple as well as gives you easy-to-understand dot notation

12632369
inherited	subclassing
it s a good place to put private ivars since you want to only expose what s needed in the public header but subclassing don t inherited them afaik

12632385
cstring	bstr
a cstring is more like a visual basic string or a bstr

12632385
cstring	bstr
so a cstring is a lot like a bstr type of variable

12632419
udp	tcp	packets	pcap
if you mean watch what packets to or from specific tcp or udp ports are sent or what packets are sent or received on particular network interfaces you would use the pcap library just as on other un xes

12632419
winpcap	wireshark	winpcap	libpcap	libpcap	wireshark
libpcap winpcap is the library that wireshark - and tcpdump - use

12632419
bsd	xnu
on os x the underlying kernel mechanism it uses is bpf the berkeley packet filter which is built into xnu it is open-source - see the bsd net bpf.c and bsd net bpf_filter.c files and the header files they include in the xnu source and doesn t require a kext

12632419
solaris	bsd	solaris	aix	solaris	irix	irix	linux	winpcap	libpcap	bsd	aix	unix	bsd	unix	aix	unix	solaris
it uses libpcap winpcap so that it can work on linux and os x and bsd and solaris and hp-ux and aix and tru64 unix and irix and so on as well as on windows if winpcap is installed so on os x and bsd it ultimately uses bpf.

12632419
winpcap	libpcap
libpcap winpcap doesn t except on linux allow you to capture on all interfaces with one handle

12632419
udp	tcp	winpcap	libpcap
if by ports you mean tcp or udp ports and you only want to watch traffic to or from particular ports you d have to specify a filter expression translate it to bpf code with pcap_compile and then make it the filter for a particular libpcap winpcap handle with pcap_setfilter

12632463
getter	setter
the getter and setter provide a consistent standardised and

12632467
accessor	properties
because manually declaring and implementing every accessor method was quite annoying properties and synthesize were introduced to automatically generate the accessor methods

12632467
accessor	ivar
if you don t declare an ivar the compiler will add it for you and it will also generate the accessor methods without you having to use synthesize

12632488
post	get
my question with that is on the server side ideally i would like to use php to handle the get post calls from the android app but i don t know how to return using php information that my app can handle and not just an html file

12632661
superclass	subclassing
get rid of getinstance in the superclass and just define it in the subclassing

12632680
subtract	add
that is you effectively subtract or add n from a until you bring r into the range above

12632701
accessor	superclass	superclass	subclassing
it should create a abstract accessor in the superclass then override it in the subclassing

12632701
base-class	subclassing
or create a protected instance variable in base-class and assign the default value in the subclassing constructor

12632708

12632905
int	double
i am trying to say if it is not an int or a double

12632917
int	double
parse it as double it would work both with int and decimals

12632917
int	double
so if you need to separate int ans double do smth like this

12632919
int	double
since all int are double you could just parse it as a double only

12632920
inherited	properties
then to fully understand how a object works and discover all of its methods and properties you ll need to follow its inherited tree

instead consider downloading a copy of tomcat or jetty and copying the war folder into their webapps directory and serving from there

12633047
kerberos	ntlm
due to this flag the kerberos ticket is not forwarded delegated to the next hop causing the authentication to fall back to ntlm and fail

12633047
google-chrome	firefox
comparing this to the tgs request requested by ie firefox and google-chrome they all have a forwardable flag set

12633053
hash	md5
also i m not using the hash class because moodle currently uses md5 so i call auth attempt like this

12633072

for-loop	loops
i m using a for-loop and it needs a return a string every time through loops but using return breaks loops and eclipse throws up an unreachable code error

12633251
width	height
note that you could also force your images to have a uniform width and height by adding the width and height css properties to the trainerimg class

12633251
width	height
max-height and max-width don t work on ie 6 or 7 so if you re supporting that you should go with specific height and width

min	max
the limits of the colorbar can be the min and max values of z from 0 to 76387

12633647
public	protected
if you want to at least keep some method separation you can create a category and have all your protected methods and attributes there but in the end everything will still be public

12633676
opera	google-chrome
everything works fine in ie8+ ff15+ google-chrome 21+ and opera 12+

12633695
folder	directory

12633795
min	max
so i found to setup a min max count of lines with android lines maxlines but nothing happened

12633798
qsort	malloc
you have to calculate actual size one you passed to malloc yourself and put it into qsort call

12633869
folder	directory
now this works great and all but the directory that is what i use is site folder root where all my files i need accessed are set to now with the code i used when i go to lets say login and i am at site folder loginfile and i login it takes me to site loginsuccess file when it should be site folder root

you can include checkbox in the listview row.xml and make its visibility as gone then when you click on a button that enables all the checkbox just set a boolean true and referesh the listview

12633950

12641775

if the member function ie sayhello wants to access the variable it has to happen through getter setter functions

12641775

there is no pure java way to actually use profinetio the problem is that initiating the communication is not an issue and polling values is also possible but in order to initiate a normal profinet io communication i would have to access the ip stack below tcp and udp which java does not allow

google-chrome	firefox
i also added some css for grab and grabbing cursors so to get a cursor effect similar to when you drag a pdf around unfortunately the support for this cursors is somewhat broken in some browsers ie and google-chrome in my tests but firefox is showing them right

12642194
post	get
i have always held the notion that drivers should only modify the data they are provided through their method calls but many of these drivers will pull information directly from get and post and while they will not directly append to the view they are often accessing view files and passing the processed view to the ci instance for output

12642206

this is working on firefox but have issue in google-chrome

12642258
prop	each
obviously prop value will be bound to relevant property on each item

12642261
min	max
i would also suggest to set min an max memory to the same value because in this case as soon as the vm runs out of memory the frist time 1gb is allocated from the start the vm then allocates a new block assuming it increases with 500mb blocks of 1 5gb after that is allocated it would copy all the stuff from block one to the new one and free memory after that

12642501

lisp	prolog
the iso iec standard of prolog provides only a very rudimentary exception and error handling mechanism which is - more or less - comparable to what java offers and far away from common lisp s rich mechanism but there are still some points worth noting

12643052
lisp	prolog
the additional effort to make a prolog processor handle each and every error locally is quite considerable and is much larger than in common lisp or other programming languages

int	chars
edit what i m guessing you want is for try int to fail if there are any non-digit chars in a string of mostly digits

12643212
int	chars
again this really depends on your definition of int but it s probably defined as a parser that succeeds on any string of at least one digit that is not followed by an alphabetic chars

12643212
int	chars
usual definitions of int will succeed on strings of digits followed by non alphanumber chars such as - even without any intervening space chars because that makes the spaces between two int literals and an infix operator optional

min	max	width	height
first you need to decide if the steps have uniform height and their widths are variable so at each step you are decreasing the width by the same percent that the plotted value is decreasing or if the min and max values are determined by their plotted value but the height of steps in between are adjusted to represent their plotted value using the volume of each step which is the approach of the referenced chart in your question

12646317
nexus	artifactory
if you don t have a local maven repository such as nexus or artifactory i think the second best solution might be to write a script that runs the mvn install install-file as as part of your build process you need to run that script and then run any of the maven comands

sharepoint doesn t know how to grouping filtering or sort on multi-select columns. another caveat could be that if you re displaying the list items in such a way that their headings don t appear such as in a list view web part or maybe in some of the styles... you obviously won t be able to filtering

12646424
pop-up	dialog
a caveat with the sharepoint list filter web part is that it s not actually a drop-down per se but instead shows a little filter icon that pop-up a dialog in which users then have to select a value

12646460
couchbase	couchdb
so far though syncpoint has proven to not be 100 reliable and it does appear to be an abandoned project due to couchbase sucking all the r+d resources away from couchdb dev

how do i give access to that folder directory but keep the rest blocked

12646714
jar	war
alternatively you could tell the maven-jar-plugin or maven-war-plugin to exclude specific classes from being packaged in the final artifact but this has the downside of not being able to catch a case where you accidentally import one of the test only classes in a real class and thus you ship something in your jar war that will cause a noclassdeffounderror

mouseleave	mouseenter
using hover with live basically just binds the one function to both mouseenter and mouseleave

12647456
int	chars
in your case apparently it treats the most significant bit as a sign bit in other words in your implementation chars is a signed int type with two s complement representation incidentally

12647460
innodb	myisam
even though the above excerpt refers to myisam one could only guess what hoops mysql jumps through with innodb given the default value of lower_case_table_names in osx

12647482
rubygems	rvm
just update rubygems and rvm

12647525
implements	extends
you have to implements a class that extends webviewclient and override it in there

12647535
width	height
decide on the width of the tunnel it will probably reduce with distance and then put 2 control points at a random height but make sure that the vertical offset from the previous pair or points is small enough for the helicopter to make a manoeuvre

12647575
client-side	server-side
to do this please follow the server-side or client-side auth flows for the mobile web and desktop web or the native ios or native android authentication flows

if you just want the int the chars represent you can put import data.char at the top of your file and do

12647702
children	parent
i have a database with rows of parent and children

12647702
children	parent
in this example there are 2 parent and 6 children

12647702
children	parent
i want to be able to find any children in the database and replace it with their parent s value in only some of the columns

12647715
ostringstream	std
the flush is needed because std ostringstream is a temporary

12647743
children	parent
generally when you use parent children relationships in sql you should make two separate database tables for each

12647768
width	text-align
i think in your case an explicit width isn t an option so text-align will be the best option

12647780
int	chars
then we compose those two functions to get a function that converts chars s to int s

12647800
std	ostream	ostream	ostringstream	ostringstream	std
i d not create an std ostringstream but rather have a function called from the destructor of a class derived from std ostream

12647800
std	ostream
to this end you should have an insertion for one of the types directly supported by std ostream which doesn t have any effect but returns an for example

12647805
ant	maven
andengine is a library project so include it in your build via ant maven or whatever ide you use

i m working on a custom web page that shows rss feed data and i d like to programmatically provide the sort and filter feature so it s available in most all browsers

12647903
apache	nginx
nginx acts as a proxy and provides apache with the data to serve

12647903
apache	nginx
because nginx is delivering the data apache gets the localhost ip from nginx

12647903
apache	nginx
once the reverse proxy server nginx is stopped youâ ll notice that apache takes over all the web requests

12647922
children	parent
css cannot modify parent based on children

12647931
instances	transient
given the transient nature of an azure instances all local storage must be considered temporary at best

12647931
instances	transient
although this obviously gives similar issues with transient data if the azure instances is recycled the window for this to happen should be much smaller

12647943
addition	multiplication
if you try blindly to use it in any mathematical operation addition multiplication etc. the xslt processor will try to convert your value to a number which is nan because of the character and from this point the result of any mathematical operation will be nan which as we now know is not equal to anything

12647948
ubuntu	debian
so for me just installing atlas-base is usually good enough on my ubuntu and debian systems

12647992
free	malloc
you could also use boehm s conservative garbage collector use gc_malloc instead of malloc and not bother free -ing explicitly your data

12647992
free	malloc
a good malloc implementation manages well a pool of memory and try re-using free -d memory before asking it from the kernel

12648023
centos	linux
upd2 all machines has same centos linux 2.6 installed i work with them using ssh

12648023

you should only ever access the ivar directly in getter setter and init also dealloc if aren t using arc for some crazy reason

12648111
onresume	onpause
i played with onresume onstart onpause onstop methods with no success

12648157
versioning	upgrade
then upgrade to 1.9.3 where that bug got fixed so it started to throwing the argument error - pretty surprising for a minor versioning change imho

12648159
disk	ram
this adds a significant amount of complexity to the build process -- cpu demands go way up ram usage goes way up disk io goes way upâ and again this becomes a bigger problem as your codebases projects increase in complexity

12648222
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can use delegated-events approach and bind hover events mouseenter and mouseleave for dynamically created elements with class dimsdiv and parent element with id fpdiv

12648268
for-loop	loops
you can also try to loops through it using a for-loop

12648273

min	max
sorting is o nlogn so if you only want max and min once please don t do sorting

12648441

so if you do not need to open any vui in your class then once your oncreate is called just init it as usual by caling super.oncreate bundle then do what you want to do there but do not call any setcontentview

12648444
maven	pom.xml
question how do i get my custom maven plugin to programmatically query and fetch non-standard maven files in a maven repository such as xml files that were uploaded along with the pom.xml jar etc

profiling	debugging
and also the failing silently part was due to me not enabling debugging level info in the test profiling for spring

12648498
prepare	execute
it s easy to use for the app developer but pretty sub-optimal for performance as the server still has to execute every statement individually - though not parse and plan them individually so long as you use prepare statements

12648526
move	drag
i ve already completed this part but the next part of the assignment requires us to have one part of that object to be independently drag-able such that when you drag it the whole composite object does not move

12648526
move	drag
although when you drag the composite object the independent object should move the same amount maintain position relative to the composite object

12648546
rss	feed
i would like to get the image link from the description tag of my rss feed

12648624

12648668
mouseleave	mouseenter
where the first function is your handler for the mouseenter event and the second call is for the mouseleave event

12648694
getter	setter
hibernate wants getter and setter for set and sets them to be instances of persistentset

12648694
getter	setter
as in this question from 2010 i initially tried adding logic to the getter and setter to wrap whatever set was passed in with an observableset but this results in the exception

12648712
width	height
i m putting a border on this hover but it messes up the width and height of the cells the new border will push the next row slightly further down etc.

12648714
post	get
this is visible to the end user via view source or developer tools in some way either a hidden html field or the url post or get parameter

12648725
width	height
you can work around by having a border on all td elements with the same color as the td background and only changing the color instead of the width of the border to get a very similar effect to the one you originally designed without messing width and height

12648728
google-chrome	firefox
i recommend you get firebug for firefox or in google-chrome just right click and choose inspect element

12648738

min	max	range	max	range	min
you might also consider looking at google chart tools if your looking for things like defining the exact range of the axis as opposed to just the min and max of the input

12648877
implements	extends
according to the documentation mimebodypart implements only mimepart and part mimepart extends part

12648891
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
does someone have a javascript solution for the browsers firefox google-chrome safari opera

12648914
int	double
i d suggest you implement you numset class with int values rather than double values while you debug because comparing two double values tends to add some unneeded complexity to your code at this debug stage

12648959
post	put
why you ask not just put the posttext column in the post table

12648987
for-loop	arrays
i am trying to use a for-loop to examine every character in a single dimensional string arrays and print character a is uppercase or character b is lowercase or character c is a space. i also have to print the index number and the character in that index

12649016
versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade your centos versioning to 6

12649016
versioning	upgrade
if you are in my situation where versioning upgrade is not an option you need create a libjnotify.so and remove the dependency on gclib_2.12

12649019
hide	show
if odd then show else hide the icon

12649031
children	parent
so the reason why is because you defined position absolute in both the parent and the children

12649081
hide	show
i did this to make it easier to show hide full control layouts all at once using the existing ib uikit architecture

12649081
uiswitch	uibutton
converting all these buttons to opengl drawing is possible since i m not using ios s native controls like uibutton and uiswitch just uiviews with images and labels but i d like to avoid it if i can

12649148
pull	push
if you think about it there can really only be two possible systems polling pull and event-driven push

12649148
pull	push
since there are two parties and each party can be doing one of two things that means that we can only have two types of systems push interrupt and pull polling plus a hybrid both interrupt-driven and polling based at different times or in different contexts

12649182
client-side	server-side
the following sample demonstrates the complete scenario myvar and also demonstrates another basic technique myvar2 for passing a javascript variable into the client-side from the server-side

12649192
equals	gethashcode
if you are going to generate your own unique id then you should override gethashcode and equals

12649192
equals	gethashcode
if the gethashcode are not equals then two objects are not equals

12649192
equals	gethashcode
if gethashcode is equals then two objects may or may not be equals

12649192
equals	gethashcode
there is only 1 int32 chance the more expensive equals will be required and the gethashcode is used for hash buckets

12649195
google-chrome	firefox
my issue occurs only within firefox and displays perfectly fine in ie and google-chrome

12649195
width	margin
i have tried changing the width to 100 i am using a css reset so padding and margin are set to zero from the start and i have also tried border-spacing

12649201
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it is quite amazing that on textmate i can change a line in a local html file the web sharing on mountain lion using url such as mike page.html and press cmd r right inside textmate and the webpage on google-chrome firefox and safari all will refresh the content automatically

12649208
folder	directory
i then delete the empty folder and put the actual directory in their place

12649235

we are setting the last cdr to the first cons

12649387
freebsd	netbsd
other bsd unixes freebsd netbsd etc tend to follow other rules so you don t usually see bsd systems with an opt unless they re administered by someone who is more comfortable in other environments

i don t recall seeing opt on berkeley bsd unix

12649443

mouseleave	mouseenter
i have a function that performs animations on hover mouseenter mouseleave

12649554
hide	show
i encountered the same problem as yours my current solution is replacing the remote validation with separate ajax.call to execute my validation logic a little bit inconvenient since i should implement the show hide method when appropriate

12649559
calloc	malloc
i am trying to compile some code for which i have to compile meschach library and some other library which has codes for malloc calloc etc

12649578
calloc	malloc
i wonder if c work malloc malloc.h is a project where you re basically writing calloc

12649581
getter	setter
easy way is storing it s coordinates in every moment for example in two fields and use them when user tapped.or you can create a class for example ball which it has fields that store coordinates of current instance ball and getter and setter for coordinates

12649606
int	double
basically says this will contain objects that inherit from number include int long double float .

12649620

12649734
google-chrome	firefox
i ve got a stylized input i m working on in html css that achieves the look i m going for in firefox but the elements input and span seem to be rendering differently in google-chrome

12649757
int	chars
instead use a pair of chars int where int specifies the size that is to be written and you will be golden

12649776
ssl	https
it s also very important that to if you are communicating with an https service from code that has an ssl warning you must setup the certificate validator on the service point manager to bypass it for testing purposes

12649940
textview	imageview
i have a custom listview that load a textview an imageview and a checkbox for each row

12649958
for-loop	loops
you can run a loops over each digit and add the positional place i.e 10 sum+100 sum etc but i can very well do this in one single for-loop

12650000
google-chrome	safari
specifically when using google-chrome or safari notice the arrows in the lower right corner

12650000
google-chrome	safari
only in google-chrome and safari the left arrow is not sized appropriately with relation to the other arrows

12650000
opera	firefox
yet in opera and firefox all of the arrows are sized the same

12650034
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
while in other browsers opera safari firefox the redirection will be done and return the address of corresponding mp4 file

int	chars	int	double
when would i ever need a type that encompassed int chars and double

12655028
int	chars
it seems like it s just there to make the type hierarchy prettier it looks nicer to have anyval and anyref as siblings rather than having int chars etc

so you should either copy-paste this code in your onpause and onresume methods renaming the method to call as appropriate or write a callhiddenwebviewmethod method that does the private method call

12655293
setcontentview	findviewbyid
findviewbyid .. can only be used after you have linked the xml which contains the layout using setcontentview ..

http web services are stateless you can make it stateful using sessions

12655379
packets	pcap
my problem is after i am kill the process there is different between the number of packets i am show and the actual packets inside the file pcap file so my question is if there is a way to kill the process but wait until all the process output finish

12655399
accessor	properties
with arc it s not as much of an issue but in general it s better to encapsulate memory management inside of properties accessor and it s the same number of lines of code at this point

12655452
equals	gethashcode
instead you should be using equals and gethashcode to check for equality

12655452
tostring	gethashcode	equals	tostring	equals	gethashcode
of course like tostring every object has equals and gethashcode methods.

but it just copies the same image twice with the same height and width as the first one

12655778
multiplying	add
my original thought was to simply multiplying each set add them all up and divide by the total units aka finding the total average

12655832
division	addition
this is basic arithmetic division before addition

12655839
division	addition
division has precedence over addition so you should use parentheses

12655889
onsubmit	onbeforeunload
on your form s onsubmit set a flag to tell onbeforeunload that it can ignore this unload attempt

12655928
mediarecorder	audiotrack
the documentation for mediarecorder states if setaudioencoder is not called the output file will not contain an audiotrack so amr_nb is not the default encoder for mediarecorder

12655962

12655983
jquery	anythingslider
i m using a jquery carousel plugin called anythingslider

12655987
for-loop	loops
the adapter should be called first-thing inside the for-loop so that we have the option of catching it within loops and cleaning up to continue or breaking out of loops to catch it and and abandon the process

12655987
put	get
and we should put some kind of lame wrapper around the setup to indicate that tricks are afoot and to force the adapter to get called if the function is adapting

express	node.js
i am making a single connection to mongodb via mongoose in node.js express app

12656408
getter	setter
it seems there will be a fair amount of duplication in the handlers now as they have to go and get various players from the look up up until this point i had no getter setter on my domain objects i think this is worth trading away to remove the primitive obsession but i d like a solution that didn t require me to

12656417
accessor	properties
the parent class declares a string field fssn and matching properties ssn with accessor that read and write the field directly

12656608
spaces	delimiter
parse keywords delimiter by spaces

12656655
for-loop	if-statement
this is little strange to me why if-statement is in this aspect treated worse than for-loop

12656662
hide	show
you d probably be better off using show and hide but otherwise you should be using in the js also

12656686
for-loop	loops
there are about a dozen ways to code this with a for-loop do-while loops etc but that should get you running

12656740
outputstream	inputstream
get the inputstream and outputstream from the socket

12656838
put	get
if you re instead trying to get values returned from different rows like showing the title and content once but then a list of aut values you need to use 2 different queries or put some additional logic in your while loop

12656859
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it uses resizable scalable vector graphics svg for modern browsers like firefox safari google-chrome opera and internet explorer 9

12656894
for-loop	loops
because it returns one after the other you need to loops over to get all most recent first this can be done with a common for-loop

12656912
activemq	rabbitmq
note amqp is a protocol not an implementation - popular implementations include activemq and rabbitmq

12656947
width	height
i was doing some unit test to find the width and height of a nxn array when i ran into this problem

12657058
for-loop	loops
once is detected i would set result to the first value in vararray then i would start with the second operand in the for-loop start your index i at 1 and only increment i by 1 each time through loops

12657065
google-chrome	firefox
dude the plugin is showing the image of dropdown menu on my pc on all browsers latest version incl firefox google-chrome ie

12657075
comparator	comparable
see this question on comparable vs comparator

12657120
fadein	fadeout
try upgrading jquery otherwise you ll just need to just regular ol fadein fadeout

12657128
width	height
property on the full page background so the background image will fit 100 of the width and height of the given area

12657143
comparator	comparable
i also have a second question i have to sort the list three different ways depending in my gui what option i select i assume that i implement comparable but in my comparator interface it is comparator object o int key

12657164
comparator	comparable
see this question and this question on the differences between using the comparable interface vs using the comparator interface

12657170
free	malloc
you could try to provide your own malloc and free calls functions contained in object files are preferred over functions from libraries to see if this can work but these would probably have to deal with the operating system for the memory management since you loose the library functions

12657186
int	chars
error 185 error lnk2019 unresolved external symbol __imp_pcre_exec referenced in function public bool __cdecl booster regex match chars const chars const class std vector class std allocator int const

12657194
int	chars
i need the string to be the exact length of the line and to return a value that is either the newline or eof int which i believe can still be used in a chars value

12657225
swing	windowbuilder
windowbuilder has bi directional code generation ie it can parse swing code and then generate it from what you do in the gui and its all drag and drop

12657259
int	chars
however the eof constant cannot be represented using chars you need to use int - both as the type of charread and return value of getline so that you can actually distringuish between a newline and end of file

12657260
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	client-side	server-side
less runs on both the client-side google-chrome safari firefox and server-side with node.js and rhino

12657282
cublas	arrayfire
arrayfire and some other gpu libraries like cublas have many man-years of optimizations poured into them and are typically going to give better results than most normal people will have time to achieve on their own

12657282
cublas	arrayfire
third arrayfire uses cublas in the functions that rely on blas so you re not likely to see much difference using cublas directly

12657300
children	parent	inherited	properties
what i usually do to avoid having children inherited properties is have one parent with two children

12657300
inherited	properties
that way the undesirable properties become sibling properties and not inherited

12657302
allocator	stl	boost	stl	boost	allocator
if you use boost interprocess vector you will need to create a wrapper class for it because unlike an stl container its constructor requires an allocator object

12657327
int	chars
one idea would be c c c c to at least print the data as chars instead of hex values but that will not work either as the smallest size of a parameter in c is an int and even the c specifier works with int -sized parameter memory region

12657339
udp	tcp
i port forwarded 1234 in my router settings for both tcp udp

12657346

i can rotate the screens manually with my ati driver but i don t thinks this is what happens if i rotate some tablet

12657412
free	malloc
unless nvidia has recently lifted this limitation you must free memory by in-kernel malloc by calling in-kernel free

12657412
free	malloc
you cannot call cudafree to free memory that was allocated within a kernel with malloc

12657413
uiview	subviews
i m using a uiview subclass that has a uiwebview subviews to play the media

12657413
width	height
i ve tried setting to container view as a large square with length and placing the web view in the middle but it moves about inconsistantly - it seems as if the width height values are getting set from the dimensons before the rotation

12657413
width	height
i ve also tried setting autoresizingmask flexible height width but as the container view is off the screen this stretches the web view offscreen also

12657420
rvm	bundler
you can ask bundler to install gems in the vendor subdirectory of your app instead of in the main rvm ruby location with the --path option

12657422
children	parent
attach the event to the parent container of these controls which listen to the events for its children and provide events to their children on which these are delegated

12657430
children	parent
parent process creates n children each one replaces itself with exec

12657443
disk	ram
perhaps you could make a ram disk and specify that drive as the storage destination for your cache using r.cache

12657445
rss	feed
assuming there is a blog which doesnt have rss feed association and i am not registered to any notification regarding this blog i want to be able to know each time a new post is published on it

12657453
ssid	wlan
netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode allow ssid haxxy key txectxec keyusage persistent

12657506
client-side	server-side
it can be achieved on the server-side through several methods such as scraping the site via curl and pulling the relevant data out with some basic string parsing or by using a higher-level tool such as www mechanize for relatively static on the client-side content or phantomjs for more-dynamic content such as elements which are created via javascript

12657520
google-chrome	safari
in webkit safari google-chrome it looks as intended

12657527
free	malloc
for both cuda 4.2 and cuda 5.0 rc the cuda c programmer s guide mentions in section b.17 that memory allocated via malloc cannot be free using the runtime by calling any

12657536
put	get
here ive put together this very simple ajax chat example it will poll your server and get the latest 25 messages it also utilizes the ajax.post to send the messages

12657548
int	chars	int	double
double float long int chars short and byte but are free to

12657553
junit	testng
using webdriver directly you can also use the full features of a unit testing framework usually nunit with c# or junit testng for java

12657553
google-chrome	firefox
this allows things like repeating tests for each browser i.e repeating tests in google-chrome firefox and ie or defining certain logic before and after tests i.e adding user memberships creating users setting up other test data

12657564
keydown	keyup
basically you just put handler on keydown and keyup events and trigger whatever you want

12657584
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
finally use the return false function at the end of the jquery script or the script may not work in opera google-chrome and safari

12657684
udp	tcp
i use the pnet tcp udp toolbox along with psychtoolbox to communicate between two instances of matlab in different machines

12657685
children	parent
will cause the element to be completely removed from the regular flow of the other elements and make the div and its children then relative to the document window itself instead of its parent

12657705
apache	nginx
i think now distro support for both of these technologies is mature enough that people with significant site traffic should genuinely consider switching out apache with nginx

12657706
uilabel	uitapgesturerecognizer
for example if it s a label here s a relevant so post showing handling a tap on a label ios using uitapgesturerecognizer with uilabel to swipe to the next page

12657720
post	get
for some reason even though i have tried a number of ways to specify this request as a post rails is making a get request

12657730
cos	sin
if you use acos cos t you ll get the result between 0 and pi but if you also check asin sin t you will be able to figure out whether the rotation was clockwise or counterclockwise

12657738
atan2	sin	cos	sin	cos	atan2
atan2 sin t cos t returns approximately t in the range -pi +pi

12657739
min	median	min	max	median	max
for things like sum mean median max min first last std you can call the method directly and not have to worry about the apply-to-dataframe-but-failover-to-each-column mechanism in the groupby engine

12657773
getter	setter
note that you are allowed to override the getter and not the setter

12657787
unix	bsd
i understand that winsock is used for networking on windows os s and bsd is for mac os and unix

12657805
stdout	stderr
the parameters are err stdout stderr

12657859
int	double
it would be easier to make the method double operator int row int col const

12657863
udp	tcp
winsock and bsd sockets are the names of two similar apis that both implement the same thing tcp ip sockets which in turn are endpoints of tcp connections or udp datagram flows

12657863
unix	bsd
there is accordingly no necessity for a winsock implementation on unix or a bsd sockets implementation on windows

12657898
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
when i test this in google-chrome and opera everything is okay but when i test it in firefox it ignores the box-sizing

12657904
public	protected
previously this method is protected and i have changed it to be public

12657937
put	get
for this you ll want to put the results in some form of store probably a database and then query them to get the most useful representations

12657949
post	get
if you want to analyze the response status you have to use the normal http request verbs get post etc but those won t work for the case you describe since your test involves multiple pages

12657949
rspec	capybara
if you want to test aspects of your application which are exclusively api-like then i d recommend using rspec request specs for that which are essentially integration tests but focused on one-step request response. you can use get requests and analyze the response using capybara matchers

12657960
children	parent
it gets the parent of the frames then the children frames as per the array

12657962
min	max
i m having a problem generating a random number between two variables that store the min and max based on previous guesses

12657962
min	max
highestnumber is what the max should be and lowestnumber is what the min should be

12657969
post	get
use a get request instead of a post

12657970
des	aes
this is more secure than using encryption like triple des or aes because there is no practical way to go from the result of rfc2898derivedbytes back to the password

12657970
hash	salt
see is it ok to use sha1 hash of password as a salt when deriving encryption key and iv from password string

12657984
min	max
to generate a random number between min and max use

12657984
min	max
includes max and min

12657991
polymorphism	specialization
the basic idea of specialization is to remove polymorphism and overloading by identifying places where the function is called and creating versions of the function that aren t polymorphism - they are specific to the types they are called with

12657995
post	get
since it seems that nobody is going to post an answer to this i ll offer my two cents as just one point of view i ve written elsewhere about the issue of how to get rails and backbone.js to work well together rails and backbone working together

12657995
post	put
we won t support post or put requests unless the user has javascript enabled or unless they want to go through the json api

12657995
stateless	stateful
this is not simply swapping haml for erb you are migrating from a stateless front-end to a stateful one and that is a potentially huge change depending on the complexity of the app

12658023
width	height
you can call self.frame.setminsize w h to force the window to have a reasonable minimum height and width but you will want to add scrollbars so that you can see all of the image.

12658026
swt	swing
eclipse even includes a native code widget library swt that is used instead of swing

12658030
inline	inlining
whether or not that call is inline depends upon ghc s usual inlining rules and whether or not an inline pragma applies to the class method definition

12658048
hash	md5
if you are using md5 or sha1 hash an attacker could easily find a hash collision and make you slip on a banana skin

12658054
macports	homebrew
don t use macports in case you don t have homebrew

12658077
post	get
to get the next 100 rows you have to post a form with the current viewstate

12658080

i use node.js and express

12658080
express	node.js
when i press the button btnsend i want to send data to node.js by express without refresh the page

12658085

myclass has a 100 getter and setter for example

12658098
rss	feed
i am trying to parse an rss feed

12658098

here is my code for parsing along with two nslogs the first log from what is just simply in the pubdate element of the rss feed and the second log when i try to convert that to an nsdate

12658112
folder	directory	folder	dir
if i execute dir command from any other directory it has the effect of a simple ls but if i copy this file into any folder and then run dir i get the correct output

12658179
google-chrome	firefox
it looks the same in google-chrome as it does in firefox

12658193
int	chars
i also know that these 40 bytes enclose int chars and other pointers

12658208
for-loop	loops
i rewrote it to use a while loops and it worked perfectly so whats wrong with the for-loop

12658224
post	get
why does the method become get and why is there no params in either get or post

12658228
rel	hreflang
have separate pages for each currency and use rel hreflang to indicate what country they relate to

12658245

if the show_login_error variable is true then i want to show the span if not then hide it

12658249
toupper	uppercase
why i cannot convert char type to uppercase with toupper when i gave the char an array.

12658269
super	self
well this question is super old now and according to my old self

12658280
for-loop	loops
i ve tried the sleep function if i put it in the for-loop it misses keypresses and if i put it in the while loops it doesn t lower cpu at all afaik

12658294
fgets	getline
the proper way to write this program would use fgets or better getline to read entire lines and then munch them by hand not with sscanf

12658314
gridbaglayout	miglayout
i m quite happy using miglayout right now but i m also seeing what the gridbaglayout has to offer as well

12658326
gridbaglayout	miglayout
edit for clarification miglayout is probably easier to use than gridbaglayout but if you get familiar with gridbaglayout it s not that hard to use and it doesn t require a download since it s part of the core java library

you could definitely make some serious progress in a couple of hours adding in fields to specifically show or hide you could even deal with the validation on a simple basis required fields would be simple for now just to get it rolling

12658917
for-loop	arrays
creating a new arrays with a different size and putting all the elements from the original arrays into the new one with a for-loop plus or minus the one he was adding removing

12658917
for-loop	arrays
friend b simply created an arrays of length m removing elements by setting their value to null and adding elements by scrubbing forward from index 0 until an empty spot was found this was a for-loop

12658917
for-loop	arrays
friend c me also created an arrays of length m but shifted every following value forward reduced their index by 1 with a for-loop when a string was removed so that n -1 was always the index of the last value when n 0 and n was also the index to add new values at eliminating the for-loop for adding strings

note that many architectures have alignment issues or optimizations meaning structures or arrays may need to start on 16-bit 32-bit or 64bit word boundaries but these are architecture specific

12659218
post	get
i m not sure but if you should want to send them as post of get vars you should do this

12659219
for-loop	arrays
reason is a has for-loop for each arrays to be added

12659263
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
for example the border-radius description says that firefox 4.0 and newer google-chrome 4.0 and safari 5.0 support the standard non-prefixed version

express	node.js
on node.js using express i am outputting json with a simple response.send myobject it s working fine but the response has a lot of white spaces indentations

12659353
stdout	stderr
stdout stderr and a file write stream are all sink type endpoints so i cannot bind them together

in generally there are too many examples on each field many ready to use code or libraries so i focus on the one you ask for the css way

12659494
int	chars
it returns the size of the return type from that function 4 on my implementation since that s what an int takes up for me which you would discover had you run it as is then changed the return type to chars at which point it would give you 1

12659533
hide	show
and then show or hide the text box client side if isalien is selected

12659559
width	margin	inherited	properties
the margin and width properties are not inherited except via the use of the inherited value

12659559
inherited	properties
however an inner element appears by default within the outer element visually so it may look like it inherited those properties

12659559
inherited	properties
there is no inherited problem for these properties

12659559
inherited	properties
for many other properties such as color an element inherited the properties from its parent if the properties is not set on the element itself

12659559
inherited	properties
if inherited is not desirable set the properties on the inner element

12659594

therefore if you set up the frc for example in viewdidload reloaddata will be called in viewwillappear and you don t have to call it manually

12659619
gridview	aspbutton
use aspbutton or imagebutton in gridview in code behind

12659631
for-loop	loops
in fact enumerable#each is a simple and universal way of doing a traditional iterating for-loop and each is much preferred over for loops in ruby

12659655
folder	directory
when i am using sorl_thumbnail the thumbnails generated are located in the right directory but when sorl_thumbnail is trying to retrieve an already existing thumbnail the url generated is you will notice that the media folder is omitted

12659673
for-loop	loops
and at the end of loops delete the that fitted the for-loop

12659674
nsurl	nsdata
seems you ll have to use a different solution to play media if you want to avoid leaking nsdata nsurl s

12659754
google-chrome	firefox
the following is triggering a syntax error unexpected identifier in google-chrome and in firefox

12659825
for-loop	loops
the for-loop itself loops over an empty list so no iterations will take place

12659867
margin	height
for #2 remove the fixed height on div.wrapper and add overflow auto this will allow the margin on div.hovered to have some effect on div.wrapper

12659925

12660096
post	get
the get call to fetch the logs depends on what you do when you receive the logs in the post call

12660106
width	height
set the width and height of the pseudo-element to 100 and the pseudo-element will stretch to the width and height of the wrapper element

12660146
width	height
of course you can resize the image there are many different ways like image#getscaledinstance int width int height int hints but this has its perils

12660152
groupbox	panel
edit for window application using panel groupbox would be best option since there is a property that you can utilize to retrieve all buttons in panel or any container control to minimize code and write clean logic

12660168
ggplot2	gtable
as the latest version of ggplot2 uses gtable internally you can do this kind of task quite easily

12660183
subtraction	add
you just add another field subtraction at index time with the value of end-start and then use

12660199

12660433
titlebar	window
i would like to add a button next to the close minimize maximize-buttons on the window titlebar using wpf

12660471
opentype	woff
the specification states that any properly licensed truetype opentype open font format file can be packaged in woff format for web use.

12660471
opentype	woff
because i have been unable to find a canonical source on how to handle truetype and opentype font files i have hypothesized that converting the file to woff format may be the best practice

12660479
partialfunction	implicit
the first solution using atleastoncewhen and a partialfunction can be combined with the second one using an implicit and the belike matcher to get maximum reusability of existing specs2 code

12660498

whether it s bmp png jpg

12660536
background-image	box-shadow
i would like to set some css trick rather than manually with box-shadow or background-image gradient because i have thousands of these rules in my css

12660538
phpmyadmin	sqlbuddy
honestly i recommand you gave up with phpmyadmin it s perfectly incapable of properly dealing with this note that sqlbuddy too fails in some way with that

12660688
for-loop	loops
should i need to user for-loop or while loops here

12660726
for-loop	arrays
the text to send in my mind isn t the problem but maybe the sending operation with the arrays in the for-loop

12660745

tinyint	boolean
i know that tinyint 1 is the same as boolean however i want to work on boolean data type instead of tinyint 1

12660763
rvm	bundler
rvm and passenger no such file to load - bundler - resolution was leftover configurations from an old virtual host in apache configuration files

12660866
pull	push
advantage is that you can change the pull request by pushing new changes to that branch even push -f if you need to change already pushed commits

12660899
pull	push
then finally you can push to github and create the pull request from your topic branch

12660920
waitpid	fork
i know fork wait waitpid zombie processes..

12660931
profiling	debugging
i m now debugging on the device using a distribution provisioning profiling

12660943
hash	md5
also generating an md5 hash does not guarantee you to get uniqe values because of md5 collisions

12661007
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested firefox google-chrome and ie9

12661027
glfw	glew
i already made sure that i have created an opengl context with glfw and initialized glew properly

12661111
width	height
i would like to know which dimension is getting bigger smaller - width or height

12661111
width	height
i need this because if i just put two conditions - if width is for 50px bigger than div and if height is for 50px bigger than div

12661111
width	height
then is working on just one condition and i can resize only width or height

12661133
put	get
after that just send the new coordinates to your server with a get or put http call

12661140
daemons	launchd
first you ll need to write an ios launchd daemons

12661140
daemons	launchd
see the blog for an example of how to write a launchd daemons

12661150
waitpid	fork
the code which you write inbetween fork and waitpid runs simultaniously alongside child fork

12661160

i have created my app details key secret etc in my twitter developer account and using the code from the example i get the twitter login and authorisation popup but once you click authorise all i get is a webview showing the callback url that i was required to put in the twitter app settings

12661198
jar	.war
there is no standard way to describe an executable jar in a pom file moreover you could make an executable .war extension doesn t make difference

12661212
mp3	wav
if you have a sound file of it such as an mp3 or wav use the mediaelement control

12661213
flex	osmf
besides videoplayer component is osmf based so you can develop a custom plugin to communicate with your red5 server and use it with flex s videoplayer

12661281
irc	telnet
let s see and try to understand the irc protocol using telnet a command-line telnet client program

12661281
irc	telnet
the whole lot of other stuff you can try yourself just by reading about irc protocol itself trying things with telnet or nc and then getting into coding a program using the basic sockets

12661338
post	get
you re submitting a post form and then searching for get variables

12661380
rsa	dsa
rsa keys are symmetrical you can use any of them as a private key or public key it is just a matter of your choice but dsa keys are not symmetrical

12661381
for-loop	loops
perhaps there is a performance improvement using a while loops than a for-loop

12661383
profiling	instrumentation
another way might be to use the instrumentation time profiling

12661397
post	get
conversely instead of mixing post and get values you could set a hidden field in the form

12661397
post	get
will pull the value from either the get values or the post values so it need only be present in one of them

12661416
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome and firefox obj.__proto__ has a value -- is this the said prototype property

12661466
inherited	properties
the only flaw i see with single table inherited is the number of columns which can be huge if you have a lot of properties and it is harder to add a new properties column in your model if you have to apply a db evolution

12661490
inherited	properties
every javascript object has an internal prototype properties often called prototype which points to the object from which it directly inherited

12661490
google-chrome	firefox
this is exposed in firefox and google-chrome by the non-standard __proto__ property

12661497
post	get
according to this servlet i can use login and send get or post data to this servelt it is perfectly ok

12661515

move	drag
how can i make effect when i start do drag to move both view controlles that one start disappear out from screen and another start to appear like we turn over photos in standard applications

12661542
hide	show
alternatively have two navbars one for normal devices one for mobile and just show hide them using the media query

12661584
dictionary	map
basically you need to define an inargument and map the external data to the arguments using a dictionary

12661673
google-chrome	firefox
my code performs exactly as expected but it seems i have a memory leak somewhere and over time abut 10 minutes the browser - ie google-chrome and firefox will accrue about 500mb ram usage

12661673
google-chrome	firefox
one more thing firefox s online crash reports are flipping awful there s been no dump after submitting and the issue is less pronounced on google-chrome ie - so no crash reports available

12661678
post	get
what exact error did you get by the way this would be much simpler if you could post the exact error code

12661680
std	ostream	ostream	istream
since talking about functions reading or writing data unless you really need to make use of specific details of std ofstream or std ifstream use open you should probably pass std ostream or std istream references

12661680
ostringstream	std
this way the functions can also be used with different stream stream types std ostringstream and std istringstream

12661706
min	max
also when n 1 it is more efficient to use the built-in min and max functions

12661710
int	chars
in c it is perfectly valid to or an int with a chars as you do in a| a

12661738
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
to use more than that amount you have use indexeddb google-chrome firefox ie10 and websql safari opera

12661750
jboss	glassfish
i cannot find anything on the web that even mentions invoking ejb s deployed on glassfish 3.1 from jboss 7.1.1

12661750
jboss	glassfish
i am able to invoke the ejb s deployed on glassfish with a standalone client and i am able to invoke the same ejb s deployed on jboss both from a standalone client and from glassfish

12661834
int	chars
therefore we need to convert to first two chars to int

12661834
int	chars
next is to multiple the first chars by 10 and add it to the second chars result this will give us result of the conversion and it is an int

12661884
put	get
you need to put the command generated the event in update panel as well to get the hidden

12661890
nsstring	nsdata
convert the nsdata to nsstring then restore it into nsdata for write to file not work

12661937
inline	inlining
functions are only inline if they are small enough or if you add a pragma specifically asking for inlining

12661958
disk	ram
another possibility is to never have your code on disk only keep it in ram

12661970
free	malloc
this copies the data into a malloc region which is nice because it is safe and the c code doesn t need to do anything special to free it other than free

12662060
for-loop	loops
since c++11 with its range based for-loop the easiest and simplest is a range class template that in addition to supporting loops supports set membership checking as a method contains

12662106
qpainter	qwidget	qtextedit	qwidget
i m eluded as the documentation says specifically that qpainter can draw on any qwidget which a qtextedit is.

12662113
try-catch	exception-handling
i understand there s a problem with injecting an exception-handling into a continuation but why can t i simply put the shifted call inside a try-catch block

12662113
try-catch	exception-handling
obviously i need him to be able to call the function inside a try-catch block even though the shifted call itself will not raise an exception-handling

12662166
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization

12662179
firefox	safari
upon opening the page for the first time most browsers ie firefox safari scroll down to the first field of the contact form possibly due to an auto focus

12662245

it does not perform ssl handshake or encryption so no https

12662252
postgresql	mysql
but there are specific sub modes for sql postgresql mysql ansi etc

12662253
crossover	mutation
there are a lot of tricks to make genetic algorytm work better choosing appropriate population encoding into genom finding a good fitness function playing with crossover and mutation ratio

12662284
google-chrome	safari
after some searching i also managed to make it render smoothly in google-chrome and safari

12662293
range	max
i am trying to get the max value in a range of cells that should be looked up somehow

12662323
google-chrome	firefox
however it will not work with google-chrome firefox or ie when launched in the same manner triggers the error event

the only pure-css way to center something both horizontally and vertically i know of requires the thing to be of a fixed width and height but given that

12667577
width	height
set left margins to negative half of the width and height respectively

meanwhile the iteration order of dictionaries isn t specified but in practice cpython and pypy iterate in the order of the hash buckets not the id memory location of either the value or the key and whatever jython and ironpython do they may be using some underlying java or .net collection that has different behavior

12667665
cpython	pypy
if you run it repeatedly with cpython 2.7 cpython 3.2 and pypy 1.9 the keys will always be iterated in order 0 1 2

12669515
inline	inlining
note that getcallingassembly has a remark mentioning that depending on how jit inlining behaves it may be possible that one method is or is not inline into another and so getcallingassembly returns varying results

12669515
inline	inlining
jit inlining could technically inline the code that calls getexecutingassembly and so that code now belongs to a different assembly and depending on whether that happened getexecutingassembly can just as well produce varying results

12669518

12669805
invalidoperationexception	notsupportedexception
i am not sure which of notsupportedexception or invalidoperationexception i should use in that case

12669807
invalidoperationexception	notsupportedexception
however the point of invalidoperationexception vs notsupportedexception is actually moot in the case of implementing a collection - given the description of isreadonly on msdn the only permitted behavior for isreadonly is that its value never changes after the collection is initialized

12669819
int	boolean
the compareto method returns an int value not a boolean

submit	submission
i believe what is happening is jquery is sending the form data via ajax but you are not stopping the default submit button from submission the html form like normal

12675908
submit	submission
adding the code above should stop the submit buttons default action submission form to send.php thus leaving you on the current page

12675929

as i ve stated previously you should get the button name by calling the requests post data this is done by

12693860
getter	setter
then to get the output into your model inside your model class you would create a property as well as setter and getter method for it

12693874

when i create classes derived from nativewindow i set the x y width and height properties prior to calling activate

monkeyrunner	adb
for example if you have a monkeyrunner script and issued a command to launch calculator app you can have a python subprocess monitoring adb logcat -b events output to determine whether calculator app has been launched or not

12694919
width	height
negative margins works only for cutting top and bottom part -- when the height of the image has to be cut and the width is left unchanged to put portrait image into the square

12694919
width	height
i have found that this technique for specifying aspect ratio to cut the width leaving the height unchanged putting landscape image into the square works well with bootstrap s scaling

12694919
google-chrome	safari
so far i checked it in current google-chrome and safari

12694919
width	height
question how can i do it in one way for both cutting the width and the height

12694944
free	malloc
and of course what you have malloc ed don t forget to free

12694950
cos	sin
i recently wanted to use lookup tables with interpolation to get an angle and then compute the sin and cos of that angle

12694950
cos	sqrt	cos	sin	sin	sqrt
instead i put sin x in the table instead of x and then used the taylor series for y sqrt 1-x x to compute the cos x from that

12694961
for-loop	loops
you need to loops over the items in your list for example using the enhanced for-loop syntax

12694968
width	height
here s a more generic form for if height and width must be less than 115

12694968
width	height
this guarantees that the largest dimension of the image be it height or width will be no greater than 115

12694989
post	get
i used this post and sample code to get a paging grid up and running using odata

if wider than 115 set width to be 115px and height height original_width 115

12695011
gif	png
after you have the correct dimensions you can resize the image using imagecreatefromjpeg png gif and then imagecopyresampled

12695054
ssms	sqlcmd
you can also use the sqlcmd or osql in sql 2000 to store the output from a command line outside of ssms very like working with mysql from the command line

dbcontext	objectcontext
i have been reading online about dbcontext and objectcontext but i cannot find them

width	height
your proportion is lets say height width ratio so put it to a variable

12695084
width	height
ratio width height

12695084

12695195
google-chrome	firefox
i test it by ie9 firefox 15 and google-chrome 22

12695200
implements	extends
the reason is that although we can use pseudo classical inheritance in javascript we actually have to implements our own extends or inherit

12695200
inherited	properties
what about the prototypal inherited -- i think it does have the feature that if foo.bar is used if bar is not a properties of foo the interpreter or the compiled code such as if using google v8 will go up the prototype chain but there is no built in method to make object b s hidden prototype properties point to a as a prototypal chain

12695207
pascal	delphi
the actual problem is not with type inference but with the types not being compatible per the strict rules of pascal delphi

12695224
portrait	landscape
there are several threads about issues going from portrait to landscape but not from landscape to portrait

12695224
portrait	landscape
i used to have the normal zooming issue when going from portrait to landscape so i added the tag

12695225
int	chars
usually string object store their length and therefore getting and comparing the int is very fast and has less memory access than an equals where you - in the worst case - have to check the length and loop over the chars

12695225
cfstring	nsstring
equals part in objective-c - nsstring is based on cfstring

12695244
google-chrome	firefox
however the content is loaded via google-chrome or firefox it loads normally and the content can be seen

12695313
google-chrome	safari
i ve noticed that safari and google-chrome will display the last element on top

12695363
udp	tcp
there are applications available that can open files on or from a remote machine but they tend to use a tcp or udp connection to transfer the data instead of an http connection

12695415
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works nicely in all the usual suspects google-chrome firefox safari but on ie for some odd reason even if you inspect the element with firebug lite and it shows the clone having when you change it the changeaccesssystem function gets called with the first argument being system_row_0

12695426
dictionary	map
i renamed your dictionary variable to map to avoid masking the built-in dictionary type

12695468
google-chrome	firefox
you can see the same effect with letter-spacing where firefox will allow non-integer values in pixels while google-chrome will round the closest pixel

12695497
udp	tcp
i have a game with a udp tcp server and client

12695497
udp	tcp
one udp port 2406 for updating the client s location and one tcp port 2407 for the chat

12695497

i ll try to post as much info as possible related to the udp and not the tcp

12695497
udp	tcp
ports are forwarded like udp 2406 tcp 2407

12695632
google-chrome	safari
as you can see in this jsfiddle the check-mark looks ok in your average windows browser but safari on mac and ipad perhaps even google-chrome on mac shows the check-mark outside the menu and there s nothing i can do to make it move even a pixel

12695636
getter	setter
if a class contains only properties and i mean truly properties with only getter and setter that have no side effects there is no need to test them

folder	directory
is there a problem with my directory structure folder naming conventions

12695890
getter	setter
note that the function takes a this pointer to an object a getter and a setter public member functions

12695890
getter	setter
the function will then interface with a gui allowing the getter and setter to be called back later

12695908
int	double
you should check if the result is actually an int or a double and if int you do

12695908
int	double
in short you have to explicitly rewrite operations that are done on int instead of double

12695908
int	double
but you can do like int i when an operation requires an int and i is double

12695919
int	double
in c++ you emulate this behavior by casting a double data type to an int and shifting

12695944
spaces	delimiter
assuming topictitle and the criteria are spaces delimiter strings i would intersect the two collections and check if there were any matches

12695984
integer	unsigned
the current c and c++ standards both limit unsigned integer representations to a pure binary representation so what you have above is entirely safe and guaranteed to work

12695989
integer	unsigned
cast your unsigned integer to a signed one when saving to sql

12695998
getter	setter
requires that setter s argument is a const reference to whatever getter returns

12695998
getter	setter
allows the setter argument and the getter return type to be different

12696009
google-chrome	firefox
you can then see this information in a debugging tool such as firebug for firefox or the built in ones in google-chrome

12696395
post	put
the form is post to an api that uses activerecord to put the params into the database

12696398
free	malloc
actually your main problem is you have corrupted your memory and now when program want to exit it want to free its internal allocated memory memory that used to store per thread data and since you are using debug version it will check its memory and understand the failure and start to show an assertion window now when it want to show its assertion window it need to allocate some memory and use memory allocation routines malloc witch will be converted to malloc_dbg in this case to allocate its required memory and malloc_dbg check memory status and understand your memory corruption and try to show an assertion window again and this procedure will be repeated

12696430
int	boolean
in his explanation odersky argues that the type is anyval because it is the most specific supertype of int and boolean the types of the two conditional branches

12696446
portrait	landscape
the easiest workaround i can see is first render to pdf the portrait bit from report 1 then render the second report in landscape and do custom post-processing to join the two documents together

12696450
post	get
that s a get request not a post request - if you can t make a post request via your code or sdk for some reason you can simulate one by adding to the request

12696501

google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it looks good but in firefox the left and right side are too short you can see this at

12696677
post	get
see if the form itself is submitting the turn camera on variable as get or post

12696677
submit	submission
if you don t want to open a browser to do this you could write yourself a custom application that submit it for you but either way you have to open something to make the submission as a script has to wait x amount of time before making the request

12696677
post	get	submit	submission
what i would do on the scripting side since merely accessing this script means you want to activate the timer most likely would be to create a timer object in javascript and then make a single function that either accesses the url of the camera form submission with the get string parameters that s easiest if it s doable via get because you wont have to build a form or if it s post have the function build a form and submit the form via post to the same url

12696702
stdout	stderr
finally i m not sure what editor you re using but it sounds like it s masking the real problem if you re getting dialog boxes instead of messages and tracebacks straight from the interpreter s stderr stdout

12696744
pull	push
no - you can change gravity but it will pull push only in the direction you have it set to never to any point

12696765
qstring	qbytearray
use qstring toutf8 which converts a qstring to a qbytearray

12696778
setinterval	settimeout
to do this i thought using settimeout instead of setinterval but that didnt work

12696796
getter	setter
i was wondering whether there is a way to define super models with getter and setter methods that allow me to edit the necessary data in one place

12696798
verilog	vhdl	verilog	hdl
this site has open source hdl verilog and vhdl implementations of working hardware.

12696804

postgresql	mysql
i discovered that much like mysql postgresql requires that i use semi colons at the end of a command

12696965
jobs	cron
i realize that it s possible to use cron jobs to output a daily number but that seems like it would duplicate data

12696968
integer	fractions
if you know the maximum of fractions digits you are going to process you can multiply your original values by a suitable power of 10 and use integer arithmetic for your computations

12697024
getter	setter
you could use virtual attributes on the person model and put custom assignment logic within the getter setter for each of the editable address attributes

12697058
nsmanagedobject	mogenerator
i know there are some recommendations to have an interface that sits in front of the nsmanagedobject for testing purposes but this seems to be adding complexity on top of the mogenerator machine human files

12697070
explode	substr
i also feel substr isn t quite as easy to read in current explode you can see the delimiter immediately with no extra function calls and there is only one incident of the variable which makes it less prone to human errors

12697070
explode	substr
basically i read current explode as i am taking the first incident of anything prior to this string as opposed to substr which is i am getting a substr starting at the 0 position and continuing until this string.

12697135
capitalize	substr
that way you could loop through all the links and substr to get the path capitalize the first letter prepend a #show to the front and pop it into the href attribute like you are doing

12697180
capitalize	substr
it capitalize each substr delimited by except for specified strings such as a or the

12697184
stdout	stderr
dmcs puts some messages on stdout and some on stderr

12697184
stdout	stderr
coderunner expects stdout to only contain the output file name nothing else so to make that happen can be used to redirect everything else to stderr

12697208
children	parent
so let s for a moment consider making parent div s position absolute and setting it at 100 height so that your relatively positioned children sidebar will get the same height if its height is set to 100

12697266
hide	show
in my routine to show hide the sidebar i see traces of say the enter_frame event but it holds the last mousex position it was aware of before the mouse left the window not the current mouse position within the desktop rect

move	drag
the purpose of this is because as you will see later is when i spin though my objects if i change the childindex value it seems to occur right away and if i drag items 2 3 4 it will skip item 3 and only move item 2 4

12697729
int	boolean
the index value can be boolean or int

fread	calloc
in both cases we allocate enough memory for 101 characters to account for the 0 terminator and since fread won t write a 0 terminator to the end of the input we initialize the memory to all-bits-zero in both cases the first by using an initializer the second with the call to calloc

12698056
button	checkbox
basically what you are saying there is that if the event came from the button and the event came from the checkbox show a message

12698056
button	checkbox
this is not possible because one event cannot be triggered by a button and a checkbox in the same time

12698058
gridview	radgrid
i have a radgrid gridview that has the option to edit and insert new items

12698060

it sounds like you should be handling the button click and within that event handler check the state checked or not of the checkbox

12698089
folder	directory
the dll is missing from your system s environment and has nothing to do with compiling and linking your executable adding the dll folder to your library directory folder is meaningless

listview	gridview
my problem is that i use a gridview which has to become a listview when the window is snapped because of the small horizontal space left

12698884
hash	md5
i gave a look to possible ways to create this hash and since i would like to avoid collisions i need to insert several millions of entries it seems that the ripemd-160 algorithm is the best one even if a quick search gave me several similar solutions that use sha256 or even sha1 and md5

12698888
wordpress	joomla
i feel you would have an easier time using a cms such as wordpress drupal joomla etc

12698910
post	get
if this is the same bug i noticed just last week friday in fact what i think you ll find is that the same httpwebrequest object or backing connection object - i never checked is being reused but the connection has stayed open to the old server in your case and that new get post invocations re-use that connection instead of forcing it to connect to data.domain.com like it should

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this is sort of just the bare-necessities of getting json data from php into js google-chrome firefox safari newer ie and a very simple strategy for putting that data in html and putting it into the page

jsf	seam
my project already works in a glassfish 3.1.2 environment based on seam 3 jsf and mysql

12698969
getter	setter
after investigations it seems that the compilation issue was related to tag getter setter type mismatch on a certain tag from the tiles library

12698984
folder	directory
however regardless you could put that file inside of a separate folder then make it a virtual directory and that should block dnn s processing of the request

12698997

12699040
serializable	deserialization
does anyone has any idea about the serializable and deserialization performance of long vs dobule

12699049
fink	macports
these locations have been created by macports and fink - be warned that it is quite possible that freetype2 might not be found by pil after this move - if you need it then just rename libjpeg parts in those locations

12699140
screens	tablet
the game is a top-down car game which won t have huge tracks or anything but they ll have to be at least as big as the device s screens or better yet its resolution and since we re aiming for tablet as well having trouble with something like 1.0f 400.0f means fixed-point is out of the question

12699156
int	chars
you can transform them back in int first level is 1 by default and chars

12699160
serializable	deserialization
and i m merely guessing here but intuitively i d say serializable deserialization of floating point types are costlier operations than the same operations on integral data types but even if there are differences they will be quite small on modern systems

12699161
urllib	cookielib
i have been doing a lot of searching and reading about using the libraries urllib urllib2 and cookielib but i haven t been able to figure out how to get it working properly

12699185

when should i use get or post method

12699234
post	get
get or post

12699234
post	get
since i m allowing people to register their emails for future newsletters i figured that get would be the preferred method but i hear alot of people just say use post for everything

12699234
post	get
get or post

12699261
post	get
both are ok however mails will be hold in history by get if you dont want this you should use post

width	height
in my program there is a rectangle class which has methods to set it s width height and it s origin from a class called xypoint

12699277
width	height
the intersects method takes a rectangle as an argument arect and uses the containspoint method in an if statement to check if it intersects with the reciever and if it does return a rectangle with an origin at the intersect and the correct width and height

12699295
post	get
post is generally used to modify data on the server get should generally return data and be idempotent

12699316
nsmanagedobject	mogenerator
where i expected to find all my auto-generated nsmanagedobject sub-classes i instead have what some googling reveals to be classes generated by mogenerator a tool that i have no experience with

12699358
rss	feed
in order to change the default rss feed you will modify the feed-myposttype.php template you made and redefine the action do_feed_rss2 like this

12699362
post	get
while post amd get would both work the actual preferred way is post

12699362
post	get
and yes you are right the user can read the get but they also can read modify your post so no point in taking that in consideration

12699394
multiplying	multiplication
i won t go into the details of fractional multiplication because i don t remember them but the important part is when multiplying to get a result c d then c is

12699405
cvs	svn
my foo bar.java migrated at cvs version 1.2.33.5 to svn as svn-rev.5678 would receive the following property

cvs	svn
last change to my foo bar.java cvs version 1.2.33.4 was mapped to svn-rev.5145 which has the svn property set for our file to

12699405
cvs	svn
svn status log for that file can be easily browsed so can be both changes made to that file and the history of svn cvs property values

12699405
cvs	svn
one major concern we have is how not to loose the svn cvs properties introduced during our first migration

12699409
put	get
to modify data use put to get metadata about data use head to remove data use delete you get the idea

12699454

i am trying to get a function to split a string containing several words which are separated by 1 or more spaces and put each word without any spaces into an index of an array of strings

12699482
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc
on linux the man pages on free says it is illegal to call free on a pointer that was not returned by malloc calloc or realloc

12699482
int	chars	free	malloc
i ask this because i read that the c standard does not require different pointer types int and chars to have the same size and i fail to understand how this is possible since they both need to be convertible to a void in order to call the malloc free functions

12699507
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
safari and firefox display this perfectly but google-chrome has a 100px space at the top of the #content div

see site in google-chrome and then in firefox and safari

12699509
x86	64bit
i have used fixed point libs successfully in the past on x86 in the 386 486 era and they all used a 64bit intermediate for multiplies before the correcting shift in fact i seem to remember intel provided a very nice 32x32-to-64 bit multiply instruction which was just perfect for this

12699520
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
as long as the pointer passed to was returned by malloc realloc calloc it s valid

12699528
awt	swing
i m having some big trouble getting java s swing and awt libraries first time working with them to work correctly for me

12699536
int	chars
since int is bigger than chars an pointer could require less information to indicate what it points to

12699598
put	get
and my final option is you can put conditional logic into the template to get different html

12699617
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the solution so far works with google-chrome safari and firefox

12699648
viewdidload	viewwillappear
to solve the problem instead i know that setting the images in viewwillappear instead of viewdidload and setting the images to nil in viewdiddisappear is releasing the memory and the app doesn t crash

12699663
google-chrome	firefox
and it work on google-chrome firefox etc.

your two rectangles intersect but the intersection does not contains either origin

12699919
accessor	properties
core data dynamically intercepts properties accessor at runtime

12699953
accessor	properties
properties can be used as though they are public data members but they are actually special methods called accessor

12699954
getter	setter
properties have a getter and a setter - their purpose is obvious to get and set the value of the property

12699969
width	height
if you set the height and width of your button to wrap_content instead you will find that it perfectly wraps text on multiple devices

12699975
getter	setter
of course you can also define the getter and setter methods yourself like this

12699981
lxml	elementtree
if you are not restricted to just using the standard library i suggest you install and use the lxml package which provides the elementtree and it has a number of advantages including easily allowing you to have multiple namespaces in the same document
