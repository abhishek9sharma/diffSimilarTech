400012
ubuntu	debian
but os updates usually have little effect on the dev server stack i m using and in any case my deployment environment uses a different os i develop on osx and ubuntu and deploy on debian and solaris

400021
mouse	keyboard
a decent keyboard and mouse are essential

400021
mouse	keyboard
for the last 10 or so years i ve always taken my own mouse and keyboard to work as you typically end up with whatever comes from the pc manufacturer

400031
post	get
probably the only choice is to read it on the client side and transfer it manually to the server get post ajax

400047
xen	openvz
if using debian debootstrap is your friend coupled with qemu xen openvz lguest or a plethora of others

400134
tax	shipping
then at the solution level you have the components and the apis for dealing with user profiling identity management and personalization content authoring versioning and publishing content search product catalogs for tangible and intangible goods product search and guided navigation pricing tax calculation promotions shopping carts gift lists and wish lists payment types shipping methods order tracking customer relationship management etc

400134
pull	push
the v iew in mvc should be populated by the model - it is a push mechanism with the model updating the view not a pull mechanism with the view querying the model

400149
ilist	icollection
you would because defining an ilist or an icollection would open up for other implementations of your interfaces

400149
ilist	icollection
you might want to have an iorderrepository that defines a collection of orders in either a ilist or icollection

400149
ilist	icollection
you could then have different kinds of implementations to provide a list of orders as long as they conform to rules defined by your ilist or icollection

400188
ienumerable	iqueryable
in the standard implementation of linq the operators select and where map to methods that return an ienumerable or iqueryable

400254
post	get
later php will send back private details to flash using get post

400254
ssl	https
a secure connection https or http via ssl

400264
integer	unsigned
while it is relatively easy to decide which integer type to use you select smallest enough to hold the value with some added complexity for signed unsigned with floats it is not this easy

400292
post	get
whether you use flash or php you re still using html form technology specificaion to do the get post thus using flash is just as secure or insecure as using php perl cgi etc

400375
put	get
of course the best solution is to use a restful client and use a combination of nsurlconnection to get send the data and the touchxml classes to parse the data though this would require more work to put the data into a dictionary

400377
actionscript	mxml
you write apps using actionscript similar to javascript and mxml markup used primarily for layout view code

400474
ssl	https
.net should handle the creation of the ssl connection without being told what port to use when you use the https protocol

400513
post	get
just to rule out the possibility you aren t actually trying to see the fragment on a get post and actually want to know how to access that part of a uri object you have within your server-side code it is under uri.fragment msdn docs

400565
inherited	properties
my objective is to code something like the example below but this class objects must inherited the httpwebrequest properties and methods

400590
put	get
note you really need to put code in here for the case that totalvisits 0 or you will get a division by 0 answer

400591
javassist	cglib
since hibernate 3.3 the default bytecode provider is now javassist rather than cglib

400675
folder	directory
one thing i ve noticed is that you can t successfully version anything in a build directory because vs thinks it owns the build directory and is likely to delete your .svn folder is this just for builds involving a clean

400697
vmware	virtualbox
with virtualization using virtualpc vmware virtualbox etc it in theory should be possible to support vb6 applications provided you have a host os that can run vb6 correctly that you can virtualize that can run these applications

400710
int	double
inputs current date maturity date coupon payment frequency int coupon amount double

400751
vb.net	vb6
so when microsoft made vb.net incompatible with vb6 this was a big deal for many of us

400764
versioning	upgrade
however i prefer to have a versioning table that can contain multiple rows with fields for the versioning number the time the update occured and the user that performed the upgrade

400764
versioning	upgrade
if you want to be really clever you can put checks in you upgrade scripts so they won t run unless the previous versioning of the database is correct

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
this is the primary use that i ve found for entity-relationship entity-relationship diagram and the entity-relationship model in general

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
in fact entity-relationship diagram don t need foreign keys at all

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
a well built entity-relationship diagram will have very little harmful redundancy in it but that s largely serendipity and not the result of careful planning

400773
entity-relationship	entities	entity-relationship	diagram
the entities and relationships in a stakeholder oriented entity-relationship diagram should only include entities that are understood by the subject matter experts and not include entities or relationships that are added in the course of logical database design

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
the beauty of entity-relationship models and diagram is that they can be used to talk about data not only in databases but also as the data appears in forms that users can see

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
it s possible to turn a well built entity-relationship diagram into a moderately well built relational schema by a fairly mechanical process

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
a few technical stakeholders need to understand the relational schema and not merely the entity-relationship diagram

400857
pascal	delphi
you could use 7zip lzma bindings for pascal compatible with delphi

400867
mouse	keyboard
getting proficient with a mix of sr and keyboard mouse is much easier than full hands-free operation

400891
width	height
it is irritating that width 100 works but height 100 does not

400891
width	height
i have tried the kb article that sets the height and width to 100 and the frame custom rules to table-layout auto but this doesn t work

400892
verilog	vhdl
i suppose that a similar setup can be achieved by downloading a vhdl verilog core of your cpu did you try opencores

400895
typedef	struct
in a typical c or c++ compiler the question of whether x is a type or not is answerable because the parser communicates such information to the lexer as soon as it processes a typedef or struct declaration

400937
width	height
have you tried only specifying width 100 and leaving the height specification off of the grid completely

400938
g++	gcc
it has been a while since i ve used anything but gcc g++

400958
for-loop	loops
you can use a for-loop to loops through the data but the length needs to be know or the data needs to be terminated by a know value eg

400966
min	max
aside from paging any time you want the most or least insert metric here row from a table ordering on whatever metric and limiting to 1 row is ime better than doing a subquery using min max

400989
for-loop	loops
i inserted an alert in the for-loop and the success function and it seems like loops gets executed cities.length times then i get the success function alerts

401014
post	get
only after some hours of searching forum post and experimentation was i able to get it working but i can t say i have it figured out

401036
keyevent	onkeydown
onkeydown keyevent event

401040
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i perform a hit test on the super layer when the touchesbegan and touchesmoved methods are invoked

401042
for-loop	arrays
the index variable cityidx is updated in the closure you create as the for-loop is processed so by the time your function on success is run cityidx will point to the last element in the arrays

401045
invokerequired	begininvoke
every winforms ui element has two members to help you with this invokerequired which returns a boolean if it is being executed on any thread other than the thread the element was created on in which case you must switch threads and begininvoke which automatically switches to the correct thread

401074
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation log profiling and tune the application sps as named database interface components of your system without affecting or re-deploying the application code

401142
post	get
trying using the jquery ajax api - you can use it to send arbitrary data via get or post and you don t need to set up a hidden form or anything

401200
udp	tcp
some solutions can selectively filter traffic for instance by port number tcp or udp etc

401241
post	get
when i go to post start i get the following error

401279
vsto	add-in
vba add-in are a bit troublesome to deploy but vsto is even more so

401323
folder	directory
this returns each individual folder in the directory array

401331
bazaar	git
i asked specifically about subversion but i d also like to hear about how bazaar mercurial and git handle this case too.

401335
post	put
assuming you re using the default scaffolding put this line before the map.resources post line in config routes.rb

401421
ubuntu	linux
some information on how it is done in ubuntu and this is a generalized guide for linux unix

401503
width	height
3 - determine the width and height of all captions in pixels and compare that to the control s width height and adjust accordingly

401515
folder	directory
the solution to this problem was to do temporary impersonation with a user account that had access to the share permissions on the folder and permissions on the virtual directory

401523
folder	directory
the answer to this solution for me was to setup temporary impersonation with a user account that had access to the share the folder and the virtual directory

401528
gridgain	terracotta
if i decided that object reuse was important i d do it with products like terracotta tangersol gridgain etc

401627
width	height
define a width and height for

401639
firefox	safari
the browser webkit which is what the iphone uses ie firefox safari doesn t see what happens on the server which is where the asp.net lives

401684
hash	md5
never hash passwords with sha1 or md5 or even sha256

401684
pbkdf2	hash	scrypt	pbkdf2
use pbkdf2 if you cannot use either bcrypt or scrypt with sha2 hash

401693
hash	salt
by using a salt any salt you re preventing the use of a generic rainbow table to attack your hash some people have even had success using google as a sort of rainbow table by searching for the hash

401698
hash	salt
but if the string is salt say with the string my_personal_salt the hash for the empty string my_personal_salt becomes aeac2612626724592271634fb14d3ea6 hence non-obvious to backtrace

401698
hash	md5
there are actually websites that do just this - you can feed it a md5 hash and it spits out a known plaintext that generates that particular hash

401720
inherited	subclassing
usually each definition instance is a subclassing of a general class for that definition type wankelengine inherited enginetype

401746
serializable	deserialization
the work is going to be in the serializable and deserialization of the controls when you initialize them to make sure you re capturing what you need the textbox values the isselected etc.

401823
width	height
for a figure already created i believe there is a set_size_inches width height method

401831
width	height
as long as the cards are staying four-square with the sides then you collide with the sides when the distance between the card center and the wall is 1 2 the width or height as appropriate

401844
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
an objectinputstream deserializes primitive data and objects previously written using an objectoutputstream

401892
width	height
you pass it a string and it calculates the width and height of the string using the currently selected font

401894
filesystems	ntfs
using an account that includes system permissions because even as an admin you can t open the master file table kind of an inode table of an ntfs filesystems

401908
getter	setter
so the question then become this is there a way i can develop a managed interface to json classes that both lets me use setter and getter for properties but also allows me to get the json serialization behavior i desire

401916
intersect	contains
if the circle intersect with two neighboring edges of the rectangle it must contains the corner connecting those two edges

401972
profiler	visualvm
why not use visualvm or a profiler to take a look at your code

401985
hash	salt
each user has an id a number and a password which is stored as a salt hash

402030
width	height
if the distance between the center of the circle and all of the vertices is greater than the radius of the circle and all of those distances are shorter than the width and height of the rectangle then the circle should be inside of the rectangle

402034
httphandler	httpmodule
for example moving httpmodule and httphandler to their new location within

402051
public	protected
even if your protected variable was public instead of protected you won t have the desired input since this will output the entire object like this

402055
rss	feed
the update of rss feed in a

402060
int	chars
my big worry about having a table full of chars int is you may still find yourself executing large volumes of pointless string comparisons especially if you use word on this new table

402104
hide	show
use jquery to add an onchange handler to your dropdown list and when the value of the dropdown list is other show the textbox otherwise hide it

402121
put	get
if you put in sufficient effort you would find that you get to the point where you can quickly design sites confidently which best illuminate your content

402156
post	get
these are http get and post requests

402156
tapestry	sitemesh
there are much more comprehensive frameworks and libraries in java too for a single web appl you may need to join several of these libraries such as spring webwork tapestry lucene for search sitemesh for page decoration

402296
16-bit	64bit
you ve probably heard processors described as being 16-bit 32-bit 64bit etc

402298
emacs	jedit
in addition i use jedit the only visual editor that i ve seen--besides emacs that allows you total control over highlighting

402329
dwoo	smarty
also checkout a new templating language called dwoo which is similar to smarty but also takes some ideas from django templating

402357
xslt	xquery
net at this date does not implement xpath 2.0 xslt 2.0 or xquery

402379
put	get
so my recommendation is if you can afford it get a job no matter if the pay is bad put your hands on any jsp project as soon as you can

402477
autocomplete	autosuggest
you re definitely looking for autosuggest autocomplete this is rather time-consuming to implement fully if you want to do it in pure javascript but yes you could use the example from strager to get started

402487
getattr	setattr
the basics of this approach is to use django s contibute_to_class method to dynamically add a new field to your model and uses getattr setattr to do the serializing on demand

402493
base	tilde
i think in the long run if you reorganize or restructure the file locations of the web pages the tilde notation will make it much easier for you to refactor since you always know that the base path is referring to the root of the web application

402527
getter	setter
it only initializes the bare minimum and lets users set the rest with getter and setter

402528
getter	setter
you may have getter and setter functions but probably may be avoided from the interface as described here

402550
public	protected
to allow subtypes of non-serializable classes to be serialized the subtype may assume responsibility for saving and restoring the state of the supertype s public protected and if accessible package fields

402550
public	protected
during deserialization the fields of non-serializable classes will be initialized using the public or protected no-arg constructor of the class

402622
int	chars
if i understand correctly the type conversion will be converting a chars array of size 8192 to a short int array of size half of that which is 4096

402623
unsigned	short
the statement that you show doesn t cast a char to an unsigned short it casts a pointer to a char to a pointer to an unsigned short

402623
unsigned	short
note that sizeof unsigned short is unlikely to be one so that won t necessarily correspond to

402623
unsigned	short
it is more likely - if say sizeof unsigned short is two - to correspond to and

402624
unsigned	short
when you do unsigned short slt unsigned short lookup_ext

402624
unsigned	short
of bytes equivalent to the size of unsigned short are picked up from the location given by lookup_ext and stored at the location pointed to by slt

402624
unsigned	short
since unsigned short would be 2 bytes first two bytes from lookup_ext would be stored in the location given by slt

402629
postgresql	mysql
for mysql and postgresql

402635
unsigned	short
that will interpret the bytes making up the array as unsigned short objects when you read from that pointer s target

402635
unsigned	short
strictly speaking the above is undefined behavior because you can t be sure the array is suitable aligned and you would read from a pointer that s not pointing at the type of the original pointed type unsigned char - unsigned short

402635
memcpy	memmove
that s all the structs and simple types that are possible in c too such as short broadly speaking is by using such library functions as memcpy or memmove

402635
unsigned	short
so if you read above you would interpret the first bytes of the array and try to read it as unsigned short that s called type pun

402643
width	height
assumes a div with as you are already specifying height and width adding a background shouldn t be an issue

402655
hide	show
you might like to add events that hide and show the div when the textbox gains or loses focus

402671
thin	webrick
after that both webrick and thin crashes immediately with

402685
rss	feed
update - unfortunately no rss feed

402693
rss	feed
if the other site provides an rss feed for their notices easiest would be to use an rss plugin for joomla to present them

402759
rss	feed
as there isn t yet an rss feed for your target -- you could write one in php which iirc joomla is written in so i ll assume support

402774
disk	ram
plenty of ram assigned to each vm avoids swapping and aids caching meaning less disk i o

402806
trie	tree
a suffix tree is more or less an advanced trie here you can also search for any substrings in o c as for the trie

402816
rss	feed
i agreed with frankodwyer and rowland s answers but one thing to consider is bugging the site owner if it s still actively developed i assume so if there is new news to add an rss feed

402918
ubuntu	linux
let s take a linux os my ubuntu system is already unicode aware

402977
vmware	esx
edit we use vmware here and the reason we can t use real keys is that our esx servers are running more vms than they have real usb ports and sharing is not acceptible

403007
int	chars
int and takes a float and two chars

403122
folder	directory
i put the typed dataset into one of the existing directory as it was in the app_code directory of the previous site but don t see the option to create that asp.net folder in this project

403165
firefox	safari
the problem occurs both in safari and firefox latest version

403233
sorting	filtering
i use them to create dynamic queries whether it be for sorting or filtering the data

403274
put	get
and with svn you can set up ignores for files and folders so the files in your web projects dont get put into svn and the ignore attributes are checked out onto each developer s machine

403397
hash	salt
for example in a project i m working on now i pass an employeedata object over the network that includes most of my l2s employee fields but excludes things like the employee s salt hash password salt

403488
sorting	filtering
finding the exact position of where the item is supposed to go into the list box would be pretty complex based on any sorting filtering rules you have

403583
public	protected
edit a little too late after asking this question i realized i d forgotten to exclude the standard pattern of package protected implementation classes possibly providing implementations of public interfaces

403629
width	height
i ve deconstructed a standard wpf button using blend and have managed to create a nicely styled button but i cannot figure out how to make the path fill the interior of the button space the button width and height

403656
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
argumentexception argumentoutofrangeexception argumentnullexception or similar

403683
weka	orange
use weka or orange

403687
pop-up	dialog
i remember reading somewhere about the concept of switching ok-cancel cancel-ok in certain situations to prevent the user from clicking through information pop-up or dialog boxes without reading their content

403735
rss	feed
i m using jalbum to create my webalbum and since version 8.1 jalbum supports rss feed of the albums

403735
rss	feed
however the rss feed generated by jalbum do not work for albums containing a hierarchy of folders

403735
rss	feed
what they try to do in the rss feed is to include the rss feed of the subfolders by including a element see example below

403735
rss	feed
it is possible to change the rss template used by jalbum to generate the rss feed

403735
rss	feed
i m trying to fix this and other problems but really doubt if it is possible at all to refer from one rss feed to another and have the entries of the sub feed be included in the main feed

403735
rss	feed
is it possible to included rss feed in another feed

403747
ubuntu	linux
cross-platform the application is be coded with cross-platform in mind windows - linux ubuntu - mac osx so the localized text system have to be cross platform too

403769
inherited	subclassing
in the interests of full disclosure i should warn you that i have the toolstrippanel and one of the toolstrips added to a baseclass form and i am trying to add the other toolstrip to a subclassing form that inherited from the baseclass form

403799
disk	ram
using the disk driver again the process might read code from the first sector of the hard drive place it in a know space within ram and then jump to that address

403799
disk	ram
in the modern world with sophisticated peripherals advanced cpu architectures and vast vast resources gbs or ram tb of disk and very fast cpus the operating system can support quite powerful abstractions for the developer multiple processes virtual memory loadable drivers etc.

403800
getter	setter
private access is very often too narrow so a public getter setter must be added

403800
getter	setter
ironically the pattern subverts encapsulation as the whole implementation is essentially nailed down by the getter setter pairs

403849
button	checkbox
and then a checkbox with yes i accept the responsibility for my actions and two button

403849
button	checkbox
yes i want to delete it this button should only be enabled if the checkbox is checked

403868
hide	show
i am using .ajaxstart and .ajaxstop to show and hide a progress indicator

403931
post	get
the asp.net request continues to execute ignorant of the fact that the browser that originally submitted the get post is no longer waiting

403947
postgresql	mysql
i haven t worked with mysql but postgresql so there might slight variation in interpretation of things here

403959
jar	war
pass its name to ant via -d or build.properties and copy the file to your build directory right before you jar or war it up

403994
g++	gcc
both gcc and g++ support the -v verbose flag which makes them output details of the current task

404014
google-chrome	firefox
| setup | | google-chrome usr lib firefox-3.0.5 firefox |

404018
client-side	server-side
i find that in most of my web projects a large majority of my time is spent validating user input both on the client-side and on the server-side

404019
put	get
i can put in the window s opening block and it compiles and shows up in the vs design window fine but during actual runtime i get a parse exception mywindowstyle could not be found

404038
google-chrome	firefox
| setup | | google-chrome usr lib firefox-3.0.5 firefox |

404045
jsf	wicket	struts	wicket
there are literally hundreds now struts jsf spring wicket etc.

404093
getter	setter
saves you time of repeating setter and getter all the time

404118
screens	tablet
when on a tablet pc touching the screens with your pen is interpreted as a click

404118
mouseup	mousedown
the only events that one cares about are mousedown and mouseup

404118
mouseup	mousedown
what i m finding is that my tablet driver on windows is batching the mousedown and mouseup together for strokes that are shorter than a certain time

404135
int	chars
when you need to store state ca tx ny you might as well use a chars 2 natural key instead of an int

404199
pop-up	dialog
everything s fine when i post with valid authentication but if i happen to pass an invalid username or password to the rest api a twitter rest api to be specific an authentication dialog pop-up

404539
public	protected
this scoping is irrelevant to your public protected private friend member-access-control

404542
vmware	esx
i haven t used vmware esx servers so this may not be valid in your case but at least in vmware workstation shared folders appear as network drives

404566
put	get
minor comments i put off to the right indented to column 81 to get them out of the way of the code

404633
mvp	presenter
to answer your question the most common pattern appears to be generalized hacking in my experience however if you want a nice pattern check out the mvp model view presenter pattern from microsoft s patterns and practices group

404634
freemarker	velocity
i actually slightly prefer freemarker to velocity just in case you re open to exploring other options

404634
freemarker	velocity
i also like the ability to render a freemarker or velocity template in any kind of execution environment junit main method without requiring a servlet jsp container as jsp would

404659
cos	sin
if you only need 64 entries in a lut that s 16 4 bytes for sin cos tan use symmetry

404659
cos	sin
compared to a large sin cos tan function

404713
getter	setter
please note that if you use svcutil.exe the generated proxy class will have both public getter and setter for the property which might not be what you are looking for

404720
viewdidload	dealloc
i guess the correct positions to register for notification is viewdidload method and correct position to unregister for same notifications is dealloc method

404721
partition-problem	np-hard
this is very close to partition-problem which is np-hard

404802
try-catch	exception-handling
also since you raised the issue yes the try-catch block does incur some overhead even if the exception-handling is not thrown

404809
innodb	myisam
it seems like i will be needing transaction with mysql and i have no idea how should i manage transactions in mysql with mixed innodb myisam tables it all seems like a huge mess

404823
cvs	svn	perforce	cvs	perforce	svn
as far as mysql version control put your schema in your source code management system cvs svn perforce whatever

404849
hash	salt
you shouldn t store the pin in clear anywhere salt and hash it like a password however given the short length and limited char set it is always going to be vulnerable to a brute force search given an easy way to verify it

404873
notepad++	scite
notepad++ is based on the editing component scintilla - for which at sourceforge there is a response to a request for this feature no need for this to be included in scite as you can add this command to the tools menu using the parameters dialog. so is it possible to do multi-line replace in files in notepad++

404883
int	boolean
i would say that if you are comparing a true int then never do an implicit conversion to boolean as it implies a different meaning to the variable

404883
int	boolean
boolean or int that is basicaly a boolean

404932
viewdidload	dealloc
in this case you could get the viewdidload message sent a second time after the memory event when your view is brought back on screen by its navigation controller. thus you ll have two registrations of the same object but only one removal in its dealloc

404941
postgresql	mysql
edit i will be using postgresql mysql i haven t decided yet

404945
hash	salt
to generate the pins i would take a high resolution version of the time along with some salt and maybe a pseudo-random number generate a hash and use the first 9 or 12 digits

404972
versioning	upgrade
is easy to push upgrade to both versioning

404976
firefox	safari
it has already been implemented using a nasty browser specific style -moz-border-radius in firefox and safari --

cvs	svn
merging between branches is much easier and safer in svn and it s trivial to convert your entire cvs history to svn - see cvs2svn

405003
cvs	svn
wincvs for cvs tortoisesvn and trac for svn and git-gui for git

405022
innodb	myisam
i think you are overrating the performance difference between myisam and innodb

405022
innodb	myisam
myisam is faster in data warehousing situations such as full table scan reporting etc.. but innodb can actually be faster in many cases with normal oltp queries

405022
innodb	myisam
innodb is harder to tune since it has more knobs but a properly tuned innodb system can often have higher throughput than myisam due to better locking and better i o patterns

405055
switching	screens
this will allow you to draw on screens using only 2d coordinates if you want 3d later on switching from ortho to perspective view and you have 3d however i don t think it will help you reuse the code since the 2d ortho view is usually done with textures and you cannot transform a texture to a 3d mesh

405070
postgresql	mysql
better yet if your application can work across multiple dbs oracle mysql postgresql sql lite ms sql server then your clients can leverage either a free cheap db or use an existing in house db

405114
filesystems	hfs
i m not aware of any drivers for xp vista that support mac filesystems like hfs

405121
memcpy	memset
the bottom line is don t access classes this way at all if you can avoid it and also don t memset them or memcpy them

405158
post	get
you ll probably need to post specific code samples to get more help it seems like there are a few python misconceptions mixed into this and once those are cleared up you ll have a simpler time

405171
uicontrol	uibutton
it s in the uicontrol class which is the superclass of uibutton

405221
memcached	apc
use a virtual drive in your ram google it for a how to for your distro or if your data is provided by php use apc memcached might work well with mysql

405231
mantis	bugzilla
i ve used bugzilla and mantis and found bugzilla better from a technical point of view but mantis wins if some of your bug reporters are not programmers not programmer minded

405246
daemons	systemd
i m writing a a very small daemons that must remain responsive even when a systemd is under severe stress

405254
userprincipal	directoryentry
if you need to convert a userprincipal object to a directoryentry object to work with legacy code you can do this

405265
lisp	scheme
if you are looking at some example written in scheme or say lisp perhaps even perl

405310
lisp	smalltalk
but ruby is very nearly a clone of smalltalk and i hope will grow more like smalltalk as the perlish cruft is deprecated and smalltalk like lisp is a language that takes one idea to extremes

405310
lisp	smalltalk
based on your desire to do cool hacks on the language level i d go with ruby as it inherits a lot of the metaprogramming mindset from smalltalk and that mindset is connected to the lisp tradition

405315
floating-point	integer
lots of developers use floating-point math along with the sluggish performance and large libraries memory usage when simple scaled integer math will suffice

405361
superclass	subclassing
the author of the subclassing makes assumptions about the superclass

405361
superclass	subclassing
the superclass changes and the subclassing is now broken

405387
postgresql	mysql
brazil is ruby ruby on rails based and supports change deployment to any database that ruby dbi supports mysql odbc oracle postgresql sqlite

405423
phpmyadmin	sqlbuddy
in addition to phpmyadmin i find that sqlbuddy has a very clean simple interface to work with

405463
union	distinct
lose the distinct clauses as your union vs union all will take care of removing duplicates

405470
post	get
they all have an http post and get interfaces along with the soap interface

405470
post	get
i believe post and get are offered by default when building soap web services in .net visual studio

405529
move	drag
most jquery drag drop libraries have the ability to serialize the elements that are being move into an array that you can save

405538
gridview	repeater
when you say databinding are you speaking of binding a database result set to a gridview or repeater etc

405545
pkcs#12	pfx
pfx files are pkcs#12 personal information exchange syntax standard bundles

405637
post	get
the get operation gives you the board so a post sends a move

405751
uiview	calayer
for iphone game development seems there are very like functions using calayer and uiview we can implement our spirit using calayer or uiview and animations are usable for them too

405751
uiview	calayer
but for coding there are many difference between calayer and uiview like object methods and properties etc

405755
gridview	rowdatabound
first add rowdatabound event to your gridview

405761
haskell	ocaml
in statically typed functional programming languages like standard ml f# ocaml and haskell a function will usually be written with the parameters separated from each other and from the function name simply by whitespace

405780
put	get
i ve thought about simply having the get request block until the move is played-- my client would put the coordinates of my move to

405805
int	boolean
there s no fundamental reason you need tuples in a programming language you can build up tuples in the lambda calculus just as you can boolean and int mdash

405846
unsigned	short
you cannot re-define xmlchar to be an unsigned short

405899
bazaar	git
ciarã n walsh has replaced svnmate with projectplus -- in addition to subverison it handles git mercurial bazaar and svk

405946
profiling	benchmarking
the best way to make sure your code is fast is to benchmarking or profiling it

406013
valgrind	gprof
on the rare occasions when it isn t for c c++ and objective caml i use the venerable gprof and the excellent valgrind with its superb visualizer kcachegrind part of the kde sdk

406028
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort and mergesort are faster in terms of sorting and should be always used before a bubble sort

406033
put	get
it sounds like you re willing to put up with a little unfaithfulness to a true projection to get simpler calculations

406110
for-loop	arrays
a fairly simple for-loop to iterate through elements in an arrays

406124
udp	tcp
with tcp ip we use mss-clamping to protect against large packet issues but this cannot be applied to any udp transmissions or anything secure protocol that uses an authentication header

406173
versioning	upgrade
at the moment i ve made it a practice to upgrade to the latest versioning as soon as possible

406226
uilabel	nsstring
i can t find the documentation for the nsstring sizewithfont forwidth linebreakmode method see kevin ballard s answer to sizing a uilabel in the iphone sdk to fit

406241
width	height
it would give you back a size with the height increased to accomidate the word-wrapped text set in the label and the width set to whatever the original label width had

406249
post	get
i m also able to get data from the gae service i did it after reading another question written here but now i need to post data so i need to send the authentication token in the header of the post request

406255
maven	buildr
there are examples of this like buildr the drop in-replacement for maven for java that is built on top of rake

406274
int	chars
consider how many folks declare main int argc chars argv vs main int argc chars argv .

406288
getter	setter
i recently started working in java and was introduced to the wild and crazy world of getter and setter for everything

406288
getter	setter
one of the things i am trying to do is avoid the trap of doing getter and setter for everything

406288
getter	setter
however much of the work i do is with entities that are mainly data containers and i am not certain that getter and setter are actually inappropriate in these cases

406288
getter	setter
here is a simple example using private properties and using getter and setter

406288
getter	setter
i feel like the getter setter example is more clear and hides the implementation details of what name and description are

406288
getter	setter
i have read several discussions about getter and setter being evil and or an anti-pattern but it really feels like those might not apply to this situation

406303
getter	setter
that being said getter and setter tend to be overused

406323
google-chrome	safari
the other issue i mentioned was the dom - js binding cost -- this can actually play a very significant part in web performance the best example of this is safari 3.1 2 vs google-chrome at the dromaeo benchmark

406323
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is based off of the safari 3.1 2 branch of webkit so it s reasonably safe to assume similar dom performance compiler difference could cause some degree of variance

406323
google-chrome	safari
in this benchmark safari 3.1 2 actually beats google-chrome despite having a js engine that is clearly much much slower this is basically due to more efficient bindings between jsc webcore the dom rendering etc of webkit and v8 webcore

406342
width	height
unless explicitly specified width and height of child elements are nan

406342
width	height
when height and width properties are

406344
hash	md5
the best option is going to be code signing -- either using a tool supplied by your local friendly os for example if you re targeting windows you probably want to take a look at authenticode where the operating system handles the tampering or by rolling your own option storing md5 hash and comparing

406350
getter	setter
getter setter are evil except for plain data storage objects which itself is just an evangelism of tell don t ask

406350
getter	setter
ideally if a class has getter and setter that s all it should have

406376
accessor	properties
that s why c# has a special properties syntax which allows to concisely specify default accessor

406426
lisp	smalltalk
to tell you the truth i just want an excuse to dive into lisp smalltalk aren t smalltalk lisp clojure the same

406426
lisp	prolog
i also checked prolog and it seems a pretty cool language easy to do relations between data and easier than lisp but i d like to hear what you think

406426
lisp	smalltalk
i always confuse common lisp with smalltalk

406426
lisp	prolog
also what i meant by other people that are fond of the basic language is that i don t prefer a language with semantics like lisp for people with no cs background and i find prolog a little bit more intuitive but that s my opinion after i just messed a little bit with both of them

406455
lisp	smalltalk	lisp	prolog
there are several good free some as in speech some as in beer implementations of smalltalk prolog and lisp

406456
vsto	add-in
after applying these fixes it was easy to use com add-in like using vsto and it took me less than an hour to write the actual code

406474
put	get
i don t know if it s better or worse but one way to structure it is to get rid of all smartness from your entity data transfer object product and put everything including create retreive retreiveall save getrelatedproducts etc

406479
lisp	smalltalk
aren t smalltalk lisp clojure the same

406501
children	parent
ie doesn t seem to calculate the height of the parent when all the children are floated

406504
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
which means that officially margin padding width and height properties should be ignored in practice not really

406504
opera	safari
it works just fine in ie7 ff3 opera 9 and safari whatever the current version is

406588
width	margin
officially margin padding width

406634
opera	safari
looks weird but works great on all common browsers ie6 7 ff2 3 opera safari

406649
stdout	stderr
iirc the studio s output window displays not only stdout and stderr but also trace messages

406678
opera	safari
as i mentioned it works in current ie7 ff3 opera 9 and safari

406787
getter	setter
i really dislike when people tell me to use getter and setter instead of making the variable public when you should be able to both get and set the class variable

406807
getter	setter
getter and setter are highly overused

406807
getter	setter
i ve seen millions of people claiming that public fields are evil so they make them private and provide getter and setter for all of them

406807
getter	setter
i m not in favor of public fields but against making a getter setter or property for everyone of them and then claiming that doing that is encapsulation or information hiding .

406807
getter	setter
now creating private fields and then using the ide to automatically generate getter and setter for every one of them is nearly as bad as using public fields

406807
getter	setter
i say automatic or not generation of getter setter pair for your fields effectively goes against the so called encapsulation you are trying to achieve

406825
for-loop	loops
if you can t apply loops invariants to a trivial for-loop you re not worth your salt as a supposed computer scientist

406833
lisp	prolog
but it has to be an easy language i saw there was a prolog in ruby even a lisp but i don t think they are easy to learn languages...

406838
set	bag
i m not sure how you do it with fluent nhibernate but you need to set the cascade option on the bag tripitems

406840
subtract	add
apply dx and dy to the previous point based on horizontal and vertical travel right down - add left up - subtract

406846
post	get
apart from tempfinalquery being unused and an unnecessary map lookup to get the state there doesn t seem to be anything too egregious in the code you post

406879
client-side	server-side
as drawbacks compared to the server-side solution this method moves complexity from the server to client-side javascript and increases the load on the web server

406881
post	get
i ve found that this code works replacing the get by the post verb and using the formcollection as the parameter of the controller method

406913
lisp	scheme
script-fu under gimp is also lisp the scheme dialect

406925
merb	camping	ramaze	merb	ramaze	camping
other frameworks for ruby include merb camping and ramaze

406982
qmainwindow	qdialog
qmainwindow has special behavior for the central widget that a qdialog does not

407038
rpm	yum
but assuming you want to support the most popular distros you can query their package manager for installed software i d suggest as a start to support apt-get rpm and yum and parse the output to look for the packages you recognize

407056
daemons	launchd
it has jsvc launchd which suports starting and stopping java-based daemons services

407070
mouse	keyboard
here is some code that looks for mouse and keyboard activity with the applicatin

407108
gridview	sqldatasource
and i m trying to get the return value using the below code sqldatasource gridview combo in vb .net

407258
post	get
however if you post two post on the same day called foo you get

407258
int	chars
if it s an int or some kind of short guid eg 6-8 chars then it shouldn t be a problem

407280
firefox	safari
only safari so far seems not to be able to set cookies but ie6 and firefox work fine.

407290
kde	gnome
i for instance made the same client app for kde and gnome for the first i used python and for the second c# even when my day job is at a java shop

407328
hide	show
when you get a successful login hide the login div and show the user panel div

407343
awt	swing
is it okay to skip the awt and swing package i learned a bit of the basics though

407358
awt	swing
you should certainly write swing for desktop java only using awt to the degree that swing demands it

407361
awt	swing
when learning swing you ll find that you will come to know those parts of awt that are still important such as event layoutmanager graphics font color etc

407391
awt	swing
it explains some of the history of awt and swing

407391
awt	swing
swing being a lightweight alternative successor to most of the awt classes

407395
client-side	server-side
faster server-side client-side

407402
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to develop a little c# application with ms visual express and sql server and am having an issue trying to figure out the error dialog that pop-up the event log file is full

407412
hash	salt
that forced us to sit and convert our salt and iteratively hash password storage scheme to a specification and provide some different language implementations for easy integration

407412
hash	salt
fshp is a salt iteratively hash password hashing implementation

407414
hash	salt
that forced us to sit and convert our salt and iteratively hash password storage scheme to a specification and provide some different language implementations for easy integration

407414
hash	salt
fshp is a salt iteratively hash password hashing implementation

407446
factors	mean
maybe specifics of brace position should remain purely religious arguments - but it doesn t mean that all layout styles are equal or that there are no objective factors at all

407449
outputstream	inputstream
if you want to make a streaming api in java you should usually provide inputstream for reading and outputstream for writing

407451
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if my app has been tested in firefox 3 safari 3 ie 7 will it need additional testing for google-chrome

407468
folder	directory
i ve placed this .py file in my my documents directory and placed a shortcut to it in my send to folder the shortcut url is

407474
google-chrome	safari
if it s working fine on safari it will probably work on google-chrome as well

407475
google-chrome	safari
theoretically because google-chrome uses the same engine as safari webkit you ve already tested

407475
google-chrome	firefox
now that gmail suggests people switch from ie to firefox and google-chrome i m guessing we ll see ie lose more and more market share to those browsers

407476
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses the webkit rendering engine which is also used in safari and some other small browsers

407476
google-chrome	safari
overall with both google-chrome and safari gaining in market share it is definately a browser to test you only really need to test one

407482
google-chrome	safari
i ve already run across sites that work in safari but don t in google-chrome

407482
google-chrome	safari
i have ie8b2 ff3 safari and google-chrome all installed on my machine

407483
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses the webkit engine which as i recall is the same engine used by safari

407483
google-chrome	safari
so in theory if your site works for safari it should work for google-chrome as well

407485
xslt	xquery
you may try using the saxon xslt xquery processor

407493
awt	swing
skip awt and swing

407493
swt	swing
in the broader sense i have a number of java applications although i am not too sure if they use swing or swt

407506
awt	swing
is the concept behind gwt and awt and swing the same or different

407524
awt	swing
awt and swing are for programming stand-alone applications and to a lesser extent applets

407545
versioning	upgrade
if you re using python 2.5 or newer urllib2_file is both unnecessary and unsupported so check which versioning you re using and perhaps upgrade

407546
next	except
i ve read that the next version of xml schema enables you to say what you meant any tag except important_tag

407554
getter	setter
domain classes in grails try to make sure that every property has a getter and setter during startup

407554
getter	setter
it does this by looking for all the getter and making sure an appropriate setter exists

407559
awt	swing
awt swing are used for desktop java apps or applets

407562
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
however i always try in all modern browsers ie6 7 ff2 3 opera 9.x safari and google-chrome

407604
awt	swing
while swing has a lot to teach you and it is too heavily infused with awt if you re never going to be writing guis you may be better off investing in something else

407662
filtering	grouping
for the first it s generally a good idea to just have a grouping which you can then filtering on if you want

407759
int	chars
there s an example a little less than halfway down of using a heap with a list of int chars tuples as a priority queue

407770
post	put
put each row within it s own form tag then when the update button is clicked it will submit the values for that row only there will also be a hidden field with the rowid and the controller class would take all the post values as parameters to the update method on the controller

407778
put	get
mind you you might get a securityexception so make sure that the runtime gives you the appropriate permissions you might want to put this in a library and make a call and then set the library up in the gac with evidence to give it full trust

407865
weblogic	oc4j
oracle will release a 11g version oc4j but after that oracle weblogic server wls will be the preferred java ee server

408013
public	protected
for instance a mix of public private and protected member variables could be laid out such that each access type is contiguous

408063
awt	swing
the only real similarities to swing and awt are that they are toolkits for creating user interfaces and they use java

408123
int	double
the only time that it doesn t pass a pointer is when you pass a variable with an intrinsic data type like an int or a double into the function

408146
django	turbogears
and then there is django and turbogears etc. which is guided by the same just-the-tools-needed philosophy as rails it can be argued who got there first or who did it better

408147
int	double
i also resorted to sqlite3_bind_text for other simple data types because the api i m working on can translate int double etc into a string

408195
int	double
developers just throw int and double in because they have to write in something

408195
int	double	int	chars	unsigned	short
if you have a day of the month variable it doesn t matter much if it s signed or unsigned or whether it s chars short int long long long float double or long double

408213
free	malloc
if you use from within your overloaded member operator delete new the global operator new delete to get your memory and release it or even malloc free you don t need that size information

408327
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
you should make sure that myobject overrides equals gethashcode and tostring so that the indexof method can find the object properly

408335
entity-relationship	diagram
i am a fan of singular table names as they make my entity-relationship diagram using case syntax easier to read but by reading these responses i m getting the feeling it never caught on very well

408342
firefox	safari
you can see it run fine in firefox and safari but not in ie

408379
put	get
unlike purists i m not really a put the functionality in the class so you can use polymorphism to get around the type switching kinda person

408412
folder	directory
the images are supposed to be stored in the web server where the application runs in a folder called images under the main application directory

408471
folder	directory
if you want to stick with 2 tiers and you have n users as your target population then you should aim for sqrt n folder in the first tier with sqrt n folder in each second tier directory

408489
entity-relationship	diagram
looking for a tool that will automatically create a graphical representation of a mysql db schema from a live database showing tables columns and relationships an entity-relationship diagram

408495
children	parent
just right click the box and select add all children and add all parent

408513
filesystems	xfs
i would look into xfs or another high-performance journaling filesystems

408528
vmware	virtualbox
i ve tried virtualbox vmware server free and virtual pc

408553
versioning	upgrade
what this means is that when you upgrade you have to be careful that both subeclipse and tortoise have released new versioning with the matching underlying subversion updates

408566
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux

408609
inherited	properties
the avm1movie object can use methods and properties inherited from the displayobject class such as x y width and so on

408611
for-loop	loops
the first loops creates a variable i that is a scalar and it iterates it like a c for-loop

408636
getter	setter
the getter setter probably look like this

408660
lisp	smalltalk
assembler c lisp ruby smalltalk

408667
int	double
there aren t many types that are c# keywords int double string .

408756
pylons	turbogears
in fact this is exactly what pylons and turbogears do is provide a reliable predictable stack to build mvc web apps

408776
int	chars
for bigger int you would need to add corresponding items to the thou array and perhaps pass the number in as a string modifying the line to extract the block by using the last 3 chars instead of using modulo as i have here

408820
awt	swing
can someone please explain me what s the difference between swing and awt

408820
awt	swing
are there any cases where awt is more useful advised to use than swing or vice-versa

408828
awt	swing
swing vs awt

408828
awt	swing
basically awt came first and is a set of heavyweight ui components meaning they are wrappers for operating system objects whereas swing built on top of awt with a richer set of lightweight components

408828
awt	swing
any serious java ui work is done in swing not awt which was primarily used for applets

408830
button	checkbox
it uses awt to create an operating system window and then paints pictures of button labels text checkbox etc. into that window and responds to all of your mouse-clicks key entries etc. deciding for itself what to do instead of letting the operating system handle it

408830
awt	swing
because awt uses native gui widgets your os knows about them and handles putting them in front of each other etc. whereas swing widgets are meaningless pixels within a window from your os s point of view

408830
awt	swing
mixing awt and swing is highly unsupported and can lead to ridiculous results such as native buttons that obscure everything else in the dialog box in which they reside because everything else was created with swing

408830
awt	swing
because swing tries to do everything possible in java other than the very raw graphics routines provided by a native gui window it used to incur quite a performance penalty compared to awt

408830
awt	swing	swt	swing
finally you might also want to check out swt the gui toolkit used for eclipse and an alternative to both awt and swing which is somewhat of a return to the awt idea of accessing native widgets through java

408853
vim	gedit
normal people prefer gedit instead of vim

408873
mouse	keyboard
generally speaking one primary focus has to be in minimising movement between the mouse and keyboard so put lots of functionality into the mouse or into the keyboard because when you have to move your hands like that there is a real delay in trying to find the right place to put them

408884
awt	swing
another statement which i saw is that swing is mvc based and awt is not

408889
pickle	pprint
have you considered using pickle for the serializing and then pprint or a more fancy object viewer for humans looking at the objects

408891
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram are great

408914
g++	gcc
mingw for gcc g++ and added gdb maybe msys when i get around to it

408931
post	get
three post to get you started

408970
freebsd	linux
i know the win32 api supplies us with createiocompletionport freebsd has kqueue and linux in general can use dev epoll that works somewhat similarly.

408981
pyopengl	pyglet
i d say that pyglet is actually more evolved than pyopengl

408990
agile	sprint
every agile methodology puts emphasis on delivering working software read meeting part of the requirements each sprint

409017
apache	nginx
the author of nginx mod_wsgi explains some differences to apache mod_wsgi in this mailing list message

409034
bazaar	git
modern distributed version control systems like git mercurial or bazaar are the best tool in a situation like this

409041

410896
strstr	substr
typically the way to do this would be to use strchr or strstr one or more times to find a pointer to where you want to extract the substr from say p and a pointer to the character after the last character that you need to extract say q if the buffer is a temporary buffer that you don t mind destroying then you can just do and p will be a pointer to the required string

try-catch	exception-handling
i just finished reading this article on the advantages and disadvantages of exception-handling and i agree with the sentiment that try-catch blocks should not be used for normal control-flow management don t use them like a goto

411026

there s a strong core of support for teaching intro programming using scheme and haskell also enjoys some support there but there s very little in the way of teaching advanced technique for functional programmer

411774
put	get
people don t do that necessarily to be able to put the product in a box at any day sure there may be routines that have to be done before release but the idea is that any developer can get the latest code in the server and it will build in their machines

411779
ant	cruisecontrol
on my current gig we do at least a daily build of our java ee app using cruisecontrol an ivy repo ant clearcase

411800

several commercial variants of postgresql have been built over the years such as illustra greenplum and enterprisedb

411996
postgresql	informix
illustra was a commercial release of postgresql which was subsequently bought by informix

411996
postgresql	mysql
mysql 5.x has a feature set that supports a reasonable cross section of capabilities but it is not as feature-rich as postgresql

411996
interbase	firebird
firebird is an open-source version of interbase

412015
postgresql	mysql
to answer your stated question more directly i don t think there s a significant difference between postgresql and mysql that is relevant to your project

412043
haskell	ocaml
just for funsies i learned a functional programming language i chose ocaml over haskell and lisp and it completely changed how i thought about programming

anything from sqlite to mysql to postgresql would probably work just fine

412083
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have 1 uinavigationcontroller and 2 subclasses of uiviewcontroller

412091
postgresql	mysql
mysql has improved a lot with its later versions but postgresql still beats it in every category

412098
uiview	calayer
my assertion that the calayer associated with a uiview shares the same coordinate system could in fact be entirely erroneous

412098
uiview	calayer
i just performed this test myself and it appears calayers actually use the same coordinate system as uiview so my assertion that calayer s flip the y axis is definitely wrong

412098
uiview	calayer
however if you do drawing with coregraphics directly be aware that coregraphics does use a flipped y axis though when drawing in a uiview subclass or i assume a calayer delegate the coregraphics context has already been flipped to match the uiview s or calayer s coordinate system

412098
uiview	calayer
so the short answer if you made it this far is the coordinate system for calayer should match the coordinate system for its corresponding uiview

412132
lisp	scheme
when i was in college at boston university 98- 02 we spent a semester learning scheme which is a close cousin of lisp

412136

after i create a new cl project stub and do that initial commit to cvs or svn how do other devs check it out to their local environment and work with it

412336

ienumerable	ilist
it s kind of simple-minded but when i plan to delete items from an ienumerable ilist i usually just make a copy

412765
free	malloc
second the suggested automatic free cannot work malloc does not initialize the allocated memory

412765
calloc	malloc	memset	malloc	memset	calloc
i would use calloc instead or add a memset after malloc

also i use calloc instead of malloc because it will set all the pointers to null and integers to 0

412787
multiplying	modulo	multiplying	division	division	modulo
for your 12-digit bcd number provided there won t be any overflow assume that b 5 through b 0 holds your bytes from most significant to least significant and that mod is the modulo remainder operation and div is integer division the following pseudo-code would multiplying by 10

int	chars
in case you don t have a decimal point your number is an int you can concat zeros if x 0 or delete the last -x chars if x 0

412865
boost	stl
that s one of my beefs with boost and stl

412866
stateless	stateful
contrast with java and .net frameworks that need to resort to horribly ugly hacks like viewstate and session keys to maintain application state and maintain the occasionally quite leaky abstraction of a stateful imperative language on an essentially stateless functional platform like the web

412882
lodash	underscore.js
underscore.js or lodash

412884
serializable	deserialization
it comes with xml serializable deserialization of graphs for wcf and also its own binary serializable for remoting much faster than the default binary formatter and also much more compact

412923
disk	ram
if you want to improve your database performance i tend to throw more hardware at it in the form of more ram and faster disk

412946

412997
getattr	setattr
look at built-in functions getattr and setattr

413036
pull	push
unfortunately this will likely also require manual intervention since you probably don t have a way to make the application programmatically pull from push to the clipboard

413060
direct3d	directx
it can grab the vista windows desktop manager directx direct3d shared surface and use it as a visual brush in wpf

413079
nunit	mstest
this second place animosity isn t old news to be honest i don t know why ms don t spend more time supporting solutions already in place we ve seen this all before with nant - msbuild and nunit - mstest it would save everyone a lot of time and effort if they just accepted one of the better and mature solutions and endeavoured to support that as opposed to brewing their own all the time

413093
equals	gethashcode
equals and gethashcode - not all classes are comparable or hashable should be moved to an interface

413125
prepare	execute
the advantages of a prepare statement over an execute string are many -

413125
prepare	execute
the statement is parsed and an access plan determind only once when the prepare statement is execute

413125
int	chars
a setint call take an int value as is the for the equvalent sql string you must convert to chars then the dbms has to convert it back to an int

413160
versioning	upgrade
the problematic moodle was upgrade from 1.8 versioning earlier

haskell	ocaml	erlang	ocaml
now which language could be the next step that is the hard stuff but i believe could be haskell f# clojure ocaml or erlang

413245
switching	accessory
instead of an on off switching may i also suggest the use of a checkmark as an accessory view

413250
gif	png
push this along with all the media files aspx gif png etc. out and your source should be hidden from less-than-diligent people

413278
gif	png
maybe not the ideal solution but you could always extract the gif animation frames to a png formatted sprite sheet and then use the sprite class to handle the animation

413281
put	get
any new tests get put in there with the rest of them and whatever package name you have it doesn t matter

413344
folder	directory
maybe i m wrong but i m not convinced that iis will serve any files from the bin folder it doesn t for me anyway and i assume this is by design in the same way that you cannot donwload web.config - it also won t even list the directory contents

413391
for-loop	arrays
the code could appear to run through a for-loop over an entire arrays collection whatever but maybe it uses obj.length instead of obj.length-1

413423
vsts	tfs
we use tfs and are looking at using vsts database edition gdr

413462
stateless	stateful
there is also obvious confusion when you used the term stateless and transaction in the same discussion as transactions are inherently stateful

check firebug s layout tab of the html tab to check the div has a height width

413473

i would prefer solutions which are for opera though i m not opposed to firefox answers

413604
opera	firefox
although this page is about opera it has some good examples that are applicable to greasemonkey in firefox too

413614
post	put
it s clear wehn i change any control and then post back the saveviewstate method saves the changes and apply them agian after postback see the folowing code notice that server-side-code put in a scrispt in my code liske this

413629
jtextpane	jeditorpane
we tried both jtextpane and jeditorpane with no luck

413680
inherited	properties
you could inherited the text box and override the text properties to retrieve and write to the string builder

413686
tostring	getter
you could always expose a property that s getter returns the tostring of the stringbuilder

413706
charindex	substr
substr lastname 0 charindex lastname + + firstname

413706
charindex	substr
charindex substr lastname 0 charindex lastname + + firstname len lastname + 3

413713
redmine	trac
maybe i ll also install something like trac or redmine for bug-tracking todo list etc

413713
ant	maven
i ve heard about tools like ant and maven - do these apply to what i want to do

413722
gif	png
it takes a latex snippet runs latex and produces a png or gif

413736
erlang	scheme
my macbook s default name jamess-macbook does not play well with erlang s node-naming scheme due to the dash

413750
jtextpane	jeditorpane
i don t have any experience in this but if you really need to load big files i suggest you do some kind of lazy loading with jtextpane jeditorpane

413750
jtextpane	jeditorpane
define a limit that jtextpane jeditorpane can handle well like 500kb or 1mb

413750
jtextpane	jeditorpane
the text on the jtextpane jeditorpane must not change when loading chunks or else the user feels like is in another position of the file

413752
ant	maven
i d definitely use ant or maven - my preference is ant because it s more flexible and i think it would suit your development style more than maven as well

413761
hmac	md5
if you are looking to verify message integrity and authenticity with hashing - you might want to look at hmac - there are plenty of implementations in php using both sha1 and md5

413855
ssl	https
it does not support ssl https

413855
apache	nginx
you ll have to run it using apache nginx or some other web server that supports ssl in order to test

413862
vmware	bootcamp	parallels	bootcamp
i generally install with bootcamp because that lets you boot into native windows if you need more umph or if you want to game and the more recent versions of vmware and parallels both allow booting the vm directly from the bootcamp partition

413863
tinyxml	xerces
there are currently plugins for tinyxml expat libxml and xerces

413863
tinyxml	xerces
so my problem cannot be solved by requiring the use of a c++ parser tinyxml or xerces

413864
getter	setter
going beyond what casperone has said including the bit about checking that this is the bottleneck you may find it very helpful to convert the getter setter into delegates a and an for the getter and setter respectively using delegate.createdelegate

413867
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
i have an uitableview with about 30 custom cells each containing an uisegmentedcontrol

aptana	radrails
eclipse 3.4 ganymede with aptana radrails and pydev addons

414022
tinyxml	xerces
restrict the parser plugins that my application can use on os x to the tinyxml and xerces plugins

414116
aptana	radrails
aptana radrails was definitely the best windows rails ide a couple of years ago but has fallen behind the times in my opinion

414136
vb.net	vb6
you could use that in anything that can use activex c++ vb6 vb.net etc... to create a parser as well to follow-up on what berek said

414137
min	max
i ve added a category value of backupdate and set the scale for the x-axis from the min of backupdate to the max of backupdate

414146
googletest	cxxtest
we ve been using a similar approach at my office except using cxxtest instead of unittest++ and now we re in the process to migrating to google s vastly superior imho googletest framework

414149
put	get
in any case if you get out of the top-level loop and put things into a separate file with an explicit type signature it all works fine

414151
mouse	keyboard
it would be extremely natural to use and much more lightweight than having to deal with a keyboard and mouse

414170
prepare	execute
generally it s more efficient to prepare the statement before your loop and execute the statement handle during the loop supplying the parameter at that time

414208
slideup	slidedown
it has also got a slideup and slidedown effect

414231
migrate	upgrade
as an addendum to harms answer i would note that like the windows registry os x preferences are deliberately not deleted when the app is removed but unlike the windows registry preferences can migrate from machine to machine as you upgrade your mac and use the user migration facility

414247
hide	show
for other kinds of apps on cds say a slide show or something like that the developer generally uses hidden folders to hide support data to ensure that the only thing the user will see when they open the cd is the single icon they re supposed to double click to start the app

414289
vim	emacs
there is also a minority class of person that thinks vim or emacs is the best thing since sliced bread

414289
mouse	keyboard
especially avoid forcing the user to change their position in front of the computer moving one hand between the mouse and keyboard

414289
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard is almost always faster than the mouse

the psp is not unix and is not posix compliant however the open source toolchain is composed by gcc 4.3 bintutils 1.16.1 and newlib 1.16

414353
mockito	easymock
some mocking frameworks like easymock require a repository interface while others like mockito dont

414384
post	get
i m also not sure they support post request types so the amount of data you can send is limited to the size of a get request url

414388
pop-up	dialog
the error message is a small undecorated non-modal non-focusable dialog that pop-up underneath the cell being edited

414396
versioning	upgrade
after i have upgrade to the latest versioning of java mail the reason of the error became clear it was a javax.net.ssl.sslhandshakeexception which was not thrown up in the old versioning of the lib

414409
put	get
i put both details in the same file so users dont have to download multiple files to get their map working it could become time consuming and seem complex

414477
globalization	localization
note i have not done much globalization or localization in asp.net generally so there may be some best practices from the non-mvc world that i am missing

414581
ubuntu	linux
i use aptana on both windows and linux ubuntu

414670
mouse	keyboard
with either one you should be able to reuse your existing screen keyboard mouse usb disks etc

414694

that said there is similar features in vim and emacs although i ve not used it nearly as much - search and replace as people have said and more similarly column insert mode

414713
pdcurses	ncurses
are pdcurses similar enough to ncurses to use ncurses tutorials

414734
put	get
here s how a crusty old government contractor i know recently put it as the prostitutes say first you gotta get them upstairs.

subtraction	modulo
as you can see modulo is about an order of magnitude slower than subtraction

414780
public	protected
visibility determined by access modifiers private protected public

414803
getter	setter
the reason for using a setfield method approach rather than properties with getter and setter is so that it is easier for code to actually set these fields in a generic way without resorting to reflection or switch statements

414838
ssl	https
i think the value with be https for location.protocol if you are on ssl

414919
wordpress	joomla
there are also various modules plugins for various cmss drupal plone joomla wordpress etc. that you can use to add socnet functionality to a site

414934
innodb	myisam
this gives you back a lot of raw performance that you would otherwise lose when moving tables from myisam to innodb

414934
innodb	myisam
likewise if you have some tables that are near 100 write you may benefit from insert delayed but that is only supported in myisam the delayed clause is ignored for an innodb table

414968
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
try bufferedreader and bufferedwriter to speed up processing

415064
stdout	stderr
when it runs it creates three pipes to redirect the console s stdin stdout and stderr

415064
stdout	stderr
it then finds its own name usually devenv.com replaces the .com with .exe and launches the new app devenv.exe using the read end of the stdin pipe and the write ends of the stdout and stderr pipes as the standard handles

415091
multiplying	add
now you have a custom operation pressing the program key or which one you ve assigned to it will run the sequence without your further assistance and will multiplying the content of the display with 2 and will add 1 - this is a program

415142
udp	tcp
if that happens look up the port numbers one udp outgoing and one tcp incomming and unblock them

415216

415305
width	height
in ie6 it keeps getting 100 width after i set a height for a making it a vertical list

415305

415611
dictionary	map
it creates an empty dictionary in map and an empty array in list

415639
mbunit	nunit
mbunit is totally compatible with nunit so you could still use tests you ve already written with nunit

415731
post	get
for example you could serialize both forms and then concatenate them and send the result to the server via post or get

415735
submit	submission
i can t test if the concept work right now but i believe that you could use jquery to achieve that its submit function will intercept all form submission on any tab something along these lines

415740
ant	maven
i find maven 2 decently documented and quite powerful when used in combination with ant tasks and some home baked java plugins

415740
ant	maven
there are ant tasks to use maven features from ant

415740
ant	maven
and you can call ant from maven

415743
vmware	virtualbox
i managed to use andlinux + wine to get this working but honestly i think the vmware virtual pc virtualbox route is simpler

415746
google-chrome	firefox
my ssrs 2005 server displays the loading icon just fine in firefox ie and google-chrome

415772
superclass	subclassing
the general idea is that you provide a xxxplugin superclass that any plugin subclassing

415785
django	web.py
simpler than django and stand-alone although just about everything i start in web.py eventually gets rewritten as a django app...

415788
children	parent
children s reference to their parent s version is hard coded

415788
children	parent
in particular if the parent pom changes the value of aversion the children will see the change

415844
post	get
this blog post shows how to get data out of the xml document

415924
int	boolean
it seems that the types int boolean and string will be good for just about everything i ll ever need in terms of variables except perhaps float could be used when decimal numbers are needed in a number

415940
unsigned	short
this is the same size as a short but a short is signed -32768 to 32767 while a char is unsigned 0 to 65535

415953
hash	md5
is there any method to generate md5 hash of a string in java

416019
put	get
to get the different arrays you have to put a regular expression into

416053
button	checkbox
originally it was intended to group together a very small set of related components usually checkbox or radio button

416102
ant	maven
what would you recommend as a good common scripting language or automation system like ant or maven that works well for both .net and linux development

416114
ant	maven
i have no experience with maven but we ve managed to get ant to do everything we ve wanted on multiple platforms just by virtue of the fact that you can extend it with any java program to do special tasks not included with the ant application itself

416146
feedback	review
if your developers experience of unit testing is low then they need feedback on how they should be doing it whether that is in the form of a code review or some other mechanism

416148
put	get
are there any tools that allow me to go onto my ppc emulator and stop by step check a that the dll is where clr expects it i have put it both in the same directory and the windows directory on the emulator - i can see it is there usign the emulators file explorer b that clr can load it has enough memory etc c that clr can then find what functions are present useful if i can get beyond the stupid can t find the dll error

416206
firefox	safari
another machine i m a mac to check ie on is it remotely possible that the valid css is really truly valid on ie as well as firefox safari that i have used to check my code so far

416235
many-to-many	one-to-many
collections in jpa refer to one-to-many or many-to-many relationships and they can only contain other entities

416254
translation	localization
for example think about how you would manage localization translation if ever you need to make those strings palatable to somebody speaking a different language

416274
try-catch	exception-handling
typically if your try-catch is outside the loop use int32.parse - you ll get an exception-handling and stop the first time you get an invalid value

416278
treemap	treeset
treemap and treeset will give you an iteration over the contents in sorted order

416306
post	get
it can either call the webservice using post or using get

416318
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
the main difference between quirks and standards compliance mode is a different box model which results in different ways of calculating sizes based on width height padding margin and border settings

416318
width	height
in standard compliance mode the effective width and height of a box is calculated by adding all these parameters please search the web for more details

416318
width	margin
then do the math to determine the correct width settings so that the sum of all widths includung padding border and margin

416331
getter	setter
java interface usage guidelines â are getter and setter in an interface bad

416340
keydown	keyup
by the time keyup or keypress is triggered the default for keydown has already happened

416365
post	get
post is not cached by default but get often is as it should be idempotent

416395
fiddler	charles
addition to other tools mentioned here i often find great help in having a proper debugging proxy - fiddler free windows only and charles commercial cross-platform are great ones

416484
put	get
for large binaries in addition to the version number i tend to put a record count and crc the reason being that large binaries are much more prone to get truncated and or corrupted over time or during transfer than smaller ones

416492
goto	break
you can t jump out of two loops with a single break instruction but you could use a goto to jump from the inner loop right outside

416595
versioning	upgrade
our average project will grab source from svn add the revision number to the versioning and build grab the database scripts and upgrade or rebuild the database and deploy to either a webserver zip it up for emailing or even create an iso for it

416625
aggregate-functions	sum
99 of the time the group by clause is an exact copy of the select clause minus the aggregate-functions max sum etc.

416673
try-catch	exception-handling
if you really want to catch exception-handling and die slightly nicer you can put a try-catch block around the application.run call and work from there

416681
try-catch	exception-handling
maybe whoever came up with the requirement doesn t understand that you can still catch all exception-handling at the top without putting a try-catch in every single function

416743
kde	gnome
you might want to look what desktops like gnome and kde give you

416798
websphere	ibm
a possible path for linux systems is opt ibm websphere appserver lib wsanttasks.jar

416898
goto	break
goto break_iterate_rows is just a visible version of break iterate_rows

416917
boost	allocator
if you used the boost containers with a custom allocator you d suddenly have to deal with the possibility that the pool the container is allocator from could go empty thus eliminating the purpose of the allocate at startup rule

416947
awt	swing
i mean by light weight i thought maybe the swing components occupy less memory than the awt components

416981
maven	pom.xml
if you allow omitting of both the version of the parent and of this pom.xml iff maven is able to access the parent pom.xml by the relative path you are done

416984
websphere	ibm
high-end messaging buses like ibm s websphere mq do purport to offer exactly once delivery

417006
icomparable	compareto
using existing sorting constructs icomparable won t work well because you need more information than is available to the compareto method

417007
vb.net	vb6
this contains vb6 compatibility functions the my namespace features as well as some compiler helper functions and is commonly referred to as the vb.net runtime

417012
awt	swing
the evolution of the swing paint system section from the painting in awt and swing article explains the difference between lightweight and heavyweight

417012
awt	swing	jlist	jtable
the advantage of swing is that it has many more components available such as jtable and jlist which are more graphical and extensible than the components provided in awt allowing for more graphics-rich applications to be developed

417017
letter-spacing	word-spacing
edit ok so the css letter-spacing property as well as the word-spacing property will allow me to control the space between letters words

417039
int	double
the types being generics instead of int would be perfect floats double ushorts etc and making it easy to expand to n number of keys is important too

417095
awt	swing
just a suggestion elaborating on what bruno advised one pattern for taking advantage of the excellent java 1.5+ concurrency utilities without breaking swing is to have your executorservice do all the heavy lifting as bruno said but once that is done the executorservice thread should hand off the interaction with the actual ui components to the awt thread in a runnable using one of

417119
profiling	instrumentation
i m not familiar with dottrace but i have used the visual studio 2008 instrumentation and profiling tools in the context of visual studio and i believe they are distributed with .net 3.5 sdk

417139
min	max
however once given a function you can possibly devise a sorting method for that for a b above order the list thusly without applying the function to any items â œmax min next max next min

417141
letter-spacing	font-size	letter-spacing	word-spacing
or some combination of letter-spacing word-spacing and font-size

417152
min	max
how do i set java s min and max heap size through environment variables

417207
testcase	fixture
also you have a setup method in a testcase that allows you to create a fixture that is used by all tests

417214
versioning	upgrade
since we ve upgrade versioning of the ajaxcontroltoolkit it seems to render differently

417220
gridview	detailsview
i tried to google on setting trigger that is inside detailsview and gridview but i haven t come across any post regarding how to do it

417224
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
if you really want to try and use reflection sqlconnection has a sqlinternalconnection this in turn has a property of availableinternaltransaction which returns an sqlinternaltransaction this has a property of parent which returns the sqltransaction you d need

417262
uiview	subviews
i also tried to add the openglview as a subviews of a basic uiview previously added to the navigationbar but i received the same error

417276
gif	png
i have a situation where i m loading some content using a urlloader but the content could either be a video flv or swf an image jpg or png or gif or a swf

417342
multiplying	subtract
adding and subtract logarithms of factorials then taking the exponential at the end is more reliable than multiplying and dividing factorials directly

417372
post	get
however i do have a way to get to the second tab - just a small variation on the eval statement from my original post

417409
superclass	subclassing
three separate tables with some common columns usually copy-and-paste of the superclass columns among all subclassing tables

417418
equals	gethashcode
to make these useful in a hashtable or dictionary you will likely want to provide overloads for gethashcode and equals

417448
pop-up	dialog
for example if you try to send some data and the data transport class throws a connectionbrokenexception you can pop-up a reconnect dialog and try to reconnect

417450
serializable	deserialization
one advantage i particularly appreciate is the seamless object serializable and deserialization

417454
tostring	gethashcode
they also implement gethashcode and tostring and so forth and lots of smallish helper methods

417506
serializable	deserialization
it sounds like you want a c++ version of java s serializable deserialization

417509
unsigned	short
note however if you are using this for serialization the unsigned short int pointer is not going to point at anything useful when you deserialize it unless you are very careful to use some sort of method to convert pointers into offsets and then back again

417640
pull	push
the action controllers are pretty boring - they pull values out of forms and urls call a few methods on model classes to actually perform the action and push the results out into the view

417643
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
what changes in quirks mode depends on the browser firefox opera safari and google-chrome implement a limited set of quirks like removing the space for text descenders in code like solution

417684
inherited	subclassing
if you only need to point to any product not any model then the solution is to have a product model that all products inherited from television and camcorder are both subclassing of product and give your offer model a foreignkey to product

417703
int	chars
is there a pythonic way of reading - say - mixed int and chars input without reading the whole input at once and without worrying about linebreaks

417703
int	chars
for example i have a file with whitespace-separated data of which i only know that there are x int then y chars and then z more int

417708
width	height
the latter takes a height and width and setting each to zero.

417710
hide	show
show the throbber before the code is run and hide it after

417742
int	double
an object consisting of only a 32-bit int and a 64-bit double -- 96 bits of data -- will require two words for the object header one word for the int two words for the double

417742
int	double	int	chars
this is because sun is relying on a relatively simple tactic for memory alignment issues on an imaginary processor a chars may be allowed to exist at any memory location an int at any location that is divisible by 4 and a double may need to be allocated only on memory locations that are divisible by 32 -- but the most restrictive alignment requirement also satisfies every other alignment requirement so sun is aligning everything according to the most restrictive location

417795
firefox	safari
works beautifully in firefox safari etc

417806
vb.net	vb6
i was a straight vb6 developer when i started transitioning to vb.net

417876
unix	aix
i am on a aix unix box so i am using vac compilers - no gnu compilers

417966
getter	setter
just recently i also thought about handling getter and setter the way you suggested the second approach was my favorite the private props array but i discarded it for it wouldn t have worked out in my app

417968
versioning	upgrade
it will be a major upgrade to the current ctp 2.0 versioning and will basically give you the same functionality to automate firefox and ie as versioning 1.3.0 offers for automating ie

418030
post	get
this means that in some cases like checking for a get or post parameter using isset is enough to tell if the variable is set because it will either be a string or it won t be set

418146
hazelcast	terracotta
i m planning to implement this idea with hazelcast i love its super-simple api or terracotta which i never used - but i m aware of their sweet spot medium-term data

418146
hbase	hypertable
how about non-relational data stores such as couch db neo4j hypertable hbase

418148
vb6	vba
vb6 might be a good idea here given it s similarity to vba

418154
rss	feed
are most rss readers able to follow redirect links without breaking the feed and making an update manually

418169
trojan	virus
the only service.dll i know of is a trojan virus

418198
submit	submission
if you have multiple forms on a page with all kinds of input elements and a button of type submit then hitting enter upon filling any of it s fields will trigger submission of that form

418214
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
assuming you don t want the superclass itself to represent an entity you can use mappedsuperclass on the superclass to have subclassing inherited the properties for persistence

418219
redmine	trac
trac redmine et al

418236
width	height
using the height and width css attributes or the height and width attributes will scale the image but it ll still download the whole thing

418238
innodb	myisam
well if you have the ability to use innodb tables instead of myisam then you can use transactions

418253
width	height
instead of using css you should do a basic width height check on your server side and if it goes beyond a certain threshold use html javascript to resize the image

418255
firefox	safari
at any point in time i have firefox 3 ie6 ie7 and safari win open on my pc checking all my work

width	height
if you don t want to go all the way to resizing the actual image file and want to maintain the proportions of the image then you can interrogate the image for its sizes height and width then multiply them by a required factor to fit into your div

418302
width	height
for example if you have a 1024x768 image and want to put it in a div that is 800 wide you know the width will be 800 and the height will be 768 x 800 1024 600

418302
width	height
then when displaying your image you can set the height and width properties as required

418347
gmp	bigint
math bigint gmp 1.24

418347
put	get
this is all in an attempt to get net sftp working to put a file on a remote host

418381
stdout	stderr
it is better not to pollute stdout and direct your debug output to file or to stderr

418434
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
the repeater and listview allow you to control the html the gridview is a total black box in this regard and generates atrocious html while avoiding the tedious server-side code that comes with the control ok new row

418437
rss	feed
pretty much every rss reader - major or minor - will update the feed url when it encounters a 301 redirect

418491
post	get
you can use cgi if you re with passing parameters only via get or post

418532
integer	unsigned
you might use any unsigned integer type you like but you should choose one which is likely to correspond to the word size of your architecture

418577
post	get
if you post which os and web server you are using i m sure someone here will post you a working cgi script within minutes if you get stuck

418599
cruisecontrol	teamcity
the only thing i would add is that you should be hooking up svn with cruisecontrol or teamcity to drive a continuous integration process

418735
profiling	debugging
follow the user scenario what your user will be doing and see how it will touch your code often this means debugging it other times profiling and other times it simply means thinking about the scenario - whatever points in your code get touched by the user those are the highest priority to write tests against

418751
hide	show
you can hide show the main menu bar by pressing ctrl+f11

418795
gridview	repeater
the only problem is clearly that with a simple repeater you must write more code to do the work that gridview does natively

418806
profiler	visualvm
the latest version of the sun jdk includes visualvm which is essentially the netbeans profiler by itself

418899
stdout	stderr
redirects channel 2 stderr standard error into channel 1 stdout standard output such that both is written as stdout

418917
for-loop	arrays
what you need is a double for-loop that check for occurrence of each char in one string in another and copy the non-occurring chars into a third char arrays which is your result

418930
vb.net	vb6	vbscript	vb6
that looks like vb6 vbscript not vb.net but i might be wrong

418934
int	chars
in c i ve decided it will be a pointer to an array of ascii int which we call chars

418938
interpreted-language	compiled-language
many other compiled-language such as c++ have a lot of simple looking instructions that can turn into much more code than you think it does virtual functions copy constructors etc.. and interpreted-language like java or ruby have another layer of instructions that you never see - the virtual machine or interpreter

418989
inherited	properties
if you only need access to it on the server side you can easily create a server control that inherited the checkbox control and add a properties to it called value which can be set and retrieved from the server side

419025
int	chars
if you re using a dos print routine such as int 21h with ah 9 you can print a carriage return chars ascii 13 without a subsequent newline chars ascii 10 to return the cursor to the beginning of the current line

419041
free	malloc
you have to call free passing it the address you got from malloc manually if the time has come to do so

419088
hash	md5
take a look at the following link the example gets an md5 hash of a supplied image

419088
hash	md5
md5 hash of an image

419094
google-chrome	firefox
the thing is it works fine in ie7 firefox and google-chrome the problem only comes up for ie6

419098
rational-numbers	floating-point
to calculate that you ll have to use the floating-point type mpf_t or the rational-numbers type mpq_t

419153
free	malloc
thus is neither must be managed as with malloc free nor do you have to worry about the address being reused as you would with an auto definition

419157
hide	show
i would like a simple way for the users to hide show some of the timeseries in the displayed chart component

419198
free	malloc
the main difference is that when you call malloc you take your memory from the heap and any memory taken from the heap must be free from the heap

419198
free	malloc
in this case the free is correct because p points to a memory location on the heap which was allocated by malloc

419218
hide	show
the show hide works fine but i can t figure out how to set it so that if the mouse is over the div it wont hide

419221
post	get
the authnrequest is usually compressed encoded and passed as a url parameter in a get while the simplest way to return the response is via the post binding - return an html page with a form whose target is the service provider and which is submitted at page load time via some javascript

419248
client-side	server-side
you would have to use ajax as a client-side script cannot be invoked by server-side code with the results available on server side scope

419327
hash	md5
to interact with an external data feed i need to pass a rolling security key which has been md5 hash every day we need to generate a new md5 hash key

419328
pop-up	dialog
having it pop-up the vista security are you sure dialog would be allright but the process cannot be marked with uiaccess otherwise it won t interact properly with the rest of the system and it will in 98 of cases be run by users without rights to elevate to administrator

419342
getter	setter
all the properties getter setter and common methods are created automatically which really saves time and money

419344
curlpp	libcurl
i ve heard of libcurl curlpp ptypes rolling my own just using the .net api and been told a bunch of times

419346
post	get
if you don t have experience with or need ajax then just stuff your data into a post get and send the data back to your page

419392
union	distinct
then i check to see if i m grouping data properly making sure that distinct s and union s without union all don t remove necessary duplicates

419396
hash	md5
my high-end workstation can calculate well over 100k md5 hash of a 10-byte data segment in a second

419444
kde	gnome
for many linux desktop systems gnome kde etc. a freedesktop s systray protocol is implemented

419446
gtk	motif
wx is a cross-platform gui and tools library that supports win32 mac os x gtk x11 motif wince and more

419466
getter	setter
the first beanwrapperimpl uses the setter getter methods of a java object while the other set the fields directly

419469
pull	push
the basic idea is to reverse the pull model of and turn it into a push model with observers - each part of the pipeline effectively pushes its data past any number of observers using event handlers which typically form new parts of the pipeline

419511
robocopy	xcopy
what about xcopy or robocopy

419532
cfstring	nsstring
so to see how nsstring or nsnumber is implemented under the hood follow the link above and take a look at cfstring and cfnumber respectively you ll need an apple developer account but registration is free

419578
set	bag
the 2 3 1 4 5 pattern you describe makes we wonder if your object isn t a property bag and it is simply serializing data in the order it was set - this would be highly risky

419590
gif	png
the web favors gif jpg and png mostly

419600
gif	png
the png portable network graphics file format was created as the free open-source successor to the gif

419600
gif	png
the png file format supports truecolor 16 million colours while the gif supports only 256 colours

419600
gif	png
gif is good for illustrations when you do not wish to move to png

419602
gif	png
examples of lossless image compression is png and gif

419602
tiff	bmp
tiff and bmp are both wrapper formats as the data inside can depend upon the compression technique that is used

419614
tiff	bmp
bmp and tiff probably are not good candidates for web applications

419617
gif	png
web browsers at the moment only display jpeg png and gif files - so those are the ones that can be shown on web pages

419652
folder	directory
i set up a website and i created a folder names docs in the website as virtual directory with some documents

419668
quicksort	heapsort
quicksort or heapsort and the

419698
post	get
edit can t really get the proper formatting i want for this so post

419717
mbunit	nunit
mbunit also has collection assertions similar to nunit assert.collections.cs

419743
realloc	malloc
otherwise you have to malloc the buffer and store its size which would make it possible to realloc on overflow.

419758
submit	submission
if you want to submit a form on click of button instead of enter then no need to use input type submit instead of this you can use input type button and set a onclick function in this like input type button onclick my_func and in the definiton of this function my_func you can use document.formname.submit for submission the form

419787
ubuntu	linux
download vmware and an ubuntu virtual machine ubuntu is a popular linux distribution from the vmware site

419868
pop-up	dialog
the strange thing is that the window pop-up tries to load show the file dialog and then you hear the sound like a pop-up window has been blocked although pop-up blocker is deactivated

419869
kde	gnome
linux kernel kde perl ruby on rails android wine fedora x.org mediawiki django vlc mono gnome samba cups gnupg emacs elpa.

419885
public	protected
bear in mind that all protected methods become part of the public api so if you change things later you will break other people s code

419890
nant	xmlpoke
instead you could have one master config and using regex xmlpoke nant your-favorite-text-manipulator to massage the file at build deploy time to insert the right values for each environment keeping the settings for all environments in another file but crucially all together

419920
disk	ram
my workstation is a core 2 quad with 8gb ram and raid 0 and raid 1 hard disk running vista x64

419933
width	margin
the same thing happens with the width and a horizontal resize showing a margin to the right

419977
post	get
ok so to post a short update thanks to the two helpful answers i ve managed to get the right format and encoding

420013
move	drag
when i just drag the file from one package to the other all references get updated and the file is move around on the filesystem

420039
cpu	processors
the power of the mainframe lies not in it s cpu grunt the individual processors aren t that powerful but they come in books of 54 cpus with hot backups and you can run many books in a single system z box but in the fact that all the cpu does is process instructions

420103
google-chrome	firefox
however ie firefox and google-chrome all fail to redirect to the new resource

420164
hazelcast	terracotta
again what i want to accomplish is something like described here and i would love to have some more feedback on ideas concerning the actual implementation why use terracotta instead of hazelcast use serialization or deep cloning via reflection or whatever else and also the major drawbacks of an approach like this - eg

420169
free	malloc
you could malloc a to the size you want just remember to free it afterwards

420180
notepad++	bbedit
it s very seldom that i want to edit something on mac win and for that any decent editor is enough bbedit notepad++

420207
post	get
redirect after post or post redirect get is something your application must do to be user friendly

420228
comparator	comparable
comparator is from the comparable interface

420240
treemap	treeset
this is implemented as part of the interface and the typical use is to define one or more small utility classes that implement this to pass to methods such as sort or for use by sorting data structures such as treemap and treeset

420242
comparator	comparable
comparator is a method of the interface comparable so it is used to compare this instance to another one

420251
comparator	comparable
if you are implementing your own classes which you know you want to compare at some stage you may have them implement the comparable interface and implement the comparator method accordingly

420255
comparator	comparable
comparable which has comparator requires the objects to be compared in order to use a treemap or to sort a list to implement that interface

420256
comparator	comparable
the method comparator is a method that you are obligated to implement if you implement the comparable interface

420298
udp	tcp
besides all the others nice and correct answers this article gives a good understanding about the differences between tcp and udp

420433
accessor	properties
i know that this is standard procedure for a struct the backing field for any properties must be assigned directly and not via the properties s set accessor from within the struct s constructor

420433
accessor	properties
thinking conceptually i was wondering if this wouldn t be a reasonable place for there to be an exception that allows the properties set accessor to be called within a struct s constructor at least for an automatic properties

420485
post	get
i ll give some of the sample linq queries a shot and see if i can integrate them with our code and then get post my results

420488
nsstring	nsdata
nsurlconnection is good if you want to get data from the web service into an nsstring or nsdata

420555
hide	show
this way when we are in dev or qa we show the toolbar but in production we hide it

420566
profiling	debugging
no there isn t - at least not without using a profiling debugging api of some description

420644
post	get
see your web server logs for the exact error message you get then post it here and perhaps we could offer you a better solution

420665
webclient	httpwebrequest
or write a .net executable which does everything you need it to using webclient or httpwebrequest

420679
accessor	properties
there are pros and cons to having properties that act as config settings accessor

420722
int	chars
nb this just needs to handle simple chars int decimal fields nothing fancy

420774
for-loop	loops
now i know i could recode this to add a boolean flag variable or traditional for-loop but i am wondering if there s any way to find out if a foreach loops is on the first iteration of its looping

420783
versioning	upgrade
even if i have the old versioning it upgrade it

420791
super	extends
but if it really did belong it would make sense to extends that super class

420792
cpython	ironpython
related question what are some strategies to write python code that works in cpython jython and ironpython

420801
versioning	upgrade
if that doesn t i would upgrade the jdk to use a more recent versioning of 1.6

420830
put	get
we had the budget for tfs and even the hardware to put it on but with our team only being 5 people going through the work to get tfs up and running didn t seem worth it

420843
hash	salt
the reasoning being that the hash now maps not to the original password but a combination of the password and the salt

420843
hash	salt
in the etc shadow the hash passwords are actually stored with the salt

420843
hash	salt
for example a salt of foo and password of bar would hash to this

420843
hash	salt
if a hacker somehow were able to get his hands on this file i don t see what purpose the salt serves since the reverse hash of te5sbm.7c25ffdu6birbx is known to contain foo

420843
hash	salt
to summarize what i understand the salt makes the hash password more complex thus making it much less likely to exist in a precomputed rainbow table

420889
hash	salt
if someone has a list of millions of pre-computed hash they aren t going to be able to look up 1 foo te5sbm.7c25ffdu6birbx1 in their table even though they know the hash and the salt

420893
hash	salt
however if we salt the password and it becomes foolegolas the hash will be different so the dictionary attack will be unsuccessful

421081
hash	salt
as you ve pointed out the attacker has access to both the hash password and the salt so when running the dictionary attack she can simply use the known salt when attempting to crack the password

421081
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
without a salt i could compute md5 attempt 0 and then scan through the file to see if that hash shows up anywhere

421081
salt	md5
if salt are present then i have to compute md5 salt a

421081
salt	md5
attempt 0 compare against entry a then md5 salt b

421145
min	max
the following functions are supported count sum min max avg stdev var

421147
hash	salt
in the etc shadow the hash passwords are actually stored with the salt

421147
hash	salt
you always have to store the salt with the password because in order to validate what the user entered against your password database you have to combine the input with the salt hash it and compare it to the stored hash

421147
hash	salt
without salt she would have to precompute 100 000 hash

421150
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
the change did not seem to have any negative side-effects in firefox 2 or 3 opera 9.63 or safari for windows 3.2.1

421211
firefox	safari
ie7 firefox safari anything but ie6

421239
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
and since you asked about languages other than .net in java i would use an illegalargumentexception in the general case - perhaps a good old nullpointerexception if the argument is null

421254
single-sign-on	shibboleth
it has also pretty much been mandated that we use shibboleth single-sign-on to handle the authentication

421260
ienumerable	iqueryable
how linq to objects and linq to xml ienumerable are different from linq to sql iqueryable

421353
pop-up	dialog
i have an asp imagebutton that is supposed to pop-up a save dialog when clicked

421353
pop-up	dialog
when i put it outside the updatepanel it works fine but when i put it inside the updatepanel the dialog does not pop-up

421368
organization	naming
if i m reading unfamiliar code i tend to look for organization patterns naming conventions consistent logic etc

421386
union	distinct
a union can be deceptive with respect to result set ordering because a database will sometimes use a sort method to provide the distinct that is implicit in union which makes it look like the rows are deliberately ordered -- this doesn t apply to union all for which there is no implicit distinct of course

421392
filesystems	ntfs
i don t know if ntfs has similar semantics although i ve heard that it s losely based on bsd s filesystems so maybe it does

421397
width	height
you can use percentages to set width and height also but this is also difficult sometimes

421434
base	fractions
there s a fractions and an exponent where the final value of the float is fractions base exponent

421439
post	get
the hazard is that you may want to signal an error if you receive a get when you expect a post

421439
post	get
typically get is reserved for viewing and post is reserved for making changes create update delete operations

421497
opera	safari
in opera and safari esp

421503
post	get
php will have both the post and get information available to it in the usual ways when the form is submitted

421566
minimum	max
the plugin dll itself also does not expose anything more than the minimum interface required by max for adding a few top level scripted classes

421582
pop-up	dialog
to make a link that pop-up the add bookmark dialog in opera 9.x use the following

421604
qtreewidget	qlist
then i remove an item from my qlist items and i try to clear reset the qtreewidget

421618
ubuntu	centos
ubuntu 8.10 or centos

421636
post	get
and of course you can get a pre-configured image with mono here go to the bottom of the post for details on using that

421653
free	malloc
or malloc some memory for the new name and don t forget to free it...

421659
udp	tcp
are aware that both tcp and udp and ip and ethernet and... already provide checksum protection to data in transit

421664
memcpy	strncpy
you could also use memcpy instead of strncpy as you want to just copy some bytes

421666
free	malloc
you need to allocate some memory for it using malloc and remember to free it when you re done or in this case you can probably simply declare it as a character array

421733
post	get
i create two overloaded actions in the controller one to render the input form using an http get and the other to process the form post using an http post

421733
post	get
if it s successful there s a redirect to another action which avoids the duplicate posting warning on browsers if a user refreshes the page - see post redirect get on wikipedia and this blog entry by stephen walther

421803
put	get
then put all known converters into a map and get happy

421848
jquery	scriptaculous
i m surveying a wide array of web frameworks and the majority don t mention security as an issue on their websites eg scriptaculous jquery prototype rico

421864
disk	ram
high cpu can often be solved by more ram and a better disk config

421880
ant	maven
the nant ant maven executable

421956
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
once set up this makes it trivial to test on ie6 7 and 8 various firefox flavours konqueror opera safari etc.

422014
maven	pom.xml
we use maven so we only check in the code the tests config files and of course the pom.xml no libs no tools

422019
union	distinct
if you want the distinct list of teams you have to select from the game table twice union the home and the away teams theoretically one team could play all its games on the road or at home if you have logic that prevents that then you could adjust this query

422019
union	distinct
the union operator will make sure you only get distinct elements in the return set unless you use union all

422039
subscript	superscript
on the other hand an i with a hat on top and a subscript d and a superscript is rather confusing.

422060
getter	setter
i ve not worried a whole lot about javabeans but i have found that following basic javabean conventions has been very helpful for me in the past basically using standard getter and setter for properties

422060
getter	setter
bound properties are properties available through standard getter and setter which fire propertychangeevents when they change

422060
getter	setter
be aware also that standard getter and setter can be very non-standard through the use of beaninfo classes to define a javabean s exact interface but i never use that either. the main other javabean convention that i choose to follow or not as appropriate in each situation is a no-argument constructor

422071
ant	maven
if you use java better choice would be ant and maven - they have a lot of code behind them.

422071
ant	maven
but as for me you have to be a little brainf ed to program in xml so i often use rake for many task and invoke it from ant maven like that

422078
mouse	keyboard
selection with the keyboard works perfectly just not with a mouse

422135
folder	directory
you can run crossftp client and choose tools - synchornize directory to compare your local folder and the remote folder

422157
stdout	fflush
edit as swaroop mentioned this doesn t work i m guessing raw_input fflush stdout

422188
sorting	filtering
note that these wouldn t be the entire uris for example the uri to list the movies would support filtering paging and sorting

422208
uiview	subviews
you just need to size this uiview appropriately and add your uilabel as a subviews of it to get the effect you desire

422219
inherited	properties
i have inherited a class in vb.net and when i create the object i am only seeing one of the inherited public properties in intellisense

422229
multiplying	multiplication
well your multiplication by scalar is wrong - you should multiplying variance by the square of d

422329
ant	maven
we are a maven shop and previously an ant shop

422343
range	infinity
i ve used symbolic values for positive and negative infinity in dealing with range comparisons to eliminate corner cases that would otherwise require special handling

422343
intersect	contains
given two ranges a a b and c c d do they intersect is one greater than the other or does one contains the other

422343
range	infinity
if you have values for positive and negative infinity that respectively compare greater than and less than all other values you don t need to do any special handling for open-ended range

422372
folder	directory
and obviously the contents of the machine-level config directory get version-controlled in a different repository or a different folder structure from your app

422401
post	get
i ve also looked at this blog post but either i couldn t get it to work or it wasn t meant to solve my problem

422420
kerberos	ntlm
the webserver just needs to be configured to support windows authentication which will be ntlm or - better - kerberos if both client and server are w2k or later

422420
firefox	safari
edit looks like firefox has some support for this too and safari on macos

422440
factories	presenter
but what about using the domain object factories in a presenter layer

422473
kerberos	ntlm
windows uses ntlm or kerberos to authorize the user against a central service typically active directory on the windows platform

422535
getter	setter
for example if you have event handlers or you wanted to simulate private properties with getter setter you might do

422557
width	height
once you know or think you know what the monitor s diagonal size and physical aspect ratio are then you you can calculate it s physical width and height

422557
width	height
this puts the physical width at 13.27 and the physical height at 10.62

422557
width	height
draw a box on the screen and have the user press the up and down arrows to adjust its height and the left and right arrows to adjust its width until the box is exactly one inch or centimeter square according to their ruler

422596
versioning	upgrade
the best versioning of this framework is the one in the colloquy irc client as it has been upgrade to use pcre 6.7

422602
post	put
i forgot that only worked for the first insert - i do have an update trigger as well to update the date fields and put a copy of the updated record in my history table - which i would post .

422650
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the autoreleases you mentioned don t actually make any sense all you re doing is creating a mutable copy nsmutablestring that s properly autoreleased but since you re casting it to an nsstring there s no practical difference then just saying

422690
subtract	add
if it makes sense to add and subtract to from primitive types then you should write a constructor that constructs the object from the primitive type

422691
children	parent
if you have a parent datarow and want to navigate to children in table2 it will be a pluralized method row.gettable2rows

422737
hebrew	thai
sure in theory it s great if you allow every script on god s green earth to be used but if the db is also used by support staff are they going to be able to handle names in japanese hebrew and thai script

422744
dictionary	map
a rainbow attack is essentially a more efficient dictionary attack it s designed to use the low cost of digital storage to enable creation of a map of a substantial subset of possible passwords to hashes and facilitate the reverse mapping

422744
hash	salt
if you use no password salt at all your hash are vulnerable to pre-computed hash tables someone with access to your hash would thus have access to the passwords for a large percentage of your users however many used vulnerable passwords which would be a substantial percentage

422744
hash	salt
if you use a constant password salt then pre-computed hash tables are no longer valuable so someone would have to spend the time to compute a custom hash table for that salt they could do so incrementally though computing tables which cover ever greater permutations of the problem space

422784
put	get
in the code below i m trying to load some images and put them in the stage as soon as they get individually loaded

422788
fflush	gets
it would help explain lots of performance issues - parser s slow because there s lots of branches and pipeline gets fflush very easily branch predictor cannot compensate for everything

422822
udp	tcp
most networked games don t use tcp but udp for communications

422822
udp	tcp
with tcp there are a number of interactions between the host server to guarantee data in an ordered manner another thing you have to account for using udp the fact that data is not ordered

422826
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
use the avaudioplayer from the avfoundation

422851
udp	tcp
the difference between tcp and udp should not account for 200 ms but a combination of other factors can

422852
post	get
if you tell me how to get xml to display i ll post it. note the passworddecryptionadvisor it only matches the setpassword method

422900
onfocus	onblur
var _2 ondijitclick _onclick onmouseover _onmouseover onmouseout _onmouseout onfocus _onmouseover onblur _onmouseout

422963
folder	directory
i m using the following command to remove every .dummy directory in a folder named test folder

422972
gif	png
if there was a better compression algorithm than jpeg gif png etc

423013
firefox	safari
i have checked this against ie firefox and safari

423070
actionscript	mxml
i don t like the way it feels different when i am using actionscript vs mxml

423073
put	get
you can put this inline but the doubly-nested function starts to get harder to read

423102
udp	tcp
we regularly use tcp and udp connections to pass info from services to other exes and in some cases msmq

423168
ninject	spring.net
namely autofac mef ninject spring.net structuremap unity and windsor

423214
codeigniter	kohana
the 1 controller to 1 view works well for me in the php mvc frameworks zend codeigniter and kohana

423256
firefox	safari
the gwt debug browser uses the native browser on your machine so ie on windows safari on mac firefox on linux

423263
free	malloc
you need to use delete w new or free w malloc to free the memory on the heap

423284
udp	tcp
i would recommend first working with tcp rather than udp

423284
udp	tcp
udp doesn t automatically redeliver lost packets like tcp so it will add another element to the equation that will probably just confuse you as you re just starting out

423307
min	max
a very simple way to detect the blowing sound might be to just count up all the samples that are at the min max values and if they represent more than 5 of the total or some other threshold assume that blowing is occuring

423362
folder	directory
i have a directory on a windows machine with a large number of files and folder that i need to watch and have the files mirrored synced instantly or as near to as possible to a linux machine over the local network

423399
tostring	gethashcode
have fun implementing isystemobject on all of your classes so that you have access to tostring and gethashcode

423420
free	malloc
the caller would have to know you malloc d it and then call free

423427
coalesce	nvl
you may also have to play with nvl or coalesce to convert nulls into zeroes

423469
firefox	safari
duplicated in firefox 3 and safari

423558
strdup	malloc
strdup char allocates memory the malloc for array i is not necessary

423560
strdup	malloc
also as kauppi has pointed out strdup will allocate memory for you so you don t need to do malloc on each string

423570
free	strdup
as the other have posted - there was unused size and strdup allocates memory by itself and it is nice to free the memory afterwards.

423673
m2e	pom.xml
i ve got m2e plugin installed and there s no problem syncing compile time dependencies that appear in pom.xml

423683
m2e	pom.xml
i have found that any time you update a project s pom.xml it helps to rerun m2e or it will not see the new external dependencies

423688
affinity	processors
the fact the processing is stuck to a single processors shows that the process is doing something that is not multi-core aware or someone has set it s thread affinity to 1

423714
rss	feed
how can i get the rss feed url for the itunes podcasts available

423728
width	height
screenbounds x 808 y 908 width 62 height 29 system.drawing.rectangle

423733
rss	feed
currently generating rss feed of podcasts in the itunes music store does not appear to be supported

423733
rss	feed
you can generate a limited set of rss feed for information in the itunes store but podcasts are not included

423733
rss	feed
you can generate these feed using apple s itunes music store rss generator

423734
mouseleave	mouseenter
then when the mouseenter one you will know and can ignore the usercontrol s mouseleave event

423734
mouseleave	mouseenter
then when the child s mouseleave event fires check for the usercontrol s mouseenter again

423760
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can also loop through all the child controls recursive on your control and attach a mouseenter and mouseleave event to them as well

423761
affinity	processors
on a dual quad-core getprocessaffinitymask or the dialog from set affinity in taskman.exe will report eight logical processors

423890
put	get
have you debugged it and put a breakpoint there to verify that the string you get is actually the string you expect it to be

423910
integer	fractions
so in short it does much more than convert a string to an integer applying specific rounding rules to fractions short circuting unecessary conversions etc

423919
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
that works perfectly fine on safari and firefox but when i try to click the link on ie7 and opera it does not even hit the server

423937
pop-up	dialog
visually you can either have it in a new pop-up or integrated into the list but actually it ll be only added to the list on the next try to add or acknowledge the parent dialog

424003
sorting	filtering
a fabricated ado recordset can be a good choice of container object for data as an alternative to a vba type struct collection dictionary etc strongly data typed nullable fields with built-in support for filtering sorting searching output to formatted text xml array paging cloning etc

424016
children	parent
i m pretty certain that the children are being loaded on-demand when i expand the parent going by the response time

424074
client-side	server-side
the problem is not on the server-side but on the client-side

424105
vb.net	vb6
the library must be able to be accessed from a wide range of languages including vb6 c++ vb.net and c#

424141
public	protected
beside #define private public you can also #define private protected and then define some foo class as descendant of wanted class to have access to it s now protected methods via type casting

424296
udp	tcp
tcpview is a windows program that will show you detailed listings of all tcp and udp endpoints on your system including the local and remote addresses and state of tcp connections

424307
translation	localization
however i plan to integrate it a bit into kde in future and here come the problems with localization translation

424308
accessor	properties
if you re not entirely comfortable with that write a properties accessor on the page that acts as a facade to retrieve the value from the viewstate

424309
16-bit	64bit
and if 8 capabilities isn t enough for you it s trivial to change the tinyint 8 bits to a smallint 16-bit capabilities int 32 bits or bigint 64bit which should be more than sufficient for just about any application most of us are likely to write

424356
x86	64bit
c program files xxx on the 32-bit dev enviroment or c program files x86 xxx on the 64bit dev environment

424373
versioning	upgrade
how straightforward or not is it going to be to upgrade this between .net versioning

424389
prng	random
edit i really should be correct and refer to this as a pseudo random number generator or prng

424407
google-chrome	firefox
i am not sure what pitfalls there are to avoid and i am not currently able to test implementations in any other browsers than internet explorer 8 google-chrome and mozilla firefox 3

424424
pull	push
it s a pull based parser instead of the push you are currently using

424427
inherited	properties
what you want to do is inherited a class from windowsformsapplicationbase setting the protected issingleinstance properties to true

424547
put	get
so then the only merge i ever need to do is to get a bug fix out of trunk and put it on the latest build branch and re-release that branch

424625
installation	upgrade
software is supposed to require admin rights for installation including update upgrade

424625
folder	directory
what specific folder in the user s directory

424703
accessor	properties
the syntax is straightforward following the same principles as properties accessor

424739
spweb	spsite
i ve looked at spsite and spweb but neither seems able to do quite what i want

424764
sorting	filtering
i thought that would apply the sorting filtering etc

424835
min	max
the naive algorithm is too loop and update min max

424835
min	max
however a recursive solution will require less comparisons than naive algorithm if you want to get min max simultaneously it isn t necessarily faster due to function call overhead

424848
hash	md5
the most reliable way would be to make md5 hash of all the local files you care about and store it in a file

424848
hash	md5
so the file will contain a list of filenames and their md5 hash

424862
rss	feed
i got lucky with a blog post that came through an rss feed referring to a tutorial that lead to the right manual

424889
min	max
the quickest query response to the min max request will always be from a sorted array because as others have mentioned you simply take the first or last element - giving you an o 1 cost

424925
min	max
if you want to find both the min and max at the same time the loop can be modified as follows

424984
cpu	processors
having dual or quad cores is just the beginning there will be systems with a much higher number of processors in the near future currently there are cpu with 256 cores windows 7 will have support for such processors

424991
vsto	add-in
i ve written a vsto add-in for word 2003 which is working correctly

425011
accessor	properties
if i don t need a special accessor and the instance variable isn t used outside the class i ll just refer to it directly rather than declaring a properties

425058
tiff	png
tiff can beat png by about 2 1 43k vs

425058
tiff	png
83k using imagemagick convert to go from original tiff - png - tiff again to double-check that imagemagick is producing both file formats and ensure that my original program didn t do a bad job producing the tiff but only because tiff uses 8bits pixel grayscale and png uses 24bits pixel rgb

425061
x86	64bit
as has been stated the 64bit jit compiler behaves differently to the x86 jit compiler

425062
awt	swing
swing components should always be manipulated on the awt event dispatch thread edt

425124
post	get
if the value has no security concerns pass it via the get or post method

425160
sudoku	crossword
it reminded me of a crossword or sudoku where you know how things are related but you can t definitively assign something until you work out what its dependant parts are

425211
free	malloc
the function free can only be called on memory that was allocated with malloc

425214
free	malloc
you need to have malloc d something for it to be able to be free d

425234
firefox	safari
did not test with firefox safari etc

425251
textchanged	selectedindexchanged
you could try valuememberchanged validating selectedindexchanged or textchanged

425308
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
currently it s showing the value of scrollwidth which is reported as 1540px by ie and 920px by firefox safari opera etc

425350
superclass	subclassing
in the code we d probably make all of these entities subclassing of an entity superclass

425355
width	height
for a cross-browser experience its either scroll width height or offset width height whichever is greater

425357
hide	show
then in my main user control applications rootvisual i just show hide each user control when needed

425361
mouseleave	mouseenter
hooking all the controls mouseenter and mouseleave events then figuring out if it is still inside the form is pretty painful

425429
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
firefox opera google-chrome konqueror - all display it properly watchbot can

425443
put	get
that is doing a get delete head or put on a resource more than once is the same as doing it only once

425467
setinterval	settimeout
probably the best way to handle this is to use setinterval instead of settimeout

425467
setinterval	settimeout	setinterval	clearinterval	clearinterval	settimeout
like settimeout setinterval returns an integer which can be passed to clearinterval to cancel the processing

425490
hash	salt
just use ssl and hash passwords using a salt

425583
wan	lan
my suggestion to you is that if there is no performance problem for example when the service provider is on the lan not wan or the data is relatively small it s worth it to send 100 post requests to the server

425630
actionscript	mxml
adobe has an free alpha release of flexbuilder for linux i thought it was quite unstable when editing mxml files but if your doing strict actionscript work you may find it useful

425662
minimum	max
for these you should set a minimum time to your estimate and make it clear you don t know what the max is

425670
chown	chmod
file permission tools are also a must for getting a system working - look into chmod and chown and how those commands work

425682
width	height
this would create two panes windows that take up 50 of the height but span the entire width of window

425748
public	protected
you should never have to test private methods because only the public or protected methods of the same class will ever call private methods

425921
jython	jacl
because oracle has a built in jvm you can develop stored procs in java but also in non-java-languages that use the jvm that means languages like jacl jython scheme and groovy

425925
ironruby	ironpython
.net covers many languages c# vb.net ironpython ironruby delphi.net even on the same solution

425987
try-catch	exception-handling
my idea is throwing an exception-handling but operation is really complex so should i put try-catch to all of my functions or is there a more generic way pattern

425989
google-chrome	safari
here s the easiest way to fix this issue for both google-chrome and safari if you have multiple web apps

425989
google-chrome	safari
now the asp.net menu will render correctly in safari and google-chrome

426138
cpu	affinity	cpu	processors	affinity	processors
you generally can only optimally have 1 thread per cpu but unless your application has some explicit thread affinity to one processors then yes windows will assign these threads to a free processors

426161
width	height
if you run this the trace statement should display the height and width of the drawn sprite which is randomly generated

426161
width	height
in other words you can get the height and width of the sprite simply by querying its height and width properties

426182
ienumerable	icollection
i ve read a couple of blog post mentioning that for public apis we should always return icollection or ienumerable instead of list

426196
width	height
alertview.frame cgrectmake x y width height

426248
filtering	grouping
use the having clause to filtering grouping

426248
filtering	grouping
in the above query where filtering for rows matching a condition and having filtering for grouping that have at least five count

426248
filtering	grouping
evaluate having conditions against grouping filtering out grouping that don t match

426252
free	malloc
for example you can write a library which implement malloc and free

426252
free	malloc
and by loading these with ld_preload your malloc and free will be executed rather than the standard ones

426255
fast-forward	merge
ideally your local branch should merge fast-forward only no merge commit is generated

426267
maven	pom.xml
maven install plugin has command line usage to install a jar into the local repository pom.xml is optional but you will have to specify the groupid artifactid version and packaging all the pom.xml stuff

426275
inherited	properties
i would have your view specific view models inherited from a common base view model then have a properties on this base view model that gets set in your controllers

426330
mvp	presenter
model view presenter seems to suit wpf quite well if you ve not heard of it before check out the supervisor controller pattern which is a subset of mvp the author has renamed it to supervisor controller and passive view as two different flavours of mvp

426357
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
no need to buy a 3rd party ftp library ftp is built into .net ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse

426384
pop-up	dialog
however the dialog box doesn t pop-up here is the download.php script

426404
unix	aix
lf multics unix and unix-like systems gnu linux aix xenix mac os

426417
post	get
if you want to pass the data using post instead of get you can do it using a combination of php and javascript like this

426456
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari	webkit	gecko
gwt works in firefox and all gecko browser safari and all webkit browsers ie and opera

426532
put	get
occasionally i get messages in a different order in which they were put onto the queue

426541
jsf	tapestry
so far our top choices are tapestry and jsf maybe with facelets

426584
capitalize	capitalization
i am trying to actually capitalize as the developer types not remind them about proper capitalization

426628
jquery	scriptaculous
the array.prototype.call in scriptaculous effect causes this problem with jquery

426649
tostring	string.format
either through tostring or using string.format

426651
post	get
that is a good discussion but more to the point you should be looking into post redirect get prg also known as get after post.

426842
firefox	safari
javascript doesn t run across multiple threads so you re safe from race conditions ignoring upcoming worker thread support in safari and firefox d

426842
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
simple question how are you calling setalpha multiple times firefox safari and opera all coalesce style sheet updates -- eg

426842
firefox	safari
safari and i think the latest firefox builds

426897
sorting	filtering
linq s supposed to be used to make filtering sorting aggregating and manipulating data from various sources as intuitive and expressive as possible

426903
for-loop	loops
if the outer for loops are doing nothing but controlling a count then your nested for loops are simply a more complicated way of iterating by a count that could be handled by a single for-loop

427040
multiplying	multiplication
for example you could define an infix multiplication operator as follows where multiplying x y is already defined

427045
codeigniter	cakephp
some frameworks like symfony cakephp akelos codeigniter and others have support for scaffolding

427100
copying	overwrite
i m relying on memory here but i recall getting this error once after copying settings between different config files and the only problem was that i d overwrite an extra angle bracket when pasting

427101
for-loop	loops
expanding on michael burr s answer if the outer for loops are doing nothing but controlling a count then your nested for loops over n counts are simply a more complicated way of iterating over the product of the counts with a single for-loop

427146
associativity	operator-precedence
once you have a fixity a precedence and an associativity for each operator you ll want to write an operator-precedence parser

427149
cairngorm	puremvc	cairngorm	mate	mate	puremvc
mvc frameworks are all the rage in ria applications such as adobe flex-based web programming cairngorm mate puremvc etc.

427209
alloca	malloc
the alloca routine like malloc but uses the stack automatically frees itself and also blows up with sigsegv if it s too big

427245
min	max
if you don t want to go by id but instead want the 30th item that would be returned you can use a limit min max

427253
draggable	droppable
have a look at the jquery and more specifically jquery ui since it has draggable droppable sortable and a variety of other complex components

427274
alloca	malloc
the deprecated alloca routine like malloc but uses the stack

427274
alloca	malloc
anyhow how much faster in your case is alloca vs malloc

427284
opera	safari
the following jquery code works just fine for me with safari opera ff2 and ff3

427284
width	height
the problem is that in ie6 and ie7 it gets width and height properly but doesn t seem to get top and left properly

427311
google-chrome	firefox
i figured out to do it in a non-w3c-compliant way and it is working in both ie and firefox and incidentally in google-chrome too

427320
subtract	add
it returns an array where you can get top and left array values. the fix was that i have to trap for ie6 and just subtract some fixed number 12px in my case for top and add that same number on height

427377
min	max
note that soviut s explanation of limit is not quite correct - it s offset number of rows rather than min max

427388
alloca	malloc	alloca	longjmp
the linux man-page for alloca notes that for certain applications its use can improve efficiency compared to the use of malloc and in certain cases it can also simplify memory deallocation in applications that use longjmp or siglongjmp

427397
powerpc	thumb
also if you can choose the architecture of the target device going with something like a modern arm with thumb v2 or a powerpc with vle or mips with mips16 or selecting known-compact targets like infineon tricore or the sh family is a very good option

427427
public	protected
in c# i would make such methods protected instead of private and expose them as public in a subclass for testing

427433
stdout	stderr
however i want to dispaly the console window and write stdout stderr by giving a cmd line parameter

427461
stdout	stderr
i d look into starting a cmd instance possibly using system.diagnostics.process to start a process while redirecting stdin stdout stderr of that new process

427490
bash	zsh
this autocompletion is a shell feature either bash or zsh whatever you use

427498
ubuntu	debian
if you are using bash you can look at etc bash_completion and at least on debian ubuntu you should create a file in etc bash_completion.d that specifies the completions for your program

427503
put	get
any pc i work on for more than an hour - where i have permissions to get puretext.exe onto and running - i put it in c windows double-click it once set it to autostart in its settings and always hide the icon in the task bar

427572
min	max
as that avoid the a min test when a max

427572
min	max
with min 6 and max 10 this will first shift a down by 8 then check if it lies between -2 and +2

427642
children	parent
this is done by calling the children property on the parent object we are trying to develop a rich domain

427651
postgresql	mysql
i haven t made sure if all rdbms s in question mssql oracle db2 postgresql mysql maybe a few others actually have such a type but at this point i just assume they do

427661
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
i ve used it a lot and works just perfect for many many browsers ie6 7 opera safari google-chrome ff2 3

427731
hide	show
also instead of referring to it by id pass in this.nextsibling to the toggle using dom navigation to get the next sibling which should be the span to show hide

427750
easymock	powermockito
i ve been a fan of easymock for many years now and thanks to so i came across references to powermockito and it s ability to mock constructors and static methods both of which cause problems when retrofitting tests to a legacy codebase

427756
superclass	subclassing
why are we not able to override an instance variable of a superclass in a subclassing

427830
public	protected
compiler is free to reorder public private protected members virtual base classes end up at the end of the most derived object iiuc etc

427830
free	malloc
you should make sure that memory acquired by malloc should be free with free so delete your instances like this

427837
put	get
if i don t put a manifest file into the war at all i get the standard stuff followed by the contents of web-inf lib but in an arbitrary order

427839
getter	setter
instead of cluttering all objects with getter setter essentially making a sieve of them i d like to tell them to do stuff

427866
typedef	struct
if it is defined using a typedef you dont have to put the struct keyword in front

427866
typedef	struct
but if its not a typedef you need the struct keyword

427896
pull	push
as ajax only offers you a client server request model normally termed pull rather than push the only way to get data from the server is via requests

427920
hide	show
show hide preexisting layers in the eps file toggle them on and off

427921
post	get
i ll post some example hql to get around this if you haven t

427924
linefeed	delimiter
you ll need to define exactly what you mean by 1st piece of data - is this data delimiter in some form like http headers - key value pairs are delimiter by carriage-return linefeed

427925
agile	sprint
we made a point of updating our team s folders at the end of every sprint of work we used the scrum agile methodology

427951
httphandler	httpmodule
when i am swapping out the httphandler with one that implements irequiressessionstate the session member is available in the httpmodule and a set-cookie is sent back to the browser but later when i try to read the contents of the session in a normal aspx page none of the values i set are there

427954
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
2 the service needs to maintain state between calls including sqlconnection and sqltransaction instances ugly but necessary due to project constraints

427957
actionscript	mxml
although the flex command-line compiler mxmlc can compile mxml + actionscript files into swfs i need specific insights into its capabilities via the command-line switches

427966
profiling	debugging
we are trying to debugging a random sql timeout error and did a trace with sql server profiling on the audit login event

427980
vb.net	vb6
i ve recently moved from vb6 to vb.net and i am finally getting there with understanding the inner workings

428074
children	parent
so before you add something to your css make sure that it is not redundant check parent elements and remove redundant declarations from children

428141
spweb	spsite
to get an spweb object from a url you can use spsite object

428205
memcached	apc
to streamline the process a bit you can always configure drupal s caching there are some addon modules and then you could go with something like apc or memcached

428271
bmp	png
when i need multiple icons i embedded the png bmp or whatever image type it is as a image resource in the application

428279
mouseover	mouseout
however the side effect of settings mousechildren to false is that all mouse events mouseover mouseout click ... on child elements will no longer work

428279
mouseover	mouseout
use the mouseover and mouseout events to set the cursor programmatically

428282
implements	extends
i do however want to do my best to force anybody who wants to implements igenerator to extends basegenerator as that s the only way to properly combine two generators

428340
cvs	svn
i recommend you sourceforge.net it has cvs svn wikis not so good file releases management and it s used by the most of the opensource projects

428365
inherited	properties
you may have to go back to the project properties and change an override back to inherited

428368
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the site renders correctly in firefox google-chrome ie 7 and safari but the design appears to be complete borked in ie 6

428410
folderbrowserdialog	openfiledialog
to keep the ui consistent it would be nice if it is possible to extend the openfiledialog or the folderbrowserdialog

428416

429215
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
i started a topic on the subject of whether or not it is a good idea to proactively throw an argumentnullexception or to let the runtime throw a nullreferenceexception

429284
websphere	ibm
in ibm websphere application server 6.1 web modules have their own class loaders that are usually used in the parent_first mode

so addition of integers is somehow complete in a sense that division isn t

430472
telerik	componentart
many of the full featured ui suites like like telerik or componentart are very seductive but i think they encourage a lot of bad programming

430476

430689
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
but for safari and opera i tried the linkrel css hack technique and it failed -- firefox was loading and interpreting the opera and safari stylesheets when i thought it might fail on the linkrel tag

430689
opera	safari
so i had to switch it to an inline css and use an import url call but that failed because opera and safari wouldn t interpret the import url call

430689
opera	safari
well the current arrangement in the file below works but it means that the stylesheet for opera and safari is loading with all browsers it s just not interpreted except by opera and safari

430689
opera	safari
i d like to know how to get the linkrel or the import working for opera and safari instead

430697
opera	firefox
for most browsers including internet explorer navigator firefox and opera the supported and sanctioned way of doing this is to use dde

430730
post	get
i solved the problem with post redirect get but i believe the tutorial has some merit and perhaps tony marston can elaborate on it

430730
post	get
or how is it better than post redirect get if the functions can in fact be used in solving my particular problem

430746
rss	feed
i see you have already gone and made yourself a module so this may no longer help but it is fairly easy to get a view to expose an rss feed which might be an easier way of getting at the content especially if you want to include it on a different site

430810
filesystems	fat	case-sensitive	case-insensitive
for example the root filesystems could be case-sensitive but you can have a case-insensitive filesystems an usb stick with a fat filesystems on it mounted somewhere

430810
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
also what if the user copies the data from say a case-sensitive to a case-insensitive file system

430810
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
this works on the original case-insensitive file system but not on the case-sensitive system

430883
junit	testng
testng is more flexible than junit and have multiple advantages like support for parallel testing for example

430889
ready	each
instead you need to create a reset event for each thread and then when you re ready loop through them all and use set

430960
opera	firefox
i m going to assume you ve tried using the same stylesheets for webkit firefox opera allready and that this is the last resort because you re doing something strange

431262
hash	salt
one small point that i haven t seen mentioned explicitly is that by adding a random salt to each password you re virtually guaranteeing that two users who happened to choose the same password will produce different hash

431263
hide	show
if the form has a lot of controls calling show then hide against the form in start up will also preload the forms controls further reducing the time it takes to subsequently display the form

431266
post	put
what other post build tasks have you put in place

431296
post	get
i want the submission to use get rather than post mostly so users can bookmark the page easily

431314
floating-point	integer
short usually means a short integer not a single-precision floating-point number

431316
post	get
have you thought about not eliminating the post but rather redirecting to a suitable get url when the form is posted

431316
post	get
that is accept both get and post but on post construct a get request and redirect to it

431319
pop-up	dialog
in most cases the only thing you can really do with an exception is log it and abort the operation serve the user an error page in a web app or pop-up a friendly this program has crashed sorry dialog and exit

431362
boyer-moore	knuth-morris-pratt
if the search string is longer the regex engine can employ a search algorithm like boyer-moore or knuth-morris-pratt to speed up the search--the longer the better in fact

431398
apache	nginx
so you can do a django redirect_to urlconf entry but you d be better off with an apache or nginx or insert-your-webserver-here redirect so the initial request never has to hit django at all

431426
rss	feed
you might check woot.com and see what they provide on an rss feed to unburden the web http server

431473
ironruby	ironpython
f# s performance is about the same as c# s they are both compiled to il which is the important factor unlike ironpython and ironruby which are interpreted and therefore much slower

431479
prerequisites	uninstaller
i think your better option is to uninstaller the software and re-install it carefully reading every installation panel carefully checking for prerequisites or any other instructions

431520
width	height
you can also do a difference on width height between the getwindowrect and getclientrect

431586
projectile	angle
i ve only just started thinking about how to design the algorithm to choose an azimuth angle elevation angle and projectile velocity to hit a target and then adjust them each turn

431606
mouse	keyboard
i haven t yet found a good cross-browser solution that supports both mouse clicks and keyboard activation of the checkboxes and doesn t fire too many events

parallels	bootcamp
if i want c# i stick to visual studio run it through parallels or bootcamp if you really want to use vs

431670
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
for ide i suggest eclipse tools for microsoft silverlight apparently it is windows-only at the moment you should use monodevelop or sharpdevelop or something like that

431681
parallels	bootcamp
without meaning to state the obvious and miss the point if you mean a mac computer rather than a mac os you could install bootcamp or use parallels to run windows on the mac and then use visual studio there are also free versions of visual studio

431740
mbunit	nunit
it has a resharper plugin that lets you run nunit mbunit row tests

431741
sharpmap	proj
sharpmap is open source proj written in c# and released under lgpl

431775
xslt	xquery
the xpath language is designed to be embedded in another language such as dom api xslt xquery ... and cannot be used standalone

431814
projectile	angle
for example if a shot falls short of the target you can try to get it closer by adjusting the elevation angle only adjusting the projectile velocity only or adjusting both of them together

431833
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko
i would like to instead do it myself and leverage firefox gecko and safari webkit to render the image

431833
webkit	gecko
is there a c# project that hooks into gecko and or webkit to create images of a loaded web page

431833
webkit	gecko
my project is called webpreview and it uses the webbrowser control from the .net framework but since that can be a bit outdated the rendered screenshots will not look as accurate as a recent gecko or webkit build

431847
jar	war
building the war file isn t any different once you have done ivy retrieve as the jar files required will be local to the project just use the ant war task to create the war as normal

431875
postgresql	mysql
ideally it would support mssql 05 08 mysql oracle postgresql db2 out of the box

431877
inline	inlining
inlining is the responsibility of the clr jit and there are some conditions as to when a function is inline

431877
getter	setter
as you will probably find out 32 bytes is not very much in terms of code it is suitable for quick and small if-else condition testing property getter setter

432018
firefox	safari
this works for all the major browsers safari firefox ie

432027
post	get
on the other hand if you can get away with using post json is a really good way to pass this kind of information back and forth

432069
perforce	cvs
xcode only supports subversion perforce and cvs

432069
bazaar	git
however there are also distributed version control systems out there such as mercurial bazaar and git

432079
free	malloc
believe it or not it can be faster than using malloc and free

432083
accessor	properties	subclass	accessor
you use key-value coding or if you implement a subclass dot syntax or accessor methods to set those properties

432134
distance	polygons
with it comes a large collection of polygons line and distance calculation tools that can even take into account the curvature of the earth s surface if need be

432137
rss	feed
as an example of what revolutiontrigger said i most often use http auth on rss feed for sites that use form-based auth simply because many rss readers can do http auth but can t do form-based auth

432139
folder	dir
in order to get around this you have to move the build dir to another location so that xcode won t try to import it or manually add the discrete folder of a project one by one

432143
inherited	properties
how can i re-organize my class structure so that circle and square can share certain properties with each other but specialcircle and specialsquare can still inherited from shape and also inherited modified functionality from special

432144
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but it fails in ie on the following line

432158
jquery	scriptaculous
there s jquery prototype scriptaculous mootools dojo and many others

432214
equals	gethashcode
don t forget that if you do override equals you really should override gethashcode also or you may get unexpected results if you are using your objects in a dictionary for example

432303
lisp	scheme
they adopt scheme which is a variant of lisp as the programming language

432306
lisp	scheme
if you do choose a lisp variant i recommend scheme

432309
haskell	ocaml	erlang	lisp	erlang	ocaml
if you start with common lisp or ocaml or erlang or especially haskell you will most likely get scared and you will feel lost for different reasons

432316
pull	push
for promotion to production we have another script that pull down all the production data and then runs rsync to push up changes

432323
post	get
the easiest solution is sending data using post instead of get

432355
goto	break
you need some statement either break or goto

432366
goto	break
however if you omit the break you must replace it with another other control transfer goto case 1

432380
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
you ll need a delegate data-source class for your picker view - something that implements the protocols uipickerviewdelegate and uipickerviewdatasource

432380
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
the class should have three instance variables - an nsarray soundarr to contain the sounds an nstimer timer to provide a delay after selection before the sound plays more on that below and an avaudioplayer audioplayer to play the selected sound for which you ll need to import the avfoundation - it s only available in 2.2 as sound playback used to be a lot more complicated

432463
width	height
currently i do this by rendering the scene to a texture that is twice the width and height of the screen

432470
put	get
since you can accept 2-3 seconds variation you could just put all your clients into long-lived comet-style requests and just get the response from the server

432538
qthread	qobject
if each allocation is an instance of qobject why don t you just parent it to the current qthread object

432567

debugging with gdb any c++ code that uses stl boost is still a nightmare

432567
boost	stl
use checked debug stl boost library such as stlport

432575
erlang	lisp
i hop you chose erlang or lisp

432575
erlang	lisp
where should i go after erlang lisp and forth please leave a comment

432642
lisp	scheme
from what i know scheme is a simplified version of lisp think of it as lisp but with only the bare essentials

432643

432749
apache	lighttpd
it is supported by lighttpd and apache with a plugin

432759
hash	salt
well a cryptographic hash shouldn t compromise security as long as it is salt and has reasonable complexity

432796
cfstring	nsstring
everyone has mentioned componentsseparatedbystring but you can also use cfstringtokenizer remember that an nsstring and cfstring are interchangeable which will tokenize natural languages too like chinese japanese which don t split words on spaces

432799
hash	md5
the main difference between this and basic is that digest is a challenge-response authentication whereas the client has to fulfill a challenge on every request and the response is just a md5 hash

432805
folder	directory
if your files are not accessible by the web server because the path is not in your web serving directory htdocs then you can make a symbolic link symlink to that folder in your web serving directory to avoid passing all traffic trough php

432817
opera	google-chrome
it looks like in both opera and google-chrome the browser is treating the area outside the browser s initial viewport as part of the html tag but not part of the body

432841
getter	setter
whenever i make an immutable object it doesn t have any setter or getter only one parametrized constructor and all fields are public like this

432844
int	boolean
the xor operator on two boolean is logical xor unlike on int where it s bitwise

432846
post	get
checkboxes are inputs and will come up like text inputs in your get or post array you re more likely to use post for this

432849
photoshop	fireworks
i m interested in people s opinions on the pros and cons or downright hell no s on designing websites in the browser and moving away from photoshop fireworks etc

432862
google-chrome	firefox
use google-chrome or firefox

432885
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
it seems this is specific to firefox -- ie opera and google-chrome all throw exceptions for it

432919
google-chrome	firefox
i find that firefox and google-chrome work faster than ie

432979
spaces	delimiter
the default delimiter is spaces so you don t need to change this with a delims arg

433022
accessor	properties
we ve got our basic entity model and we want to add certain business-level semantics to the default data accessor navigation properties etc

433033
textview	imageview
for controls -- like text boxes textview or images imageview -- this will wrap the text or image being shown

433083
apache	lighttpd
what you need to do is configure your web server itself iis apache lighttpd whatever to direct requests to a specific script or resource

433109
invalidoperationexception	argumentnullexception	invalidoperationexception	argumentexception	argumentnullexception	argumentexception
i wouldn t make my own base classes to create a custom argumentexception argumentnullexception or invalidoperationexception

433116
multiplying	add
for each field in your object multiplying the current result by another prime number and add the hash of the field

433163
entity-relationship	diagram
as mentioned in another so question this programs has the capability to generate a simple entity-relationship diagram

433190
multiplying	add	multiplying	multiplication
so for example if say floating point add and multiplying instructions each have a throughput of 2 and a latency of 5 actually for multiplying it s a bit greater i think that means that adding a register to itself or multiplying it by itself will likely take two clock cycles since there are no other dependent values whereas adding it the result of a previous multiplication will take something like or a bit less than 2+5 clock cycles depending where you start finish timing and on all sorts of other things

433190
multiplying	add
during some of those clock cycles another add multiplying operation could be taking place so it s arguable how many cycles you actually attribute to the individual add mutliply instructions anyway...

433195
put	get
how does the cache know to invalidate the multiple-farm get when it sees the put go by

433195
put	get
how does the cache know to invalidate the single get when it sees the put go by

433203
subtract	add
how do i add subtract etc

433219
boost	stl
note that the difficult to inspect structures are not only stl boost but also from other libraries like qt kde

433254
keydown	keyup
when i was trying to tackle the problem i thought about starting a counter on the keydown and resetting it on keyup

433257
division	multiplication
multiplication and bit-shifing should be faster than division but probably are not precise enough

superclass	subclassing
i couldnt able to mock the protected varibale defined in the superclass.i could able to mock the protected method in superclass but couldnt to mock the protected variable in to the subclassing wherein am writing the testcase for subclassing please if anybody out there has any soluton for it .please reply

profiling	instrumentation
so if you re developing a resource intensive application you should be using profiling tools specific to each os you re targeting like for example instrumentation on os x and of course test the performance in each browser

433371
width	height
maths101 question - does anyone know how to calculate an ellipse width height that will enclose a given rectangle

433371
width	height
obviously there is no single ellipse - i m after an algorithm that will give me various width height combinations - or perhaps the smallest area of ellipse

433371
width	height
it s for a gui so an aesthetically pleasing ratio of height width is what i m looking for

433394
width	height
2 put a div with a pre-set height and change the width according to the value you want it to display

433408
vcard	vcf
pycocuma appears to have a vcf parser built into it and it ll generate vcard output

433422
onmousemove	onmouseover
it would be expensive to do serious programming on every onmousemove instance so you might find it better to create several zones around the page and poll for a onmouseover event

433426
cos	sqrt
x cos theta sqrt 2 rect.width + x.center

433426
sin	sqrt
y sin theta sqrt 2 rect.height + y.center

433494
profiling	benchmarking
if it s just used to check security once per request and cache various things i can t see how it s likely to be significant - but that s why you should profiling and benchmarking your app

433543
width	height
the site has 2 layout types vertical height width ang horizontal width height

433573
post	get
you can treat it the same as any regular get or post request

433573
post	get
without knowing any of the background i can t give a definitive answer on whether i would choose it but in general there is no reason not to use it just apply the same security you would use for http get and post requests like in regular form submissions

433594
tstringlist	tlist
if your array is no longer static you might want to consider using a tlist a tstringlist or one of the many container classes in the contnrs unit

433606
post	get
it has the same security risks as a regulat get and post it is just another format to send the data back and forth

433628
min	max
the idea of the program is that i should use functions to read an array of 10 elements then get the average of the elements then get the the max and min

433628
min	max
i ve got the max and min right but the average is showing weird stuff

433642
min	max
also your max and min functions have a loop like this

433651
multiplying	addition
you ve got some problems with counting starting with zero and multiplying before addition rules

433704
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu and anything else that s based on debian you do that like this

433712
calloc	malloc
try setting the nodes child property to null c doesn t automagically zero out memory so it looks like your may have garbage in child or your could use calloc instead of malloc

433715
int	chars
the x format specifier by itself says that the argument is an int and since the number is negative printf requires eight chars to show all four non-zero bytes of the int -sized value

433715
int	chars
now then you re only passing a chars so bare x tells the function to use the full int that got passed instead â due to default argument promotion for .

433722
debian	linux
ideally the tool would run on debian linux but windows os x is fine if necessary

433723
getter	setter
when you put logic in your setter and getter you make it harder to understand whats going on since many people will never look at its implementation

433723
getter	setter
if you disagree i urge you to look at every setter and getter implementation before you use it just to check if its not just a bean

433725
int	chars
what you see is the sign preserving conversion from chars to int

433725
int	chars
promoting such a chars to an int will preserve the sign and the int will be negative too

433725
int	chars
note that even if you don t put a int explicitly the compiler will automatically promote the chars to an int when passing to printf

433733
rpm	yum
source rpms also exist but how to get them depends on the high-level package manager used on top of rpm yum urpmi apt-get4 for rpm ...

433739
getter	setter
you keep the internal values in one measurement system but you convert from all others in the setter and convert back in the getter

433748
metaclass	subclassing
you can create a common base class that using metaclass logic enforces the convention that only variables that are declared when the subclassing is declared can later be set

433761
listadapter	listactivity
how do you implement a context menu triggered by a long click or tap on a listactivity that is using the built in layouts and a listadapter

433776
freebsd	linux
see for example the byteorder 3 manual page on a freebsd or linux system

433788
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
we have a cruisecontrol.net server running various antunit mbunit and nunit tests via ant

433788
mbunit	nunit
this works however mbunit outputs the tests in a different xml format than nunit and antunit

433788
mbunit	nunit
for example nunit seems to use testcase to signify a test result whereas mbunit uses run among other things

433788
mbunit	nunit
does anyone know how to transform the mbunit output into nunit compatible format xml that we can then merge together to produce a full set of test reports by applying the nunit unittests.xsl

433821
superclass	subclassing
while javascript tends to allow anything and maybe such an example could be considered normal i don t really know in python this is mostly a negative byproduct of omission of type declaration which can help speeding up development - if you at some point change your mind on the type of a variable fixing type declarations can take more time than the fixes to actual code in some cases including the renaming of a type but also cases where you use a different type with some similar methods and no superclass subclassing relationship

433829
post	get
in regards to the custom skin there s a blog post from nina meiers that goes into a bit of detail on how to get a legacy skin to work in dnn 5

433895
int	chars
that is it appears that c chars literals are actually int

433915
int	chars
what the code did was to put the read chars into an int then test for eof then convert to a chars if it wasn t

433915
int	chars
i realize this doesn t exactly answer your question but it would make some sense for the rest of the chars literals to be sizeof int if the eof literal was

433926
inherited	properties
they all inherited from an abstract base class so i could use reflection to map the properties but i m wondering if there s a better way

433957
int	chars
which suggests that a chars is 8 bits like you suspect but a chars literal is an int

433959
puts	gets
a deep copy really gets the actuall values and puts them in a new field of the new object whilst a shallow copy only copies the pointers

433965
int	chars
protected.cpp in function â int main int chars â

433988
int	chars
impossible to use a chars value without it being promoted to int first

433988
int	chars
so making chars constant int in the first place eliminated that step

433998
int	chars
i don t know the specific reasons why a chars literal in c is of type int

433998
int	chars
having a chars literal being an int would make that impossible

433998
int	chars
note that in c++ literals having more than one chars still have type int although their value is implementation defined

433998
int	chars
so ab has type int while a has type chars

434012
put	get
thats why i prefer open apps this way you get more open people to whom yo can actually talk ask then questions propose new ideeas that actually gets implemented or at least put on an open todo-list thus you get some kind of evolution

434027
implements	extends
basically you want to use a meta tag here with attribute extends for a common base class or implements for a common base interface

434046
move	drag
drag selection - move text

434047
int	chars
edit just to be sure i checked my copy of expert c programming deep secrets and i confirmed that a chars literal does not start with a type int

434047
int	chars
it is initially of type chars but when it is used in an expression it is promoted to an int

434047
int	chars
chars literals have type int and

434047
int	chars
particular chars and short become int

434060
int	chars
i haven t seen a rationale for it c chars literals being int types but here s something stroustrup had to say about it from design and evolution 11.2.1 - fine-grain resolution

434060
int	chars
in c the type of a chars literal such as a is int

434062
int	chars
this is only tangential to the language spec but in hardware the cpu usually only has one register size -- 32 bits let s say -- and so whenever it actually works on a chars by adding subtracting or comparing it there is an implicit conversion to int when it is loaded into the register

434062
int	chars
the compiler takes care of properly masking and shifting the number after each operation so that if you add say 2 to unsigned chars 254 it ll wrap around to 0 instead of 256 but inside the silicon it is really an int until you save it back to memory

434075
jpql	hql
don t write sql if you can help it use hql or jpql is on java ee whenever possible

434079
erd	entity-relationship	erd	diagram	entity-relationship	diagram
also you should generate entity-relationship diagram which are useful additions to database documentation though erd s don t tell the whole story either

434085
memset	malloc
many of the standard c library fwrite memset malloc functions have direct equivalents in the windows api writefile fillmemory zeromemory globalalloc

434102
ant	maven
well it s much more verbose then ant but pure maven

434171
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
for example if you have a uiviewcontroller and add a uinavigationcontroller as subview you must add this code to the uiviewcontroller if you want viewwillappear animated to be called when uinavigationcontroller.view appears

434203
vsto	add-in
using vsto i could build an add-in which could be used to edit the application where i would convert to and from docx

434277
post	get
here is why suppose you have a model that does handle your requests get or post

434277
post	get
now that you accept more than simple get post json or xml your model will have to distinguish between each request type and know how to parse them

434278
debian-based	linux
pdftk is included in debian-based linux distributions and perhaps others as well

434286
xcodebuild	xcodeproj
i know xcodebuild install -configuration can compile our xcodeproj from terminal without launching from xcode however the compilation files are under ios but not in the iphone simulator

434292
min	max
also remove the border from the window and remove the min max close buttons so you do not have any chrome showing

434351
hide	show
i m not familiar with the flickr method you reference above but generally the approach to these sorts of things is that you show the gif before you make the call and then hide it when the call completes

434377
gif	png
first - go here and create a spinning gif or png -

434413
stdout	stderr	system.in	system.out
i would guess that the reason is to be backwards-compatible with posix c c++ standard i o in which stdin stdout and stderr the c c++ equivalent of system.in system.out and system.err respectively are byte streams

434424
mouseup	mousedown
imagine a custom view where the mousedown mousedrag and mouseup methods are overriden so the user can drag a point nsrect on the screen

434458
actionscript	mxml
there are two different compilers one that is used for compiling actionscript code to avm bytecode and another mxmlc that compiles mxml files into actionscript code which is then in turn compiled by the first compiler

434526
jlabel	jseparator
for this reason it is a good practice check jgoodies on the web for more details in swing guis to not use titledborders but rather separate groups of components in a jpanel by a jlabel followed by a horizontal jseparator

434529
typedef	struct
for example typedef extern and function prototypes are all declarations while things like struct int and function bodies are definitions

434564
division	multiplication
multiplication and division would accumulate that error faster but it would still take quite a while

434565
ironruby	ironpython
i m not sure which is more mature at present between ironpython and ironruby but both are now supported by microsoft people

434584
bazaar	git
a distributed decentralized version control system solution will suit your needs git bazaar mercurial darcs.

434666
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
i don t understand why ilist implements ienumerable taking in consideration that ilist implements icollection that implements ienumerable also

434681
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
basic addition subtraction multiplication and division are the first things that come to mind

434691
ienumerable	ilist
ilist only implements ienumerable by associaton

434691
ienumerable	icollection
it implements ienumerable precisely because it inherits icollection which is ienumerable

434691
ienumerable	ilist
in the same way ilist is ienumerable

434694
google-chrome	firefox
when run it logs hidden on firefox but visible on google-chrome

434697
ienumerable	icollection
i assume you want to know why it declares that it implements icollection as well as ienumerable when the first implies the second

434697
ienumerable	icollection
i suspect the main reason is clarity it means people don t need to look back to icollection to check that that already extends ienumerable

434703
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
on firefox and safari it works properly but just doesn t work at all in ie and opera

434711
websphere	ibm
websphere app server ah ibm bless their little hearts has changed what it does

434740
subtract	add
you may also choose to store tenths of a cent ie 4090 or some other constant fractional precision. you will be able to add and subtract an infinite number of times without losing precision

434753
disk	ram
if you have just hit your ram limit you ll be probably able to hear the disk working and a system activity monitor will tell you that

434771
post	get
this just sets up a get but you can do a post with file_get_contents as well

434786
boost	stl
as others have already suggested life is much easier if you use a container -- especially an stl container -- and smart pointers -- which for now means pointers out of boost

434805
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
if you were to open the code in resharper it would indicate that the ienumerable interface declaration on ilist wasn t required as it is already specified via icollection

some other answers suggesting using parseint inside the function to convert the octal value to decimal

434962
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i get security exception when using system.net.webclient to do http requests which is due to the fact that crossdomain.xml or clientaccesspolicy.xml on the target server are either missing or are too restrictive

434983
profiling	debugging
the commercial oxygen xml editor has a feature for profiling and debugging xslt files

435000
put	get
higher values decrease the space overhead but increase the lookup cost reflected in most of the operations of the hashmap class including get and put

435082
folder	dir
added this is how the source control structure looks the deployed app would just have the config dir with no sub folder or course

435098
min	max
i could write a set of classes each representing a single validation regexvalidation with its pattern property lengthvalidation with it s min and max and so on

435098
min	max
they will have a dictionary that maps arguments names to their values so that lengthvalidation will have items with keys max and min and regexvalidation will have items with keys pattern and so on

435128
ready	each
additionally you need each validator object to return the cleaned ready for use by the database value

435131
profiler	gprof
- some profiler if you can get it to work i ve done profiling with netbeans gprof even oprofile but i was never able to make it work with eclipse - it s anyway more complicated to do profiling than in netbeans

435131
ubuntu	linux
- maybe on linux i d like rpms for gcj-compiled versions of eclipse like ubuntu and redhat provide

435182
interpreted-language	forth
if you want a very fast interpreted-language look at forth

435233
innodb	myisam
if you are on myisam switching to innodb if you can - it has no full text indexing opens up more options for this sort of thing as it supports the transactional features and row level locking

435336
cvs	svn
an important reason to use svn rather than cvs is svn supports binary diffs

435382
entity-relationship	diagram
as bill said you certainly need an entity-relationship diagram

435410
button	checkbox
another alternative would be to have a checkbox whose value is the id of the member being approved that the admin can select for each member to be approved and a similar one for reject and one each approve reject button for the entire form

435420
children	parent
i m using an orm sqlalchemy but my question is quite implementation-agnostic to model a many-to-many relationship between a parent class and its children

435427
junit	testng
my advice is simply ditch junit and use testng

435427
junit	testng
once you get used to testng junit looks like stone age

435564
gridview	objectdatasource	gridview	sqldatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource
in principle you need to configure the sorting at the data source whether its an objectdatasource or a sqldatasource not at the gridview

435579
udp	tcp
they are checking the datagramsocket as well to check if the port is avaliable in udp and tcp

435605
boost	stl
maybe not the sort of tip you were looking for but i have to say that my experience after a few years of moving from c++ stl to c++ boost stl is that i now spend a lot less time in gdb than i used to

435685
nsbezierpath	nsimage
the view s drawrect method draws some content nsimage s nsbezierpath s and nsstring s on the view but leaves parts of it transparent

435685
mouseup	mousedown
clicking on the regions of the view that have been drawn on invokes the usual mouse event handling methods mousedown and mouseup

435685
mousedown	mouseenter	mouseup	mouseenter	mouseup	mousedown
this appears to only add support for mouseenter mouseexited mousemoved and cursorupdate methods not mouseup and mousedown

435719
google-chrome	firefox
edit google-chrome and firefox do not have this issue

435799
min	max
i realize how to put values and expression in the max min and the gridline interval fields although its more of a question what expressions i should put there

435831
vb.net	vb6
if costs are a constraint you could try this there is a wizard in visual studio that will attempt to upgrade vb6 to vb.net

435842
vb.net	vb6
in case you were able to migrate it to vb6 you can use the code advisor to see how you can fix your project to be compatible to vb.net then you can migrate to vb.net in case it success you can use this tool to convert it to c# or the reflector

435948
vb.net	vb6
there are applications out there that do a rather good job migrating from vb6 to vb.net

435949
hide	show
first you can use tree.setrootvisible true to show the root node or tree.setrootvisible false to hide it

435954
mbunit	mstest
mbunit and mstest have timeout attribute

435965
nsstring	nsobject
for example cocoa defines things like nsstring and nsobject

435999
folder	directory
your newly created jar should be in your project directory s dist folder

436032
lisp	smalltalk
you can write a complete high performance os in a high level language like lisp or smalltalk with only a few minor parts in c

436064
rss	feed
for example is it possible to update the url of the rss feed in the following snippet

436076
awt	swing
swing or awt which are the java ui toolkits both handle events - check out the official swing event tutorial for examples

436093
rss	feed
different modes of presentation in web apps are increasingly popular these days rss atom feed json or ajax responses wml for handheld devices etc

436094
bash	tcsh	jline	readline
people familiar with the readline editline capabilities for modern shells such as bash and tcsh will find most of the command editing features of jline to be familiar

436147
getter	setter
you can still have private variables but if you want methods defined on the prototype to have access to them you should define getter and setter on the this object which the prototype methods along with everything else will have access to

436154
firefox	safari
it works on safari but in firefox i just get an almost-empty page with nothing but the following text

436169
pop-up	dialog
i don t think enabling anonymous access would make sense here since i want access to the website to be password protected pop-up username password dialog when you first navigate to the url

436206
google-chrome	safari
webkit has a few bugs that prevent our software from running in this browser and safari google-chrome etc

436206
google-chrome	safari
most bugs are related to standard compliance so i expect safari and google-chrome to copy the patches once webkit accepts them

436211
int	double
value types int double object

436302
mbunit	nunit	fitnesse	mbunit
it seems like fitnesse is yet another testing framework like nunit or mbunit or any of the others because you define inputs and outputs that you want to see but it seems to be aimed at testing the application as a whole rather than as units

436322
post	get
so if you have 80 blog post that s 1 query to get the list of blog post then 80 queries to get the comments for each of them

436346
post	get
one query to select the post ids you want then another to get all the comments for that list of post ids

436397
free	malloc
allocate with malloc a sufficient buffer which then becomes your problem to free

436400
boost	stl
i am a quite capable gdb user but stl and boost easily crush my debugging skills

436408
mbunit	nunit	fitnesse	mbunit
the difference between nunit mbunit and fitnesse is that nunit mbunit are intended to be used for unit tests while fitnesse is for acceptance tests

436413
hide	show	portrait	landscape
how can i hide the navigation bar when the user puts the iphone in landscape orientation and have it show again on portrait view

436417
firefox	safari
this is currently supported in ie safari and firefox 3.1 alpha

436421
vmware	virtualbox
what s your choice vmware virtualbox or ms virtual pc server

436438
vb.net	vb6
theoretically you could convert vb5 to vb6 and then vb6 to vb.net and then vb.net to c# but that just sounds crazy to me as i type it

436440
vmware	esx
we have both the full blown esx for virtual servers and the vmware workstations for development testing

436442
fink	macports
i wouldn t use macports or fink for any critical apps

436442
fink	macports
perhaps it s just me but i ve had about a 50-50 success rate in installing apps using macports and fink

436494
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
i ve used vmware when the company would pay for it vmware server when the company would not virtualbox because it s free decent and supports snapshots parallels on the mac which i bought and xen

436503
google-chrome	firefox
currently there s somewhat of an arms race between google-chrome firefox and webkit s javascript interpreters which has really improved the speed situation with javascript

436513
int	chars
the code below compiles but has different behavior for the chars type than for the int types

436535
division	multiplication
can be fast or it can be awfully slow even if division is done entirely in hardware if it is done using a div instruction this instruction is about 3 to 4 times slower than a multiplication on modern cpus

436535
integer	unsigned
the code below assumes that you want to divide an unsigned 32-bit integer by three and that you c compiler knows about 64 bit integer numbers note even on a 32 bit cpu architecture most c compilers can handle 64 bit integers just fine

436535
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division	division	multiplication
in a 64 bit application this code will be a lot faster than in a 32 bit application in a 32 bit application multiplying two 64 bit numbers take 3 multiplication and 3 additions on 32 bit values - however it might be still faster than a division on a 32 bit machine

436535
division	multiplication
you always need to know the magic number here 0xaaaaaaab and the correct operations after the multiplication shifts and or additions in most cases and both is different depending on the number you want to divide by and both take too much cpu time to calculate them on the fly that would be slower than hardware division

436604
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
it could be any number of things but i suggest you start with your viewwillappear and viewdidappear methods as well as viewwilldisappear and viewdiddisappear

436628
int	chars
while most integral types like short and int default to being signed chars does not have a default signage in c++

436628
int	chars
it s a common mistake that c++ programmers run into when they use chars as an 8 bit int type

436655
mouseover	mouseout
i think the best approach would be to leave the hover behavior as a fall-back for non-javascript users and then use jquery to create mouseover and mouseout event handlers to create a different effect for javascript-enabled users

436666
firefox	safari
while this works like a dream for us in firefox and safari it explodes with delight in ie 6 and ie7 with the error object doesn t support this property or method

436690
public	protected
perhaps you haven t marked your public private protected access correctly

436742
implements	extends
given a class bar that extends class foo which implements interface deedum

436742
accessor	properties	inherited	properties
in other words bar doesn t inherited accessor from foo and can t override properties

436742
inherited	properties
does that mean that you can t inherited any methods or properties

436747
hide	show
so it can check a condition and then decide to show or hide a section

436758
inherited	subclassing
you are hiding the inherited variables with ones defined in the subclassing

436802
int	chars
the type signed chars was introduced to make available a one-byte signed int type on those systems which implement plain chars as unsigned

436823
punctuation	words
they are used for respectively hyphenation and joining words indicating a range punctuation and a mathematical symbol

436912
paradox	bde
you can change the default location of the .net file if you go into the bde administrator in the control panel and go into configuration - drivers - native - paradox and change the path to somewhere that is writable my documents for example

436942
bazaar	git
git mercurial and bazaar are three options

436945
width	margin
on column2 setting a left margin of the width of the image + the amount of separation you want for example 160 should work but you can play with it then making the width of the column2 100 of the remaining width should prevent your overlap

436996
versioning	upgrade
why do you want to do this and why don t you want to upgrade the delphi versioning

437024
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
it s free and you can install ubuntu or debian linux on the simulated arm core

437050
mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
i m most comfortable with mbunit for unit testing and cruisecontrol.net for ci so right now they are the front runners

437075
mouseleave	mouseenter
essentially i m going to create the linklabel from a textblock and handle mouseenter mouseleave and mouseleftbuttonup events

437160
django	web2py	pylons	web2py
has anyone used any of these pylons web2py django with ironpython

437168
queue	fifo
should fifo queue be synchronized if there is only one reader and one writer

437177
queue	fifo
yes if the reader and writer interact with the fifo queue from different threads

437194
width	height
if you are okay with horizontal vertical blinds just append a bunch of divs and animate the width height

437258
hex	binary
looks like it converts the binary source of clr stored procs as some kind of hex encoded text

437265
getter	setter
if adding a setter and getter to a class exposes information not meant to be exposed you should consider friends if you can t find your design being faulty using friend is valid

437265
getter	setter
if you can add a setter and getter without that being destructive to the interface then you should avoid making other classes friends

437273
button	checkbox
imagine that b is a mediator class and a and c are components that need to be managed do you really think it makes sense that a button should need access to the implementation of a checkbox

437296
bazaar	git
what do folks here see as the relative strengths and weaknesses of git mercurial and bazaar

437296
perforce	svn
in considering each of them with one another and against version control systems like svn and perforce what issues should be considered

437296
perforce	svn
version control systems like subversion svn perforce or clearcase are centralized version control systems

437296
bazaar	git
git mercurial bazaar and also darcs monotone and bitkeeper are distributed version control systems

437296
bazaar	git
git has git-svn bazaar has bzr-svn and mercurial has hgsubversion extension

437296
bazaar	git
i know mercurial and bazaar only from their documentation various discussion on irc and mailing lists and blog posts and articles comparing various version control systems some of which are listed on gitcomparison page on git wiki

437301
cvs	rcs
if you have a backup of your repository the actual rcs files on the server on tape you could just restore that folder on the cvs server to the state it was before

437402
post	get
it s complicated to get right so see the instructions on using manifests from shawnfa s .net security blog for the .net 3.5 beta and post ga .net 3.5

437416
wtl	atl
or is wtl or atl the big thing

437416
wtl	atl
for vs 2008 it s vs + mfc atl wtl qt....confusing for me since i don t know much about them

437426
wtl	atl
you can use wtl atl win32 or any number of libraries to create apps without mfc

437464
adplus	cdb
adplus attaches the cdb debugger to a process in crash mode and will generate crash dumps for most exceptions the process generates

437467
versioning	upgrade
most server platforms iis or not are capable of being installed on a windows box for exactly this reason among others. in fact non-microsoft server platforms are usually less demanding about windows versioning and configuration because they don t have any stake in having the host upgrade to a more expensive license

437475
folder	directory
eclipse sets the working directory to the top-level project folder

437478
for-loop	loops
so for example if you have a loops instead of using a for-loop use a while loops make sure the scope of loops variable is at the form level

437481
hide	show
so you need to show hide it inside every dialog independently

437496
lisp	smalltalk
the upshot of being a library is that code contracts will work for any .net language c# vb.net f# ruby python javascript lisp smalltalk boo you name it

437530
binutils	bfd
bfd library does what you want and the kitchen sink which is the main component of several binutils tools

437580
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
i believe that calling tostring equals and gethashcode result in boxing if the structure does not override the methods

437631
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it displays them in safari os x firefox 3 windows and google-chrome windows ie displays all the divs in a big stack in the corner.

437722
executable	upx
i m not sure how to strip the executable but another thought is to compress it for example using upx which will decompress it and run it in place.

437763
int	chars
note however that if the function takes arguments that are subject to normal promotions in the absence of prototypes for example a function that takes a chars or short - both of which are converted to int

437794
serializable	deserialization
depending on your language of choice this might mean manually writing a serializable deserialization function from scratch

437808
ironruby	ironpython
other options i m looking at are python ironpython ruby ironruby powershell and maybe vb but i m not sure about the ease of implementation with vb

437830
int	chars
on most systems the address of the string will get pushed on the stack and then m as an int assuming it s an int short chars

437859
opera	safari
it also works for opera and safari too

437868
public	protected
further does the scope public protected private etc. of said method change the above answer 1

437874
apache	nginx
i need to do a rewrite with nginx from blah ... 3275 to id 3275 if the second file exists otherwise i want to hand it off to apache

437903
getter	setter
pointless testing testing the same basic case more than one way or testing things so trivial that they really do not need to be tested like auto-generated getter and setter

437912
pivot-table	crosstab
crosstab pivot-table workbench

437918
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
an aggregate-functions count max min sum avg has to run through all the entries in a column regardless

437927
post	put
on top of that i could really use some help detailing how to take the post data and put it in a cookie in php

437945
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
an aggregate-functions count max min sum avg has to run through all the entries in a columns being summed regardless.

437960
public	protected
checking parameter validity is clearly more important for all public functions than protected or private

437960
public	protected
i will often dispense with checking for certain private methods although you take the risk that someone maybe you makes then protected or public someday and you also skip the chance to catch a data inconsistency one step closer to the source

438057
quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	in-place
you can usually only get 2 of these at once - quicksort gets you 1 and 3 mergesort gets you 2 and 3 and an in-place mergesort gets you 1 and 2

438096
debian	linux
debian linux has a really awesome tool called pbuilder which creates an image of a freshly installed system and then attempts to build your code

438100
put	get
most of the articles i have read involving the industry suggest that someone with no professional experience looking to get break into gaming should put together a portfolio of small games you have written demonstrating your abilities

438112
jruby	mri
to do this i want to use rails on on mri - not jruby or rbj

438116
gridview	sqldatasource
the gridview is bound to a sqldatasource object

438136
width	height
here width alerts fine height alerts fine but offset alerts object object in firefox

438145
client-side	server-side
if you re using asp.net validation controls they have a client-side portion and a server-side portion

438145
client-side	server-side
the gist here is that asp.net validation controls can be set so they don t do anything client-side but they still provide validation server-side

438300
gridview	repeater
you will have much more control using a gridview object rather than a repeater and you will never have that kinda of problems because rendering the gridview will always came with the table tags

438320
jobs	cron
this will allow you to schedule jobs in a cron like fashion

438381
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i ve tried doing this in viewdidload viewwillappear and viewdidappear with no success

438454
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
for firefox there is the firebug extension safari webkit has web inspector opera has dragonfly and for the internet explorer there is the internet explorer developer toolbar

438461
versioning	upgrade
to make matters worse because of contractual limitations it is not always possible to upgrade the clients to the latest and greatest so we must branch fix test and release on the versioning they currently have yielding yet another versioning number

438463
pop-up	dialog
my problem here is i need joptionpane dialog to pop-up on time according to what i set but problem here is when i minimize it the dialog will pop-up but not in the top of windows when other application like explorer firefox is running anyone know how to pop-up the dialog box on top of windows no matter what application is running

438509
post	get
this won t help in the short term but voting on the ms connect post for this issue may get things changed in the future

438526
vmware	virtualbox
i would suggest creating a virtual machine in vmware virtualbox whatever with these specifications in terms of ram and diskspace and then do some experiments

438566
ssl	https
one of the sites has an ssl certificate installed and was running fine on https

438566
ssl	https
the problem i have is that when i publish my app from vs2005 to the site with ssl the https urls stop working and i can only use http

438602
lisp	smalltalk
pps if i had to give up smalltalk lisp or haskell would be my second choice but both do not offer ide s which are anyway near to what i am used to these days

438604
getter	setter
is it synthesized or did you write your own setter and getter

438635
free	malloc
malloc and free and other memory-related functions are weak symbols which means that you can simply reimplement them and your versions will be used

438635
free	malloc
if you compile a shared library with malloc free and friends you re all set

438637
cvs	svn
hundson is easy to install and comes with a trac plugin svn cvs git plugins and a doxygen plugin and others for almost anything you can think of

438689
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
but as a programming excercise and seeing that you work with c++ you will need to override the global new and delete as well as malloc free and realloc

438689
realloc	malloc
you d think that only overriding new and delete would be enough but the std string and other classes are likely to use malloc and especially realloc

438695
equals	gethashcode
equals and gethashcode result in

438704
sorting	filtering
i wanted it to be fairly easy to use in other places and didn t feel like hardcoding the sorting and filtering into query expressions so i looked for a way to build the expressions dynamically and the best way to do this i found was with dynamic linq

438738
icomparable	compareto
or you can inherit schedule_payitem from icomparable and implement compareto and then just call m_equipmentlist.sort

438768
pascal	delphi
.inc - delphi pascal include files

438891
folder	directory
if your host is running apache you can secure folder using .htaccess on iis you can do the same through directory security

438953
width	height
i ll probably use swfobject to render the flash but i need the width and height

438976
fflush	gets
in addition if the output buffer gets too big it will fflush anyway

438986
lisp	smalltalk
1 smalltalk s rpn-like control flow by messages is like lisp - it s regular and cool but weirds people out

439040
openscenegraph	blender
i would start by looking at blender or the viewer tools from ogre openscenegraph and similar tools

439049
button	checkbox
my suggestion is to use a checkbox instead of a button

439076
button	checkbox
thus after the page is reinitialised the first click of the button will enable all checkbox

439076
button	checkbox
if i clicked this button with all checkbox checked i would expect it to behave consistently regardless of how those checkbox got to that state which should be irrelevant

439076
int	boolean
and asides from the fact that we re hopefully getting rid of this variable it ought to be a boolean rather than an int as it only has two states.

439120
pop-up	dialog
with basic authentication ie pop-up the usual pwd dialog but i want to skip this dialog

439125
cvs	svn
we are migrating from cvs to svn and as far as i can see svn does not have checkout hooks

439178
doc	rtf
doc -- pdf html txt rtf

439198
width	height
you can then get height width using

439215
doc	rtf
main goal is to output rtf document but doc would be nice too

439286
jquery	simplemodal
so i ve been able to get greasemonkey and jquery 1.2.6 to work together without issue but now i m wondering how to embed additional jquery plugins into my greasemonkey script such as eric martin s simplemodal plugin

439286
jquery	simplemodal
the following code gets jquery loaded but i m not sure how to get simplemodal loaded properly

439292
inherited	properties
you can add a onfailure option in the option list as the ajax.periodicalupdater inherited the properties of ajax.request

439313
width	height
perhaps you should also give the user the option to manually enter the width and height for each swf as well as the option to auto-detect from swf bytecode

439313
width	height
i mention this because swf files are mostly designed to be embedded in html and the stage size flash lingo for dimension of the swf is not always intended to be the embed size for that piece of content - some swfs are designed to automatically resize their contents to match how they are embedded within html so the actual stage width and height for these swfs might be irrelevant

439373
width	height
probably the simplest in a general sense is to get a reference to the image object and inspect the width and height properties

439463
post	get
how do i simply get get and post values with jquery

439492
vmware	virtualbox
i ve never run vmware in vmware but i ve run virtualpc inside virtualbox without problems so there s no fundamental reason it shouldn t work i suppose.

439553
google-chrome	firefox
note it works fine in firefox 3 and google-chrome

439573
int	chars
i can of course access each chars by index but how do i convert it into an int

439580
xlsx	xlsb
i need to support all excel formats from 97 through the present including the xlsx and xlsb formats

439588
width	height
for instance if you are passing the specification for a rectangle you can pass x y width and height or you could just pass a rectangle object that contains x y width and height

439625
dictionary	map
dictionary is hash based map is a tree based container

439634
getter	setter
this kind of smell since we are talking about refactoring this horrible word seems appropriate... might also be detected for objects that have a lot read any properties or getter setter

439639
hide	show
if what you are really looking for is a show hide effect you could use javascript to show the larger image if the user clicks on the smaller image

439681
mouse	keyboard
how can i use my keyboard to say i want a cursor so i can modify the text without clicking in it using my mouse

439686
children	parent
create my own children collection which will be given a reference back to the instance so it can handle setting the parent on the add

439744
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
however after trying it out it works successfully in firefox google-chrome and opera but fails in konqueror invalid date safari invalid date and ie nan

439777
vmware	esx
this question is probably better phrased how does running a java server on a hypervisor such as vmware esx affect the java heap

439798
postgresql	mysql
mysql or postgresql are more-or-less equivalent from within django

439811
uniq	grep
if you don t have the ability to use uniq and want to preserve order you can use grep to simulate that

439818
postgresql	mysql
i have never used postgresql myself but i think it s mostly a matter of taste whether you prefer it over mysql

439846
primes	square-root
you only ever need to check up to the square-root of the number if you find no factors by then then the number is primes

439858
put	get
you can t because there s no installer redist for the debug runtime and in fact the software license forbids distributing it so you d be breaking the eula even if you did get something put together

439875
rss	feed
my guess is that your best bet on that unless these guys have rss feed would be to scrape the html with a language that supports regular expressions

439877
imperative	declarative
is there an equivalent way that is less imperative and more declarative ie

439897
equals	gethashcode	equals	icomparable	icomparable	gethashcode
i also read at msdn that when you implement icomparable you ll need to override the equals method and gethashcode by extension i presume

439897
comparator	icomparer
2 when i implement icomparer i ll have to follow the same comparator guidelines

439925
icomparer	iequalitycomparer
implementing iequalitycomparer is like implementing icomparer - instead of comparing this object with another one the equals compare method takes two values to compare

439925
icomparer	iequalitycomparer
implementations of iequalitycomparer icomparer rarely override object.gethashcode or object.equals unless they want to allow comparisons of comparers - rarely useful

440029
ssl	https
if ssl isn t configured on your server that would explain why the url above works but the url visual studio is using same but with https wouldn t work

440037
sorting	filtering
i d like to essentially copy the range into some native class that supports filtering and sorting so i don t have to reinvent the wheel and use that class to return a result to calling code

440061
perl	tcl
i m running on a windows platform but i have access to sed awk perl python and tcl in addition to the usual windows tools

440098
postgresql	mysql
just to address the mysql vs postgresql issues - it shouldn t matter

440104
profiling	debugging
second the runtime profiling uses the debugging memory manager when it runs the child processes

440118
postgresql	mysql
as for postgresql versus mysql either works

440168
vbscript	vb6
look in the microsoft.visualbasic namespace to get access to the old vbscript vb6 functions

440204
int	double
for the answer to this question to be yes all int within the range of an int have to be exactly representable as double and floor must always return that exactly represented value

440222
int	double
since double uses 53 bits for mantissa it can store all 32-bit int s exactly

440239
int	double
in a compiler with a 64 bit double and a 64 bit int you ve got more problems of course...

440239
int	double
this shouldn t come as any surprise - there are more long values than double given the nan values and plenty of double aren t int so we can t expect every long to be exactly representable

440239
int	double
however all 32 bit int are representable as double

440262
put	get
of course i can put in a cast and get the compiler to shut up but i m wondering if i m doing something wrong here

440454
rss	feed
the other answers is absolutely correct i would recommend against giving your feed a title of rss if the format used is actually atom

440454
rss	feed
rss of course refers to an entirely separate format for feed and syndication and there s enough confusion among the general population about what the differences are that i wouldn t suggest feeding the fire

440497
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu and i d guess all other debian distros if not all linuces the file var log auth.log records successful and unsuccessful login attempts

440574
filtering	grouping
next we join a new reference to pages in on the section id and filtering by sortorder being the minimum from the section grouping

440584
rar	zip
if the data is still too big you can try using an external library executable to rar or 7zip the data as that will be half the size of the zip d copy

440588
translation	localization
all articles i ve read about localization of a winforms application assume that i already have all the strings translation

440667
png	ico
use this syntax for getting the ico or other items png xaml etc out of the assembly

440675

post	get	post	put	put	get
it really lowers the barrier to entry to the lowest common denominator allowing anything that can use basic http get and post also put and delete for the proper way of doing it to use the api

440778
jlabel	jseparator
another approach would be to create a custom component maybe with a horizontal boxlayout and add a jseparator a jlabel and another jseparator to it then add it to the menu

440802
public	protected
you can test protected methods from unit tests in another package by creating a subclass of the class under test that overrides the methods you want to test as public and having those overridden methods call the original methods with the super keyword

440822
client-side	server-side
telerik s unique advantage is that you can render both client-side and server-side meaning you can support clients that do not have javascript enabled

440855
width	height
i like to have buttons that have a fixed size ie if minimized maximized the button sizes dont change other controls may but not buttons width text in it and height 27 -30 pixels

440855
width	height
my co-worker prefers buttons that are only 20 pixels in height and the width is docked to vary as screen is resized

440874
pkcs#12	pfx
you have your certificate you only need to pack the certificate and the private key inside a pfx or pkcs#12 file that microsoft csp recognizes

440942
csv	tsv
another possiblitly is to export the html tables as a csv or tsv file but you would need to setup the formatting in your code

440945
width	height
i agree that some scenarios where localization of an app is needed requires you to take into consideration the button size.however that still does not call for buttons that stretch to 75 of your screen in width height remaining the same

440964
post	get
first theses post helped me get on the right track

441007
hide	show
i used div tags around the tables i wanted to show and hide like

441007
hide	show
this allows me to show or hide the tables without taking up blank space on the page when they are hidden but still rendering them so they ll work with validation controls that was my ultimate goal while hidden or showing

441057
public	protected
the point here is that junit forces me to make process public or at least protected or to put it in it s own utility class

441060
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
the forms are subclassing of various different classes and i really don t want to do make some kind of intermediate tform descendant which overrides the scaled properties - partly because i tried briefly to do this and discovered that setting the scaled properties to be false after the inherited create made no difference to the form and setting it before the inherited create caused an exception

441095
ssl	https
5 false in order to authenticate the service callers you don t necessarily need to have any transport-level security such as ssl https

441117
folder	dir
the solution i found for word templates is to read the install dir from hklm software microsft windows currentversion app paths winword.exe and install to the startup folder underneath the path contained in that registry key

441143
width	height
is there a way to scale a silverlight app to 100 width and 100 height of the browser frame that the application is embedded in

441165
vbulletin	phpbb
phpbb3 and vbulletin are good choices for php phpbb is open source but vbulletin is a private product unfortunately

441165
wordpress	joomla
some say wordpress is a good thing to look at i disagree but i expect joomla wouldn t be a bad place to look either

441168
postgresql	mysql
we re migrating mysql to postgresql

441193
jsf	seam
yet seam is still a new approach to developing jsf web applications

441213
width	height
using the rectangle class from an earlier answer as an example the constructor which takes parameters for x y height and width could factor x and y out into a point object allowing you to pass three parameters to the rectangle s constructor

441249
width	height
width 100 height 100 you might also want to set the d designwidth 640 and d designheight 480 that way it is easier to do layout in expression blend

441275
swt	swing
can i put a java control swt swing ... on a c# control

441340
put	get
i guess i wasn t anticipating this approach but as long as the pages can get spidered and ranked as more information is put in i m cool with it

441347
width	height
remove the width and height attributes from the root usercontrol

441384
equals	tostring
however i recommend you to both define the tostring as above and also an equals

441394
int	double
as well as this you have to remember when you code that x is an int or that y is a double

441406
vb6	vba
long answer vb6 which is what vba really is is pretty much a dead unsupported language last updated a decade back with an ide from the same period

441455
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the second comparisontype parameter of the indexof method specifies how to search for the value parameter using the current or invariant culture using a case-sensitive or case-insensitive search or using word or ordinal comparison rules see for the full documentation

441476
hash	md5
i think about it and found a solution i ll md5 all books strings and save the hash books strings

441487
min	max
the max and min memory requirements are set in the startup script are they not

441501
spaces	delimiter
if that isn t possible but you know that there s a spaces between the date and the time then you could again import as text and parse the date from the time using the spaces as your delimiter and then process the time field

441526
trie	tree
a suffix tree is a type of trie mentioned by divo

441554
int	double	int	boolean
int double boolean and other primitive types do get allocated on the stack

441554
elf	coff
the c++ standard has some language about a similar technique but the implementation is left up to the binary format elf a.out coff pe etc.

441554
int	double
the standard expects constants that are integral data types bool int long etc. or c-style strings to be actually kept in a constant part of the binary while other constant data double floats classes might be stored as a variable along with a flag saying that the variable is not modifiable it s also acceptable to store them with integral and c-style string constants but many binary formats don t make this an option

441631
google-chrome	firefox
tested it on google-chrome firefox 3 ie 7 and ie 6 and it s working

441642
cvs	svn
one more thing on the off chance it actually works if there is a cvs to svn utility use it i am assuming such a utility would pull deleted files from the cvs attic and if it saves each moment in time as a project level checkpoint since svn does that unlike cvs use svn to fetch the right moment in time

441676
inherited	properties
the inherited form does not honor the anchor properties of the ok and cancel buttons

441676
width	height
4- increase in the designer the second form s height or width

441692
getter	setter
however this leads to a rather anemic domain the user class is nothing but getter setter

441707
getter	setter
however this leads to a rather anemic domain the user class is nothing but getter setter

441752
inherited	properties
make sure that the inherited form isn t overriding some properties in the designer..

441775
post	get
get post or a cookie

441792
google-chrome	firefox
client uas are diverse ie5.5 - 7 firefox 3.0.5 iphone google-chrome

441809
nunit	mstest
mstest is essentially nunit slightly reworked with a few new features such as assembly setup and teardown not just fixture and test level and missing some of the best bits such as the new 2.4 constraint syntax

441816
mouse	keyboard
edit when i specified user interface techniques i left it open to both using existing hardware mouse keyboard and some other things like multi-touch gesture recognition augmented reality see hitlabnz for some great examples

441837
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
for each malloc or calloc there should be exactly one free

441861
getter	setter
i d also advise you to keep the getter and setter as restricted in scope as possible to reduce coupling

441930
mockups	prototyping
pencil is built for the purpose of providing a free and open-source gui prototyping tool that people can easily install and use to create mockups in popular desktop platforms

441935
getter	setter
recently i read about someone who got an assignment to write a bunch of setter and getter -- in a better language this would be a job for its metaprogramming facilities

441936
post	get
i was going to write a blog post about it i may as well get started here

441936
screens	tablet
there are more alternatives than just a mouse or a touch screens or a tablet

441949
codeigniter	cakephp
have been studying testing some php frameworks codeigniter symfony and cakephp

441950
hash	md5
you should verify that your md5 hash is correct by also comparing the string that was used to generate the hash so you don t have any false positives

441950
hash	md5
although an md5 sort of hash is fast the techniques presented in the other answers should be considered as well to find the best benefit cost balance for your circumstance

441996
iboutlet	ibaction
in your controller s header file make sure you are using iboutlet on your controls and ibaction on your methods that you wish to link to link up in interface builder

442151
gridview	repeater
i know that the asp.net repeater doesnt have a client side object model and we are stuck with improving the performance of many pages which have repeater gridview with the functionality of adding rows to them by server-side code

442151
gridview	repeater
we have used updatepanels to ajaxify the functionality adding the rows to the repeater gridview but the time it takes for the server trip and rendering back on the browser is not acceptable

442151
gridview	repeater
is there some way in which this can be done on the clientside to improve the performance of adding rows to the repeater gridview

442179
notepad++	jedit
i use notepad++ on my host for editing recent convert from jedit and with drive mapping in the vm software sun s virtualbox my dev webserver guest machine has no problem serving up the ever-changing source files

442181
postgresql	mysql
in-query variable modification doesn t work in postgresql for instance this will work in mysql but not in postgresql i haven t tested this recently maybe it does work now.

442181
postgresql	mysql
i also personally believe that postgresql has better handling of complex queries that include sub-selects and the like which most mysql users used to avoid

442181
postgresql	mysql
the way postgresql stores tables is utterly different than how mysql does

442252
nginx	lighttpd
nginx lighttpd

442298
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a new versioning we decided

442319
stdout	stderr
task will be stuck when you won t read what it is sending on stdout stderr

442343
ubuntu	linux
i have a django app that on the my comp ubuntu linux 8.10 works fine both through runserver and mod-python

442366
awt	swing
swing depends and uses awt as it s basis

442398
versioning	upgrade
the reason i left php is that they alter the api available functions between major versioning upgrade

442413
children	parent
a parent entity can have many children of the same record type

442468
free	malloc
and that allocated using malloc should be deleted using free

442491
hide	show
i found this out by observing the keyboard show hide events

442541
nspersistentdocument	nsdocument
remember nspersistentdocument is a subclass of nsdocument .

442586
folder	directory
since few days it creates a new visual studio 2008 directory in the same folder that my .sln file exists

442647
int	chars
now i had a discussion with someone about what happens when you convert the value -1 of type int to unsigned chars

442699
int	double
__declspec dllexport void __stdcall getdoubles int count double values

442733
superclass	subclassing
i though that a subclassing should be able replace a superclass without any modifications to the subclassing

442748
folder	directory
smarty for example employs this approach by placing the library one directory above the htdocs folder

442897
getter	setter
never put getter and setter for actual business values on your view

442921
putty	winscp
in addition i have jetty server maven winscp putty vim and a several other tools running quite happlily on my desktop

442935
hash	md5
md5 is a hash algorithm not an encryption algorithm in short u cant get back wat u hash u can only compare

442937
versioning	upgrade
since your question title asks if there are any disadvantages to hosting this at google the most obvious answer that springs to mind is they may upgrade their versioning at any time potentially breaking your code or causing unexpected side effects

442941
mouse	keyboard
moreover if i press alt+tab to switch to some other running app and then press alt+tab again to switch back to my app it responds to both mouse and keyboard input

442943
hash	salt
p.s. for security reasons you should consider not to save the password in plaintext but as hash value salt

442945
put	get
i did get them to put me and the other developers in a special collection so that we could block breaking changes if needed how could ie7 be a security update

442948
opera	firefox
what might i be able to change in the firefox settings so it is as fast as opera and explorer

442982
cassini	iis
for me closing the ide shutting the web site iis or cassini deleting all of my temporary asp.net files launching the ide and doing a full compile does the trick

443032
entity-relationship	diagram
or you could go even further and reverse engineer an entity-relationship model with an accompanying diagram

443032
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram were really useful to me when discussing the data with people who were neither programmers nor database experts

443032
entity-relationship	diagram
sometimes a few manual fixups to the entity-relationship model and entity-relationship diagram were necessary before it was a useful communication tool with stakeholders

443114
versioning	upgrade
contrary to what others have claimed they do not automatically upgrade you to the latest versioning

443209
post	get
get post

443219
post	get
just set post get variables while you are requesting the page

443253
hash	md5
on a page that automatically lists several small files 100-500kb that are contained in a specific folder is there a way using vbscript to automatically generate md5 hash of each file and display it on the page

443253
hash	md5
cliff notes can i generate an md5 hash of a file on the server machine

443276
onclick	onsubmit
i tried to attach a javascript function which uses ajax.updater to onsubmit on the form and onclick on the input but the form is still non-ajax submitted after the function ends so the whole page is replaced by the results

443310
superclass	subclassing
i d like for a subclassing of a certain superclass with certain constructor parameters to load an xml file containing information that i d then like to pass to the superconstructor

443361
fileoutputstream	filewriter
use a fileoutputstream rather than a filewriter

443397
cassini	iis
i d imagine the stack is immense though i would expect cassini to replicate iis as closely as possible

443397
cassini	iis
it s surprising that something that runs in vs wouldn t run in iis and i d even consider filing a vs bug with microsoft since it seems that the whole point of cassini is to replicate the functionality of iis and provide an ideal debugging environment since any web projects you write in vs will inherently be deployed against iis

443446
osql	powershell
you can automate script this easily using powershell or just .cmd files with calls to osql

443459
pop-up	dialog
error dialog will pop-up and add a

443503
post	get
manni s suggestion to eliminate post and head was indeed correct because i was looking for negative matches therefore should not restrict to get as when parsing for query strings

443639
inherited	properties
winforms have the autoscalemode properties which can be set to either font dpi inherited or none

443644
serializable	deserialization
even with a wrapper library you ll probably want to customize the serializable deserialization handling

443676
for-loop	loops
compare this to a for-loop or a while loops or an if

443695
put	get	children	parent
right now i m using a foreach loop to fetch the parent objects directly below rot put this means i cannot get the children

443704
free	malloc	free	strdup	strdup	malloc
it has functions like strdup that malloc the string and expect the programmer to call free on it

443777
width	height
i resize the inherited control increase height or width

443777
inherited	properties
the inherited control does not honor the anchor properties of the ok and cancel buttons

443777
width	height
4 - increase in the designer usercontrol1 s height or width

443828
inherited	properties
when you change the properties and compile that doesn t mean that s the default setting for classes that inherited your control

443846
superclass	subclassing
1 superclass logs with the subclassing s logger

443848
addition	multiplication
this is kind of like implementing multiplication in terms of addition or addition in terms of increment

443878
public	protected
if you do not explicitly write a method s access level public protected or private then it will default to package-private and these methods will probably been shown in content assist

443891
superclass	subclassing
try debugging an error where you see a message generated by the superclass class when the error is really being logged in the subclassing class

443908
superclass	subclassing
the major difference asides from the superclass logging with subclassing name of course is that you ll have one logger object per member of your class

443910
merb	ruby-on-rails
i ve been having a look at several mvc frameworks like ruby-on-rails merb cakephp codeignitier and similars...

443910
sorting	filtering
something like master-detail filtering by example paging sorting and similars

443920
firefox	safari
it looks like safari can t download some of the javascript files necessary to show these widgets strange that firefox can though

443974
put	get
its always a bad idea to put data from a get request directly into sql and there are many easy ways to prevent sql injection

443981
post	get
using the query parameters allows you to use an http get which is bookmarkable rather than a post

443991
rss	feed
i d like to parse rss feed and download podcasts on my readynas which is running 24 7 anyway

444001
hide	show
if the validate parameters function is successful you hide the error panel and show the report panel if not you do the opposite

444002
hash	md5
simple solution - for each file get its md5 hash by

444002
hash	md5
calculate the md5 hash with system.security.cryptography.md5cryptoserviceprovider

444020
getter	setter
here s a good rule of thumb if you have a variable that has nothing but a setter and a getter you have data not code--get it out of your class and place it into a collection or something

444020
getter	setter
having a variable with a setter and a getter just means that either you never do anything with it it s data or the code that manipulates it is in another class terrible oo design move the variable to the other class

444098
equals	tostring
not reflection but i had a look at generating the tostring method along with equals hashcode as a post-compilation step using bytecode manipulation

444185
cifs	smb
smb cifs

444189
mouseover	mouseout
look at the slidedown and slidetoggle functions and it would basically require you setting up hidden divs and then on the mouseover event you would slidetoggle your text out and the hidden image div in and on mouseout do the opposite

444217
getter	setter
this property is available to all javascript objects you create and allows you to add properties or functions to the object declaration so you had a object with 2 properties and later on you added 4 functions getter and setter

444217
getter	setter
in the example 2 you inline the declaration of these getter and setter in the object declaration so in the end they are the same

444217
getter	setter
this will give you the same object without getter and setter

444227
vtiger	orangehrm
so my experience has been that the open source web based tools are very good eg orangehrm weberp vtiger very useable and free and they do a perfectly good-enough job

444231
rss	feed
i am using django s rss capabilities to build an rss feed

444231
rss	feed
the of the rss feed items contains html markup

444231
rss	feed
it seems that django autoescapes special characters in rss feed or any xml for that matter no matter what regardless of whether you pass it through the safe filter or not the issue is discussed in this ticket

444260
binutils	newlib
the community and me have been updating the gcc and newlib to the latest stable versions and everything seems to work with the old binutils

444336
children	parent
from there select the node with children but no parent and iteratively build your tree from the top down

444370
subtract	add
i will have to add my viewstate value to the page total and somehow subtract overlapping totals

444422
post	get
can switch between get post easily

444462
stdout	stderr
try making a simple app that just spits out data to stdout and stderr and then make sure the app closes while you are still reading

444486
bmp	png
it works fine with png bmp and jpeg

444563
children	parent
parent and children

444579
pull	push
i am sure if you search the net you will find pull and push based parsers for json

444580
postgresql	mysql
note the interval syntax varies slightly between databases and that s the one for postgresql so you might have to change it slightly for mysql

444589
range	minimum
you can call it on the minimum valid virtual address which can be obtained from getsysteminfo you can then use the size of the returned page range to determine the base address of the next page range for which to call virtualqueryex

444626
cvs	svn
see if you can persuade your manager or pm to use svn or cvs or git locally for a project and then get it to diffuse

444717
interbase	firebird
it took us years to convince our managers that everything would be okay if we moved away from using interbase a commercial relational db to it s opensource counterpart firebird

444721
cpu	processors
so along with recursion i d say it helps with learning how to balance cpu load across parallel processors

444731
jar	war
to deploy a war can i just copy the jar to catalina_home webapps

444733
put	get
there is a slight difference between remove get and put although my guess is that you have a threading issue

444738
prepare	execute
you also said you don t want to mess with perl did that include a prepare perl-script that he just needs to execute

444775
implements	extends
extends the eventdispatcher class or implements the ieventdispatcher interface from the flash.events package

444814
hex	binary
as greg said you can use struct if you are dealing with binary values but if you just have a hex number but in byte format you might want to just convert it like

444951
bash	zsh
i d like to set up zsh so it behaves similarly to bash

444959
rss	feed
this is huge for reading docs however i have a third party rss feed reader that does not have this functionality and i always attempt to use it first before remembering that it doesn t exist in this app

444983
vmware	virtualbox
if you re running on windows or linux vmware server mentioned by another poster and virtualbox should both do what you want and they re both free

444984
webkit	gecko
step 1- use a javascript library so you can have the code be as cross browser as possible - otherwise you have to cater to two different event models between internet explorer and gecko webkit based browsers

445001
postgresql	mysql
this is legal sql syntax supported for example by microsoft sql server postgresql and sqlite but not by oracle ibm db2 or mysql

445004
client-side	server-side
generally the best experience i ve had of this was a largish company with very defined groups of developers including the design team who produced the gfx the apps team who did the vast bulk of server-side coding and app architecture and the ue user experience team who sewed the two together producing xslt jsp html markup in general and the css and js for the client-side

445022
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
the problem is that asp.net asp.net-mvc html.actionlink and similar functions generates urls with www.domain.com subfolder

445042
ready	each
if you use the gd library you can reuse the same image resource for each step and then just write it to file when you re ready re-use the same image resource to create the thumbnail

445045
equals	compareto
check java practices on equals and compareto

445056
post	get
if you post some code you could get to a solution to the problem that is better than trying to close your eyes and wait for the problem to go away they don t usually

445082
move	drag
this results in dragmove executing on the main window move the main window alone as i drag the title bar

445214
x86	64bit
on plain x86 you wouldn t notice the problem on x86 with pae or 64bit amd64 intel 64bit machines you d get a segfault

445253
mbunit	nunit
if you use gallio to run both your mbunit and nunit tests then the output will be in the same format and you can use the gallio reports

445253
mbunit	nunit
alternately just modify your dashboard.config file to include the mbunit report in addition to the nunit report

445270
strcpy	strncpy
countless mistakes in the c design exist ranging from gets to strcpy to the strncpy api it should have had the strlcpy api since day 1

445274
vb6	vba
the closest msdn articles i find reference .net i m stuck in the vba vb6

445330
erlang	lisp
if your cs course didn t touch on it i highly advise spending a bit of time with a more functional style of language like erlang haskell or even lisp

445333
put	get
get a vanilla hard drive for the os and a pair of fast drives wd velociraptors etc and put them in raid 1 for the webserver for redundancy

445338
pascal	delphi
delphi object pascal properties

445348
ostringstream	std
std ostringstream is not required to be slower but it is generally slower when implemented

445372
google-chrome	safari
it s the browser safari google-chrome etc that expands www.google.com out into so that you can actually visit the site

445373
cout	cin
one reason i know that the printf family of functions are faster than the corresponding c++ functions cout cin and other streams is that the latter do typechecking

445373
cout	cin
in fact in programming competitions it is often recommended that you use printf et al rather than cout cin for precisely this reason

445397
post	get
if you write a contract first web service that consumes and produces xml you can talk to any client that can make an http get or post request in the appropriate format

445497
post	get
there s a blog post here that describes how the behaviour of was changed between .net 3.5 and .net 3.5 sp1 but it still doesn t explain the invalidcastexception which you even get if you rewrite your code thus

445506
public	protected
if you re trying to expose protected methods from an inheritor you can wrap them in public methods

445508
inherited	subclassing
your subclassing will be able to access the protected members of the class you inherited

445607
width	height
in the layout tab you can set the width and height of the window and the width and height of the screen buffer

445644
migrate	upgrade
depending on how many new projects you ve added is it possible for you to restore the 2005 databases to the new server upgrade them to 2008 and then migrate the newer projects into this newly updated database

445653
folder	directory
with that many files i would write a script for my command-line ftp client that goes to the folder in question and performs a directory listing redirecting the output to a file

445657
int	chars
if the string is only a few chars then it will be nearly as small an an int anyway

445689
padding	right-align
left-align the header to make it stay put you can add padding on the left to fake a centered or right-align header

445703
put	get
i ll put a calculation on a read-only get or a set

445704
put	get
you should only put calculations on get if the value is likely to change every time its queried

445724
typedef	typename
instead of typename you want to use typedef

445739
put	get
if the calculations simple and does not take a long time then put it in the get

445748
for-loop	loops
so you could either find a workaround or just use a for-loop instead of a foreach loops

445810
cvs	svn
eclipse can be sluggish but i ve become attached to integrated svn cvs block indent unindent and run as unittest features

445852
x86	64bit
x64 exception model gets you to the msdn article everything you need to know to start programming 64bit windows systems which contains the quote the downside to table-based exception handling relative to the x86 stack-based model is that looking up function table entries from code addresses takes more time than just walking a linked list

445879
folder	directory
edit strangely enough if i put the jar somewhere else say in a directory inside of my user folder and change the path to it in my build.xml it works

445942
post	get
client-side code submits an object in the post request body or query string if using get method via ajax request to a python cgi script

445947
getter	setter
depending on what you re trying to achieve and what version of .net you re using you could consider using the datacontractserializer which doesn t require things to be public for example you could put a datamemberattribute on a private field or a property with public getter and private setter

445955
opera	firefox
for the specific case of needing a more screen-friendly view of the msdn or on any other site like stackoverflow that makes poor use of screen real estate i would suggest applying a custom stylesheet to the page using a tool like ie7pro ie greasemonkey firefox stylish fireox or the built in stylesheet picker in opera

445979
updatepanel	formview
easiest way is to nest a formview inside the updatepanel

446005
put	get
what do you want to happen if you put a 5l then try to get 5 5 ..

446005
int	double
if k is int then check if the object passed is long short float double ... then convert and compare

446228
launch4j	jsmooth
there are some software for that such as jsmooth or launch4j

446230
cvs	svn
vcs like svn git cvs etc

446244
cvs	svn
i have a git repository originally cvs then svn now git containing a rails project that has been deployed on linux for a while now

446325
pull	push
use pull push to sync with another parent repository on an external harddrive for backup

446329
ant	maven
in the end you have to be a bit flexible depending on the project itself and whether you use ant or maven

446330
post	get
in which case get the post first

446336
postgresql	mysql
both of the big oss db s mysql and postgresql can scale to extremely large sites

446352
post	get
if i ve read your question correctly i assume you want to get the single post out then order the comments within that post

446369
width	height
if you need to layout some others components based on the sprite width and height but before actually drawing it you can draw on a flash.display.shape object use this size as a reference and then attach the shape on the sprite

446445
interbase	firebird
i had to use interbase at work so i came to firebird

446501
versioning	upgrade
the fix suggested by them is to upgrade it to versioning 2.2.6

446545
hash	salt
and hash your passwords in your database with a salt

446571
folder	directory
hence all the apache related dlls are located in the application folder s sub directory c program files mywebapp apache2

446585
prepare	execute
it s still possible to screw it up -- for example if your stored procedure just builds a sql string internally and execute it trusting the input -- but prepare statements with parameters mean that no unescaped data will ever get to the db server completely cutting off that attack vector

446626
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
as of jquery 1.5 the returned object is a wrapper for the native xmlhttprequest object called jqxhr

446856
hide	show
i am using a collapsiblepanelextender in the ajaxtoolkit 3.5 to show hide search filter options

446911
super	extends
let s have two objects foo of class super and bar of class sub which extends super

446918
type-safety	typechecking
moreover gcc provides static typechecking on printf -style function calls so the benefit of type-safety is reduced

446962
ati	nvidia
are there any third-party reports that compare ati s stream framework to nvidia s cuda framework ie not from ati or nvidia talking themselves up

447029
webkit	gecko
i don t think you ll be able to do this with any kind of accuracy without embedding gecko webkit trident or essentially recreating them

447101
stdout	stderr
the last line is supposed to return the stderr back to where it was before which i have only supposed is the same as stdout

447137
for-loop	loops
in javascript the for-loop does not have it s own scope - so a var you create inside a loops is not different from one defined outside of it

447214
many-to-one	one-to-many
one-to-many and many-to-one you

447218
put	get
if you put the rev keyword inside a file and enable keyword substitution with the svn keywords property you will not get what you want

447230
hide	show
you can use these to hide navbars ads or show different ads

447271
stdout	stderr
that way the script preserves the separation of stdout and stderr for the script ie

447271
stdout	stderr
the scripts stdout and stderr can be redirected separately

447356
outputstream	inputstream
this is likely to be some object with a keylistener hooked into the view as well as an inputstream and an outputstream to handle communication with the other player it probably also needs to be the one to worry about synchronizing the game state

447359
gridview	formview
it works with a gridview which then displays the data but with this formview it doesn t display the data

447434
udp	tcp
for example it only provides interfaces for tcp and udp networking which is much higher in the network protocol stack that what you are discussing

447500
packets	multicast
i m supporting a 3rd party app that sends multicast packets with a ttl of 1

447502
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
the first style sets the default body rules top-left position hide any overflow take up the whole width min height 372px trebuchet font black b g orange f g etc although margin 0 is repeated for some reason

447610
post	put
modify your uri template to something like task new and put the data of the new task in the body of the post http request

447621
getter	setter
it allows you to have the object be dynamic yet still be able to write some custom code that runs whenever properties are accessed similarly to getter and setter -- see getproperty and setproperty .

447636
updatepanel	scriptmanager
for example any updatepanel in any embedded control in the app would want to know about the existence of that scriptmanager

447644
getter	setter
then i can have methods as well as data setter getter with validation and so on

447666
ati	nvidia
the virtual framebuffer driver is a display driver just like one you d use to connect to an nvidia or ati video card except it s output is a chunk of memory that contains the pixels not an lcd screen

447672
post	get	post	put	put	get
i had a whole long post detailing how you shouldn t expect to be able to get acceptable battery life because wm is not designed to support what you re trying to do but -- you could signal your service on wakeup do your processing then use the methods in this post to put the device back to sleep immediately

447704
google-chrome	firefox
i ve scoured my firefox history my google-chrome history my feeddemon feeds and my google bookmarks to no avail

taken from this post building mod_perl2 on leopard which also links to further details on how to get apache2 request libapreq working as well

447824
width	height
honestly i d be happy if i could make the default character width height of the shell larger but the others would be nice too.

448017
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the following simple block of code renders as i would expect it to in safari firefox google-chrome and opera

448054
hide	show
based on the value of a boolean viewstate variable i would also like to hide show the updatepanels alternatively but

448079
free	malloc
when free ing the piece first goes into a free-list for quick reuse by another malloc if the size fits

448079
free	malloc
when free pieces arrive so that multiple fragments can be joined free usually does this but sometimes fragments remain depending on size and orderof malloc and free

448079
free	malloc
but usually malloc keeps things in its pocket dependig on the allocated free ratio many heuristics and sometimes compile or flag options are often available

448079
free	malloc
notice that there is not one malloc free algotrithm

448176
hash	md5
indy comes with functions for calculating several hash md5 is one of them

448204
implements	extends
what spring security classes do i need to extends implements

448204
implements	extends
i ve messed around trying to extends abstractprocessingfilter and or implements authenticationprovider but i just get caught up understanding how i make them all play nicely

448245
getter	setter
it also is considerably shorter for example 99 of getter setter can just be left out in favor of directly accessing the fields

448246
websphere	ibm
i came across an article on the ibm web site where it says that hibernate s cluster aware caches in conjunction with websphere application server has not been determined yet

448321
ant	maven
i have used both ant and maven tasks to great effect in deploying wars remotely all while being built-in to the build process

448328
post	put
i don t believe that content_location has any defined behaviour in response to a put or post request

448330
superclass	subclassing
for each class subclassing it in jython and port the methods one by one making the method in the superclass abstract

448393
cifs	smb
the in smb cifs uris means that the share is hidden and won t be displayed when browsing shared folders

448413
ant	maven
multi module builds are the norm for maven projects and are also easy to set up for other build systems like ant

448422
getter	setter
for the same reason i tend to dislike getter setter functions

448444
post	get
now if my initial post has the validator enabled but client side i disable it does the server side recognize the client side change and keep it or does it get re-enabled the the page is sent back to the user

448498
post	put
jeremy miller just put up a post on how to create your own conventions.

448572
hide	show
if you re just presenting a lot of static data in a compact space - load it when the page loads and hide show as appropriate

448577
strncmp	strcmp
as far as i know you re absolutely right--there s no reason to use strncmp instead of strcmp

448588
gtk	cairo	libjpeg	cairo
shoes relies on cairo pango libungif libjpeg gtk 2.0 and ruby

448588
ubuntu	debian

448689
post	get
i m glad this post has been helpful and i m hoping i can get off my arse and finish up my book on the subject by the end of the year early next year

448713

java has swing swt awt etc

448793
profiling	debugging
both of them provides good unit tests debugging profiling etc

448806
super	abstract
abstract the sql away 95 of the time so not everyone on the team needs to know how to write super efficient database specific queries

448849
mouse	keyboard
mouse click works perfectly but doesnt allow for keyboard selection ie bound fields update but picturebox does not

448859
realloc	malloc
but in addition to that things allocated with malloc and family can be resized using realloc

448860
apache	nginx
you should look into cherrypy as your http request handler which can be configured to run on top of a very light nginx web server or apache if you prefer

448892
mp3	flv
i would recommend using mp3 audio and flash using the free jw flv media player which should do everything that you want except for the low high quality thing but maybe you can just use two players if you need

448975
client-side	server-side
however to use the feature you will have to use word automation on either server-side or client-side

448978
antivirus	norton
i had heinous problems with this until i disabled my norton autoprotect antivirus software

448992
implements	extends
but if you create an interface for your modules and then each class you load unload implements that interface as well as extends the flex module class you can load and unload them cleanly

449104
width	height
edit just realised no javascript so in that case keep the a tag and simply define a style for it in css that way you can give it height width etc

449161
hide	show
i want to fire a toggle event that will show hide the div marked with the class main by clicking on the corresponding clickme text inside its child div tag with clickme class

449162
config	ini
figure out that i need to make a copy of the data dir and merge ini with backup ini file and didn t need to run the config wizard twice

449166
mod-python	mod-wsgi
either through mod-python s wsgi support or maybe better mod-wsgi

449178
width	height
the outer container was specified with fixed height and width and the inner dg was set to 100 height and width

449178
width	height
setting the dg height and width to fixed values a bit smaller than the outer container did the trick

449252
wxpython	pyqt	wxpython	pygtk
there are some very popular cross platform gui toolkits borrowed from c c++ that have a lot of external widgets wxpython pyqt pyfltk pygtk

449356
dictionary	map
in the simplest case the dictionary has a key which would map to the primary key of a table - so that when you specify the values of the key you can immediately find the matching data via a simple lookup

449372
google-chrome	firefox
i have firefox open with a size including google-chrome of 1024x1000

449428
datalist	repeater
if you really needed to use a datalist for some reason instead of implementing this as a repeater you can try doing something like this

449484
portrait	landscape
i had to do a linear layout and include 3 images that look like real tabs so i can try and mimic the operation of the tabs while rotating the screen to landscape and keep the visuals as portrait

449504
implements	extends
it s far more flexible to implements a common interface than try and force things to extends from a specific base class or sometimes it s impossible

449505
getter	setter
a and b are independent variables so they have simple setter and getter that merely get and set a filed

449514
jobs	cron
if you have shared hosting there s probably some tool they d give you for cron jobs

449516
getdate	datepart
select dow datepart d getdate where 1 sunday 7 saturday

449761
csv	tsv
if the file is something like csv tsv similar then csvreader is highly recommended

449772

you ll probably want to post to the mod_wsgi group if you try this and hit problems or if you successfully build the modules please post them as some of us would very much like them but are too busy to get to doing it ourselves

449779
ironruby	ironpython
you could compile your vb6 functionality and expose it as a com object and connect it to python with ironpython or ironruby which are python and ruby implementations in .net thus allowing you to access .net functionality although im not quite sure if com exposed objects are easily pluggable to those interpreters

449808

webclient is simpler to use than webrequest

449926
opera	firefox
the following should work in at least firefox and opera

449962
versioning	upgrade
i m new to the project and relatively new to asp.net mvc itself - soon we will be looking to upgrade to either the beta or rc versioning

450005
inherited	properties
this next note doesn t apply to the original days but one interesting point in the current incarnation of asp.net is that the page inherited from the code-behind so the proper-case names would make sense if they were exposed as protected properties

450035
gridview	objectdatasource
the best approach is to have some objectdatasource s in order to the entire process be easier for you or off course you can bind the nasted gridview in the paraent gridview onrowdatabound event it is all up to you

450036
cvs	svn
cvs svn plugins are available

450070
selecteditem	selectedindex
you have selecteditem or selectedindex

profiling	debugging
iphone on the other side has a lot of cool tools to debugging and profiling your app

450180

some heaps like fibonacci heap has o 1 time of decreasekey and min operation but what i need at least is fast increasekey and min or decreasekey and max

450218
erlang	lisp
it was this one thing that keept popping up in google results when searching for lisp and erlang stuff

450243
jedit	scite
i like scite and there s also jedit

450251
public	protected
part of the recommendations for writing cls-compliant libraries is to not have two public protected entities that differ only by case e.g you should not have

450316
firefox	safari
it works fine in safari but in firefox and ie the stays small in the top-left corner of the browser

450316
width	height
if i use left and width and top and height then everything works fine

450316
width	height
however i don t know what is the width and the height i want them adjusted depending of the size of the browser window

450322
camping	ruby-on-rails	merb	ruby-on-rails	merb	camping
in the ruby world you have the big player ruby-on-rails but you also have much lighter ones like merb sinatra camping and a couple of others

450387
sorting	filtering
if the list offers extra features sorting filtering etc via ibindinglist ibindinglistview etc then more functionality might be available

450400
width	height
theyâ ll use the last vertical and horizontal position specified and need the dimensions to be specified using width and height

450429
hide	show
within that new stylesheet show the container element and hide the old elements and anything else that you do not wish to print

450455
qtcore	qtgui
i think qtcore and qtgui are required

450456
division	modulo
so the definition of modulo will nearly always depend on the definition of integer division

450459
switching	screens
parsing screenshots generated by java.awt.robot is neither platform- nor version- or even configuration-independant and in general i don t think screens is locked is a well-enough defined concept to be used in this sense - on linux there can be more than just one screens x server you can switching to console terminals you can have applications running one or more machines display their guis on another machine over the network.

450508
range	max	range	min	min	max
for one of my charts where there could be a large range of different bars i have this set on the y-axis min and max

450527
comparator	comparable
in 1.4 the signature of comparator could only ever take an object since all kinds of classes implemented comparable and there was no way to know exactly what was needed

450527
comparator	comparable
with generics however you can specify that you are comparable with respect to a particular class and then write a more specific comparator method that only takes that class as a parameter

450607
sorting	filtering
in short adding an index on columns that you regularly use for filtering or for sorting may improve performance

450609
int	boolean
the conversion of a boolean to an int is ingenious but requires mental parsing and that fiddling could be more expensive than the use of

450625
put	get
then after the old database is shut off you can iterate over those keys and get those records from the old database and put them into the new database

the awt and swing apis for example are heavily event-based

450682
put	get
obviously if i put a value there all the fields will get that value

you might want to look at a framework like cakephp or codeigniter that make writing internationalized applications much easier

450703
cvs	svn
i already do through svn hg git and cvs

450725
bazaar	git
this question sounds like an advert for a distributed vcs like git or bazaar you need developers to be able to commit changes often but on to their own branch which then gets reviewed before being pulled in to the central repository

450728
stdout	stderr
i had to add my own appender for logging to stderr and stdout but that was much easier than creating my own logging framework from scratch

450766
dllmain	getprocaddress
the most obvious condition is that the process calling loadlibrary explicitly gets getprocaddress dllmain and then calls it

450794
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
or use sudo and edit etc sudoers such that sudo does not ask for a passwd

450814
bazaar	git
generic scm interoperability solution like fast-import exchange standard created in git but supported by bazaar and i think also by mercurial or tools such as tailor but tailor has its limitation

450835
rss	feed
we actually do offer rss feed to allow 3rd party apps to scan our site for product info but not ahead of the main site html

450855
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
but it really looks like you re missing the point of inherited it s that you can only treat subclassing uniformly when using exclusively the superclass methods

450873
jar	war
a delivery unit is a small small as in the fewest number of files as possible set of packaged files jar war and ear are all an example of such packaged files but we also include sources compressed in a zip file javadoc compressed also script to execute this delivery and so on

450875
super	implements
there is a way to implements typesafe heterogenous containers thc using super type tokens but that has its own problems again

450882
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the objectoutputstream and objectinputstream can do this

450892
hide	show
you can build functions on your page as user controls and dynamically load user controls on your page based on those permissions if you want or you can put content in panels and just show hide panels as needed

450900
xsl-fo	xslt
works like a charm if you re familiar with xslt and xsl-fo or willing to learn it

you can put that in your code to get around it

451054
client-side	server-side
because we re standardizing on flex client-side development amf and blazeds now better coupled to spring thanks to adobe and springsource cooperating on the integration are the most efficient and convenient means we can employ to interact with the server-side

451060
coalesce	isnull
no if statements no case statements no isnull no coalesce

451247
pop-up	dialog
i don t want to pop-up the confirmation dialog unless i know the user has made changes

rss	feed
i m working on an application that allows users to add their own rss feed to a simple reader of sorts

451362
versioning	upgrade
since i upgrade to versioning 1.3 of jquery this appears to be causing problems because both libraries define a function named

451375
int	chars
given that signed and unsigned int use the same registers etc. and just interpret bit patterns differently and c chars are basically just 8-bit int what s the difference between signed and unsigned chars in c

451379
jmeter	soapui
jmeter is also a great solution as is soapui

451406
pull	push
alternatively have the n worker scripts on other machines that pull requests from the db and call sox and then push the resulting output file to where it needs to be

451426
concave	convex
i have my ideas about pulling a sequence of triangles from the list of points but i know there are a bunch of edge cases regarding convex and concave polygons that i probably won t catch

451438
hash	md5
something like an md5 hash

451465
versioning	upgrade
i ve upgrade to the latest versioning with relative ease

451468
int	chars
most importantly if you overflow the valid range of a chars by assigning it a too big or small int and chars is signed the resulting value is implementation defined or even some signal in c could be risen as for all signed types

451468
int	chars
if an int will be able to represent all values of chars which it is for most implementations then the chars is being promoted to int before passing to printf

451468
int	chars
however if chars is unsigned then the value is unsigned and promoting to an int will yield a positive int

mouse	keyboard
the desktop computer has a ton of buffers for both keyboard and mouse actions

451580
width	height
this script will resize an image somepic.jpg using pil python imaging library to a width of 300 pixels and a height proportional to the new width

451580
width	height
it does this by determining what percentage 300 pixels is of the original width img.size 0 and then multiplying the original height img.size 1 by that percentage

451619
next	except
i m thinking of learning it next currently using erlang and in general happy with it except the records fiasco..

451654
cvs	svn
my company is moving from cvs to svn

451654
cvs	svn
with cvs i made branches for each production release now svn copy and applied limited patches to the branch for critical issues

and on top of that there are many implementations of common lisp or scheme

451730
tabcontrol	tabitem
i want to achieve the following using prism composite application library for wpf when one of the buttons is clicked i need to add a new tabitem to the tabcontrol and load and individual instance of the corresponding module application inside this tabitem

451882
profiling	benchmarking
as you progress through the development use benchmarking and profiling to determine the bottlenecks in the code and if needed you can bypass the orm and use manual queries where they are required

451916
gentoo	linux
the way i really learned my way around in linux was to install gentoo

451929
hide	show
thanks a lot dear now i am able to show the div but could t hide others

451929

as you said all page disappear i have on container id formcontainer and other divs child of that id div under this id show hide and 1 show that is clicked

451931
hex	binary
hex is a human readable form of the binary the cpu actually uses

451941
entity-relationship	diagram
i ve also used some entity-relationship diagram tools to help me keep track of changes in db versions

451960
hide	show
we do something similar though we have the tab items already created with no content and show hide as appropriate

451967
min	max
i thought that they might be min average and max numbers but line 2 would seem to counter that idea

452037
vmware	esx
we have a mix of vmware esx vms and bare-metal os running app web and db servers and without a doubt the heaviest loaded dbms system is on bare-metal machine quad proc quad core etc.

452063
fish	bash
while sticking with bash might be best while just learning the fish shell might be a little bit easier to use

452109
vmware	virtualbox
i installed it on two machines using both vmware and virtualbox

452123
post	get
would resolve to a url in the get case -- post would work the same way though like this

452149
jobs	cron
for things that can take place out-of-band and have some delay such as report processing or video conversion i have a model called jobs and then use script runner combined with cron to call jobs.process_jobs every few minutes

452205
client-side	server-side
it s all client-side not server-side

452220
verilog	hdl
specifically this time around i am using a hdl language cyclicity cdl which is on sourceforge the documentation needs some help but the examples may get you going and it produces synthesizable verilog so you get an extra win there

452235
folder	directory
i usually just un-check create directory for solution so that it puts the sln file in the same folder and then i delete them by hand the first time i close the project

452260
memcpy	memset
if you use generic c and no libc calls write your own memcpy memset etc this code will run anywhere on the host for development and on the target

452344
hide	show
the show and hide events fire for visibility and this seems to work for the first descendant of a viewstack component but not further down the display tree

452390
put	get
if i put them in baz s onupdate function i m back to the original problem in that i d have to remember to tell baz s onupdate function to call bar s onupdate function otherwise bar s onupdate function wouldn t get called

452401
unsigned	short
the easiest way is to make a stub function that has the signature you want where uint16_t unsigned short we usually make the # of bits explicit

452401
cos	sin
i ve used assembly to optimize some control loop code that got executed frequently or to calculate sin cos and arctan

452450
hide	show
in either case the children of the object will not emit a show or hide event unless the object has specifically written an implementation to do so.

452461
hide	show
it s also true the show and hide events don t bubble by default so if you want to be notified of visibility changes in a descendant of a viewstack container you ll need to listen for them explicitly

452461
hide	show
you ll see the show and hide events for each label fire once their visible properties have been bound to their parent panels

452503
chunked	transfer-encoding
the utl_http package supports http 1.1 chunked transfer-encoding

452503
chunked	transfer-encoding
when the response body is returned in chunked transfer-encoding format as indicated in the response header the package automatically decodes the chunks and returns the response body in de-chunked format.

452527
expression-blend	silverlight
i think that expression-blend is an important tool when starting out with silverlight as the xaml writing doesn t come easy in the beginning and you have to concentrate more on the xaml errors than on the overall system of things and actual visual results

452564
getter	setter
also be wary of making every property in your domain model have public getter and setter

452608
filtering	grouping
at least that s what i d do i d just order by instead of grouping by and loop through the results to handle the grouping as a filtering done in the client language

452667

452691
haskell	scheme
ask the long line of people who have tried to compile haskell ml modula-3 scheme and more using this technique

452780
versioning	upgrade
you ll have to either install asp or upgrade your versioning of vista to

452802
int	chars
you could return default k and that means you will return null if k is a reference type or 0 for int 0 for chars and so on.

452830
width	height
try giving the object element some width and height 1px by 1px and make it visible within the viewport when you attempt to communicate with the plugin via javascript

452830
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
safari and opera should work but firefox will definitely require the netscape style embed element and really you should provide both

452939
vim	emacs
if your text is from any half-way known program and is ever logged or stored in a file the text editors vim or emacs can do some very smart highlighting on it

452947
onchange	onkeydown	onchange	onblur	onkeydown	onblur
you ll be better off just using onchange or onblur instead of onkeydown

453059
ocp	principles
and in any case this is a bad design practice as it will break the ocp principles

453071
put	get
for the moment let s leave aside the fact that it derives from java.util.hashtable to start with which means it has get object and put object object despite the fact that properties are always strings.

453103
mouse	keyboard
these displays would provide at most mouse input but no keyboard

453132
wadl	wsdl
i think the main reason why wadl doesn t gain popularity is that it might bring back to life all those problem we had with soap and wsdl

453139

x86	64bit
finally if you re running 64bit windows then the working folder path for the command prompt would be c program files x86 microsoft visual studio 9.0 vc

453151
ssl	https
mongrel does not support ssl https directly

453151
ssl	https
if you really want to test https functionality you have to setup apache or another webserver with ssl https support using mod_ssl and configure it to run your rails application using mod_rails or mod_proxy

453153
folder	directory
remember to rename your zend framework containing folder to zend uppercase z to follow zf naming conversions then put your zend folder in your include directory

453171
int	double
i strongly suggest you avoid bit-manipulation of double using int operations

453171
int	double
on most modern cpus there is no direct means of moving data between double and int registers other than by taking a round trip to the dcache

453205
opera	firefox
if i remember correctly it is possible in the internet explorer maybe the site must be in the trusted zone but not in firefox or opera

453254
inherited	properties
of course consumers of ibar won t be able to get value of offset properties because inherited of ifoo doesn t change semantic of offset properties defined in ibar - compiler warns you for a reason

453254
inherited	properties
however consumers of class inherited from ibar interface will be able to get and set offset properties

453265
getter	setter
what you could do is having the ibar-interface having the getter and the setter there s really no point of not having this

453291
width	height
here for each page we read through each xobject of subtype image and get the width and height values

453300
bazaar	git
i m considering subversion bazaar and git

453305
freebsd	debian
ok so in the example the server runs freebsd and is sparky whereas the machine to be saved is under debian and is replica

453329
bash	zsh
the reason ipython hits the soft spots with me are very much because i generally like command prompts and especially nix-inspired prompts with inspiration from ksh csh yes chs is a monster but as a prompt it sport lots of really good features bash and zsh

453334
bazaar	git	bazaar	fossil	fossil	git	darcs	fossil
as a side effect i ve started myself on a small project to evaluate side by side subversion git bazaar mercurial monotone darcs and fossil though in a more general version management context merges and such

453334
bazaar	git
as to mercurial i didn t include it in my list because i have tried it previously and i felt that i liked bazaar better while git seems at first sight to have a great deal of power which admittedly i may not need

453413
width	height
where 320 width 240 height

453437
svg	vml
what are my options for rendering graphics encoded by java2d to vector graphics formats such as eps swf svg vml pdf and others i might not have heard of yet with open source libraries

453479
put	get
will i get different sequences of numbers for every seed i put into it

453521
public	protected
dangerous attributes and methods of your class ones that might cause data loss should be non-public whether to make them protected or private is influenced by other factors with public methods used to provide a simpler safer interface

453563
int	boolean
in general though it s best to avoid runtime type checking and use as3 s primitives as defined in the docs boolean number int uint string

453595
abc	subclassing
protected the abc probably already has some pure virtual methods and therefore already can t be instantiated except as a subclassing

453601
post	get
even simple query requires two round-trips post then get

453622

453751
kerberos	ntlm
so kerberos and ntlm are not mutually exclusive and ntlm is not obsoleted by kerberos

453751
kerberos	ntlm
in fact in some ways ntlm is better than kerberos

453751
kerberos	ntlm
note that when mentioning kerberos and ntlm in the same breath i have to also mention spengo and integrated windows authentication iwa

453751
kerberos	ntlm
iwa is a simple term that basically means kerberos or ntlm or spnego to negotiate kerberos or ntlm

453751
kerberos	ntlm	kerberos	ldap
but until recently implementing kerberos and ntlm have been difficult so using ldap as a make-shift authentication service has persisted

453751
kerberos	ntlm
so how do you implement kerberos or ntlm in java and in the context of web applications in particular

453792
floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer	integer	fractions	base	fractions
if you store something with an index that is not a nonnegative integer it s alphanumeric negative or a floating-point number with a fractions piece it will fail on the array-index store and default to the object which is array s base class store which then converts the argument to a string and stores by string index -- but these stored properties are not seen by the array class and therefore are not visible to its methods properties length join slice splice push pop etc

453802
hash	md5
what i want to is to genate them to md5 hash

453832
hash	md5
alternatively you could keep an md5 hash of the .proto file the last time protogen was executed and only execute protogen if the .proto file has changed - even less to do on each build

453871
post	get
http protocol get post

453879
inherited	subclassing
i believe the consensus is that for typical application classes winform subclassing one-off utility classes et al there is no need to consider reuse of any kind much less reuse via inherited while for library classes it is critical to consider reuse via inherited in the design

453902
children	parent
the former selects all descendant para elements that are the first para children of their parent

453902
children	parent
will produce two nodes because both bars are first children of their respective parent

453920
inherited	subclassing
if a type is meant to be immutable it shouldn t allow inherited - because a subclassing can easily be mutable

453950
mouse	keyboard
function fnidletime will tell you how many seconds it has been since the user touched the mouse or keyboard

454010
width	height
the following function demonstrates a client that assumes that setting the width of a rectangle leaves the height unchanged

454025
simulink	labview
to answer the simulink portion of your question it is a simulation environment that mainly uses block diagram programming much like labview

454025

i m interested into delving into x86 assembly and i have heard that is somewhat harder even my mips textbook says this

454071
x86	mips
what core information should i know as a mips programmer before making the dive into the x86 world

454121

x86 have more complex instructions than mips

454121
x86	mips
x86 have more exceptions for register usage than mips that you have to keep in mind but nothing worth whining about constantly

454218
ada	pascal
to me inner classes -- at least private inner classes -- look a lot like inner procedures in pascal modula-2 ada they allow to break down a main class in smaller parts in order to ease the understanding

454258

if you have lots of range and are really concerned about performance you could create an avl type of tree consisting of the range min max pairs but sorted on the lowest part of the range

454519
ubuntu	debian
for instance the reason debian and its derivatives ubuntu etc. is so good is that you can happily use your system without ever having to install something outside the repositories and that everything on it is thoroughly tested

454551
postgresql	mysql
based on my understanding django would manage both the view and controller pieces and postgresql or mysql would handle the data

454587

apt-get install qemu installs qemu on debian ubuntu

454938
firefox	safari
i generally like to have a stylesheet for standards-compliant browsers such as firefox and safari and then use conditional comments to detect internet explorer and serve it an additional css file containing ie-specific fixes and overrides

455097

455176
gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian	gentoo	linux	debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
although some of the other posts mention a number of tools that you could use in your scripts the problem is that every linux distribution is a bit different and simple tasks like adding an user or installer a service are suddenly non-trivial when you need to do them across debian ubuntu mandriva redhat gentoo etc

pull	push
i have access to a server where i push pull my work to through ssh and this is my main projects repository which is pretty safe with raid 1 and regular backups

455599
width	height
it could still be helpful to know the exact height and width of the string so you can position it exactly where you want it and draw other ui items around it

455619
opera	firefox
unfortunately as far as i know there is no opera internet explorer webkit equivalent - this addon is only available for firefox 3 firefox 2 and firefox 3.1 beta are not supported .

455767
cvs	svn
gone through cvs svn before and now i feel it requires less work than it saves me from

455774
opera	firefox
the fact that your media query for opera works could very well mean it ll end up working for firefox too once that supports media queries

455876
spweb	spsite
so in your example you should not dispose either the spweb or spsite object

455876
spweb	spsite
as it has already been said it is a must to dispose instances of spweb and spsite that you create yourself new

455876
spweb	spsite
if you use try finally it is best practice to check for null on your spweb spsite instance and check for spweb first as spsite automatically will dispose your spweb

freemarker	velocity
if you are using spring then you may be interested in using velocity or freemarker with spring framework

456565
pull	push
when you commit you re only committing to your local repo so to get changes collaborations must either a pull from your local repo or b pull from some other accessible repo to which you have pushed your changes using git push

456601
mouse	keyboard
it would also receive a digital packed from the second processor containing the mouse keyboard input sent from the client

456601
mouse	keyboard
it would send the compressed monitor output to the correct clients and also receive the keyboard mouse input which would be dispatched to the second processor

456623
bison	ocamlyacc	bison	cup	cup	ocamlyacc
i ve used bison for c c++ cup for java and ocamlyacc for ocaml and they re all pretty good

456686
post	get	post	put	put	get
this is done by using the http methods post get put delete

456686
post	get
we take these 4 methods and think of them in terms of database interaction as create read update delete but on the web we use post and get because that is what anchor tags support currently

456686
post	get
so treating post and get as our create read update delete crud then we can design routes in our web application that will be able to deduce what action of crud we are achieving

456709
jar	manifest.mf
you can access them in the main method of main-class mentioned in the manifest.mf file of a jar

456756
moq	typemock
checkout mocking frameworks like rhinomock moq or typemock

456776
jtextpane	jeditorpane
you should try to use jeditorpane or jtextpane instead

456811
inline	inlining
you may want to disable inlining too as otherwise i guess there s a possibility that a smart compiler would notice you calling the function without using the return value and inline it to nothing

456819
cpu	affinity
on a multicore system be sure to either spawn the loop like this in multiple threads one for each cpu or execute the process multiple times and to make the scheduling predictable assign thread process affinity explicitly

456820
folder	directory
something like finding the directory of the executable won t work simply because the start-up folder item that starts your program is likely to be a shortcut to it so you won t have that path

456874
folder	directory
i need to scan a directory and its sub-folders i used findfirst and findnext procedures but the tsearchrec s name property is a string thus unicode folder names hebrew arabic etc are

456889
cvs	svn
the settings can be saved with the other project files cvs svn git whatever

456918
getter	setter
it s good practice to expose the instance of this class as a singleton and exposing the application variables you re initializing using getter and setter

456919
put	get
edit in your example recursion depth is prevented by the number of lives so that seems ok as this won t get bigger than 1000 or even 100 - this is exactly why i have considered it but now i can see it was a rather stupid idea i wonder who put this in an example program .

456942
int	boolean
i want to make a function that receives this matrix and a point where a zero is stored and that transforms every zero in the same area into a 2 suppose the matrix can store any int even it is initially boolean

457060
innodb	myisam
i have just changed a lot of the tables from myisam to innodb

457065
inherited	base-class	inherited	subclassing	base-class	subclassing
one option would be to use inherited and a protected modifier but having an internal constructor on the base-class so that external code can t subclassing it

457071
opera	firefox
how do i manage to do this with people that do not speak the language or again does not even have the skills to communicate with the customer you all know someone very bright that is going into deep technical issues with a customer that hardly knows the difference between firefox opera

457084
for-loop	loops
the enhanced for-loop doesn t do anything to try to release resources at the end of loops

457102
for-loop	loops
i would expect a for-loop to generally have a fixed number of iterations and the only part of the for-loop condition that changes to be loops variable i

457258
cassini	iis
iis and cassini are not the same and not exposing your code to production conditions can cause you problems

457273
lisp	smalltalk
it also grabs ideas from lisp and smalltalk

457306
ubuntu	linux
furthermore a previous incarnation of this project ran slapd on ubuntu linux on a dual-core server

457308
int	boolean
additionally each one only stores two int x and y coordinates and a boolean so they are going to be very small objects in the grand scheme of things

457362
post	get
i have some post actions on my controller that are hit from a pair of get actions

457454
vb.net	vb6
i have inherited a rather large project consisting of an application written in vb6 and several dll s and activex controls written in vb6 vb.net 1.1 and vb.net 2

457454
vb.net	vb6
my main vb6 application i will call it alpha has a configuration file alpha.exe.cnfig which contains settings used by my vb.net 1.1 dll which i will call bravo

457511
post	get
if you want to follow that process you can use firefox live http headers extension or wireshark to view full http headers and actions get post

457596
uilabel	uitextview
on receiving the data i set the values of uilabel and uitextview

457596
uilabel	uitextview
uilabel values appear fine but the uitextview sometimes do not show the value until i move to subview or scroll up and down to revisit the area contaning uitextview

457596
uilabel	uitextview
i m showing uilabel and uitextview objects in uitableviewcell

457596
uilabel	uitextview
i call tableview reloaddata right after setting values in uilabel and uitextview but i do not re-create the uitableviewcell

457614
jsr168	jsr286
this involves lot of portlets and i am inclined to use jsr286 specs rather than jsr168

457696
jexcelapi	jxl
in java with either jexcelapi jxl or apache poi

457728
width	margin
if i ve understood it correctly maybe you could set the first and second element to float left and then set the margin of the third element equal to the width of the first and second

457728
width	margin
you could also set the first element to float left the third to float right and the second with a margin equal to the width of the first element

457811
stdout	stderr
the exceptions are stdin stdout and stderr which your process did not open

457814
getter	setter
some of my classes have final fields that are populated from the constructor as well as properties that can be assigned from getter and setter

457867
getter	setter
then you can have the normal setter getter based as usual

457920
button	checkbox
sorry are you talking about checkbox button

457927
squash	merge
in fact our workflow is a little different as we tend to do squash merge instead of raw merge

457927
squash	branch	squash	merge
squash merge controversy - as several commenters have pointed out the squash merge will throw away all history on your feature branch

457976
redhat	fedora
if you re familiar with how redhat enterprise linux differs from fedora you can consider the difference to be quite similar

457988
pull	push
avoiding git disasters a gory story about the dangers of git push --force instead of a git pull --rebase for instance

458009
stdout	fflush	stdout	stderr	stderr	fflush
for the same reason it is probably a good idea to fflush or possibly to close stdout and stderr if you write to them

458049
http.sys	httplistener
httplistener hooks into http.sys even without iis i believe

458098
datamapper	activerecord
it feels like i am convoluting the activerecord pattern with other stuff like datamapper

458172
int	double
design-wise you should try to avoid converting nsdecimalnumber or nsdecimals to and from int float and double values for the same reasons it s recommended you use nsdecimalnumbers loss of precision and binary floating point representation issues

458172
int	double
if you have to input from an int float or double you could do something like the following

458194
outputstream	inputstream
when calling a web service method which includes a datahandler clients can write to the outputstream and on the server side you can read from the inputstream

458225
superclass	subclassing
ok so i m trying to make a nice superclass for data-access objects that can generate a tsql query to search all of the subclassing s public string properties

458255
post	get
get and post

458285
cvs	svn
quite a few hosting services -- even cheap shared hosts -- have the svn or cvs client installed

458310
getter	setter
i also have getter and setter to deal with this dictionary

458310
getter	setter
my goal then is to provide transparent access inside ironpython to this getter and setter as if they were real properties of a class

458314
post	get
you can t write a one-size-fits-all validation function for get post data

458318
mouse	keyboard
plus if you implement this your computer will have two ip addresses - one to control the video keyboard and mouse and another to say access files etc

458318
mouse	keyboard
this doesn t solve the problem you are thinking of but i think you d be better off implementing a thin client which only connects to a vnc server and processes the keyboard mouse commands then encodes them to vnc compatible ethernet commands and displays the video data on an attached monitor

458335
playstation	wii
motion sensing nintendo wii controller or to a lesser degree sixaxis controller for playstation 3

458360
ilmerge	reflector
short term though you may have to go with ilmerge or reflector + copy code

458379
post	get
when i post this suggestion i nearly always get a complaint about exception performance

458413
opera	safari
the css3 text-shadow is ultimately what i m after but of course only safari opera not yet released ff3.1 out of the major browsers support it

458436
puts	gets
which gets rid of all folders and puts all files in the target folder and its subfolders into a single zip file

458466
hide	show
yes i would like to show hide divs and such

458478
folder	directory
after adding some imports your code runs fine for me how do you call the script maybe you could tell us the folder structure of the .. packed bin directory

458511
hide	show
if you mean you want to show hide divs and such that s much easier using css and javascript

458514
hide	show
what you probably want to do is change css property display of the element to none to hide the element and change it back to block or inline to show it again

458525
boost	stl
edit i can use only stl and not boost old compilers

458558
ubuntu	linux
i m working on linux system ubuntu 7.04 server with a 2.6.20 kernel

458558
terminate	timeout
if i do this while thread1 is blocked in a select with a timeout then the select will not terminate immediately but will eventually timeout properly

458662
chown	sudo
you need to run chown as root directly or through sudo

458726
ready	each
for example the following should log the # of ms it took each image to load from the moment the dom was ready

458756
awt	swing
any awt swing bindings

458776
awt	swing
i think a swing awt component must have focus for this to work

458846
put	get
at the moment i have put a property for both in icommand and i get each subclass to implement those properties and just have a return blah blah blah statement in them

458854
mockups	balsamiq
balsamiq mockups is a notable exception

458855
versioning	upgrade
which would mean that you have to change your code if you want to upgrade to the final versioning

458869
sse	avx
intel is set to release a new instruction set called avx which includes an extension of sse to 256-bit operation

458973
google-chrome	firefox
seems that changing name and id attributes has no effect on the password managers in firefox and google-chrome all they see is a password_field and the field above it and that is good enough for them

458984
post	get
if you really need to send new custom data every time i would suggest sending it through a get or a post preferably

459061
perforce	cvs
this is roughly equivalent to the workflow in cvs or subversion. you would synchronize your working copy go off and develop and then ask perforce to figure out what you did while it wasn t watching

459096
integer	unsigned
an ipv4 address can be stored as a four-byte unsigned integer an uint in c#

459096
integer	unsigned
an ipv6 address can be an eight-byte unsigned integer an ulong in c#

459185
cvs	rcs
if you have to have subversion cvs or rcs crud in your source file

459217
equinox	knopflerfish
springsource dm server is based on the equinox osgi framework and should not be confused with the spring dm technology included in dm server which can run on equinox apache felix and knopflerfish

459232
folder	directory
in my project bin directory i created the folder nl

459233
free	malloc
but let s say i want to test a dynamic memory structure with a lot off malloc and free

459233
put	get
and it turns out that i can put data in and get correct data back out again

459233
free	malloc
detect any malloc free problems

459234
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer an ulong in c#

459236
jquery	simplemodal
is it possible to use simplemodal jquery plugin with asp.net mvc

459252
client-side	server-side
server-side javascript is an interesting idea because of the client-side validation problem you want to do validation client-side to avoid sending needless requests to your server

459302
hide	show
with .show replaced with hide for the show less function

459302
fadein	hide
however if i try to replace the .show hide with fadein .fadeout ie renders it as almost identical to .show hide except it takes a minute for hide to take effect

459306
jquery	scriptaculous
since both jquery and scriptaculous work by changing the underlying css i think it s safe to say that any javascript implementation is going to be computationally expensive

459312
innodb	myisam
i created these tables as myisam but have since changed all three to innodb because i read that myisam doesn t support foreign keys

459323
lisp	scheme
i am looking for a version of scheme or even lisp that i can use to recover some lost lisp development skills

459376
subtract	add
you can also add or subtract date components if you really need to

459378
firefox	safari
this code works in firefox but not in safari

459397
scheme	racket
plt scheme is now known as racket but i haven t experimented with it after the change.

459400
qtabwidget	qtabbar
until then the only way to get close buttons is to subclass qtabwidget or qtabbar and add it manually possible but not trivial

459441
post	get
when you get a doget or dopost call in a servlet you can use getparameterxxx to get either the query string or the post data in one easy place

459441
post	get
if the call was a post you get the post data all parsed out for you

459441
post	get
if you specify a fully qualified or partially qualified url for the action param everything works great if you don t the browser will call the same url as it did on the previous page submit and if there happens to be query string data there you ll get that as well as post data and there s no way to tell them apart

459441
post	get
i m looking through the request object i see where the post data comes from i m just trying to figure out where the get data comes from so i can erase the get data on a post call and erase the post data on a get call before it parses it out if possible

459474
pdcurses	ncurses
you can always use this tutorial for ncurses and change the #include from ncurses.h to curses.h in order to use pdcurses

459481
post	get
the httpservletrequest.getparameterxxx methods don t distinguish between get and post parameters

459481
post	get
if you really need to distinguish between them you ll need to parse them manually using getquerystring for the get parameters and getinputstream getreader for the post data

459485
post	get
i don t know of any clean way to distinguish between get and post parameters but you can access the raw query string using the getquerystring method of httpservletrequest and you can access the raw post data using the getinputstream method of servletrequest

459485
post	get
i m looking at the tomcat api docs specifically here although i think those are both part of the standard servlet api then you could parse the post data and get data separately if you want

459495
vb.net	vb6
it lets you create usercontrols in vb.net which you can then add to vb6

459547
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the javascript engine just isn t anywhere near safari or firefox or google-chrome

459547
width	height
opacity height computed height element width + border + padding screen position are all good places to start

459664
subclass	abstract-class
this seems like a fairly bad design can t you have an abstract-class c++ interface such as computable that has a pure virtual function1 subclass computable for each implementation and then have myfunctionset maintain a set of computable

459690
int	boolean
you could convert the boolean to a 1 or 0 using intval or cast it with int or int

459690
int	double
according to mysqli_stmt bind_param s documentation the only types you may bind are int double strings and blobs

459725
free	malloc
malloc free 33 allocs 30 frees 84 109 bytes allocated

459725
free	malloc
malloc free 2 allocs 2 frees 3 200 000 bytes allocated

459732
post	get
you can find more details about this in kb929149 and in raymond chen s post where does shell.windows.com get information about file extensions and how do i get in on that action

459739
put	get
why how does it get put on the main thread in wpf

459757
int	boolean
null is essentially the zero address and is treated as such in comparisons and i believe would be promoted to an int for the boolean check

459806
int	boolean
null means nothing neither true or false or a boolean value or int or string

459826
hash	md5
you can hash your sql query using md5 and use that as a lookup key before going to database

459854
cpu	processors
it will tell you the number of cpu cycles executed since the processors was booted

459899
width	margin
it adds the margin onto this such that the element has 100 width

459899
width	margin
if you want to get around this add a div or something above the nested table with a margin 3em and you can leave the width of the table at 100

459918
textview	imageview
i have a cocoa app i m writing that has an imageview with a textview as a subview sitting on top of the imageview

459918
textview	imageview
i have two functions one that updates the image in the imageview and one that updates the text in the textview

459953
put	get
you ll need to either hard code a value to put in that column or query the sys.columns catalog view and get the default value for the column you are inserting into and use that value there

460062
ready	each
if have multiple independent developments each group should have there on branch which they should sync with trunc periodically and merge it back to trunk when ready

460133
inherited	properties
given the names i would have expected subtest to inherited from test and thus automatically expose the text properties but thankfully i have forgotten vbscript so i can t remember if it even supports inherited

460146
titlebar	window
how do i draw a toolbar on the titlebar of a c# winforms window in windows vista

460168
put	get
if all else fails put it in a while loop and keep generating it until you get one that works

460220
hex	binary
you can use windows calculator to see how integers is presented in different forms hex and binary in your case

460352
versioning	upgrade
as novemberborn himself pointed out i did upgrade sifr to versioning 3 whereas the jquery plugin only supports v2

460360
springsource	grails
i also choose grails over simplicity and there are lots of java lib such as jasper report jawr etc and i am glad that now they join with springsource which makes their base solid

460375
jar	manifest.mf
you should have a meta-inf manifest.mf file in your jar

460389
firefox	safari
do ie firefox and safari handle this differently

460412
post	get
honestly though the easiest thing to do if you re posting statistical data on a website is get the data into spss or sas or another statistics package format and post those files for download directly

460460
width	height
it doesn t make the window really maximized but makes the browserwindow the maximum height and width

460476
fiddler	charles
it s also worth checking your http traffic using fiddler or charles it might help you get a better idea of what is going on

460479
post	get
i ll post my code when i get back from an inauguration party

460488
implements	extends
or by using interface implements instead of class extends

460592
ubuntu	linux
this one is for ubuntu linux - prints the number of connections to the mysql server

460618
opera	firefox
2 the is firefox extension which you can add to view wml pages with firefox or you can use opera which supports wml natively

460634
mouseover	mouseout
the problem is that when currently sorting when i m currently dragging a list item mouseover mouseout events do not seem to be firing for any object on the page

460669
ubuntu	linux
i happen to have my hands on a ubuntu linux box and a deskjet printer hp5150 but could probably use windows or possibly get another printer if absolutely required

460687
profiler	vtune
this kind of optimization depends on hardware architecture so you better use some kind of platform-specific profiler like intel vtune to detect possible problems with cache

460717
profiling	instrumentation
there are two common profiling strategies for vm-based languages anyway instrumentation and sampling

460717
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation inserts checkpoints and informs the profiling every time a method starts and finished

460729
profiling	debugging
this kind of sampling profiling can work with standard binaries but are more useful if you have debugging symbols to work out lines of code given addresses in the program

460729
profiling	instrumentation
other profiling involve recompiling the program to insert instructions known as instrumentation to count how often each continuous set of instructions basic blocks are executed or maybe even record the sequence in which basic blocks are executed or record the content of variables at certain places

460776
textview	imageview
i m not sure this is the best option since it means doubling the memory usage for a couple of seconds but you could meaning not necessarily should create a new imageview and a new textview each with opacity zero and identical to the originals with the new text and image of course and then fade out the old ones and fade in the new ones

460778
pull	push
every week the project manager might pull changes from each team into his central repository merge them and push them back out to his teams central repositories

460782
content-length	content-type
wrong content-type content-length could freak flash player

460803
width	height
the problem is spans are inline elements and you can t set width or height on inline elements

460823
move	drag
move drag drop is nice but can be hard to program

460831
ienumerable	iqueryable
does the myobject class need to implement ienumerable or iqueryable

460847
boost	stl
note i can t use boost only standard stl

460851
ncover	nant
software we used for this was nant cruisecontrol.net a custom code generation system custom app to build an oracle schema and ncover for the code analysis

460871
hide	show
back to proposal 2 build a complete report will all expected data to be displayed then hide show the different sections of the report

460904
pop-up	dialog
is there any ms api to pop-up the uac dialog when i click the button

460954
kde	gnome
gnome and kde look to be implementing a dbus approach to this problem but in my opinion even if it becomes widespread it isn t yet widespread enough to rely on it in 3rd party code it s not the right approach

461016
wicket	stripes
otherwise i would suggest wicket stripes or spring mvc

461016
wicket	stripes
stripes is probably the simplest of the three spring is a little complicated and wicket is conceptually different from the other two

461050
put	get
alternatively you can just put the text in the html page hidden for example and get it from there.

461112
scrollable	panels
i would also like to make the panels vertically scrollable

461148
modula-2	oberon
even an oberon or modula-2 compiler is similar in complexity to pascal

461166
lua	scheme
python scheme and lua all come to mind

461167
width	height
edit i do not have local access to the image and the image url is in a variable with is output with img src ... i need a way to specify the values of width and height tags

461170
forth	brainfuck
write a brainfuck or forth compiler

461172
dynamicmethod	reflection.emit
for example under the bonnet and out of sight code might use things like reflection.emit dynamicmethod delegate.createdelegate to generate dynamic but highly optimized code

461186
opera	safari
cross browser applications can be used by opera and safari as well

461220
pdfsharp	itextsharp
so far i had a quick look at itextsharp and at pdfsharp but it doesn t seem like these are the right tools for the job as they focus most on altering and printing pdfs

461220
pdfsharp	itextsharp
does anyone know another way of reading lines from a pdf or should i keep trying with itextsharp pdfsharp

461223
width	height
if you have to keep the aspect ratio of the image intact then you should scale it by a factor so that the longer side of the image height or width fits inside the limitations for that side

461270
getter	setter
through any number of levels of getter setter

461297
ubuntu	linux
at least with sun jre 1.6 on linux you get interesting if not always informative error messages peregrino is netbook running 32 bit ubuntu with 2g ram and no swap

461408
width	height
what i found out was that flash will sometimes give a width and height of 0 for a short period of time

461420
consistency	acid
there are explicit and implicit transactions if you do not start a transaction explicit sql server will start an implicit transaction for you this is necessary to make it acid atomicity consistency isolation durability

461422
post	put
if you put your repeater inside an update panel when your delete post back is fired the update panel will only refresh what ever is inside that update panel

461422
post	get
if you get it working without ajax whole page post back and then add the update panel it should work straight out of the box

461448
ant	maven
the ant script that the maven-ant-plugin executes is not really aware of maven as such

461448
maven	cargo	ant	maven
it should also be possible to execute a second instance of maven from inside ant which runs purely the cargo goal but in that case you might encounter problems with locked files and the like

461450
width	height
we are using the stage dimensions to scale the contents to width 0 and height 0 in this case

461452
profiler	vtune	profiler	aqtime
if you re having problems using vtune try aqtime profiler from automatedqa instead

461490
subtract	add
in general though there are plenty of times where it makes sense to add or subtract one

461508
jboss	weblogic
another way of looking at this problem is that you want an application depoyable in both spring dm server and a traditional app server websphere weblogic jboss ...

461541
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
when developing in .net a developer can choose from several unit testing frameworks such as mstest - nunit mbunit xunit etc

461616
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
if that s the case can t you solve your problem by using an autoresetevent or manualresetevent depending on what behavior you want

461638
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried numerous browsers ie firefox and google-chrome but they all have the same amount of information

461661
xslt	xquery
burst-mode streaming is available in both xslt and xquery but there

461661
xslt	xquery
is no equivalent in xquery to the xslt iterate construct

461666
ant	maven
take time to put in place a good build process ant maven in the java world

461697
folder	directory
since you mention you don t have access to anything but the code behind and the page the only thing i can think of is actually creating those directory if you have access to do that and using a server.transfer page passing the value to your actual page in the folder above

461738
hash	salt
you could even salt your key before you hash it which would make it virtually unbreakable by making the key unpredictable

461770
google-chrome	firefox
and indeed works as expected at least in windows tested with ie firefox and google-chrome

461797
maven	cargo	ant	maven
cargo is not only a maven plugin it also has a java api and an ant task

461800
crypt	md5	crypt	hash	hash	md5
while i believe crypt is using the md5 algorithm the outputs are not valid md5 hash

461800
hash	md5
is there a way of converting the produced hash into valid md5 hash 16-byte hex values

461800
crypt	md5
i m pretty sure the crypt function used is using some sort of md5 algorithm

461800
hash	md5
what i m looking to do is convert the ouput that i have into an md5 hash that looks something like the following

461819
client-side	server-side
you could use javascript to create an ajax request to a server-side processing script but allowing js to directly write to disk - either client-side or server-side - would be a massive nasty glaring unforgivable browser security hole

461845
crypt	salt
crypt function and will accept salt

461852
hash	md5
calculates the md5 hash of str using the â rsa data security inc

461852
hash	md5
md5 message-digest algorithm and returns that hash

461862
crypt	md5	crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
1 indeed means that this is a md5 hash but crypt generates a random salt

461862
hash	salt
the salt is base64 encoded in the output as the hash

461868
post	get
actions that modify resources should be done via post not get

461869
pop-up	dialog
how can a i guarantee that no pop-up dialog will appear when i automate microsoft excel through ole

461869
pop-up	dialog
i can avoid most dialog pop-up using the following code

461870
qmodelindex	qabstractitemview
qabstractitemview qlistview s parent has a setcurrentindex const qmodelindex index

461870
qtableview	qabstractitemview
qtableview which also inherits from qabstractitemview has a selectrow int row function why in the seven hells doesn t the qlistview have this

461877
jobs	cron
scheduled tasks such as cron jobs

461883
vbscript	jscript
i opt for jscript instead of vbscript

461912
slideup	slidedown
i have two divs and two separate links that triggers slidedown and slideup for the divs

461946
hide	show
one interesting issue i ve found is that i ve had complications with using the visibility property of .net controls when trying to show hide them in this manner

461947
puts	gets
many people believe that synchronizing on puts to a map not a concurrentmap but say a hashmap and not synchronizing on gets is sufficient

462013
textarea	textbox
textbox -- mode multiline is textarea

462024
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
among the reasons sometimes given are that doing so does not require shifting on most keyboards that the words are more readable when they are separated and that camel case may simply not be reliably preserved in case-insensitive or case-folding languages such as common lisp that while technically a case-sensitive language canonicalizes folds identifiers to uppercase by default

462080
idictionary	ilist
without generic ilist or idictionary seem not to work

462089
hide	show
you could possibly find the other divs you d like to hide and put them in a print style sheet so they don t show up when going to print

462117
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
a 1.x panel will render as a div in ie6+ - however in firefox or other downstream browsers - considered downstream because there were no details of it in the machine.config by default it will render as a single cell table - this could be resolved by supplying updated browsercaps for firefox opera safari etc either in the machine.config or web.configs

462128
folder	directory
name of a file directory or folder as it would be displayed in a system file browser

462190
int	chars
is a pointer to a member function of a class fred that returns an int and takes a chars and a float

462207
width	height
as others have mentioned your sprite-bg element needs to have either some content to give it a height width or have those properties specified in the css thusly

462241
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
you use an abstract-class when you want to define some shared behaviour in a superclass - but that class can t stand on its own it needs to be subclassing

462329
post	put
this post sums up what s required to implement the permission calculation and should be enough to put you off from doing this

462332
post	get
i wrote a blog post about how to get started embedding lua and c# might be worth to check out

462351
inherited	subclassing
that way anyone who is happy with the default implementation in the abstract-class can quickly subclassing it without rewriting a lot of code but anyone who needs to do something more complex or who needs to inherited from a different base class can still implement the interface and be plug-and-play

462389
bazaar	git
there are ways around this but with git bazaar mercurial this simply doesn t happen - they realize whether the commits have already been merged because they id each commit across the merging paths it takes

462396
do-while	break
can also use an unlabeled break to terminate a for while or do-while

462396
do-while	break
while or do-while statement but a labeled break terminates an outer

462449
post	get
i will use a good blog post or 2 to get me going then some trial and error

462486
equals	gethashcode
equals the gethashcode methods for the

462486
equals	gethashcode
derived classes that override gethashcode must also override equals to guarantee that two objects considered equals have the same hash code

462513
equals	gethashcode
not directly answering your question but - if you use resharper do not forget it has a feature that generates a reasonable gethashcode implementation as well as the equals method for you

462542
exslt	libxslt
the only option i know of is to directly use libxslt which supports xslt 1.0 and some of the exslt extensions

462547
vundle	pathogen
there is also a vundle pathogen plugin that uses the same code but is easier to install and keeps your .vimrc clean

462562
processors	hyperthreading
the only disadvantage of hyperthreading that i can think of is the fact that if the os is not aware of it it might schedule two threads on one physical processors when other physical processors are idle which will degrade performance

462567
equals	gethashcode
on the other hand msdn also states that the return value of gethashcode should be equals for 2 objects if those 2 objects are considered to be equals

462567
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object

462567
equals	gethashcode
equals the gethashcode methods for the

462572
put	get
if the cost is reasonable they aren t going to put an unreasonable amount of effort into using it anyway so you don t need to get into overly restrictive measures

462581
cpu	hyperthreading
the threads in a hyperthreading cpu share the same cache and as such don t suffer from the cache consistency problems that a multiple cpu architecture can

462611
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading will mainly make a difference in the scheduler behaviour performance when dispatching threads to the same cpu as opposed to different cpu.

462614
nginx	lighttpd
proxy setups using nginx lighttpd etc. and fundamental design decisions are likely going to overwhelm the framework s inherent characteristics pretty quickly

462627
cpu	hyperthreading
so aside from the fact that hyperthreading s extra cores aren t real in the strictly technical sense and don t have the full performance of real cpu cores i can t see that it d be any less reliable

462627
cpu	hyperthreading
of course it depends on what you re running - i suppose some applications might get down dirty with the cpu and hyperthreading might confuse them but that s probably pretty rare

462629
try-catch	exception-handling
client code has to handle this kind of exception-handling enforced in the compiler via try-catch or throws clause

462629
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception all classes that inherit from runtimeexception

462722
textwrangler	bbedit
if the text editor in xcode doesn t suit you i d recommend bbedit or its free little brother textwrangler

462727
getter	setter
it s not enough to create object in ib if it s a new entity it has to be connected to a real ivar in file s owner with properly synthetised getter setter

462732
min	max
i would use bsr and bsf to determine the min and max bit set in the number

462735
vsto	add-in
among these items is a word 2003 add-in vsto 2005 se .net 2.0 that reportedly had been working fine in 2007 but our deployment environment calls for 2003

462735
vsto	add-in
created a clean vsto 2005 add-in for word 2003 new add-in name clean slate

462742
client-side	server-side
the help files explain how to profile com dll s isapi dll s and even client-side scripting but not a word on how to profile the server-side script running on the asp pages

462761
intersect	contains
in oracle we can use functions like sdo_geom.relate or sdo_relate to find out the spatial relationship between two objects contains touches intersect etc.

462766
vsto	add-in
a shared add-in or a vsto

462766
vsto	add-in
however even if you use vsto for word the add-in still looks like a classic com add-in which is extending the classic idtextensibility2 interface

462814
postgresql	mysql
for mysql and postgresql i d be surprised if they did not behave more like ids than db2

462830
textwrangler	bbedit
my vote would be for bbedit s free little brother textwrangler

462866
opera	firefox
pointed example does work in ie and should work in firefox unfortunately doesn t work in opera

mathml	mathjax
for a web interface you can also use the jsmath javascript or it s successor mathjax library as a latex mathml renderer

462934
webrat	cucumber
webrat has selenium support built in and we ve used selenium before but i m curious if anyone has had good results using watir with cucumber and what the pros and cons are of watir versus selenium

462995
width	height
fillrectangle drawrectangle fillelipse and drawellipse all can take 4 float or single parameters x y width height

463018
children	parent
i ve got a feeling it s because the columns are sized based on children but by sizing the element based on it s parent i ve created a catch 22

463054
min	max
similarly by replacing min with max i can get the oldest

463067
width	height
analyze the height and width of the element

463107
vim	emacs
vim and emacs they are the most capable editors and have been for quite some time

throttling	throttle
what i was wondering basically is if there is any way to do broker rather than consumer side throttling or some other solution whereby the consumer can throttle without ultimately blocking

463223
des	aes	3des	aes
block-ciphers such as des 3des and aes can only operate on blocks of bytes

463223
des	aes	3des	aes
des and 3des operate on block of 8 bytes and aes on blocks of 16 bytes

463227
radix-sort	in-place
i ve never seen an in-place radix sort and from the nature of the radix-sort i doubt that it is much faster than a out of place sort as long as the temporary array fits into memory

463302
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
since extension methods are nothing but static methods you could argue that it should be argumentnullexception but on the other hand they re used like instance methods so it might be more natural to use the nullreferenceexception

463302
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
i think i favor the argumentnullexception that s what i ve use so far but i still think there is at least room to argue for an against the nullreferenceexception since it seems more natural in most places where the method is going to be used

463337
hash	md5
i would also consider saving and comparing an md5 hash of the file to see when it changes

463340
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
in that case i would certainly not except a nullreferenceexception but instead an argumentnullexception

463346
button	checkbox
the only way around this is to use checkbox instead of button and make it one big form â or to use javascript

463379
pop-up	dialog
i guess you could open a pop-up window and call that a dialog box

463397
awt	swing	swt	swing
i m looking for a way to display a vnc viewer in a thick rich java client specifically i m using swt but if i can get it into awt swing i can integrate that specifically. this is not an applet but a real live thick java client

freemarker	velocity
either velocity or freemarker will provide the facility of separating your markup from your code

463420
freemarker	velocity
velocity is simpler than freemarker

463420
freemarker	velocity
freemarker is more powerful than velocity

463847
gridview	sqldatasource
so far the only examples i know of are telerik s grid cost implements sorting and paging in the grid and sqldatasource + gridview implements sorting and paging in the datasource but requires ms-sql to be available

463908
san	fileserver
if you do not perceive dfs as a viable approach you may wish to consider failover clustering of your fileserver tier whereby your files are stored in an external shared storage not an expensive san which i believe is overkill for your case since dfs is already out of your reach connected between active and passive file servers

463919
getter	setter
in that case you really should limit the scope to at most a file global by declaring it static variable and getter setter methods that protect it from multiple access where that could be dangerous

463922
postgresql	mysql
give it a hint that you re on mysql or postgresql and it can add a limit clause to your query or rownum over a subquery for oracle and so on

463952

vb6	vba
i understand it is possible to do so using excel macro see programmatically extract macro vba code from word 2007 docs but what i want to do here is to use vb6 to make an application which does the same thing

464012
perl	tcl
i can see how to do that in c fairly easily - it wouldn t be all that hard in perl either and therefore not too hard in the other scripting languages - python ruby tcl etc

464032
postgresql	mysql
ansi sql99 oracle mysql postgresql and sql server

464040
post	get
in php you can just use for post and for get query string variables

464053
portrait	landscape
then in your portrait mode controller you can do the reverse - check to see if its currently in landscape and if so rotate it back to portrait

464092
min	max
the ui knows that description is required and that the item count is 0 and 100 in these examples a good ui will rely on the business layer to tell it for example the min and max but the ui is still aware of the relationship

464096
kerberos	ntlm
note that kerberos like ntlm can also be used to implement sso authentication

464096
kerberos	ntlm
when presented with a www-authenticate negotiate header ie and other browsers will send spnego wrapped kerberos and or ntlm tokens

464096
kerberos	ntlm
the negotiate ssp actually just negotiates either the ntlm ssp or kerberos ssp

g++	gcc
according to g++ -v i have gcc version 4.3.2 debian 4.3.2-1.1

464159
g++	gcc
did you maybe accidentally compile â or link â with gcc instead of g++

464173
freemarker	velocity
struts 2 offers a clean command pattern framework implementation that talks to jsps or velocity or freemarker templates on the front end

464180
g++	gcc
well just figured it out seems code block was using gcc instead of g++ to compile the file

teamcity	nant
i ve written a console application that has a number of unit tests and i m wanting to include it in my nant build script so that it will be run on our teamcity cis

464262
implements	extends
if i ve been misreading your question and you actually want each database query to execute in its own thread then i d suggest making a class called something like sqlquery which implements runnable or extends thread - actually you could even consider using java.util.concurrent.callable which allows you to return a value from its call method which is like run

464309
hash	salt
my program creates script file and calculates it s salt hash

464313
x86	mips

the same delay is present when i run rundll32 shell32.dll openas_rundll from a command line

464418
pcm	music
that task reading a file from the disk and sending it via http should not use any significant amount of cpu especially at the bitrates required for music streaming unless you re talking about multi-channel uncompressed pcm or something like that but even then it should be i o-bound and not use a lot of cpu

464432
perforce	cvs
its simpler to install than subversion perforce or cvs and no server component is required

464463
wxpython	pyqt
i am also interested about the possible implications this will have on their bindings with the most common scripting languages pyqt wxpython wxruby

464463
wxpython	pyqt
why pyqt is so under-used when it has a professional grade designer and wxpython not

464469
toolchain	binutils
you will need either a cross compilation toolchain or to build your own cross binutils

464488
stdout	stderr
what is a little tricky is passing stdin and reading stderr and stdout at least for non-trivial sizes thereof because you need to start seperate threads to make sure the respective buffers get cleared

464493
mousehover	mouseenter
edit mouseenter or mousehover doesn t catch menu selection via the keyboard

464516
folder	directory
within that database there is a table called moz_bookmarks which contains all the bookmarks tags and folder within the bookmarks directory

464804
firefox	safari
it s possible that if it s been built to look nice in safari that it will work in firefox but there may be issues with the rendering layouts in ie - this is a fairly well known issue

464813
int	double
then when i start to get used to the idea that the objects i am using like string know how to perform operations i am used to using external functions to achieve like to upper tolower substring etc they change the rules with numbers numbers don t know how to convert themselves from one numeric type to another for some reason instead you have to invoke convert class static functions to change a double to an int and math class static functions to achieve rounding and truncating

464825
gif	png
i also tried converting the sample gif to png with gimp and using the png as an input for the java code

464835

465390
pop-up	dialog
com automation has the disadvantage of not always being reliable mainly because applications tend to hang due to modal pop-up dialog

folder	directory
i ve figured out another approach though you put a file httpd.ini holding specific rewrite s to a specific virtual directory domain in the root folder of that virtual directory domain

folder	directory
with the newer os vista and win 2008 writing to the program files directory may need acl or be virtualized to the user s folder

465912
folder	directory
i think you should prefer the appdata folder but if you want to combine all the logs in one folder then use all users directory environment.specialfolder.commonapplicationdata and create sub folder inside your app folder for each user

465950
width	height
mainad has a valid height and width however it isn t shown like subad1 subad2

465960
post	get
i may be painting with a wide brush but i find it shocking that most web application developers specifically .net webform developers i have come across have a complete lack of knowledge when it comes to the http model basic things such as post and get are out of their grasp due to the abstractions they have encountered

466009
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
multiplication and division occur before addition and subtraction

466082
gif	png
this works for png to jpg and gif to jpg

466086
int	double
this is a little different than your question because it involves arrays of int rather than arrays of double but should work identically

466090
versioning	upgrade
upgrade from minor versioning number is free

466098
inherited	properties
you have to add the xmlelement attribute to each properties as well setting the namespace properties to an empty string as the namespace is not inherited in your situation

466141
pull	push
certainly these teams could each maintain their own git repository and push pull between each other as necessary which would quickly turn into a nightmare in many situations

466169
unix	bsd	unix	solaris	solaris	bsd
first off when doing ruby development the first thing to know is that it works best in a unix like environment so mac os x linux solaris bsd etc.

466169
merb	ruby-on-rails
i m going to assume you re talking about doing web development with either ruby-on-rails 2.x or merb 1.x

466169

466215
actionscript	mxml
you may have to learn actionscript and mxml dtd

466216
multiplying	subtract
to generate the verification digit you must perform some arithmetic operations on the number you have generated for example adding all the digits in the odd positions and multiplying them by some other number then subtract all the digits in the even positions and finally adding all the digits together you must vary the algorithm a little based on the value of certain digits

466224
pull	push
the master repository offers other advantages as well such as ease of continuous integration as the push pull triggers can be configured on the master repository to fire off the unit tests and build system

466246
spaces	delimiter
in the current case this delimiter will be a spaces

466287
versioning	upgrade
if you need to run test those types of apps you may have to upgrade to a not-free versioning

rss	feed
that is no good to me i need the page to be completely public as it is an rss feed

466394
facade	mediator
and what happens when requirements change and your module wasn t abstracted using a facade or potentially a mediator thus making it overly difficult to swap out

466456
swt	nebula
if you were to use the jface-type viewers swt table or nebula grid both support this style of mvc architecture as do some others mentioned in this question it should be possible to implement paging in the content provider just by setting some custom offset into your dataset and then refreshing the grid

466456
swt	nebula
nebula is one swt table isn t

466458
mp3	ogg	mp3	wav	wav	ogg

queue	fifo
given that a queue is fifo you have to assume that all messages that are in a queue arrive at a time equal to or later than the time than the first message in the queue

466625
serializable	deserialization
i was just wondering how serializable actually works well actually deserialization

466645
getter	setter
if you are using data contract serialization the datacontractserialization then the getter setter will be called if you apply the datamember attribute to the property not to its backing field

466647
super	self
in it you just use super and it does super thisclass self

466695
gridview	repeater
if you are using controls like gridview or repeater and the likes you can simply use

awt	swing
swing is thread-hostile so do your swing manipulation in the awt event diaptch thread edt

466732
slug	permalinks
processes url requests to recognize slug permalinks and then updates the query step to locate the correct post in the database

466737
post	put
because xmlhttprequest allows you to post with credentials cookies to the destination site and read the data sent back from the site along with sending the persons credentials you could orchestrate some javascript that would submit a series of forms including confirmation forms complete with any random keys generated that were put in place to try to prevent a xsrf

466755
kde	gnome
if i were you i would download the source code for ps or top or the gnome kde version of the same or any number of system monitoring graphing programs which are more likely to have all the necessary unix cross platform bits see what they do and then make the necessary native calls with ctypes

466781
inherited	properties
it s ok in this sample but it might cause problems when you inherited the class and override the properties

466815
profiling	debugging
you d probably find that you can do this if you use the profiling debugging api but i don t believe you can do it from normal .net code

466817
mouse	keyboard
if you are not familiar with windows messaging it is a way for win forms to communicate with the os for things like drawing keyboard events mouse events and everything else

466819
gridview	repeater
i ve found that the tests are very brittle broken not just by code changes that actually change the pages but also by innocuous refactorings such as renaming a control since i need to pass the control s clientid to selenium s click method etc or replacing a gridview with a repeater

466841
bufferedreader	ioexception
bufferedreader actual throws ioexception

466861
singleton	facade
there is a narrow way to think of it basically as a collective name for the oo concepts listed in the gof book singleton facade strategy

466897
ironruby	ironpython
will applications written in ironpython ironruby be so specific to the .net environment that they will essentially become platform specific

466897
ironruby	ironpython
if they don t use any of the .net features then what is the advantage of ironpython ironruby over their non .net counterparts

466921
accessor	properties
as a follow-up in the methods of the class do you refer to the internal private identifier or to the public properties accessor

466930
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython ironruby are built to work on the .net virtual machine so they are as you say essentially platform specific

466953
pull	push
i don t have to choose which one is the single central repository i can pull and work from the github repository and later push to my own copy

466954
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
it doesn t appear to be a browser issue as i ve tried in ie 6 7 firefox 2 3 opera safari 3 and the problem does not occur

466967
dictionary	map
if you want to map particular numbers to particular objects consider using a key-value pair structure like a hash table or dictionary instead of a list

466990
addition	multiplication
it starts out with such simple concepts as addition and multiplication but as it explains the concepts it also explains how computers do the calculations

467053
gitignore	git-status
as detailed in is there a way to tell git-status to ignore the effects of gitignore files

467059
opera	firefox
also works in firefox and opera but with a warning

put	get
i couldn t get fop.bat to work even running as local system but i could call java so i put the entire fop commandline into my asp script similar to this snippet

467112
post	get
however html forms only support get and post as far as i know so how would i go about making an http request with the less popular http actions such as delete

467113
put	get
i have a few months of experience with web application development with an mvc framework cakephp so i get the basics but i began to see a theme that made me think i m taking a flawed approach to where i put my logic

467171
gtkmm	glibmm
if you program with gtkmm or use glibmm that should be the first choice it uses utf-8 internally

467173
webkit	gecko
most html email clients use internet explorer bits webkit bits or gecko bits to render the html

467178
put	get
at this point it seems as though the calls to the com object get put on a stack and they get processed on a fifo basis

467239
post	get
aside from catalyst cgi has a standard way to send in parameters via get or post and cgi.pm makes it easy

467268
tiff	png
the story around pdf a is a lot more complex than format conversions like tiff to png

467299
hash	md5
for example when generating session ids on a server why just not do something simple like apply an md5 hash to the concatenation of an appropriate subset of the following client machine ip address sequentially incremented counter fixed secret constant of your choice output from random number generator of your choice etc.

467363
backtracking	greedy
for your code to work spirit would need to recognize that the greedy print_p matched too much and then backtracking to allow matching less

467363
backtracking	greedy
but although spirit will backtracking it won t backtracking to the middle of what a sub-parser would otherwise greedy match

467363
backtracking	greedy
see exhaustive backtracking and greedy rd in the spirit documentation

467382
regexbuddy	rubular
by the way this regex works in regexbuddy in ruby mode but not at the rubular site

467394
cpu	processors
i m interested in creating software games for sony playstation 2 consoles since they contain powerful processors for graphics gpus floating-point calculations and general cpu

467402
hide	show
i have a datagridview form in my .net application and i d like to be able to show or hide additional columns based on a boolean value at run time

467402
hide	show
what s the best way to show hide these columns in code as opposed to in the forms designer

467409
getter	setter
i personaly only access the variable through its getter setter if it has one

467418
int	double	int	boolean
the surprising thing is that a single matlab data type may match different java data types logical matches boolean byte short int long float and double in that order of precedence

467432
opera	firefox
according to w3schools window.top is supported in ie since v4 firefox v1 and opera v9

467596
action-filter	onactionexecuting
you could create an action-filter that implements onactionexecuting which fires before the controller action is invoked

467618
int	boolean
if you try parse as in the first instance with an invalid int you ll get an exception while in the tryparse it returns a boolean letting you know whether the parse succeeded or not

467629
int	boolean
oh and by the way now i look at your question again perhaps one of the reasons it isn t working is that the line will return a boolean rather than the int you want it to

467657
japplet	jwindow	japplet	jdialog	jwindow	jdialog
swing is lightweight but even it has heavyweight components like jwindow jframe jdialog and japplet

467688
atof	strtod
you can use the atof or strtod functions from c or

467696
vmware	virtualbox
it was developed with only various versions of windows in mind and from my experience there s always some sort of problem running any linux distro under it. i would recommend vmware as suggested above or alternatively virtualbox which has worked very well for me in the past it runs certain linux distros best though i can t remember which ones

467705
awt	swing
i suppose in theory you could have some sort of framebuffer device and have swing draw directly to that but a as you noted swing is based on awt and awt does not work like that and b it would still be the os that implements the framebuffer device

467706
swt	swing
if you re worried about the performance or bloat of swing check out swt

467739
vim	textmate
i m getting back in touch with my inner g vim due to an unscheduled macbook mother board of a meltdown my emergency backup linux box won t run textmate

467754
ubuntu	debian
the cell sdk is available as well and could potentially provide better integration and packages are available for rhel 5.2 and fedora 9 should be able to use alien to pull these into debian ubuntu but not sure on that

467772
csv	tsv
i would be far more worried about a custom backup restore based on a fragile format like csv tsv failing

467776
udp	tcp
real streaming protocols such as rtsp are a lot more complex and usually use udp instead of tcp

467789
versioning	upgrade
and even in the future if we do upgrade to .net i think most of the tests that i ve written should be helpful in validating the correct behavior and should be upgradable to a .net versioning too i guess

467943
width	height
in that example you have to set the div height width to that of the image

467987
subtract	add
a method i often use for this sort of problem is to iteratively add and subtract code until i can narrow it down to the one thing that caused the problem

468006
composite	command-pattern
actually i d be tempted to turn it into command-pattern along with composite

468033
rss	feed
the twitter atom feed requires your login and password obviously which is nicely supported by ie7 apparently ie7 can t handle rss feed with login pw

468059
ubuntu	linux
however in ubuntu linux when i compile the same java application and resize my window the canvas stays the same size

468140
button	checkbox
one option if you have a checkbox would be to have to take action button on the screen with each having a implied value that you would have used a checkbox for

468140
button	checkbox
for example you could have a button labeled come straight home from work and stop at the grocery on the way home from work instead of a checkbox for the pick up milk option

468140
button	checkbox
by putting the checkbox values on the action button the user has to consider the option and make a conscious choice

468143
folder	directory
if you get the properties of a large directory in explorer the time it takes to give you the folder size is proportional to the number of files sub-directories it contains

468183
opera	firefox
or if you want get firefox or opera go to any site say stackoverflow.com or w3schools.com view the source edit away and then apply the changes

468239
int	boolean
type generally refers to the classification of primitive values - int strings arrays boolean null etc

468357
put	get
you should find this is all transparently handled for you - if you put a into the content of an element it will be stored as and then translated back when you get the content back out again

468358
swt	swing
it s a layout manager not a builder for swing and swt that will make your life easier

468367
implements	extends
an instance of the arraylist class is said to be of type of every superclass it extends and every interface it implements

468385
width	height
then i get the window width and height and use gluortho2d to set up my orthographic projection

468423
try-catch	exception-handling
you said that the exception-handling may be thrown during file process so i put the processfile in a try-catch block

468451
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome come hand in hand as both working off a similar engine which makes them the next logical step for compatibility tests

468451
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is a logical choice because if you get it on safari it will work on google-chrome and it has a pretty strong start in browser stats for being so new

468482
width	height
i have an iframe with width 300 and height 250 and when i change them to 500 and 400 firefox refreshes the content and i want to prevent that

468509
gridview	sqldatasource
i m not sure if you are asking for an alternate to the gridview or the sqldatasource ..

468657
getter	setter
is this level of abstracting things so important that i shall spend time on writing 3-4-5 levels of getter setter

468658
folder	directory
so it appears like until and unless i do some manual operation in iis for a folder file in virtual directory it does not create the corresponding metadata in the active directory

468724
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

468745
pull	push
i have some java clients that push pull a lot of data into c++ servers that are written in mico

468750
getter	setter
instead of going all the way and providing getter setter for every member of every contained object one simpler alteration you can make that offers you some flexibility for future changes is to give objects methods that return their contained objects instead

468756
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i am trying to use the axinom cms with asp ajax and created a page containing scriptmanager updatepanel and timer

468760
versioning	upgrade
it also helps if there is a batch file or similar to append these stored procedures together this will be your upgrade database to latest versioning script

468949
doc	rtf
i had made an application in c# to merge rtf files into one doc iam hopeful it should work for doc and docx files as well

469094
awt	swing
ibm used to have a remote awt long ago before swing iirc

469251
.nettiers	codesmith
i ve used both codesmith with .nettiers and more recently t4

469453
accessor	properties
if it were a simple collection i d say just wrap a framework treeview control in a custom user control and hide the nodes properties exposing only the accessor and mutators you want

469462
sysml	uml
pavel hruby has some nice stencils for uml and sysml on his site

469496
google-chrome	firefox
if you were designing a core business intranet app for a small business and wanted it to be as responsive-feeling as possible where the staff are indifferent to being stuck with a certain browser would you design for firefox google-chrome or test more widely than you need to just to avoid lock-in

469507
google-chrome	firefox
technically we re an ie shop here but i make sure all my apps function on at least ie and firefox and i m doing more testing in google-chrome as well

469532
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome i tried have no issues what-so-ever

469577
inherited	properties
but if the class is inherited virtual allows the properties get set to be overriden so the behavior is no longer fully encapsulated and controlled so it can break in theory

469577
inherited	properties
it is not wrong to use properties in a constructor if you know you who what is ever going to inherited from the class but it isn t officially best practice

469634
google-chrome	firefox
i think ie and firefox ie especially are designed for standards conformance where as google-chrome might be lenient especially to work great with google apps which themselves are not really w3c spec conformant

469703
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
it s not open-source or free but check out chart director - they have a free download no time-limit it s cross-platform windows linux solaris freebsd mac and the charts look better than what i ve seen on cpan

469707
put	get
can these be put into a query so that i just get the 2 columns

469922
getter	setter
if you provide a setter you don t also have to provide a getter

469974
put	get
so every time code gets changed reviewed you need to look for something in quotes and yes you can filter out the empty strings but i tell people it is good practice to never put strings in quotes unless you know it won t get localized

470023
notepad	textpad
vim on cygwin textpad notepad and various ides eclipse ms vs c++ ms vs vb6 etc

470060
int	double	int	boolean
according to the vb6 documentation isnumeric returns true if the data type of expression is boolean byte decimal double int long sbyte short single uinteger ulong or ushort or an object that contains one of those numeric types

470066
uilabel	uitextview
the view contains two uitextfields a couple uilabel and a uitextview

470071
int	double
decimal double int long

470071
int	double
you might try converting it to a double and then to an int

470078
post	put
if you want to use embed or object to inline your pdf you can put a button on your fillable pdf and have that button use submitform with csubmitas set to pdf and curl set to the http you want to post to

470102
google-chrome	firefox
speedwise you re not going to find significant gains choosing one over the other unless you re doing specific tasks that play towards their strengths look at the range in benchmarking for instance some google tests have google-chrome hundreds of times faster where as others have firefox beating google-chrome

470175
children	parent
until i renamed the navigation properties to parent and children respectively

470175
children	parent
the toughest part was figuring out which is which which i did by noting the multiplicity property on the navigationproperty objects 0..1 for parent for children

470255
mp3	ogg
you are no doubt familiar with mp3 and ogg technology though i have a feeling from your question that you are interested in getting back a pcm file with a lower sampling rate

470267
int	double
this one s an overflow but i think it illustrates the unreliability of isnumeric in general especially for int - for double it s much more reliable

470279
webkit	gecko
we ve got a couple systems like this where technically they only support one browser but we make really sure they at least function even if they re not pretty across the ie - gecko - webkit universe

470284
int	chars
i should then be able to turn u2122 into u2122 and ae into u00ae relatively easily using chars base-10 int value of uxxxx or xx in a match and replace loop using regular expressions

470294
folder	directory
the gratuitous new names of directory unix folder mac windows etc

470302
gridview	objectdatasource
i can bind objectdatasource with a list of blah to a gridview but i can t make it sortable since the datasource is not datatable

470306
docx	xlsx
even better if you make the zipping intelligent and use no compression when you re zipping large already compressed files mp3 zip docx xlsx jpg gif etc and using high compression when you have simple text files txt xml doc xls etc as they will zip very quickly even with heavy compression

470309
post	get
edit it appears that there s no way to get rid of the http headers so now my question is can i craft a custom post request that will minimize on what is sent in the header

470323
inherited	properties
so i made an object reminder that inherited from the linq to sql object fnrthu_reminderbytaskresult with the properties i wanted

470352
daemon	cron
an important point might be that rather than having a cron job run once every second have a always-running daemon that s automatically restarted on exit - or something like that

470355
pop-up	dialog
setting it to 0 provides a pop-up dialog with the exception otherwise being buried

470377
globalization	localization
you will want to look at the section of the msdn documentation that deals with localization and globalization of asp.net apps

470406
g++	gcc
besides that with msvc++ and gcc you can look at the generated assembly for a file which can give you some hints with gcc it s g++ -s foo.cpp for msvc++ it s fas

470442
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
svn has great tool support including ankhsvn and visualsvn for vs2008 integration and distributed version control systems like mercurial git or bazaar will give you even more options and the price of much more basic tool support

470451
integer	unsigned
that will wrap around because size returns an unsigned integer type

470547
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
i try to steer clear of them for this reason horizontalalignment and verticalalignment don t work as expected but i got your code to work with these minor modifications binding the width and height of the control to the canvas s actualwidth actualheight

470572
ati	nvidia
one thing i can tell you for sure as of december of 2008 nvidia and ati did not have managed classes for their gpus

470595
post	get
take a look at which creates a hidden iframe copies the input control and uses the iframe to perform the post to get the file on the server

470595
pop-up	dialog
if you re looking for the behavior where when the user clicks attach file and the file browsing dialog automatically pop-up that can be done via javascript but doesn t work in firefox which has the security precaution of requiring the user to invoke the browse button directly rather than programmatically through script

470600
post	get
2 you need to post picked status to the server and get some response two solutions

470600
post	get
also don t impose ajax to your client the highest part of navigation should be handled with get post at primary level then adding non intrusive ajax to navigate

470631
doc	rtf
i had made an application in c# to merge rtf files into one doc iam hopeful it should work for doc and docx files as well

470647
width	height
x 46765 autostart false width 0 height 0 id sound1 enablejavascript true

470647
width	height
object type application x-mplayer2 height 0 width 0 id sound1

470683
free	malloc
are decent implementations of malloc free garbage collection fast enough that it s only a bottleneck in a few corner cases or would most performance-critical software benefit significantly from trying to keep the amount of memory allocations down or having a faster malloc free garbage collection implementation

470692
client-side	server-side
client-side scripting w javascript server-side scripting with php ruby python perl

470710
free	malloc
in games i ve seen calls to malloc free consume as much as 15 of the cpu in poorly written products or with carefully written and optimized block allocators as little as 5

470725
post	get
spam comments at end of this post but the gist is that you can probaby get away with anything if you are working on your own creative product development project

470726
int	double
particularly the new int add and new double add

470726
put	get
i can omit the new but then i just get compiler warnings which amount to i think i m hiding this method you need to rename it method or put new on it

470756
mouseup	mousedown
that is on a mousedown i want the menu to come up and on a mouseup i want the menu to disappear selecting the active item if any

470793
serializable	deserialization
the deserialization of serializable objects ought to happen in the clr anyhow

470806
debian	linux
i only have debian linux on hand so please don t offer windows or mac solutions

470835
memcpy	malloc
also iteration may not allocate any heap memory so no new or malloc at any stage and no memcpy

470846
user-controls	elementhost
i have a winform that uses an elementhost to display a wpf user-controls

470890
vmware	virtualbox
i ve noticed i get about 20 of the network speed of vmware from virtualbox

470984
tinyint	boolean
when dealing with mysql i typically use the boolean type which is equivalent to tinyint 1 or 1 0

rss	feed
i am trying to take several rss feed and put the content of them into a mysql database using php

471103
rss	feed
after i store this content i will display on my own page and also combine the content into one single rss feed

471103
rss	feed
i haven t dealt with rss feed before so i am wondering the best framework method of doing this is

471159
post	get
did you tried get instead of post which sends additional data in headers

471159
post	get
for example in rest-ful api post request is equivalent to create update delete and get to read and that might break the offline mode

471165
mp3	wav
these are not mp3 files and do not have any id3 or other meta data but plain wav files

471175
addclass	removeclass	mouseup	mousedown
if so binding the mousedown mouseup envents to addclass removeclass methods should do the trick

471241
width	height
but for some types the variable type is replaced by more helpful information such as x 0.0 y 0.0 width 0.0 height 0.0 for a rectanglef

471259
trac	bugzilla
trac s issue tracking is little better than bugzilla s...i know a lot of folks love trac but i find it very inflexible

471279
vim	emacs
i want my application to be extendable in an emacs vim sort of way via scripts

471362
post	get
this causes an error that it s trying to get the title and vote value where the post id the vote value id

471398
folder	directory
it turns out that when validation is turned off typing in a directory name that ends in a will still change the folder being displayed but typing in a directory name that does not end in a will not

471424
installation	upgrade
configuring installers for new installation and upgrade

471426
dxcore	coderush
you can create such a function yourself using devexpress free dxcore product the same extensibility framework used to create coderush

471474
multiplying	add
if you don t as time goes on programs tend to suffer the death of a thousand cuts as the effect of functions that are 5-20 slower than they need to be add up and indeed multiplying

471618
versioning	upgrade
when versioning 2 of that code is released i want to be able to upgrade my customised versioning with all of the versioning 2 changes retaining my customisations

471636
opera	firefox
i have a centered ul styled like a table ala cssplay that is having li elements added to it after page render and it seems to work beautifully in everything but firefox and opera

471636
opera	firefox
for whatever reason it seems like firefox 3.05 and opera 9.63 keep the ul at the initial draw width after the third li is added even though there is no width specified anywhere in the css

471637
nant	cruisecontrol
you should be able to create a simple batch file to run qtp which can then be invoked via nant and or cruisecontrol

471651
hudson	bamboo
my suggestion would be to use a continuous integration server like hudson or bamboo

471668
mouseleave	mouseenter
the top div is hidden but slides in to partially cover the bottom div on mouseenter and then out again on mouseleave

471725
wxpython	pyqt
you can write cross platform guis using a number of different frameworks like wxpython pyqt etc

471739
cobertura	emma
further a code coverage tool like cobertura or emma

471754
stdout	stderr
also for reasons that i forgot i immediately fork again and then in that child re-open stdin stdout and stderr

471779
ready	each
if they can not think of any possible solutions and possible outcomes of each solution then they are not ready to step up to this problem

471792
pull	push
however both examples listed by you are using ajax to pull information not push it

471804
rss	feed
i have used it for several years to grab rss feed

471881
post	get
i haven t used it very much but i do use its companion command-line utilities get post etc. a bit and they have a useful set of functionality

471889
x86	64bit
for example when a .net application is running in 64bit systems the clr can either be loaded from c windows microsoft.net framework64 v2.0.50727 anycpu x64 compilation targets or from c windows microsoft.net framework v2.0.50727 x86 compilation target

471905
nsstring	nsdata
fyi the property list classes are nsdictionary nsarray nsstring nsdate nsdata and nsnumber

471915

sorry if i have misunderstood you but i think you just want to do the standard pull and push

471991
sdl	ncurses
some libraries attempt to provide portable keyboard input facilities such as sdl and ncurses

472004
equals	compareto
especially know the difference between equals hashcode and compareto and what it takes to implement them correctly

472015
alloca	malloc
is there a way to use the new keyword to allocate on the stack ala alloca instead of heap malloc

472028
free	alloca
however while using alloca and in-place new ensures that the memory is free on return you give up automatic destructor calling

472036
opera	firefox
i m wondering if you might have found a bug in firefox and opera i guess where the page isn t reflowed properly when things are inserted via javascript

472059
onchange	onblur
suppose i connect logging functions to the filteringselect s events onchange and onblur i get the following play-by-play sequence

472068
mouse	keyboard
you ll never be able to block users from refreshing either with their keyboard or pushing the refresh using their mouse

472090
spaces	linefeed
how can i remove the spaces and linefeed in c#

472133
free	malloc
i know i can manage my own memory by overriding new and delete to use malloc and free but if i did that i d rather the garbage collector not run at all

472146
atomic	interlocked
read and write using atomic interlocked functions example interlockedincrement on windows

472158
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
take a look to sorteddictionary and sortedlist

472158
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

472158
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist

472166
post	get
one thing that i do is set a value in a hidden field on the page then writing the necessary javascript to extract that value this is nice because i can change that hidden field via javascript and when if the page post back i can get that new value from code behind as well

472174
free	malloc
if you want to use malloc and free use std.c.stdlib

472180
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the issue you have is that objectoutputstream writes a header and objectinputstream reads that header

472180
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
solution always create the objectoutputstream first and flush it before creating the objectinputstream

472189
profiling	debugging
you d have to use the debugging profiling api

472208
mp3	aiff	mp3	wav	wav	aiff
naudio is an open source .net audio library that can play back wav mp3 wma aac and aiff files making use of acm or media foundation codecs installed on your computer for decompression purposes

472210
try-catch	exception-handling
a basic workaround is to just put the offending statement in a try-catch and discard the exception-handling

472258
for-loop	arrays
for arrays the c# compiler emits largely the same code for foreach as it would for an equivalent for-loop

472259
google-chrome	safari
everything was fine until i tested using google-chrome and safari and found it didn t work

472263
post	get
each of those supports get and post and each of those may or may not be available or work depending on the php version and configuration

472266
folder	directory
the folder you see in visual studio are not normal folder directory

472283
for-loop	loops
the conclusion of the article is that using for-loop is generally better and faster than the foreach loops

472312
cpython	ironpython
are always integrated in cpython first and you have to wait until they are implemented in ironpython

472312
cpython	ironpython
extensions one of the strengths of python are the thousands of extensions which are all usable by cpython as you mentioned mathematical problems numpy might be a suitable fast package for you which might not run as expected under ironpython although ironclad

472312
wxpython	pyqt
especially under windows you have a native gui-toolkit with wxpython which also looks great under several other platforms and there are pyqt and a lot of other toolkits

472312
cpython	ironpython
platform independence if this is an issue cpython is ported to really a lot of platforms whereas ironpython can only be used on the major platforms recently read a developer was sad that he couldn t get mono to run under his aix

472312
cpython	ironpython
ironpython is a great work and if i had a special .net library i would have to use ironpython might be the choice but for general purpose problems people seem to suggest using the original cpython unless guido changes his mind

472316
folder	directory
however if i add a file to that directory let s say an test.sqlite file in the app_data folder or say images created by some other program then these files do not appear in my solution explorer even if i click the refresh button

472333
disk	ram
running an application brings its executable and other files from the hard drive into the os s disk cache in ram

472333
disk	ram
ram is much faster than disk

472347
ubuntu	linux
our current automated build consists of 1 master box and 4 core-2-duo pizza boxed at around 2.5ghz with 3 gb memory each all running ubuntu linux

472348
getter	setter
the entire application is extremely simple it contained only code that initialize some of the supporting objects however this particular location type would initialize just fine but on first invocation of property getter setter it would throw the above exception

472355
cpython	ironpython
we are also hosting the ironclad project to run cpython extensions under ironpython and that is going well we plan to release a beta of resolver one numpy soon

472355
vim	emacs
each of us has his editor of choice textpad emacs vim wing and everything works fine

472379
pthreads	fcntl
i have very little experience with windows apis but from what i ve heard they have good pthreads support so you should be able to use fcntl as long as they support posix.1-2001

472396
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql or javadb would all handle this elegantly at little or no cost

472495
allocator	stl
many of the stl templates allow you to define custom allocator as well

472531
nscountedset	nsmutableset
use nsmutableset nscountedset or nsmutablearray instances as dictionary values

472532
jboss	glassfish
well jasper reports is simply a jar so you need to be more specific are you running jasperreports in a web app on tomcat glassfish jboss etc or are you running it in ireport

472559
folder	directory
it should be possible to just load it from the libs directory inside of our product s source folder

472571
photoshop	paint.net
it s not the best tool for creating artwork anyway you can use paint.net and inkscape for that which are both free or photoshop and illustrator if you have the money

472571
actionscript	mxml
you don t want to use the flex framework so if you re using flexbuilder you ll want to do an actionscript project not an mxml project as someone else noted

472581
vbscript	jscript
there are two approaches you can code in jscript or vbscript which do have the construct or you can fudge it in your code

472634
pull	push
if the contents would need to be dynamically loaded you would then need to use ajax or similar to pull them from the server and push them into the second box

472637
getter	setter
having said all this here are some old style methods for getting getter setter and properties i wrote a long time ago

472646
haskell	sml
this module implements a number of iterator building blocks inspired by constructs from the haskell and sml programming languages

472706
free	malloc
malloc is entirely unmanaged though the runtime libraries are free to use reserved areas of the managed heap to do this

472748
forth	smalltalk
wikipedia mentions the term was used by forth programmers in the 80s fowler also spoke about the smalltalk community

472754
selenium	sahi
it is different than selenium sahi or watir in the way that it controls the browser natively not using javascript and is not affected by many issues other solutions have

472926
bazaar	git
it sounds to me like you could benefit from using a distributed vcs git mercurial bazaar etc.

472951
google-chrome	safari
can someone please help me out with printing the contents of an iframe via a javascript call in safari google-chrome

472951
google-chrome	safari
but i can t get anything to work in safari google-chrome

472973
sorting	filtering
i have two pages a report page where you can pick data do some filtering and sorting etc

473009
jar	war
you need to ensure that the cxf jar is in the web-inf lib directory of your war

473023
boost	stl
generally i ve used boost object_pool or boost pool_alloc as an stl template parameter

473068
jar	war
my war depends on another project packed inside a jar i m working on

473068
jar	war
but when i save a file in this project the jar project jboss tools republish the compiled classes of the war project but does not re deploy the classes changed in the jar project. actually the war project is deployed exploded in the deploy directory but the jar project is deployed as a jar in the web-inf libs directory

473068
jar	war
i would like eclipse and jboss tools to republish the classes from the jar project like they do for the jsps and classes inside the war project..

473087
for-loop	loops
changing the for-loop to a foreach loops resulted in the following benchmark result

473105
bmp	png
also as mfc relies on gdi and it doesn t support natively png at least on xp i didn t try on vista or win7 you will need to convert them to bmp anyway

473119
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it looks fine in ie6 7 firefox but in google-chrome safari it has big problems with what looks like either margin padding or positioning

473122
for-loop	loops
2 try using a foreach loops instead of a for-loop - it may well be simpler

473150
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

473155
google-chrome	safari
will fix the display issue in webkit-based browsers safari and google-chrome for example

473160
auto-generate	edmx
i need the partial class to implement an interface implements interfaces.iasset but vb.net want to place implements interfaces.iasset.id at the end of the property which of course is in the generated code section of the partial class which i can not do as the edmx file is auto-generate and will change in the future

473321
folder	directory
don t forget that in vista they ve also added a little more security on the program files folder itself so that rogue programs can t mess up other programs in the same general directory area

473367
for-loop	loops
i is check to be in range three time in loops once in the for and once each for the two ca i s which makes a for-loop slower than foreach

473554
metaphone	soundex
metaphone similar to soundex and possibly more effective for you

473557
free	malloc
the gc can be removed and replaced with a simple wrapper around malloc free

473568
rss	feed	puts	gets
so i have a little wpf xaml that gets the titles of my rss feed and puts them in a listbox

473590
rss	feed
there s a lot of different things to learn from the code theming compression how to write an rss feed configuration multi-language support .

473600
post	get
you can use post or get for both xmlhttprequest and normal navigation and form submission well post is always a form submission

473600
post	get
there are also advantages and disadvantages to using get vs post

473663
children	parent
should or shouldn t i retest parent classes when testing the children if no methods have been overwritten

473722
accessor	properties
create a private accessor for your class in the test project and then use the accessor to set the properties for your test

473740
implements	extends
each class would implements or probably inherit from a user class instead the user interface for the common functionality and then extends with their specific functionality

473826
post	get
i think that in stackoverflow they extract all common english words from the text and then compare this words with the remaining words of other post to get the related post

473870
many-to-many	one-to-many
edit except it s one-to-many not many-to-many

473891
many-to-many	one-to-many
then when i do this it not only does the new one-to-many relationship not work as i get a nomethoderror when calling say result.find 0 .stat but now my previous working many-to-many relationship with games and teams is now broken as well

473915
boost	stl
should i make my own framework by wrapping up the stl classes and or boost libraries so that if i need to change the implementation of the string vectors lists etc

473921
mp3	flv
i extract the audio from a bunch of flv files as an mp3

473941
osql	powershell
from powershell or just about any external scripting language you can use the sql command line osql or sqlcmd

473974
boost	stl	boost	allocator	allocator	stl
as long as you re using standard collection classes an algorihtmns such as stl boost it shouldn t be very hard to plug in a new allocator later on in the cycle to fix the portions of your code base that do need to be fixed

474031
lisp	scheme
the scheme standard requires that implementations be able to do this optimization while the common lisp standard leaves it up to the implementation

474043
int	chars
you can use an unsigned chars to read the float byte by byte into the int array

474088
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
if the input is required for the function to operate and the language supports it i throw argument exceptions see .net argumentnullexception argumentexception so that the code doesn t do clean returns in the case of invalid states

474089
put	get
similarly if you execute a sql statement with an invalid variable name sql plus will get the column and line position and put a under the offending character

474093
cakephp	qcodo
try looking at cakephp symfony or qcodo in php or ruby on rails django if you are not bothered about using php

474108
implements	extends
the only exception to this that i ve seen is if you have multiple type that have different class hierachies like winform controls you can make a subclass of each that all implements and interface and then extends that interface thereby giving base functionality to a group of different controls without extends everything like control or object

474117
versioning	upgrade
sandribbon best of all when you buy it upgrade versioning are free and the author constantly updates improves fixes a new release almost weekly and you can contact him directly very smart guy and will accept any feedback

474162
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
other useful tools are wsdl.exe and svcutil.exe for web service development and in rare cases ildasm.exe and tlbimp.exe

474192
google-chrome	firefox
the issue i m having is that both ie and firefox are making 2-3 lines worth of cities while google-chrome keeps it in a nice horizontal line

474215
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
i would try odp.net instead of system.data.oracleclient

474246
client-side	server-side
i think this is a bit cleaner and more readable client-side than it would be in some server-side environments

474291
boost	allocator
not sure if this would help but be aware that boost shared_ptr has constructor overrides which allow the user to include a custom de-allocation and custom allocator if desired

474293
put	get
in general put as little in common as you can get away with

474321
ienumerable	ilist
you could make the handlestatechange method return an ienumerable igameaction ilist igameaction or igameaction

474365
getter	setter
if with properties you mean javabean properties represented bay a getter and or a setter method then you can use a dynamic proxy to intercept the set method

474377
put	get
i wanted to create a powershell script for a sharepoint upgrade so i put 4 or 5 books in my library and had plenty of info to get me started

474378
int	chars
for example int bool chars is the type of a function returning int and taking a bool and a chars

474378
boost	allocator
that said if you want to construct the shared_ptr right away you don t need to store the functor somewhere boost function requires the new operator for that even though for very small functors it will use special tricks to only use stack allocator small buffer optimization

474394
mp3	wav
j2me automatically records to a wav file but i was wondering if i could request it to record to mp3

474461
children	parent
what would be the correct way to set this up so that the children get removed when the parent is deleted

474528
daemon	cron
this code will run as a daemon and is effectively like calling the python script every minute using a cron but without requiring that to be set up by the user

474535
equals	compareto
the equals method is now consistent with the compareto method

474551
subtract	add
you ll probably also want methods to add subtract etc. and maybe some way to get the representation in various string formats

474552
subtract	add
in constrast with some other comments about adding methods to add subtract etc...since you didn t mention needing them i m assuming you don t

474559
daemon	cron
the main difference between that and cron is that an exception will kill the daemon for good

474567
comparator	comparable
you might consider restructuring to implement comparable or comparator for your class.

474576
equals	tostring
implements the equals tostring and hashcode methods

474579
int	double
implement similar factory methods for converting from int double etc

474579
addition	multiplication
implement addition multiplication etc

474579
int	double
basically take a look at the api for other value classes like double int and do what they do

474580
multiplying	add
it s kinda pointless without arithmetic methods like add and multiplying etc

474580
equals	compareto
think about whether you want 1 2 and 2 4 to be considered the same or not - this has implications for the equals hashcode and compareto methods

474593
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
some python core developers have recently begun putting together a document which illustrates various work flows that compare and contrast working with hg bazaar git and svn

474658
post	put
i put this comment on nickolai s post

474680
getter	setter
only keep parameters that are important when constructing initiating the class in question and do the rest with getter setter methods or properties if you re doing .net

474713
mbunit	nunit
for testing however i would recommend going with a test framework like nunit or mbunit instead of writing your own in a console application

474717
crypt	md5
depending on your system you re either looking for crypt or md5

474717
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
traditionally unix uses des-encrypted passwords thats the crypt function with a 2-character salt two random characters from the set a-za-z0-9. which is prepended to the hash to perturb the algorithm

474725
maven	pom.xml
i ended up generating the pom.xml with a maven archetype as peter and sal suggested and then moving the existing source in

474730
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
also i should note that the md5 version is not a simple md5 sum operation it also uses a salt value to make hash not-precalculatable

474760
equals	compareto
by making the class immutable as suggested you can also take advantage of the double to perform the equals and hashcode and compareto operations

474768
equals	compareto
this might be one of the few cases though where you don t want compareto and equals to be consistent since fractions reducable to each other are not necessarily equals

474809
maven	pom.xml
your existing project probably does not use maven so creating a pom.xml based on it isn t trivial

474833
put	get
a couple of days ago i took the code an put it on my eee pc with linux just to see if i could get it to build

474835
put	get
i dynamically declare an array of pointers to pointers these are what get pushed because i assume priority_queue stores by reference so if i just put a pointer declared in the loop into the queue that pointer goes out of scope

474903
translation	localization
in the latter case there s nothing to translation and therefore no need to worry about localization

474943
width	height
your viewport just needs to be a div with a fixed height width and overflow-x scroll

474984
gridview	onclientclick
i have an gridview that i am adding onclientclick events to a checkbox column via

474984
button	checkbox	updatepanel	onclientclick
everything works fine but when the user clicks the save button on the form which is within the updatepanel suddenly the onclientclick event of the checkbox stops firing

475012
put	get
an alternative is to put an images directory in the root but then you get images at the same level as controllers and views which is pretty horrible

475026
crypt	hash
also instead of using crypt you may prefer hash because this allows you to keep the string setting for the hash algorithm elsewhere

475074
post	get
do to the number of views this question continues to get i ve decided to post the simple regex that i ve been using in a c# application for 3 years now with hundreds of thousands of transactions

475076
nlb	iis
my companys uses microsoft nlb to load balance traffic between our iis servers

475132
unix	solaris
a nix operating system unix solaris linux macos cygwin and it s classic set of command line utilities

475154
jsf	seam
to do this work through the seam manual and refactor your code for each seam feature that simplifies the jsf approach

475154
jsf	seam
make your jsf action listener classes into seam components add one annotation

475178
children	parent
my problem is that i want to order the groups of categories in the order listed above parent of 33 first children of 33 second and parent of the root node last

475224
inherited	subclassing
if the operation will need to be overridden by a subclassing for some reason then of course it must be an instance method in which case you ll need to think about all the factors that go into designing a class for inherited

475286
interpreted-language	forth
threaded interpreted-language like forth look up keywords in a dictionary and execute their associated native-code function immediately

475286
prepare	execute
summary the difference really comes down to prepare the code for later execution or execute the code right now

475336
lxml	elementtree
one possibility would be to use objectify or elementtree from the lxml module

475388
globalization	localization
it is especially useful if you care about localization globalization in your application

475402
maven	cargo
i m using the maven cargo plugin to startup a jetty web container for running some integration tests in a separate project module

475402
maven	cargo
the web app works fine when run in an installed tomcat container or standalone jetty run through maven on the command line so i think the problem must be down to something to do with how cargo embeds jetty and then how jetty compiles the app

475429
addition	multiplication
this class includes all of the basic things you expect to be able to do with numbers addition multiplication etc. as well as some complex classes like adrian has mentioned regular expressions finite automata context-free grammars pushdown automata

475459
pull	push
pull instead of push you ll use a threadpool thread when there s something happening instead of always having one active

475483
post	get
get and post are just request methods carrying all sorts of information including in the case of a post request a section known as post data

475483
post	get
so while getpost gets the data from the post data section of a post request getquery retrieves data from the query string of either a get or post request as well as other http request methods

475503
min	max
i don t know about magic but for moving to the top or bottom you could just set the sortorder to min max sortorder + - 1

475535
ienumerable	ilist
i converted it to a list since the docs for the checkedlistbox datasource property indicated that it needs to implement ilist or ilistsource not merely ienumerable

475541

anyway i exported the the the xunit.net registry key from hkey_local_machine software wow6432node mutantdesign testdriven.net testrunners xunit.net and edited it removing the wow6432node and then imported it

475550
ant	maven
its one click setup built-in support for ant and maven and works on all platforms with jvm

475601
dlsym	dlopen
after you find a symbol you can use dlopen and dlsym to load it

475620
subtract	add
second rather than comparing the string literals add subtract and such try to use constants final variables or enum s

475658
post	get
if thats the case you can post it back to the same action and in the controller have different sets of code for the get and post to give the functionality that you are looking for

475663
folder	directory
much of the bin directory is required but you can strip out plugins and folder for things you don t need such as visual studio support resharper extensions autocad integration etc

475672
min	max
you d then create a layout with a tabbed pane filling the window and then overlay the min max close buttons on the top right

475673
gif	png
use a gif or png - both support transparent pixels

475691
free	malloc
and yeah your biggest risk is that an initialized buffer is free d without using delete and a subsequent malloc happens to reuse that memory block

475695
g++	gcc
with gcc g++ the situation is a lot better since most of the standard has been implemented there already the standard committee doesn t like adopting features that haven t been implemented and tested in a real compiler and a gcc fork is often used for that

475707
post	get
even on my own site i ve just been using post 6 to reference post by ids even though i still store a slug. instead of post 6 small-rant-on-urls and in some cases they can get even more absurd much more so than is really necessary

475733
post	get	post	put	put	get
it could be that is faster to get the post in a blog by the id than by the slug so put the id for the sql query and the slug for the search engines seo

475762
getter	setter
unnecessary overhead comments that point out the obvious deeply nested classes superfluous getter and setter for private nested class variables and unusually long function variable names can all create syntactic noise within related functions that will ultimately increase their length

475776
put	get
the code is here and if you try to run it you will see that it will some times not be able to get as many workitems as it did put in the list.

475776
interlocked	lockless
edit i have got a lockless list working it was faster than using the lock obj statment but i have a lock object that uses interlocked that was still outpreforming the lockless list im going to try to make a lockless arraylist and se if i get the same results there when im done ill upload the result here

475818
ubuntu	debian
the debian ubuntu version relocates some jars around and eclipse expects the pure version and jar locations

475825
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the comparision seems to be case-insensitive what if i want to find case-sensitive max

475828
serializable	deserialization
my code tends to be slightly faster than his but both are much much faster than the other serializable deserialization options in the framework

475843
decoder	encoder
the design problem i am facing now is whether the encoder and decoder api should be in one interface or in separate ones

475849
decoder	encoder
only thing is that you usually have one code part that will use the decoder and a separate using the encoder

475881
decoder	encoder
consider not having a separate encoder decoder interface but instead

475908
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	webkit	gecko
however only webkit safari google-chrome ... and gecko firefox ... have implemented it so far and you ll have to add their respective vendor prefixes -moz-column-width ..

475928
copying	overwrite
when copying files there is already a progress dialog overwrite handling etc

475953
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython	ironruby	ironpython
i can t say anything about ironruby but most python implementations like ironpython jython and pypy try to be as true to the cpython implementation as possible

475953
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy
the main thing that will encourage developers to write code that s different from what they would write in cpython is the lack of c extension modules like numpy this is a problem in jython and pypy as well

475953
cpython	ironpython
this should eventually mean that you can develop code under cpython using whatever modules you like and it will run unmodified on ironpython

475953
cpython	ironpython
it should be easy enough to write ironpython applications that work on cpython as well but i would probably aim to go the other way around cpython programs that work on ironpython as well

475953
cpython	ironpython
the advantage of ironpython et al existing is that they provide alternative implementations of the language which are sometimes useful for spotting bugs in cpython

476011
collabnet	svn
collabnet svn command line

476020
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
but i would like to keep the auto update so every time i edit or add delete an object it auto updates i suppose i need to implement something like the interfaces inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged

476021
accessor	properties	getter	setter
when creating getter and setter should you also use those same accessor properties as your way of accessing that array in this case

476026
getter	setter
can you post the getter and setter for one of these properties

476029
getter	setter
if you should modify either the getter or setter to take specific actions in the future you ll break your object if you fail to use that path

476031
decoder	encoder
so the implementation is shared but user code sees the encoder and decoder as separate and independent concepts

476071
getter	setter
do not use property getter and setter for expensive operations like reading a file or accessing the network

476110
trojan	virus
it s unlikely to be a generic virus or trojan as such would either have to specifically delete the files on startup before sql server started assuming your database starts automatically or shut down the database then specifically delete the files

476168
post	get
form action same page here method post or get rsaquo

476173
typedef	struct
the solution must work with typedef and struct no limiting to only basic c types

476176
post	get
they get values from post get and then assign the values the user typed to the template

476189
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
i ve used vms with vmware fusion parallels and virtualbox and i have to say i find performance to be pretty much even across all three

476189
virtualbox	parallels
virtualbox also has seamless mode essentially similar to parallels s coherence mode but less integrated into the desktop

476208
codeigniter	cakephp
most frameworks though do all of this for you and in a much better way than the code above i personally suggest cakephp or codeigniter

476272
std	ostream
matrix.cpp 459 error std ostream

476272
std	ostream
math matrix operator std ostream

476359
pop-up	dialog
the dialog pop-up as usual but on the mouse over hint of a recently created file the entire thing crashes with a out of bounds error

476439
post	get
an unchecked checkbox doesn t get sent in the post data

476449
vmware	esx
also i d suggest looking-into vmware s esxi - it s a stripped-down free edition of their full esx product

476461
getter	setter
should you declare the getter setter of the class inside the .h file and then define them in .cpp or do both in .h file

476461
getter	setter
i personally like the latter wherein all of them are in .h and only methods which have logic associated with it other than setter getter in .cpp

476469
inherited	subclassing
subclassing which used the api of the specific hardware to implement the abstract api inherited from the abstract base class

476487
vmware	esx
whether you were to go with vmware esxi the free edition of esx or the full-blown esx is a business and maintainability decision

476508
boost	stl
consider boost as an extension to the stl

476531
northwind	adventureworks
it no longer comes standard with a northwind database but you an download the adventureworks db

476533
postgresql	mysql
mysql or postgresql are both full fledged db s and good for education experimentation

476567
ingres	postgresql
postgresql is also well worth considering as it is also a real relational database having originally started as the much respected ingres rdbms in the 1980s

476589
int	double
this seems weird to me that int double etc are actually not just modifier keywords

476601
int	double
int double etc

476653
put	get
you can fairly easily get down to o n log k time just put the lists in a heap

476653
quicksort	heapsort
this is one of the ways to do i o-efficient sorting you can generalize quicksort and heaps heapsort as well

476717
put	get
therefore small functions that are as simple as get set i often use to put in a separate file as inline-defined functions and then include that file where i use the extension .inl into the .h header file

476718
mousemove	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mousemove
on first page load with nothing highlighted no ugly orange selection box around any item using down button to select the first item the following events fired in order mouseover mouseenter mousemove domfocusin

476718
mousemove	mouseout	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mousemove
with an item selected moving to the next item using the down button the following events fired in order mouseout mouseover mousemove domfocusout domfocusin

476718
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
with an item selected clicking the enter button the following events fired in order mousemove mousedown domfocusout mouseup click domactivate

476730
width	height
how can i determine that width height and background have been explicitly declared inline

476762
cvs	svn
i also hope to get some information about the ability to move between suggested tools migrate between cvs and svn and even between operating systems if applicable

476770
fileoutputstream	printwriter
it also assumes output is a printwriter or printstream one of which is system.out a fileoutputstream is easily wrapped by a printoutputstream or printwriter new outputstreamwriter

476789
cvs	svn
for issue tracking i suggest you hosted redmine ror app that integrates with cvs svn git mercurial and a few others

476790
cvs	svn
all three have good built-in support for cvs and svn as well as integrated debuggers

476791
cvs	svn
basically the things people are using now are svn cvs or maybe git

476791
cvs	svn
svn for version control -- it is more mature and now seems more in use than cvs

476791
cvs	svn
however in terms of sourceforge i think it still uses cvs though there are other open source hosting that probably use svn

476791
cvs	svn
cvs still good support though many people have been moving to svn

476792
cvs	svn
i would recommend svn over cvs although distributed version tracking tools like git and mercurial seem to be very popular among open source projects

476821
firefox	safari
it turns out that there are some browser-specific innertext in ie textcontent in firefox safari etc. attributes that when set are required to create a single text node

476902
client-side	server-side
enforced strong password policy server-side with optional client-side javascript validator

476984
fortran	ada
such languages include b event b ada fortran

477036
post	get
if you can t get it to work post your new code and i ll be happy to help you troubleshoot

477048
many-to-many	many-to-one
to start with you never ever have classes which represent many-to-many or many-to-one link tables

477055
stdout	stderr
have been studying the file system related classes of adobe air 1.5 but so far i ve not seen anything that mentions how to interact with stdin stdout stderr

477088
codeigniter	kohana
i was looking into the same thing recently and i found a codeigniter fork called kohana that includes a nice authentication module

477088
codeigniter	kohana
if you are set on codeigniter maybe adapting kohana s auth module backwards to codeigniter would save you some time

477132
pop-up	dialog
otherwise you will need to find some method for specifying the quarter year when the macro runs pop-up a dialog box and ask the user to input it

477139
tunnel	vpn
by secure line i mean ssl vpn tunnel public-key encryption - or a robust challenge-response scheme

477142
put	get
watch the intellisense or put the cursor on transferdata and press f1 to get the help for the transferdatabase method for reference

477157
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the elements are positioned as expected the first and second div s are adjacent to each other and are above the third and fourth div s which are also adjacent to each other

477188
google-chrome	firefox
this makes it look like your google-chrome sample both in firefox and ie 7 browsers i tested

477257
uiview	subviews
and set clip subviews property to true for parent uiview and to false for child uiimageview

477322
getter	setter
this was relevant very recently for us as we recently went through the code and added a lot of runtime assert statements to validate input data for our classes and that required a lot of modification to getter and setter

477325
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview with a uitableview for a subviews

477349
vbscript	jscript
as well as vbscript classic asp pages can use jscript as the underlying script language

477488
accessor	properties
as s-bug said you should implement the accessor and use mutablearrayvalueforkey to mutate the properties

477525
pow	sin	cos	sin
functions are sum ave sin cos tan cot mul div pow log 10 ln mod

477558
yacc	bison
in order to do that you need to describe the full grammar and write a frontend have a look at lex and yacc or flexx and bison

477578
ssl	https
unless the connection is already secure that is tunneled through https using ssl tls your login form values will be sent in cleartext which allows anyone eavesdropping on the line between browser and web server will be able to read logins as they pass through

477578
hash	salt
while it is true that hashing the password can be effective against password disclosure it is vulnerable to replay attacks man-in-the-middle attacks hijackings if an attacker can inject a few bytes into your unsecured html page before it reaches your browser they can simply comment out the hashing in the javascript or brute-force attacks since you are handing the attacker both username salt and hash password

477578
scrypt	pbkdf2	scrypt	kdf
whenever a new user is created or a password is changed you take the password and run it through a kdf such as bcrypt scrypt or pbkdf2 turning the cleartext password correcthorsebatterystaple into a long random-looking string which is a lot safer to store in your database

477578
hash	salt
to verify a login you run the same hash function on the entered password this time passing in the salt and compare the resulting hash string to the value stored in your database

477578
hash	salt	scrypt	salt
bcrypt and scrypt store the salt with the hash already

477578
hash	salt
the reason a salt is used is because hashing in itself is not sufficient -- you ll want to add a so-called salt to protect the hash against rainbow tables

477578
hash	salt
a salt effectively prevents two passwords that exactly match from being stored as the same hash value preventing the whole database being scanned in one run if an attacker is executing a password guessing attack

477657
post	get
see this post by me trying to get more specifics on the issue

477691
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the submit button works when the user presses enter and the button doesn t show in firefox ie safari opera and google-chrome

477698
width	height
you could include an image with width height 0 px

477701
put	get
with that kind of specs if you don t actively help the client reshape them what s going to happen is you put the number in the offer that would pay for all the crazy stuff and then yet some and less experienced competitors won t see all the implications and put a lower number in their offer get the gig and it all ends in tears for everybody

477726
hash	md5
note that it expected some md5 hash but instead got back null

477726
hash	md5
if this were a simple file corruption issue i would expect that you would have two different md5 hash for the expected got

477729
getter	setter
until i took a class with brian goetz i didn t realize that the non-synchronized getter of a private field mutated through a synchronized setter is never guaranteed to return the updated value

477747
folder	directory
it is quite common simply to have a documentation folder in the root directory of your solution that is not referenced in any way by the solution project files

477750
int	double
for long float double and int there is no need to cast

477769
int	double
there is a predefined implicit conversion from short to int long float double or decimal

477769
int	chars
chars is the only unsigned int type

477800
awt	swing
if my memory servers me right the swing implementation was pretty bad - so you would need to use awt

477844
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
if the former then use parallels vmware or virtualbox

477855
int	double
and an operation consisting of int logs and double will have a double result

477855
int	double
so in the following example the subexpression 5 4 uses only integral values and is performed using int math even though the overall expression involves a double

477894
concave	convex
how would i go about constructing the contour of 2d polygon which is formed of only triangles and it can have holes and the external contour can be concave convex and the holes can also be concave convex

477894
octree	quadtree
are octree quadtree relevant to this

477898
jexcelapi	jxl
you will probably need a library to manipulate excel files like jexcelapi jxl or poi

477940
vimeo	flickr
there is a new idea called oembed that a few sites support flickr vimeo and a few others that addresses this problem

477986
ubuntu	linux
i have configured my django app to run under apache+fastcgi on linux ubuntu if it matters

477999
getter	setter
i hate languages that require you to make use of code generation or copy paste for simple things like javabeans with all their getter and setter

478012
width	height
by doing this you are telling that td that if it s content is larger than it s max height and width it should have scrollbars

478032
for-loop	loops
he uses a single foreach loops as opposed to your double for-loop

478074
stdout	stderr
data written to stdout or stderr before entering the fastcgi accept loop or via a mechanism that is not fastcgi protocol aware will also be directed to the main server log.

478148

equals	tostring
also do yourself a favor and override equals hashcode and tostring and if possible create a values method

478471
post	get
i ve always thought it would be interesting to write something that will look at a post say a question here and predict how many votes it will get

478502
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
no openfiledialog and savefiledialog are both derived from filedialog which is inherently modal so as far as i know there s no way of creating a non-modal version of either of them

478524
superclass	subclassing
from the standpoint of the object model you re trying to convert a superclass object into one of its subclassing types while not changing the identity of its persisted instance and that s where the conflict is the converted object isn t really supposed to be the same thing

478539
getter	setter
this inflammatory article on why getter and setter are evil challenged how i thought i was doing oop

478555
children	parent
i need to write a simple program there will be a parent and a few programs children started via execl in parent

478555
children	parent
children communicate to one another in this way child i sens to parent number j parent sends a message something like -- there is a message to you to j j send to parent number k etc

478559
put	get
to put it another way is there any way to get db create and db migrate to be run without root access perhaps automatically or something

478566
union	distinct
i m not familiar with the mysql tsql dialect but you would have to first select the row with the highest a value perform a union all no distinct via sorting with the row with the highest b value perform a union all with the row with the highest c value and then a union all with the remaining rows ordered by c and excluding the 3 rows by id already selected

478643
versioning	upgrade
the issue is that when i upgrade foo somehow in visual studio when i go to the object browser it shows me two versioning of foo.dll

478643
versioning	upgrade
how can i find out which project is referencing the old versioning of foo.dll so i can upgrade it so there is only one dependency across all projects

478644
put	get
get all of the code and associated data that you have so far and put it somewhere publicly accessible such as github or sourceforge

478648
int	chars
the check for error is very simple if the first unrecognised chars wasn t the x0 that ends the string then the string is considered not to contain a valid int

478674
children	parent
the problem is that odd and even and their css cousins nth-child odd and nth-child even refer to the order in which the elements appear as children of their parent not as children with that particular selector

478678
boost	stl
i don t work with code that uses boost or stl as i don t work with systems that support them particularly well but i have found the following standards useful.

478680
versioning	upgrade
if you pin the versioning and upgrade you have to open your 10 something projects and upgrade the reference - but you are isolated from accidential upgrade

478724
firefox	safari
for dropping firefox uses ondragdrop while ie and others use ondrop while safari doesn t appear to support it

478726

accessor	properties
so far all our debugging in the properties accessor and no-op ivalueconverter s hasn t found a solution -- but if we do i ll post it back here too

478851
int	chars
additionally i would try to avoid reading in single chars and use the various functions and methods for reading data in fields - you can read a whole floating point or int number using the stream extractors

478948
checkbox	dropdownlistfor

479121
equals	compareto
concentrate on things such as equals hashcode compareto methods

479164
inherited	properties
purely on the basis of inherited you would use an abstract where you re defining clearly descendant abstract relationships animal- cat and or require inherited of virtual or non-public properties especially shared state which interfaces cannot support

if you are using html resize the image in the browser by setting the width and the height of the image make sure you enable the right settings in ie for maximum viewing pleasure

479448
internationalization	localization
edit for user-friendly strings you need to go through a .resource to get internationalization localization done and it would arguably be better to use a fixed key based on the enum key than a decorator attribute on the same

id recommend ftgl as already recommended above however i have implemented a freetype opengl renderer myself and thought you might find the code handy if you want reinvent this wheel yourself

480078
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome have a built in web inspector right click and select inspect element

480118
gridview	repeater
i am using a repeater because i have implemented pagination as a gridview was not appropriate due to how i am displaying the content

480139
datalist	repeater
however i think a more appropriate option for you is to use a datalist rather than a repeater as the data list can automatically render 4 columns and it will handle all of the html rendering for you

480177
put	get
the other option is put them on my sqlite database but i worry that that get bigger

480182
spaces	delimiter
i think the key bit here is the single spaces as a line delimiter in the last line 61 sqlchar 0 0 0 status

480216
throttling	throttle
for the attackers at best it will be the same effort to break 100 accounts as it would 1 account but since you re not throttling on a site wide basis you can ramp up the throttle quite quickly

480224
hash	salt
currently we re simply writing a salt hash of the document string to the start of the file before the xml document itself

480234
inherited	properties
the background properties is not inherited from the parent you have to set it yourself

480235
disk	ram
the easiest way to work around it is to copy things to the ram disk eg

480237
hash	md5
you can definitely hash the file though but something like an md5 hash ought to do the trick

480241
hash	salt
you should sign the message by encrypting the salt hash with an asymmetric encryption algorithm and send it along the document

480271
int	chars
if the output is in chars output with length stored in unsigned int length and the matched string needs to go in chars match.

480324

internal exception java.sql.sqlexception columns of type blob may not be used in create index order by group by union intersect except or distinct statements because comparisons are not supported for that type.

480337
ubuntu	linux
it follows what i ve done using ubuntu linux 8.10

480361
factors	mean
i agree on the money as a mean of interchange but nevertheless i consider that as an important factors

480362
int	double
under the covers it uses the same msil for all reference-type specializations so a list string uses the same implementation as a list object with different type-casts at the api boundaries but each value-type uses its own unique implementation list int generates completely different code from list double

480362
int	double	int	chars	int	boolean
the clr allows user code to define new value types structs whereas the jvm provides a fixed collection of value types byte short int long float double chars boolean and only allows users to define new reference-types classes

480405
verilog	vhdl
the motivation i want to implement this in hardware in an fpga in vhdl verilog

480406
post	get
if you use apache httpclient to manage your programmatic http connectivity you get an extremely useful api which makes creating connections and optional automatic re-connecting on fail setting headers post vs gets handy methods for retrieving the returned content and much much more

480496
implements	extends
multiple dispatch further extends this concept to more parameters but is significantly harder to implements in languages like c# not that it can t be done it s just hard

480524
int	boolean
or putting an int as an if condition where a boolean is expected

480542
put	get
and then put it into a generate loop ie it will get unrolled into hardware which will produce parallel hardware for the expressions

480551
hide	show
so in this case it would render a linkbutton hidden by default via styles and a normal button with some javascript registered to hide the button and show the linkbutton

480556
ati	nvidia
as an alternative you can look at some of the different languages for performing general purpose gpu programming gpgpu such as cuda from nvidia or stream sdk from ati

for a bit of review java.lang.number is the abstract super-type of atomicinteger atomiclong bigdecimal biginteger byte double float int long and short

480644
accessor	properties
if your properties accessor are just simple get sets then they ll be compiled down to that anyway so ther are no performance concerns - given this your question should be is there any good reason not to use them

480647
accessor	properties
this is just an example you know implement good accessor properties and so on.

480654
int	double
all the common numbers int long double etc do implement comparable

480675
accessor	properties
the thing is you can never be completely sure a field won t be used differently or the accessor won t ever change and given the trade off in work there s no reason not to implement a properties

480785
children	parent
relying on a numerical trick where the number of parent-child links the number of children that parent is linked to all children

480833
voip	sip
after setting up your asterisk box to connect to your voip service provider use a software sip phone x-lite is a popular one

480867
hide	show
so to show it i just have to hide the controller

480883
metaphone	soundex
i ve taken soundex levenshtein php similarity and double metaphone and packaged them up in c# in one set of extension methods on string

480914
implements	extends
all you would achieve is an exception if it did not implements the interface extends or was the class or do nothing if it did

480946
google-chrome	firefox
for ie google-chrome it works mostly fine but from firefox it is quite high chance not to have dopostback in page source

480965

480975
jsf	seam
i am using jsf facelets seam and am trying to display radiobuttons

480987

481000
children	parent
you can t delete a parent until there are no children hanging off of it

481098
hash	salt
i ve read around and i know that you should salt and hash and possibly hash a bunch of times etc

mysql supports this in newer versions if you use the innodb storage engine but not for myisam

481125
width	height
when i specify a height in the style for any element inside of this ie makes the entire thing 100 width rather than keeping it autosized for width

481126
hash	salt
store the hash and salt in the database

481126
hash	salt
generate the hash and the salt in your own code

481126
hash	salt
i would recommend fetching the hash and the salt from the database and comparing it to the ones you calculated from the username and password supplied by the party that wishes to be authenticated

481182
button	checkbox
none of these approaches worked - we wound up using the checkbox jquery plug-in that replaces the checkbox and radio button with shiftable images

481227
int	double
looking at your code i think you re actually trying to see if it can be represented exactly as an int in which case why can t you just cast to int then back to double and compare to the original

481227
int	double
any int stored in a double that s within the range representable by an int should be exact iirc because a 64 bit double has 53 bits of mantissa and i m assuming a 32 bit int

481289
post	get
edit now the question becomes how do i tell sajax to use post instead of get

481289
post	get
also tried to use post instead of the default get and telling sajax to use post didn t work at all

481355
debian	linux
the machines have debian 4 linux sunos 9 sunos 10 or apple darwin

481372
folder	directory
extract the .zip file using folder names to a local directory say c jqueryui_test

481374

481402
equals	gethashcode
you can see i overrode the equals and gethashcode for this object

481402

i thought overrideing the equals and gethashcode should fix this

481431
width	height
php code to go about extracting the width and height of the really large image

481477
int	chars
or make your own print_string to print a null-terminated string using the undocumented int 29h print chars in al

481496
try-catch	exception-handling
if you don t expect the finally block to throw an exception-handling and you don t know how to handle the exception-handling anyway you would just dump stack trace let the exception-handling bubble up the call stack remove the try-catch from the finally block

481496
try-catch	exception-handling
if you want to reduce typing you could implement a global outer try-catch block which will catch all exception-handling thrown in finally blocks

481570
treemap	treeset
however you can write your own comparator and use it to create a treemap number object treeset number or collections.sort list number comparator or arrays.sort number comparator

481573
hash	md5
you can upload an md5 hash of the file and then upload the file and if the file uploaded doesn t match the md5 then it s not finished or if it takes to long perhaps it didn t upload properly

481573
hash	md5
md5 is often used to check the integrity of a file by creating a hash that represents the file

481573
hash	md5
if the file varies at all it will almost always as in basically never for our purposes generate a different md5 hash

481573
hash	md5
the only reason a file would not match it s previously uploaded md5 hash is if it wasn t finished or the md5 file was corrupted on upload

481588
postgresql	mysql
i m using both postgresql and mysql so subqueries are probably bad given that mysql doesn t optimize subqueries pre version 6 anyway

481625
gridview	sqldatasource

481882
wordpress	joomla
i m looking at things like wordpress joomla and drupal but i m wondering if anyone has personal experience in using and more specifically developing for these applications

481936

facade	mediator
i understand that facade encapsulates access to a sub system and mediator encapsulates the interactions between components

481984
facade	mediator
i understand that sub system components are not aware of the facade where as components are obviously aware of the mediator

481984
facade	mediator
i m currently using a facade for encapsulating the method of retrieving configuration information app.config user setting stored in sql assembly info etc and a mediator for navigation between different windows forms

482175
codeigniter	cakephp
still i don t remember seeing anything remotely as well polished in cakephp codeigniter or even zend framework

482180
hide	show
i would however say that it s really not that big a deal to show hide groups of controls

482180
hide	show
if you re using panels to show hide then you aren t tabbing to the other panels anyway

482237
i2c	spi
i am starting to try to interface with some external components skyetek m1 mini or m1 rfid scanner than supports the following protocols ttl spi or i2c

482268
hash	md5
you can specify md5 or sha1 as your hash algorithm or indeed other hash algorithms if supported by future framework versions

482268
hash	salt
what you should do is salt the hash

482268
hash	salt
you store the salt unobfuscated in a column in the db alongside the hash salt + password combination

482268
hash	salt
when the user returns you prepend or suffix the salt to their input in the same way and then do the hash comparison as before

482268
hash	salt
you can safely store the salt in the db because working out a string from its hash is just as hard when you know some of the string as it is when you know none of it provided the password itself is longer than the salt and long enough and strong enough to take a long time to crack by brute force at least 6 chars with at least one case change and a number or non-alphanumeric i d say

482309
folder	directory
i don t need the actual contents of folder being stored in the git directory

482346
facade	mediator
finally the facade is an structural pattern that is it describes the composition of the objects while the mediator is an behavioral that is it describes the way the objects interact

482640
freebsd	linux
it is present on freebsd but not on linux glibc although both are using gcc by default

482640
openbsd	freebsd
maybe you also want to support freebsd openbsd etc

482685
stdout	stderr
if you have already redirected stdout and want stderr redirected to the same file you must use the 2 special form rather than just specifying the same file twice

482692
integer	unsigned
if this is stored in a dword unsigned 4 byte integer then dates all the way up to 2106 can be stored as seconds since epoc 01 01 1970

482708
hbase	hypertable
based on what i ve seen people are abandoning hbase and cassandra and adopting hypertable

482719
vim	emacs
i m not sure if i answer your question as it is not entirely clear what you are asking why the macro s are not working or which tweaks are available for emulating vim in emacs

482755
config	ini
thus you would be free later on to have config in ini files the registry or even a database which would give you a simple way of implementing a history of config changes

482757

482827
easymock	jmock
there are several ways to do it and it depends on if you inject your dependencies using ioc in the java world we have spring ejb3 and other frameworks platforms which provide injection capabilities and or if you mock objects for java you have jmock and easymock to separate a class being tested from its dependencies

i want these two methods to post a restaurant to the web and get a restaurant from the web

482859
vim	emacs
i don t know how to make vim macros work but since you asked for tweaks for making emacs as vim-like as possible here s a few additions to vimpulse i use everyday

482859
vim	emacs
and the default vim key bindings are so comfortable that using viper simply means that viper does some emacs customization for you

482859
vim	emacs
as for using vim instead of emacs i love vim but i love the interactiveness of the lisp system that is emacs

482899
outputstream	inputstream

what i ve done is write my own extendedjsonresult class that inherited from jsonresult originally to add the ability to register javascriptconverters to the serialization process but this later allowed me to add a checkcontextforerrors method that looks at the modelstate errors of the context and adds and errors to the json result data properties name attempted value message

483339
lisp	scheme
scheme lisp helped here as the syntax for a program is exactly the same as the syntax for lists in general namely s-expressions

firefox	safari
see it as a new safari user or firefox who tries to put the url inside the search field..

483743
int	chars
i don t know why this would fail for a chars and not an int and it is possible you ve got other problems causing this

483751
hex	binary	octal	binary	octal	hex
hex and octal are just shorter ways to write binary

483757
octal	binary
because hexadecimal and rarely octal literals are more compact and people using them usually can convert between hexadecimal and binary faster than deciphering a binary number

483781
debian	linux
i m writing a new daemon which will be hosted on debian linux

483797
g++	gcc
i understand i think i understand correct me if this is wrong that i can t do an implicit cast from a void pointer in c++ but c lets me and this is why the above code will compile using gcc but not using g++

answering to you question we ve been using scrum for two years and our versioning format is the classic major.minor.upgrade.build we only use upgrade on bugfixes

484050
mp3	wav
if you have wav files they will already contain a waveformatex structure you can use directly but if you want to use acm to decompress say mp3 files you will need to construct the waveformatex yourself which is often non-trivial google is your friend

484066
hex	binary
it seems the from a readability and usability standpoint the hex representation is a better way of defining binary numbers

484114
hex	binary
the average coder can parse hex just as well as binary when handling flags or bit masks

484114
octal	binary
although binary -- if available in c c++ java c# would probably be used more than octal

484725
gridview	datalist
in asp.net how to customize datalist or gridview or what ever from data tools to be like this picture

484736
width	height
if you find yourself in the situation where this is what you want except in the case of a deprecated method referred to in another answer chances are you have an inheritance model where inheritance isn t really modeling is-a scott myers s example square inheriting from rectangle but you can t change a square s width independent of its height like you can for a rectangle and you may need to reconsider your class relationships

484745
teradata	greenplum
for that you want to go to specialists like teradata best in class extremely expensive greenplum asterdata netezza and others

484840
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
note better than just runtimeexception would be to use a more specific unchecked-exception if one is available

484840
illegalstateexception	runtimeexception
other good runtimeexception s to use if they describe the problem you are rethrowing are illegalstateexception typenotpresentexception and unsupportedoperationexception

484849
hex	binary
hex is just less verbose and can express anything a binary number can

484859
config	ini
my clients aren t really the type to understand xml and have asked me make config files more like the old ini style

484898
verilog	vhdl
the only languages i ve ever used that properly support binary numbers are hardware description languages verilog vhdl and the like

484925
bufferedreader	printwriter
from what i can tell it appears as if on closing the printwriter and bufferedreader the socket itself is being closed

484934
background-image	background-color
you could add a background-image to your td and wrap the inner text with an inline element such as a span and style that with a background-color

484961
post	get
i have a webforms page .aspx that accepts parameters via get post and returns xml

484972

you can use the listview in combination with a gridview and at least one celltemplate for the column that contains the icon

484999
getter	setter
does anyone know of an eclipse plug-in or method to get eclipse to generate getter setter on one line like this

485008
post	get
if you post more info on your setup you might get better answers

485035

723 - this set of chars refers to a literal int value

485150
int	chars
my_int_var - this set of chars refers to a variable int value

485188
getter	setter
globals over having getter and setter functions for everything does keep application size down though

485211
getter	setter
this expression will transform the generated getter and setter to be one line

485234

485234
postfix	dovecot
you might also want to check out the virtual mail manager command line tool for managing domains accounts and aliases with a dovecot postfix postgresql setup

485297
ironruby	ironpython
given that there are many .net clones of various languages - f# ironpython ironruby jscript.net for example - visual studio is quite a good way in which you can combine various languages

485343
getter	setter
to access your fields you should declare properties in ifacilitytreeitem interface with getter and setter

485388
vim	emacs
but compared to vim and emacs i m sure the text editor inside visual studio is really lousy

485406
getter	setter
java code formatting in eclipse does not differentiate between getter setter and any other methods in a class

485414
put	get
you need to put it in the routedata to get it to show up

485416
mouse	keyboard
the good thing about those two i have never used emacs before but i still use vi for the most mundane task is the fact they don t interrupt your train of thought you don t have to take your hands out of the keyboard to grab the mouse and hunt in the file menu for the correct option

485472
for-loop	loops
this is shown clearly by the for-loop which is actually an infinite loops

485475
eurekalog	madexcept
my suggestion would be to try either madexcept link text or eurekalog link text

485487
eurekalog	madexcept
i would recommand some kind of exception-hook like eurekalog or madexcept that gives you a nice callstack when exceptions occurs

485525
ceil	floor	ceil	math.h	floor	math.h
i can find ceil and floor in the math.h - but not round

485529
int	double
or to put it another way you can always assign and int value to a double and then compare the double back to the same int and be guaranteed it will be equal

485529
multiplying	subtract
you can also start out by assigning a whole number and have simple comparisons continue to work by sticking to adding subtract or multiplying by whole numbers assuming the result is less than 24 bits for a float abd 53 bits for a double

485529
int	double
so you can treat floats and double as int under certain controlled conditions

485538
vim	emacs
as others have noted the editors in ides are sort of limited compared to either vim or emacs

485538
vim	emacs
at the same time both vim and emacs are available when there s no chance of having a full-blown ide working over ssh sessions for instance

485558
jdom	dom4j
you ought to be using jdom of dom4j to handle nodes if for no other reasons to handle whitespace correctly

hide	show
edit a little css js to show hide nested elements no checkboxes

485600
hide	show
if the box is checked show it else hide it

485614
strlen	strcpy
you do not strcpy a string you have just strlen d

485614
memcpy	strcpy
edit memcpy is very likely to be faster in any architecture strcpy can only possibly perform better for very short strings and should be avoided for security reasons even if they are not relevant in this case

485640
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
it would be much better to create an nswindowcontroller or nsviewcontroller for each secondary non mainmenu.nib nib and bind the nsarraycontrollers in those nibs to file owner.myarray

485640
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
you can then instantiate the nswindowcontroller or nsviewcontroller passing it an array or array kvc-compliant object before loading the secondary nib

485658
cvs	svn
very good if you are used to sourcesafe or tfs and it can work in the svn cvs checkout-merge-commit way if you want to not the default but easy to change or just use the check out - lock - check in way like vss

485698
post	get
the first line in the post says it all people sometimes ask how to get involved in open source software...

485738

width	height
this has been driving me crazy for a couple of days now but in reality it s a problem that i ve hit off and on for the last few years with html css how can i make an element that has a width and or height that is 100 of it s parent element and still has proper padding or margins

485845
accessor	properties
the right way to do this is to implement accessor methods for the properties then call your own accessor

485845
accessor	properties
when you implement accessor then when an object binds to the properties cocoa will wrap the accessor in kvo magic that will send the appropriate notifications for the mutation

485858
merb	ruby-on-rails
i d advise you to look at bort as a complete ruby-on-rails skeletton app with restful auth builtin one of its fork here or at authlogic a less intrusive auth solution for ruby-on-rails and merb and some others

485872
width	height
the other problem then is that padding and border are added to the height and width in most modern browsers except ie6 ie6 is actually quite logical but does not conform to the spec

485876
vim	emacs
the clarification that great programmers adapt their environment to themselves may have some merit but lots of tools can do that vim and slickedit so there s nothing particular about emacs in that regard

485876
vim	emacs
emacs and vim and slickedit et al is such a tool

485896
int	double
for context imagine a whole library of math theorems you want to use with int double int-rational double-rational bigint or bigint-rational types depending on what you are doing and the speed precision accuracy and range requirements

486290
hide	show
i have like 15 grids on my window and i have a small menu on which i can click and choose which grid to show up or hide

486572
int	double
this function is usable on values of type double int float even odd ones like short thanks to the marvels of implicit conversion

486585
portrait	landscape
for example when you want to send something to a printer there may be dozens of parameters to be set landscape or portrait

486599
superclass	subclassing
however the object which exists on the stack can be passed to subroutines which accept a superclass instance as a parameter in which case the fact that it s a subclassing is useful used

486617
kde	gnome
the comparison between vi and emacs sounds like the comparison of gnome and kde to me

486641

this is the solution i have working in firefox 3 opera and google-chrome

486674
hash	md5
easy to do with md5 hash values now at least and when sha-1 is broken well you get the picture

putting everything in an airing cupboard if we put everything in one big pile and just let general warmth do it it will take a long time for the middle shirts to get dry

487278
addition	multiplication
but a comparison of two algorithms to do arithmetic operations one multiplication one addition will tell you something meaningful

487278
multiplying	multiplication
so to multiplying our two 6 digit numbers we must do 36 multiplication

487454
quicksort	mergesort
mergesort versus quicksort

487454
quicksort	mergesort
because of the worst case time complexity of quicksort is î n 2 all elements fall on the same side of every pivot and mergesort s worst case is o n log n mergesort is the default choice for library implementers

487454
quicksort	mergesort
given that it is possible to vastly reduce the likelihood of the worst case of quicksort s time complexity via random selection of the pivot for example i think one could argue that mergesort is worse in all but the pathological case of quicksort

487491
google-chrome	firefox
the difference between google-chrome and firefox might be different tostring implementations

487505
int	boolean
on top of that you can get typed functions now it seems you only store boolean what if you need to store an int a string etc

what many folks probably donâ t know is that this rule is already supported in opera 9.5 shipping versions of safari for the mac windows and iphone os and is promised for firefox 3.1. and well as ie6 and later

488309
opera	firefox
sadly while support for font-face was hinted at for opera 9.5 and firefox 3.1 see my comments at #4 below this is in fact not the case sadly

remember inherited is an is a relationship between the base class and the subclassing thus every time you have an instance of a subclassing by definition you will also have an instance of the base class as part of the instance not as two separate instances

488749
superclass	subclassing
the superclass constructors are called because otherwise the object would be left in an uninitialized state possibly unbeknownst to the developer of the subclassing

488850

int	double
in c# when you want to divide the result of a method such as below what is the best way to force it to return a double value rather than the default int

488946
superclass	subclassing
it seems that you might want to inspect the argument list of the superclass __init__ method and compare it against what you have in the subclassing

488946
superclass	subclassing
it might not be safe to assume that just because class a has n arguments to __init__ subclassing will contain at least n arguments and pass the first n through to the superclass

488946
superclass	subclassing
if the subclassing is more specific then it might fill in all by 2 of the arguments to its superclass __init__ method

488978
mockito	easymock	easymock	powermockito
powermockito extends both easymock and mockito with the ability to mock static methods final and even private methods

488978
mockito	easymock
the easymock support is complete but the mockito plugin needs some more work

488996
superclass	subclassing
your decorator won t check parameters marked with any and the accepts on the superclass constructor will check all the arguments passed up to it by subclassing

489000
put	get
seriously just start reading kernel source and get a feel for how everything is put together

489018
mockito	easymock	easymock	powermockito
powermockito is another mock framework that extends easymock and mockito

489036
udp	tcp
the socket api is the de-facto standard for tcp ip and udp ip communications that is networking code as we know it

489040
post	get
if i get a chance to diff them i will and post the result

489056
rss	feed
this would be the basis of taking an rss feed non-full text and turning it into a full text one by following the permalinks given in the official rss

489056
rss	feed
with enough scrapers and detectors it should be possible to point a given rss atom feed out and convert it into a full text feed

489070
actionscript	mxml
although you can create custom components in mxml and in actionscript i would recommend implementing them in actionscript

489071
pop-up	dialog
we have an exception handler that pop-up an error submit dialog that s hooked up to application.threadexception and appdomain.currentdomain.unhandledexception

489074

using javascript with some vector graphics available around svg and vml google maps actually use this technology to do some graphic like routing etc

489088
opera	firefox
tested and works in firefox 3 and opera 9

489116
post	get
i want to get a result set telling me what the highest rated post are

489116
post	get
however what i need is to get the total rating where each thumb-up gives a post one point and each thumb down gives a post a negative point

489120
folder	directory
if the directory for the documents is okay to add to i would add an index directory in each folder as documents are parsed and store a file such as originalfilenamesansextemsion _index.txt inside

489120
folder	directory
if that is not possible create an index folder on each drive and mirror the directory structure as needed

489154
xls	ods
hi i m looking to parse spreadsheets xls ods in groovy

489154
xls	ods
the ability to process xls files is not of major importance but would save me having to save multiple xls files to ods as this is for parsing data from clients

489172
cvs	rcs	manual	rcs
cvs was based off individual files in rcs format and was much more amenable to manual repairs than the subversion repository

489209
hash	md5
keep url in a text field keep the md5 hash of the url in another column and create a unique index on the hash column

489278
super	extends
the reason is that super only operates on new-style classes which in the 2.x series means extends from object

489327
xls	ods
both xls and ods will produce the same csv - you ll have to handle just one input type

489373
pecl	pear
there s both a pecl and pear bbcode parsing library

489438
union	distinct
one performance tip that i see off the bat is using union all instead of union unless you intentionally want distinct records

489441
postgresql	mysql
i would like to port the functionality from oracle to postgresql or mysql

489527
onchange	onsubmit
it appears in both ie 6 and firefox 3 that when you type some text into the input field and click submit that the onchange event fires for the input field but the onsubmit event does not fire for the form until you click the submit button a second time at which time the onchange does not fire of course

489527
onchange	onsubmit
in other words the onchange seems to prevent the onsubmit from firing

489554
onchange	onblur
you could use the onblur event in your inputs instead of onchange

489597
onchange	onblur
perhaps onblur is a solution but why does onchange not work

489597
firefox	safari
works on both firefox and safari on mac

489604
checkstyle	cpd
my template-project for an ant-build-script antiplate has at the moment the following reports junitreport emma-report pmd cpd and checkstyle

489621

this file doesn t get put into source control for the codebase because it belongs to the webserver s configuration

489641
post	get
i get the following error when i try and save a new post

pop-up	dialog
to test the reverse i added a third button which pop-up a dialog with a datagridview that gets bound to the same datatable

489730
post	get
we ship software so that every user can get under the hood fix the things himself and post us a solution â for free

489752
prerequisites	uninstaller
yep...we have an app that needs a lot of prerequisites set up....web service windows service user accounts security folder creation gac bits etc....i rolled it all up into a nice msi with custom actions that can install and uninstaller cleanly

489755
updatepanel	scriptmanager
note that if you re using a scriptmanager updatepanel use scriptmanager

489765
hide	show
in your case where you have content you don t want to show for the non-js users you can just hide it by default

489783
jflex	cup
i m currently reading compiller construction and jflex and java cup is quite painful to work with so i m wondering if i could should use parser combinators instead

489872

int	chars
an int for the length of the string in chars

489877
filtering	grouping
stackoverflow questions filtering by a specific grouping of tags

489905
children	parent
maybe somewhere else in your code you are setting a parent control of those panels to visible which rips through all children and sets them to visible as well

489936
queue	fifo
the file you are writing to and the old file you are reading from taken together constitute a queue or fifo fifo but that s not a very deep concept

489936
puts	gets
on subsequent passes in update mode debutton gets the id from the fifo modifies it if necessary and puts it back in the fifo

489950
kerberos	ntlm
then kerberos will be attempted between the server and the client if something above is not met then ntlm will be attempted

489950
kerberos	ntlm
i currently handle this by keeping track of the request in the session and if a ntlm message is received it disables kerberos and www-authenticate for the rest of that sessions life

489974
google-chrome	firefox
it is only a problem in google-chrome and firefox

489976
monobjc	gtk#
the other way is to split the ui for each platform winfoms gtk# linux and cocoa cocoa# monobjc

489988
pull	push
you can push changes pull changes and clone repositories

490122
interbase	firebird
i like ibexpert for firebird or interbase

490175
getter	setter
essentially it would be a bunch of getter and setter and any one of the major libraries could sit inbetween

490180
accessor	properties
to encapsulate the frame the form which is after all just a class can have public properties that have accessor and mutators to proxy the information to and from the embedded frame

490208
inherited	properties
instead of applying changes immediately it allows properties mutators to invalidate the component s content text via the inherited invalidateproperties method

490219
websphere	ibm
i m doing some portlet development for ibm websphere portal 6.1

490278
integer	unsigned
it s not advisable to use unsigned integer because if u assigned negative values to it all hell break lose

490303
instances	transient
it is used to update transient instances in a different session from the one that was used to retrieve the instances see here for details

490311
internationalization	translation
internationalization is really not that difficult except for finding a firm to do good translation of your text

490324
g++	gcc
how do i tell if gcc more specifically g++ is optimizing tail recursion in a particular function

490329
gridview	objectdatasource
i have an objectdatasource that will return a potentially large collection up to 200 000 records that are bound and paged in a gridview

490357
wav	riff
a wav file can basically be just a riff file container that contains the raw pcm audio

490391
inherited	subclassing
i have a mysitecontrollerbase class inherited from controller - which is subclassing by productcontroller

490444
implements	extends
if you like though you can create a pretty bare-bones uicomponent from scratch simply by extends uicomponent which ll give you all the baseline stuff or i suppose if you re really going for minimalism and you re up for a challenge you can just implements iuicomponent and define each interface method manually

490472
many-to-many	many-to-one
similarly for any of the foreign key constraints which are many-to-one or many-to-many

490540
folder	directory
if you haven t committed your changes yet you can do a revert on the parent folder where you deleted the file or directory

490554
cvs	svn
furthermore the sourcecontrol blocks for cvs and svn in cc.net are more granular and featurerich than their counterpart in the java version but this has not been a problem in my work

490560
cos	sin
let the fixed distance be d then x d cos a and y d sin a where a is the angle

490566
cassini	iis
you could probably use cassini if you don t want to use iis

490569
ultrawingrid	ultragrid
edit 5 16 12 just ran into this issue repeatedly with an ultragrid ultrawingrid

490607
for-loop	arrays
now if you add more strings to mystrings arrays for-loop will be automatically adjusted

490614
cos	sin
if center-point xcp ycp isn t the origin you also need to add it s coordinates to x y x xcp + d cos a and y ycp + d sin a

490635
jquery	scriptaculous
also we found the documentation on the struts 2 client side validation to be less than useful so you may want to consider the validation in your javascript framework of choice dojo yui scriptaculous jquery etc

490642
post	get
the last three responses to this post thank you for the response say the same thing so i am not sure who will get the accepted answer

490665
put	get
one thing extra when i create the cache file i put in a little php code in the beginning of the file to serve it as a gzipped file which is actually where you ll get most of your savings anyways

490806
pop-up	dialog
however a standard basic auth dialog box still pop-up prompting the user for their username and password

490816
g++	gcc
that way gcc g++ will also look here in addition to the default headers directories

490835
clang	llvm
i followed the steps in finding memory leaks with the llvm clang static analyzer but i was unable to run static analyzer on my project

490864
ubuntu	linux
i am developing some python programs that i m running on a remote ubuntu linux server hosted on slicehost

490900
int	chars
my guess is that your compiler is putting int ret on the stack before chars buffer 1

490900
int	chars
so to get to the return address we have to go through chars buffer 1 1 byte int ret 8 bytes and the saved base pointer 8 bytes for a total of 17 bytes

490900
x86	64bit
here s a description of the stack frame on x86 64bit

490954
fiddler	charles
try using setcredentials rather than setremotecredentials and failing that using fiddler charles to find out what headers are being sent with the request

490976

explode	implode
just call explode with the same separator you used for implode

490998
hide	show
that s what i used to do a long time ago for the display property in plain-old-javascript to show hide a field

491053
komodo	scite
i prefer a scite kind of editor with similar highlighting and fonts aesthetics and f5 working but with display of folder and files dynamically like komodo edit and a better code completion and vi emulation

491196
comparator	comparable
comparator or comparable for sorting your data structure to get the top 10 list out

491199
ada	pascal
ada pascal and many other languages support ranges a way to subtype integers

491199
eiffel	spec#
i think about the design by contract approach eiffel and the spec# c# contracts that give a more general solution

491209
hide	show
you can hide and show controls and subreports but stuff like interactive grouping etc isn t there

491217
distance	polygons
the polygons solution suggested is wrong -- the area of interest is the union of that polygons with the circle of radius d around each point on l -- and actually less efficient than simply finding the distance from each point to every line segment.

491222
int	chars
if you just want to open a file whose name is 1 then you can use integer_to_list 1 to do that since a string is just a list of int for the ascii values of the chars

491240
int	chars
index the sort order column and ideally add a trigger to the chars column so that inserts or updates to the chars value trigger an update to the int value

491259
pascal	delphi	int	chars	int	boolean
pascal and also delphi uses a subrange type but it is limited to ordinal types int chars and even boolean

491263
union	distinct
depending on the number of rows returned you may be best using union all on the selects with a select distinct query around it

491323
awt	swing
i ve done plenty of swing awt and i know most of the rules regarding the edt

491323
awt	swing
is it safe to construct swing awt widgets not on the event dispatch thread

491405
ienumerable	icollection
if you do this then there s nothing stopping your callers casting the ienumerable back to icollection and then modifying it

491487
directx	gdi
does anyone have any tutorials info for creating and rendering fonts in native directx 9 that doesn t use gdi

491527
google-chrome	firefox
edit on further examination firefox does not seem to be doing this but google-chrome definitely does

491527
google-chrome	firefox
i guess its just a bug with a new browser - for every event an i o read also occurs in google-chrome but not in firefox

491527
google-chrome	firefox
when i load the following page in a browser i ve tested in google-chrome and firefox 3 under vista and move the mouse around the memory always increases and does not ever seems to recede

491548
int	double
i am c# developer and i am almost certain that in this language an int is always 32 bits regardless of the platform 32 vs 64 bit a long is always 64 bits a float is 32 and a double 64 and so on

491553
sorting	filtering
this should leave the paused view free for sorting filtering etc

491560
cpu	affinity
the information placed in cpu is only guaranteed to be current at the time of the call unless the cpu affinity has been fixed using sched_setaffinity 2 the kernel might change the cpu at any time

cpu	affinity
from apic ids to a cpu number or affinity mask or something

491571

491572
post	get
there are lots of post on the repository pattern the way that works best with mvc is to get the item then update it with the form then save it

491577
int	chars
chars is the only unsigned int type

491603
post	get
having come from a get post world before this i don t have a good basis for understanding why people would go through the trouble of encrypting query strings when using post for sensitive data along with ssl would achieve a similar level of security

491606
public	protected
if b wants to do something to a then use a s public or protected interface

491649
width	height
currently i m probably incorrectly listening to the event.resize event and drawing the contents when the width and height are non-zero

491649
width	height
i ve hacked it for the moment by binding the width and height to a container which does resize but how should i really be handling this

491649
width	height
it turns out i was setting the width and height somewhere in the redraw method i have no recollection of why i did this

491676
pull	push
like a lot of work but i think the result is relatively decent -- a super-high-level view of a project that allows for a high degree of day to day flexibility but still affords one a way to reasonably make plans around interdisciplinary activities once this is done we need to buy those four servers make sure our legal stuff is taken care of and pull the trigger on that marketing push one week later etc

491742
direct3d	gdi
mixing gdi rendering and direct3d rendering into the same window is a bad idea

491751
folder	directory
in an earlier question i ve found out that sadly solution folder are not real folder inside a directory

491792
rdf	owl
i m thinking about using semantic web technologies like rdf and owl in an application on mobile devices

491792
redland	jena
i know that there are some libraries frameworks like jena redland protã gã but they don t state on which platforms they are known to work

491818
hide	show
one option you could check would be to add all components to the same panel with just one grouplayout then and hide show them based on user s selection

491818
hide	show
if grouplayout behaves well then it would just be a matter of calling pack each time after user changes his selection to show hide extended fields

491822
public	protected
they take it directly off the pda they also need the password as the public key should be protected by the user password

491823
boost	stl
i also avoid using pods and instead use stl boost as much as possible to avoid mem leaks and other nasty things

491842
post	get
right now you should get some errors because post variable is not defined and then because you re accessing a php property on a non existent object setdata

491929
inherited	properties
right now since this code was inherited the view states are changed in an actionscript function which sets the visible and includeinlayout properties on each pie chart based on the selectedindex of the togglebuttonbar but this just doesn t seem like the best way to do this - not very dynamic

491931
g++	gcc
the gcc g++ flag -print-file-name library can help track down exactly which library is being used

491960
richfaces	icefaces
this is using icefaces however it will be similar for you with richfaces

491964
ant	maven
for packaging your app it s ant or maven or make

491977

i have an ellipse with x-radius and y-radius or width and height respectfully multiplied by 2

492166
updatepanel	scriptmanager
you could use a scriptmanager with a form runat server in your control instead updatepanel

492190
implements	extends
you d make use of the abstract eventdispatcher through encapsulation allowing any other class to easily implements eventsource while not requiring it to extends any particular class

492220
versioning	upgrade
does this mean i have to upgrade to the full versioning or is there a way to enable compression in standard edition

492255
post	get
this may vary from browser to browser but when a user submits a form and the action for that form is say if the browser cannot resolve that site does the post payload ever get sent over the wire

492299
children	parent
so a postback event in one of the children will cause the parent to update

492412
mouse	keyboard
you can use mouse and keyboard events using win32 programming in visual studio

492418
put	get
we decided to choose php instead of asp.net in part because we didn t want to get stucked in a unflexible paradigm webforms everything-automatic-but-not-so-flexible but i believe a php framework could put us in the same situation

492420
postgresql	mysql
if you use the top solution or limit if you use mysql postgresql sqlite then you can t get the minimum for multiple groups based on name you can only get the minimum for one name

windows	wow64
the seemingly counter-intuitive name of syswow64 for the directory where the files reside is makes more sense when you consider that wow64 means windows on windows 64-bit which is what the emulater that s mentioned above is called

493109
gridview	onclientclick
edit i should note that the link with the onclientclick event running the thickbox is being built up from c# code behind then injected into a gridview

493232
google-chrome	safari
this works fine on ff3 google-chrome and safari 3

493240
onchange	onsubmit
it turns out that it is only presence of an alert - or a confirm - during the input s onchange event that causes the form s onsubmit event to not fire

493241
bazaar	git
in summary bazaar was great when i was cutting my teeth on dvcs but i m now very happy with git and github

493533
gnu	uclibc
where arch is arm or armeb vendor is unknown or softfloat os is linux and libc is gnu or uclibc

493533
libc	binutils
if all you want is a compiler and linker for the kernel the libc part is irrelevant and you can use -s1 --stage1 to inform crossdev that you only need binutils and gcc

git-rebase	amend
and amend and git-rebase as described by jpalecek

493653
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade to a regular standard enterprise etc sql server versioning then typically you get a per cpu license for a web server

493658
folder	directory
you need to make sure that the folder that your header files are in is added to the additional include directory setting in the project properties or is one of the global include directory in the main vs options

493811
subtract	add
instead of adding subtract the buckets in the last row column you passed and add the new buckets

493853
addition	multiplication
i need addition multiplication and logarithm to manipulate my data

493868
queue	fifo
clearing the queue can be seen as a violation of the fifo concept

493881
pop-up	dialog
this dialog pop-up when you make a request to a portion of website where anonymous access is disabled from iis

493892
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
storing md5 hash + salt to prevent attacks would be more secure

493898
min	max
in that case this won t work because you actually want the min and max absolute values - the numerator should be close to zero and the denominator far from it in either direction

493931
try-catch	exception-handling
to see the exception-handling message put a try-catch around the service call and set a breakpoint in the catch block

493951
for-loop	loops
don t think about the situation follow a list of inviolate rules no matter what the situation no matter what you think is the better way if the rules say use a for-loop in case x then you have to use a loops even if you know if there will only be 1 loops from 1 to 1

494047
pop-up	dialog
howabout a pop-up window dialog with a filterable list instead

494071
hide	show
sharepoint s field editor for lookup fields purposefully hide any columns types that aren t supported by lookup fields but you can create a field editor for your custom field type that show them

494120
unix	solaris
the script would need to run on solaris and use as few as possible external libraries as possible definitely pure classic perl getting anything additional installed on these unix boxes is a pain and would have to be done by remote team

494138
opera	firefox
also since you can t take up 100 of the parent block i used 90 and it produced working results under firefox not sure about ie or opera

494154
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
the contenteditable property works in safari firefox 3 and opera 9

494174
int	chars
for this reason you must cast the pointer to a type such as or before using the pointer so that the compiler knows how much memory it s working with 1 byte for a chars 4 bytes for an int etc.

494185
memcpy	memset
void pointers are often used in memory operations memcpy memset etc... since one doesn t want to assume the type of the data at the given address

494249
pop-up	dialog
i am starting using yui s container control in my application to display messagebox pop-up and other dialog

494249
pop-up	dialog
now i know i could use this example for how to show a please wait dialog and on completion just show another pop-up with the returned data

494254
versioning	upgrade
there s a free versioning of an obfuscator shipped with visual studio which can be upgrade to industrial strength

494289
put	get
if you want it to be completely automatic you d have to put all the correct values into an array and get the computer to compare them

494386
disk	ram
an oldie but a goodie create a ram disk and compile your files from there

494562
width	height
this is the label whose height and width are going wrong

494595
min	max
create an index with the min max and no of elements of sets

494595
min	max
then apply brute force excluding sets where max max set being searched and min min set being searched

494602
octree	quadtree
break up all the primitives into a quadtree octree 2d 3d

494602
intersect	contains
leaf nodes in this tree contains references to all geometry that intersect that leaf node s axis-aligned bounding-box

494602
octree	quadtree
a general visitor pattern is used to walk the quadtree octree

494614
ant	maven
hudson supports maven ant etc and supports all the major scms

494650
cruisecontrol	teamcity
try teamcity or cruisecontrol

494760
typedef	struct
the line typedef float vertex const vert means that vert is a pointer to a float member of the vertex struct

494762
folder	directory
for unix based os i-node look-up algorithms are highly efficient and number of files and folder in a directory does not matter

494772
filesystems	ntfs
usually modern filesystems like ntfs or ext3 don t have a problem with accessing files directly ie

494812
hash	md5
we structured them with md5 hash usernames 3 levels deep ie

494818
free	malloc
closest thing we ve done with malloc free for debugging is to

494873
width	height
yes basically the width and height properties of the html have been deprecated for some time you are recommended to use styles instead

494921
free	malloc
allocation from the loh is done via a free list much like malloc is handled in the c runtime whereas allocations from the generational heap is essentially done by just moving a pointer in generation 0

494922
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the following checkboxes are properly vertically centered in ie safari firefox and google-chrome even if the text size is very small or large

495077
post	get
if you re still struggling to get it right post a link to your page

495090
gif	png
as an extra tip opacity and png s or gif s with transparent backgrounds don t tend to play nicely in ie6 and i would strongly recommend you use a javascript library such as prototype or jquery if you are working with javascript

495100
magento	joomla
a solution which looks promising to me is jfusion which is an open-source bridge to combine several different systems in terms of structure and user authentication - this is built around joomla but supports moodle and several forum software products along with magento ecommerce

495133
factors	matrix
you can store a matrix of conversion factors where

495136
getter	setter
it should be noted that it s not good practice to use public instance variables you should always create getter setter to have proper encapsulation

495155
outputstream	inputstream
i have used inputstream and outputstream to do he same

495159
gif	png
they will already be png gif or jpeg images

495160
solaris	bsd
apart from the highly recommended stevens books providing a detailed description of one implementation check out the source in linux or solaris or one of the bsd s

495161
hash	md5
i have sets of hash first 64 bits of md5 so they re distributed very randomly and i want to be able to see if a new hash is in a set and to add it to a set

495166
post	get
i ve never tried it but you can use the referer header to know where the post or get comes from and try to match the url with a route

495171
pop-up	dialog
where freakout did something like clear out the text field or pop-up a warning dialog

495194
width	height
the table needs to fill the entire page so i have set the height and width of the table to 100 in the css stylesheet and the height of the html and body to 100 too

495216
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
tried the following code in ie7 mozilla 2 google-chrome 1 opera 9.5 safari 3.2 and it works

495265
post	get
in order to handle the case where javascript is turned off when you detect in the controller that the post was not done with ajax request.isajaxrequest is false you could look at the request.urlreferer property to get the url of the referring page

495285
asterisk	ivr
i ve worked with ivr in the past but mainly with large systems and have never used asterisk

495290
asterisk	ivr
freepbx makes it really easy to set up an ivr - got a decent web-based front end and supports some cool asterisk tools out of the box

495318
google-chrome	firefox
and i find that although this works in firefox google-chrome and anything

495321
pop-up	dialog
in vs2005 opening a file causes a dialog to pop-up contacting server to get a list of items to update .

495380
width	height
we use sql server and have a window table with columns for id name machinename for environment.machinename userid windowstate x y height width

495380
width	height
so for every window you would have one row with windowstate x y height and width for each user and machine

495418
maven	m2e
i m using the m2e plugin to handle maven modules in eclipse

495431
disk	ram
your best bet might be to up the disc cache more ram and get harddisks with a very high random access speed maybe solid state disk

495528
vbscript	jscript
when writing code in jscript as i am wont to do as i have never been a fan of asp.net and jscript is infinitely more elegant than vbscript you can call upon the arguments collection

495540
put	get
i will put variables into another variable and then it will get re-initialized to default values

495574
pop-up	dialog
if you do manual ntlm authentication with explorer for example does the browser pop-up the credential dialog

495613
versioning	upgrade
versioning is it reasonable to force all customers to upgrade at the same time

495626
ienumerable	ilist
you can use a collection of t instead note that this is different from collectionbase or simply expose ilist of t or ienumerable of t

495647
dictionary	map
i now want to store an associative array of drive letters to map key is the drive letter value is the network path and have tried using dictionary hybriddictionary and hashtable for this but i always get the following error when calling configfile.load or configfile.save

495802
ienumerable	iqueryable
public static iqueryable duplicates this ienumerable source where tsource icomparable

495817
qmail	exim
other good choices are exim and qmail

495829
sequence	permutation
empty placeholders could be used with default ordering and numbered for some localization cases where different languages do permutation of words or parts of sequence

495862
zoo	xts
xts and zoo handle irregular time series data on top of that

495868
rss	feed
with my rss feed

495868
rss	feed
i tried other rss feed

495881
int	double
that data type can still basically act the same whether it s a double or an int

495886
getter	setter
having complex logic in getter setter is not a good practice

495886
accessor	properties
i recommend to move complex logic to separate methods like getsumofxyz and use memoization in properties accessor

495903
cpu	processors
one ec2 compute unit provides the equivalent cpu capacity of a 1.0-1.2 ghz 2007 opteron or 2007 xeon processors

495908
background-color	font-size
do you try to keep positional css layout separate from color flavor css color background-color background-images font-size and family

495913
getter	setter
if this was on a domain entity then i wouldn t be in favor having complex logic in a getter and especially not a setter

495914
getter	setter
i think that there is some level of logic that is expected in getter and setter otherwise you just have a kind of convoluted way to declare your members public

495925
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
the enterprise library client system.data.oracleclient is a viable alternative to the odp.net provider from oracle

495925
xmltype	clob
also the oracle xmltype column is not supported and must be casted to a clob to be returned into the oracleclient

495927
int	chars
why is that you will ask the reason is simple int32 is type int numerical and string is oh well type string chars

495929
width	height
width and height of all textures must be the same

495937
hash	md5
when an md5 hash algorithm is specified the probability of hashbytes returning the same result for two different inputs is much lower than that of checksum

495965
int	chars
x0000f the int split into two sets of two bytes each representing a unicode chars

495965
octal	binary
however if you convert to binary octal or hexadecimal negative numbers are displayed in twos complement so convert.tostring -7 16 becomes ffffffba

495977
fontfamily	font-size
firstly if you re catching yourself setting color font-size fontfamily style rules over and over you re wasting your time

495985
ubuntu	linux
our web app is written in django we are running on linux ubuntu under apache + fast cgi with postgresql database

496022
cvs	svn
oh yeah and to repeat what dozens of people will undoubtably add to this question if it is at all possible to use svn instead of cvs in your system do it

496047
libc	binutils
con you are stuck with whichever version of gcc binutils libc they picked

496047
gnu	uclibc	libc	binutils
set which versions of gcc binutils libc gnu or uclibc threading and linux kernel to build and crosstool-ng does the rest downloads the tar balls configures the tools and builds them

496124
toolbar	docking
i haven t found a good simple solution to stopping the toolbar from being dragged yet while docking next to each other you can remove the cbrs_gripper style however that doesn t stop the toolbar from being dragged

496124
toolbar	docking
however dockpaneleftof does not seem to work in this case so you lose docking toolbar next to each other

496124
toolbar	docking
so it seems like one or the other right now if you want to stop docking or dock toolbar next to each other

496251
int	chars
i believe from an architectural perspective a datetime would be a more efficient data type as it would be stored as a two 4-byte int whereas your nvarchar 10 will be stored as up to 22 bytes two times the number of chars entered + 2 bytes.

496258
ssl	https
ssl through https is sort of a cooperative venture with the destination server

496276
sorting	filtering
the date filtering in the nvarchar field is not easy possible as the data in the index is sorted lexicographically which doesn t match the sorting you would expect for the date

496279
nant	cruisecontrol
cruisecontrol and nant are probably your best bet for builds with flexible output

496312
next	except
if there is no actual next argument or if type is not compatible with the type of the actual next argument as promoted according to the default argument promotions the behavior is undefined except for the following cases

496312
integer	unsigned
one type is a signed integer type the other type is the corresponding unsigned integer

496313
post	get
hope this helps and if either of these give you some more clues post them here and we ll get this solved

496346
free	malloc
and i know it s early in your development but you ll want to make sure you free the memory that you malloc

496358
expression-blend	silverlight
if you are just starting with silverlight then i highly recomend also installing expression-blend 2 with sp1

496364
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this code doesn t work as intended in ie6 7 it might work in ie8 i tested it and works correctly in firefox 3 safari 3.1.2 opera 9.50 and camino 1.6.6

496374
int	chars
unicode defines a single huge chars set assigning one unique int value to every graphical symbol that is a major simplification and isn t actually true but it s close enough for the purposes of this question

496376
pkcs#12	pfx
pfx files are actually pkcs#12 files part of a specification by the rsa group

496426
clang	llvm
finding memory leaks with the llvm clang static analyzer

496470
gridview	objectdatasource
i m used to using the asp.net gridview control with an objectdatasource pointed at objects in our business layer - and in that case the ods handles all of the paging sorting using the methods that our orm generates on the objects

496486
stringbuilder	stringwriter
use the stringwriter class if you want a stream that wraps a stringbuilder

496498
sorting	filtering
if you want to bind without dipping into code-behind whenever your query logic changes you re probably better off using a collectionviewsource since it has sorting and filtering capabilities assuming that s what you re after from using linq

496583
width	height
i tried setting the width and height to auto but no go

496606
implements	extends
if are supposed to implements models by extends abstract models listeners by extends adapters but that s it

496664
getter	setter
a very simple tutorial that shows object creation use simple getter and setter would be fine and deletion would be fantastic

496692
stringbuilder	stringwriter
the stringwriter implements textwriter against an underlying stringbuilder

496692
stringbuilder	stringwriter
then in your test instead of instantiating a streamwriter you instantiate a stringwriter and you could then check what was written by looking at the underlying stringbuilder

496717
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
for example firefox safari chromium or google-chrome and my other next-gen browsers do not lose focus when using a scrollbar

496723
folder	directory
all svn export does is move the chosen directory s to a new location without the .svn folder so it acts as if it s not a working copy and from there you can add it to your working copy

496724
for-loop	arrays
if you re really using arrays the best way is probably just to use the conventional for-loop with indices

496781
jobs	cron
in my past experience any cron jobs generally only have to deal with data as opposed to say generate static files etc

496794
put	get
put it on once and get happy

496825
gmail	hotmail
i want to use this template as an email newsletter template but i ve heard people say hotmail yahoo and gmail offer limited support for css

496864
versioning	upgrade
pick the versioning of a family of processors with the smallest amount of flash on the grounds that you can always upgrade later unless costs make this unavoidable

496875
coldfusion	verity
i then want to make it available using coldfusion s available verity search to search the contents

497020
subtract	add
i have looked at and understand a javascript to manipulate and display a single date add or subtract but am unable to get that date in a cell as well as figure out how to display the other multiple dates mentioned above in a html table

497034
ceil	floor
see also ceil floor and trunc

497040
ceil	floor
you can try ceil and floor to round up and down

497040
ceil	floor
ceil and floor only work on double s though

497063
put	get
the main reason i see to make at least the get synchronized is that if it is very expensive to miss in the cache and you don t want multiple threads each going out to get a value to put back in the cache

497144
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
edit it looks like ie did not have everything wrong after all this is part of html5 draft and seems to be supported by the latest version of google-chrome safari and firefox at least

497146
freebsd	linux
is this possible under freebsd and linux

497148
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if your application code comes from a case-insensitive collation database it may not run on a case-sensitive collation database if a object is misreferenced you would get a message when you attempted to run the statement or create the stored procedure or in a stored-proc architecture you would catch all these pretty quickly unless you had a significant amount of dynamic sql

497160
gridview	rowdatabound
in the gridview there is an event called rowdatabound

497211
prng	random
you also need a real source of entropy not just a prng no matter how random it looks

497221
ubuntu	debian
the problems with deployment especially between debian and ubuntu are so miniscule you can go on without worrying about it

497333
ocaml	sml
ml family sml ocaml f#

497337
min	max	min	median	median	max
as for what value to select when the points overlap you can do min max median average etc

497346
csla	.net
csla insulates developers from the gotcha s of the .net and the ever changing architectural topology at microsoft

497349
hash	md5
stuff you cannot avoid except by being as up-to-date as possible new attack against a hash function or an encryption function see recent md5 talk new attack technique see recent attacks against protocols that send encrypted voice over the network

497353
folder	directory
what i m trying to do is create a powershell script which gets a list of folder in a directory which is filtered by a regular expression screening out folder names with nnnnnnx31 or nnnnnnddd where n alpha chars for the first 6 characters and the last 3 is either numbers of the static string x31

497380
int	chars
what s happening here is that chars + chars int

497389
rss	feed
i have a database with many rss categories that in turn have many rss feed

497389
rss	feed
so each rss feed is pulled out of the database depending on the id of the parent rss category

497389
rss	feed
i initially imagined two nested repeaters the outside one databound to a list of rss categories from the database which displays the category header and contains a hidden control with the category id then an inner repeater with the rss feed for that category

497389
rss	feed
how do i access the category id from the hidden field control in the parent repeater so i can look up the correct rss feed

497406
int	chars
both methods invoke abstractstringbuilder.expandcapacity int which will allocate a new chars eventually and system.arraycopy the old content first

497406
int	chars
afterwards abstractstringbuilder.append chars just has to put the given chars in the array whereas abstractstringbuilder.append string has to check a few constraints and calls string.getchars int int chars int which does another system.arraycopy of the appended string

497430
rss	feed
how do i access the category id from the hidden field control in the parent repeater so i can look up the correct rss feed

497495
pull	push
wouldn t this just be a standard linked list except you only define functions to pull off the head element and push stuff onto the tail element

497571
google-chrome	firefox
i ve got this working in firefox and google-chrome

497589
inherited	subclassing
when a subclassing inherited from iterator it does this

497626
unix	bsd
bsd ftp doesn t give you a return code for error conditions necessitating all that parsing but there are a whole series of other unix programs that can be used to transfer files by ftp if you or your administrator will install them

497643
min	max
just calculate the min max values and use that to translate each number into a different shade from white to black

497695
actionscript	mxml
one s just by referencing the class name directly -- so for example if you d created a new component class mycomponent in actionscript or indirectly by making an mxml component extending another uicomponent called mycomponent in both cases the component would pick up the styles declared in your external stylesheet provided that stylesheet s been imported into your application via style source

497698
rss	feed
it is a great utility to let you create consume and manipulate all types of feed be they rss or atom of any version

497713
post	get
the .aspx file extension is properly mapped to the correct .net dll and has the verbs get head post and debug activated for the mapping

497730
versioning	upgrade
i thought in upgrade the windows versioning to one with asp.net iis but i thought in another possibility

497734
vmware	esx
yes i use vmware workstation 6.5 and esx 3.0 for my servers

497772
superclass	subclassing
another question even though i have changed the type of b to the type of the superclass are the overriden methods in the subclassing going to be called and not those of the superclass

497794
quicksort	mergesort
i was working on implementing a quicksort yesterday and then i ran it expecting a faster runtime than the mergesort which i had also implemented

497794
quicksort	mergesort
i ran the two and while the quicksort was faster for smaller data sets 100 elements and i did verify that it works the mergesort became the quicker algorithm fairly quickly

497794
quicksort	mergesort
i had been taught that quicksort is almost always quicker than mergesort and i understand that there is some debate on this topic but i at least expected it to be closer than this

497819
quicksort	mergesort
previously discussed on so why is quicksort better than mergesort

497824
inherited	properties
you may also create a custom control that inherited from label that overrides the id properties to be what you want it to be

497830
ant	maven
the tomcat documentation gives recommendations for pre-compiling jsps at build time using ant and a maven plugin is also available .

497833
superclass	subclassing
another question even though i have changed the type of b to the type of the superclass are the overriden methods in the subclassing going to be called and not those of the superclass

497849
quicksort	mergesort
i could imagine that by directly accessing the memory using c for example one can improve the performance of quicksort more than it is possible with mergesort

497849
mergesort	in-place
another reason is that mergesort needs more memory because it s hard to implement it as an in-place sort

497880
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu as my linux development environment on top of vista 64

497918
put	get
put them together and you get

497936
boost	stl
for example using classes and class methods and function overloading which are usually easy for even c diehards to cope with but not the stl stream operators and boost which are harder to learn and can have bad memory characteristics

497967
quicksort	mergesort
i actually just wrote a linked-list comparative sort demo program in c and arrived at a similar conclusion that mergesort will beat quicksort for most uses altho i have been told that quicksort is generally not used for linked lists anyway

497967
factors	mean
i would note that the choice of pivot values is a monster factors -- my initial version used a random node as the pivot and when i refined it a bit to take a mean of two random nodes the exectution time for 1000000 records went from over 4 minutes to less than 10 seconds putting it right on par with mergesort

497967
quicksort	mergesort
mergesort and quicksort have the same big o best case n log n and despite what people may try to claim big o is really about iteration count and not comparison count

497967
quicksort	mergesort
the biggest difference that can be produced between the two of them will always be to quicksort s detriment and it involves lists that are already largely sorted or contain a large number of ties when quicksort does better than mergesort the difference will not be nearly so great

497979
uiview	catransition
i try with catransition uiview animation but nothing

497987
rss	feed
given a blog url obtain its rss feed url

graphics2d	bufferedimage
callouts text images etc can be added to the screen shot via the graphics2d object you receive when you call the creategraphics method of the screen shot s bufferedimage

498046
hide	show
if you hide all your errors you won t be show those which signify that the logic of the program is wrong - namely errors you want to see

498052
x86	mips
beyond that if you want to run them on an arm processor or mips or powerpc then you have to run a full machine instruction set emulator that interprets the binary machine code from x86 into whatever machine you re running it on

498056
voip	sip
to clarify i am talking about the voip protocol sip

498056
asterisk	pbx	asterisk	freeswitch	freeswitch	pbx
i m not looking for asterisk freeswitch or any other pbx software

498057
config	ini
now is it possible to tweak all these settings inside the apache config files and mysql ini and php ini files

498069
inherited	properties
according to this book if an element is not matched by a selector in any of these stylesheets only then will the properties value be inherited from parent elements

498069
inherited	properties
if a browser s stylesheet does define a style for all types of element and this style has a higher precendence than inherited then inherited properties values should never be observed

498069
inherited	properties
i m aware that not all css properties inherited but for the sake of this discussion assume i m referring to a properties that is color

498076
fpdf	fpdi
you can use fpdi to read pdf and translate them in fpdf

ubuntu	linux
i particularly like vmware on my laptop and i really like to use it for ubuntu linux

498215

498271
ubuntu	linux
you can buy a virtual machine with 256mb for 20 month but you build the machine from scratch after loading a base linux distribution like ubuntu

498271
ubuntu	debian
i would suggest debian or ubuntu

498271
gentoo	linux
if you want to learn a bit more about some linux fundamentals like building a kernel and tweaking .conf files could be useful at some point try a distribution like gentoo

498278
post	get
i am very familiar with using post or get to send data but all of a sudden realized i have no idea how to retrieve it in a way that it can be used by a jquery callback function

498342
listview	checkboxlist
this way you can simply take a repeater or listview control and databind it to the list of categories then put a checkboxlist inside that

you might also want to consider putting a more balanced reverse proxy in front of your mongrels something haproxy instead of nginx apache or lighttpd

498486
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
the other reverse proxies nginx apache lighttpd only do round-robin which means that they can load up your mongrel queue inadvertently

otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

498840
integer	unsigned
signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned

498856
google-chrome	firefox
if a competitor came along it would need to really bring something new to the table in order to convince everyone to a adopt it b live with locking out all the users of older browsers like ie7 firefox 3.0 google-chrome 1.0 etc

498884
extjs	mootools
what we re currently getting is a range of library sets jquery prototype extjs mootools etc

498968
inherited	subclassing
i ve come across the feature in visual studio to auto-generate a subclassing of a custom control using add new inherited user control

498986
children	parent
my service layer then adds an additional query restriction by parent before returning the list of children for that parent

498991
inherited	subclassing
you just create your own class that inherited the control that you would like to subclassing

499137
textarea	textbox
what would be the css selector to force this text to be wrapped in an html textarea or in a xul textbox

499141
firefox	safari
microsoft could probably have pulled it off some years ago when ie has an extremely large market share before the rise of firefox and safari but they chose instead for strategic reasons to let the browser stagnate

499155
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
the for-loop loops over its arguments your args variable is an arrays but bash only sees the first element when you do args

499158
google-chrome	firefox
as of 2016 tested and working on google-chrome firefox ie11 even ie8 see that last here

499172
fortran	ada
there are a multitude of programming languages that aren t used terribly often anymore but we re used extensively in their heyday - cobol fortran and ada come to mind

499172
lisp	prolog
other languages such as prolog or lisp are not used terribly often in business but contain key concepts that all programmers should learn and are valuable in their own right

499177
firefox	safari
note safari seems to wrap the long string in a anyway unlike firefox

499218
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
it could be that the gif jpg decoders rewind the stream but bmp png don t hence the error.

499280

499602
post	get	post	put	put	get
but if you are using get instead of post then the user will still be able to cut and paste the url out of the location bar and you will probably not want to put confidential information in there that can be seen by anyone looking at the screen

499603
post	get
under net - xhr tab you can see the exact url call with all get post parameters that was triggered

499615
stdout	stderr
stdout stderr

499615
stdout	stderr
stdout stderr - so air or java or

499615
stdout	stderr
alas merapi has to use a localhost port and socket for doing the interprocess communication - which is a clumsy way to go relative to using stdin stdout stderr interprocess pipes instead

499662
cvs	svn
gforge incorporates cvs svn document storage issue trackers and integrates everything nicely

499662
cvs	svn
versioning although we tried svn we switched back to cvs because it fits our needs better and works fine

499664
serializable	deserialization
also another lesson we have learned was that the slowest operation in distributed caching is serializable and deserialization at least in asp.net

499755
lisp	scheme
learn lisp or scheme

499796
boost	stl
boost thread - an stl style

499879
stdout	fflush
it sends lots of newlines to stdout for those of you thinking i should fflush

499893
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql and a few other gems like hpricot thin and mongrel don t work but the application does work

499895
stdout	fflush
