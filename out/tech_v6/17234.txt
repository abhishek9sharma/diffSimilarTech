46500491
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
you need to restructure your code flow such that your either your .foreach loops gathers input often in an arrays and then sends one response containing all the data after loops is done or if you only intend to send a response on the first token found then you probably want to switch to a regular for-loop so you can break out of loops after you send the response to avoid sending another one with a return or break

i was unable to reproduce your issue neither in firefox nor in google-chrome so i can t address the exact reason for the 25 seconds or 1.5 minutes but it really seems to a bug fixed in more recent versions

46501375
pull	push
for this your agent may self-connect a receiving access-point working as a pull archetype so as to sniff when the local-end context instance has reached an rto-state + a .bind - created o s l3+ interface starts distributing the intended agent s- push -ed messages

46501375
pull	push
given the push -side message-routing strategy is round-robin the local-agent can be sure that until it s local pull -access-point receives all messages indicating a contiguous sequence of ordinals there is no other remote - pull -ing agent in an rto-state

46501375
pull	push
once the local pull -access-point receives gap in the stream of ordinals that means sure only in the case all the push s .setsockopt -s were setup properly there is another -- non-local -- pull -ing agent in an rto-state

46501375
wan	lan	pull	push
the nature of multi-stage message queuing multi-layered implementation local- push -agent s-code local context -thread s local-o s local-kernel lan wan remote-kernel remote-o s remote context -thread s remote- pull -agent s-code to name just a few and multi-agent behaviour simply introduce many places where an operation may gain latency block deadlock fail in some other manner

xslt	xquery
so if your xslt processor for instance is saxon 9 which also supports xquery you could consider doing it with xquery instead of xslt

46501410
xslt	xquery
if you want to use it with xslt then here is an xslt 3.0 stylesheet that can be run with saxon 9.8 any edition or altova 2017 release that tries to use xslt iterate to emulate the xquery approach of a tumbling window computation shown above

46501410
xslt	xquery
if you need to do it in xslt 2.0 one way is to write a function that recursively processes the datetime sequence item by item and returns a group respectively trk element once it finds a datetime having a greater difference than the allowed limit so basically implements the xquery check

46501432
lsp	principles
in addition your example seems to violate the lsp liskov substitution principles

46508309
put	preflight	post	put
so your first request with the put method creates one preflight cache entry for put requests with an expiration of access-control-max-age seconds â and any next request with a post method would create a separate preflight cache entry for post requests with its own expiration of access-control-max-age seconds

46508324

but it is common to use 0 when working with int and 0 when dealing with chars or bytes

46508551
int	chars
chars is an int type it means that the chars you can use with the simple quotes like a are in reality int values

46508551
int	chars
i invite you to look for the ascii you ll see the link between chars and int

46508551
int	chars
you ll notice that the chars 0 has the int value 0 so there is no difference you can use 0 or 0 in your code for the compiler it s the same thing

46508560
int	chars
in c chars literals such as x have type int which means 0 and 0 are not just numerically equal they are 100 equivalent semantically

when i touch the screens to switching states from title to running firefox handled the touch properly the game runs and the monster starts running as i planned just like a mousedown event

46508693
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox everything is fine and dandy but in google-chrome the game will show the title screen briefly like 1 10th of a second and go straight into running state

46508693
google-chrome	firefox
the real problem is while firefox is handling the touchstart event just like a mousedown event a quick one-shot trigger google-chrome is handling it like an automatic rifle with burst fire mode - it fires the event far longer than needed

46508693
google-chrome	firefox
is there a trick hack to make google-chrome behave the same way like firefox like just by setting something tags in the html or values in javascript code

46508942
getter	setter
i had this problem before and it has many reason.first you may remove final keyword from your model because your variables are changing.second tableview shows empty cells because you make your variables private in class student and you can not access them from init method in parent class.so you need add getter and setter methods for access to these variables

in fact in order to make it work we also have to adjust the render size of the export flipping height and width of the portrait track natural size

46511732
int	double
this is because jvm will automatically type cast int to double so we get infinity instead of arithmeticexception

46511785

below is my function code which is adding watermark but i can t find out how to resize image to given height and width

46511897
int	chars
you can not directly cast a chars to an int those are objects

46511897
int	chars
the cast between them only works if we are talking about the datatypes chars and int

46511897
int	chars
while java indeed auto-boxes and -unboxes int to int chars to chars and vice versa it does not automatically use this technique for a fast conversion between int to chars

46511952
folder	directory
for development create directory c tests and place there few files and folder

46511959

free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
to reduce such a performance hit hit malloc and calloc etc and free can manage a pool of allocated memory internally in order to avoid the expense of going to the operating system every time memory is requested or released

46512660
free	malloc
with malloc and free working in such ways as far as the operating system is concerned the memory usage by the program may not reduce on a call of free at least until the code of free actually decides according to its own criteria to return the memory to the host system

46512660
free	malloc
there may also be effects on multiple calls of malloc of memory usage increasing sharply at first and then leveling out even if the program is calling malloc many times with no calls of free

46512691
free	malloc
you need to dynamically allocate it with malloc in order for the memory not to be free d unless you call free

46512755
google-chrome	safari
as i finished it it can be successfully runned on windows google-chrome edge and also android but just can t run on my iphone neither i use safari or google-chrome

46513151
uitextfield	uicontrolevents
you can subclass uitextfield and add a target for uicontrolevents editingchanged

46513155
min	max
so from my situation and all above answers what i got is when you are only after the values at min or max priority basis go for heap

46513200
button	checkbox
you need to register listeners on your checkbox and button in order to react to these actions

46513204
post	put
so there s no need for functions that return scope and seems like you have a problem in your code somewhere post more code put it on fiddle or somewhere and we may be able to help

46513214
lodash	underscore.js
you can use underscore.js or lodash each function and groupby function to achieve your desired output

46513218
dlsym	dlopen
on linux and posix you would use dlopen 3 and dlsym 3

46513218
dlsym	dlopen
be aware of name mangling so use extern c for those c++ functions you want to load at runtime with dlsym see c++ dlopen mini howto

46513218
dlsym	dlopen
you want some intermediate ast fork a compilation of that code into a temporary plugin and dynamically load that with dlopen then run it using raw function pointers obtained with dlsym

46513218
haskell	ocaml	haskell	scheme	ocaml	scheme
but in contrast to haskell or scheme or ocaml there is no repl in c++ so you need to make one using the tricks i considered above if you want some and that is a difficult task for a c++ newbie

46513253
put	get
to get the extension s key which i m putting in the manifest and referring to it as key_here i uploaded the manifest of the extension to the chrome web store developer s dashboard as a draft and got the public key from there and put in the manifest

46513267
minimum	max
this obviously is a simple way to make these operations run faster however its not really that viable as its still pretty slow at the minimum usable resolution of 480x360 which is massively reduced from the camera s max of 3280x2464

i can t hide using css and jquery because class name is generated by angular js which will hide the buttons in other dialog pop-up also

46513380
submit	submission
here i use the submit event and a submit button since you had a form - you then need to stop the submission by returning false in case of error or if ajax is used

46513440
spaces	delimiter
one ore more sequential spaces could be used as the delimiter which would result in the date at the 6th month 7th day and 8th time column but i am not sure how to do this and i don t think it would be the best solution as it will break as soon as the output changes

46513444
next	except
both are self-closing tags and there is no connection between those two except their placement in the source code next to each other - but that is incitental

for-loop	loops
old method double for-loop 7.32 s â 207 ms per loops mean â std

46513953
multiplying	add
whether you re just adding them or multiplying them so it s no faster in c to do it this way where you add the image values than if you just do the convolutions

46513988
free	malloc
for secure working with malloc function we must free the memory locations that is reserved by malloc by calling free with these blocks

46513992
int	chars	int	double
the double cast unsigned int unsigned chars forces the chars read from to be zero-extended rather than sign-extended to the width of unsigned int

46514035
free	malloc
as with malloc you need to manually free this memory but with delete instead like this

46514134

solution delete the npm-cache npm folder in the installation directory of nodejs

46514376
serializable	deserialization	outputstream	inputstream
instead of extending requesthandler and letting aws lambda map the json to a pojo you can instead extend requeststreamhandler which will provide you an inputstream and an outputstream so you can do the deserialization with the json serializable of your choice

quicksort	heapsort
heapsort is slow compared to quicksort

46514625
quicksort	insertion-sort
of course a vanilla quicksort is slow too but it can be made very fast by using insertion-sort and some fallback for the rare cases where a part of the range is suboptimal for quicksort

46514662
quicksort	heapsort
it sorts using a quicksort but if the quicksort becomes too expensive it switches to a heapsort

46514662
quicksort	heapsort
fortunately quicksort and heapsort are both very old and very well-understood algorithms

46514662
quicksort	heapsort
because heapsort is actually slower than quicksort for each n

46514662
quicksort	heapsort
so for even small inputs quicksort does less work than heapsort and is physically faster for every n

46514662
quicksort	heapsort
quicksort also has a better cache access behavior than heapsort

46514662
quicksort	heapsort
it recognizes when quicksort has found a worst-case input and switches to a heapsort thus preventing quicksort from degenerating into an o n 2 problem

46514662
quicksort	heapsort
i keep making references to the inner workings of quicksort and heapsort

squash	merge
squash and merge

46516503
fast-forward	merge
git merge --ff-only to prevent merging but allow a fast-forward action

46516503
squash	merge
git merge --squash to force a squash action without creating a merge

46516503
fast-forward	merge
git rebase followed by git merge --ff-only to copy the commits such that fast-forwarding is possibleâ this is the default rebase actionâ and then to do a fast-forward action

46516503
squash	merge	squash	branch
note that the plain-merge diagram on that page is rather poor but the squash one is decent. a real merge made with --no-ff on the command line has two parents the first parent is the previous commit on the branch on which you performed the merge master and the second parent is the tip commit of the branch that was merge branch in your example

46516503
fast-forward	merge
but it does make for a more tangled history if the fact that there was a merge is expected to be useless or distracting in the future while the n separate commits are expected to be useful for debugging for instance it may be better to use a fast-forward operation

46516503
fast-forward	merge
as i mentioned above a fast-forward is not a merge at all

46516503
fast-forward	merge
however fast-forward is only possible if all the new commits to be merge are ahead of all the current commits

46516503
fast-forward	merge
if fast-forward is possible the command-line command git merge will do it by default

46516503
fast-forward	merge
so if you want to attempt a fast-forward but not create an actual merge commit if it s not possible you can simply use git merge --ff-only and observe whether it succeeds or fails

46516503
fast-forward	merge
if a fast-forward is currently not possible you can use git rebase to make it become possible after which you can use git merge optionally with --ff-only either as a safety check or to override any configuration you set with git config merge.ff

46517513
postgresql	mysql
the answer is going to depend on what type of database you are using sql server mysql postgresql etc. and whether you are doing this with 100 sql or if you have an application that uses another language that could manipulate the data as well

46517513
postgresql	mysql
searching for your database type mysql postgresql etc. and date format will be a good starting point

46517653
width	height
if you want custom width you can play with the percentage but if you want a specific width and height in px you can do the following

46517653
width	height
change the width and height to your desired width and height

46517716
width	height
if you can use height 0 or width 0 you can hide the pop-ups without position absolute display none or removing them from the container

46517723
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
so stack is as simple as uinavigationcontroller - uiviewcontroller used as container - uitableviewcontroller

46517733

46517838
int	chars
why we can store a chars data as a int variable

46517859
int	chars
the getchar function and similar chars input functions returns an int because of eof

46517859
int	chars
also in many places where one use a chars variable it will silently be promoted to int anyway

46517952
int	chars
in c int is the default return type if you don t have a declaration of a function in c compilers will assume that it returns int and returning a value is done using a register - therefore returning a chars instead of an int actually generates additional implicit code to mask out the extra bytes of your value

46517977
int	chars
but in the end the type chars is just another term for int really since ascii assigns a unique int for each letter

46517991
for-loop	loops
i m pretty sure that in order to make this run in linear time i have to remove the second for-loop but i m not sure of how i can go through the list without the second loops

46518151
draggable	droppable
the problem is it seems that a draggable can only be dropped upon a single droppable

46518164
width	height
this first moves each element which already have position absolute to the right and down by 50 of the containers width and height then it moves each element back left and up by 50 of its own width and height which results in horizontal and vertical centering in relation to the parent element

46518180

46518263
for-loop	loops
and those names will loops through a for-loop to create separate graphs

int	chars
c requires int be at least as many bits as chars

46519058
int	chars
therefore int can store the same values as chars allowing for signed unsigned differences

46519058
int	chars
in most cases int is a lot larger than chars

46534872
width	height
i tried it setting height and width to any x any and putting a image filling out the screen..content mode scale to fill...but when i run the app the image is cutted...i believe the problem is the constraint because i really don t now ho to use they...they look like to be used to set the distance of views and not to set a background as a scallable background to a page..

46534897
int	chars
if you want to read int values positive or negative you need to read a single chars at a time and then compute the int value that the chars sequence represents

the downside is that it is a unique commit and not a commit history so if you continue to develop on that branch and do another squash commit you will get another commit that contains the entire history of changes for that branch

46535123
squash	branch
the solution to this is to delete the branch after you do a squash commit and any changes or improvements should be in a new branch off of develop that contains the squash commit in its history

46535910
mouseover	mouseleave
keep the mouseover and mouseleave bound to the div because they can be fired with a non-focusable element

46535910
mouse	keyboard
also a keyboard event is different than a mouse event so you can t access shiftkey of e in mouseover

46535910

width	height
where 100 is the width and the height

46542302
width	height
rather than that though i am using a calculated expression which tests whether the height h is less than the width w using a ternary operator

46542302
width	height
that results in taking whatever is smaller out of the current height and width as the new height and width so there are really two calculated expressions in there with an x between them similar to 100x100

46542302
width	height
first get the width and the height of the image then choose the smaller of the two and then issue a convert command with the gravity and extent both set

folder	directory
using the below code to read a file from ftp folder and write it to the local directory

46543274
textview	imageview
i have tried replacing the textview imageview combination with a single textview populated with a spannablestringbuilder but that positioned the icon at the end of the wrapped text see example with green woodpecker when i d like it positioned to the right of the text

46543274
textview	imageview
my desired behaviour is for the imageview icon to always be right next to the textview and when the textview is long the imageview becomes dominant within column b and the textview wraps it s text into a slightly smaller space

git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

46543327
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility

46543327
git-svn	svn2git
if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually

46543327
git-svn	svn2git
the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn

46543327
git-svn	svn2git
you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

46543335

46543670
textview	imageview	width	height
it is hard to understand from your question completely but what i ve decoded is you require to place textview and imageview side by side that can only be possible if you hardcode textview width and give textview height as match_paren t something like below

46543691
post	get
that s by design because each post get parameter is basically a string

width	height
i have applied this layout to the grid s items so every cell has a perfect width and height except for the 3rd cell because it has the size of two cells

46545126

46545126
for-loop	arrays
it is used after the for-loop has created the arrays and will just pad out the final row with null values so that you don t have the blank space to the right of the final row

46545126
for-loop	arrays
then just call it on an arrays and iterate as i have done at the end by which i mean the table part with the for-loop is not part of the function

i have changed the approach slightly from the original by using a separate file to run the interactiveconsole and then making the main file open this other file which i have called console.py and is in the same directory in a subprocess linking the stdout stderr and stdin of this subprocess to the tkinter text widget programatically

46545426
stdout	stderr
the reason that reading from stdout and stderr is in separate threads is because the read method is blocking which causes the program to freeze until the console.py subprocess gives more output unless these are in separate threads

46560610
uiview	cashapelayer
i have a pretty basic question how do you choose between using uiview and cashapelayer when you want to draw shapes i m not talking about textfields switches or other controls just drawing

46560610
uiview	calayer
my understanding is that uiview as part of uikit uses a normal calayer under the hood to draw its content

46560610
cashapelayer	calayer
if this is correct then cashapelayer or calayer in general would be the exact same thing only without the extras uikit gives you

46560610
uiview	cashapelayer
then when does using a uiview make sense and when does using cashapelayer make sense

46560610
cashapelayer	uibezierpath
create a cashapelayer with a uibezierpath

46560610
uiview	cashapelayer
at this point i m not sure whether to use uiview s or cashapelayer s

46560806
min	max
i can see min max properties along with a smallchange property but no largechange property

46560925
serializable	deserialization
so even when the type is not changed the serializable deserialization changes as soon as the assembly is updated

46560985
cashapelayer	calayer
cashapelayer or calayer in general would be the exact same thing

46560985
cashapelayer	calayer
clearly when you try to draw various shapes using cashapelayer is beneficial in terms of performance when compared to calayer

46560985
cashapelayer	calayer
so none of the layer can recognize user interactions no matter whether its calayer or cashapelayer

46560985
cashapelayer	calayer	uiview	cashapelayer	uiview	calayer
as you have specified in your question you want user interactions of red circles and because we are now aware of the fact that cashapelayer calayer will not respond to user interaction its pretty clear that you have to use uiview rather than layer

46562577
int	double
in this case you are trying to tell theâ arraylist to reference only values of type long or int or double etc.

looking at it and reading that one has to increment over the datasnapshot lead me to wonder if it differed to the datasnapshot retured in the below example and if not is it correct to think of the query class as nothing more than an intermediary to add sorting and filtering to the data before working with it and hence fine to add a for-loop when not using the query class as in the below example

if it s not enough that the grammar capture the parent child relations in the input but you also want the sequence of children allowed for any element in the grammar to match in some sense the examples in the input then you have reached an interesting problem worth a master s thesis or a dissertation not long ago for each instance of element e in your input you have some finite number of sequences of children your task is to define a regular language that includes those sequences and captures the implicit patterns of the input clearly

technically since all classes inherited from object which lacks __slots__ that would imply that instances would all have __dict__ but what they really mean to say is that if __dict__ is not suppressed on instances at every level of the inherited tree by failing to provide __dict__ for built-in types like object or suppressing it with __slots__ on user-defined classes then a __dict__ will exist for instances of the first class in the tree that fails to suppress __dict__ and for all of its subclassing even if they try to use __slots__ to suppress __dict__

for-loop	loops
that s not actually the simplest method given that you have three strings like no1 that you are looping through but it makes it easier to later switch to dynamically adding the colors to the page without having to manually write three p elements beforehand. for this numeric loops you would use a for-loop

i understand that the minimum value could be found by looking for the root but what about the max value in a min heap

46616001
int	chars
now i want to print the chars value at index 3 of that int array

46616001
int	chars
from my understanding an int is equal to 4 chars

46616001
int	chars
since a chars is technically a byte and an int is 4 bytes

46616001
int	chars
so i am storing a chars into my int array as 4 bytes but when i pull it out there is garbage data since the chars i inserted is only one byte compared to the index being 4 bytes in size

46616491
virtualenv	conda
ubuntu would be a wise choice and you can run conda or virtualenv easily

46616519
for-loop	loops
declare the variable before the for-loop so that you can use it after loops

where the parent node is a smaller value than that of its children

46616562

you redirect the request and put parameters into the get array instead of post as the nature of post is to send data inside the request body but you send it in the request uri

46616892
width	height
i used the scrollview normally and everything is going well but the point is that i can t adjust the tools size constraints inside the scrollview for example i have many sizes for ios phone screens so i don t want to make a specific width and height for tools and that what storyboard force me to do

fabric 2 introduces some new parameters for image onbects scalex scaley width height cropx cropy.

46616896
width	height
setting the object origin of both images to center middle and adjusting the width height and cropx cropy of your second image should do the trick

46616931
int	chars
you store the chars into int var

46616956
width	height
that is set the image width and height to 50x50 for a 100x100 pixel image at 200 dpi scale

in other words s1.hasnextdouble will be true when the next token is a double or an int

46617022

int	double
a simple answer is that double is only accurate to 15-16 total digits as opposed to long which as an int type has an absolute accuracy within an explicit digit limit in this case 19 digits

46617201
int	chars
int count this method is called to notify you that within s the count chars beginning at start have just replaced

46617224
for-loop	loops
i think you need loops by range created by length of df and then get return outside of for-loop

46617287
int	chars
if you know in advance exactly how much memory you need exactly how long your int array is there is no need to use dynamic allocation malloc and declaring the array like chars input 32

46617739
width	height
as you use predefined width s and height s you can simplify the code a lot and use background and background-size cover to accomplish that

46617739
background-size	object-fit
if you still want to use object-fit cover you can though it has less browser support than background-size cover

46617750

to add a header file you can either directory add it to the project while making sure its in the sys folder

46618286
saas	iaas
one of the challenges in aws is that its difficult to draw the line between saas paas and iaas since there are large number of services available with different functionalities

46618286
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
however you can consider amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk as a paas which allows you to provision web and database servers without deeply knowing the underling iaas aspects of amazon-web-services though it provisions ec2 instances elastic load balancers and autoscaling groups behind the scene

46618329
post	get
i believe that post method try to process all data asynchronously and this is causing problem as each set of data take 3-4 seconds and end system which get updates show weird result because of 5 request behaves together

46618353
post	get
i can understand why this works the get and post url are the same so the browser doesn t change its url

46618471
udp	tcp
a main difference between tcp udp is that tcp is a connected socket you first need to establish a connection and then send or receive packets

46618471
udp	tcp
with udp the packet size is limited recommended not to exceed 512 bytes instead with tcp there s not limit

46618471
udp	tcp
with udp there is no guarantee that the packet will be received on the other side and the sender will not have any confirmation of whether it was received instead on tcp there is such a verification

46618471
udp	tcp
if you need a connection that ensures that the bytes sent are received on the other side you need to use tcp and not udp

46618471
udp	tcp
in this situation the android device can t act as server that means can t wait for received udp packets and can t listen for incoming tcp connections due its ports are inaccessible from the wan

it is probably better to write a netpbm file though - so pgm p5 if greyscale and ppm p6 if colour

46618886
ppm	pgm
and while that would be marginally smaller it is no longer self-contained like a pgm ppm file and means you have to carry around the size separately to be able to get your data back so i would go for the pgm ppm version for the sake of 3 tiny lines of header

46625258
backtracking	greedy
the pattern matches the minute part in 8 25 43 pm because of backtracking after matching a colon grabs 25 greedy and tries to match a char other than

46625295
put	get
now you can t tell whether any given character is the last one until you re done reading so it s not like you can just put in an if statement to test that but there are a few ways to get around that

46625445
width	height
i thought it was at 100 width height at default

46625450
min	max
notice that the result is a function so trying to derive a min and or max with no argument will always fail

46625450
min	max
once you do find how to access the environment of ecdf see below then you would probably want the min of the concatenated values of the two vectors rather than assuming one has the min and the other has the max

46625461
pull	push
what does get rid of my commit but then it wants me to do a pull before i can do a push and i get all the changes back

46625490
mouseleave	mouseenter
jquery has mouseenter and mouseleave methods

46625503
int	double
you quickly reach the limits of int and double precision if n gets bigger you may need biginteger and bigdecimal which provide an unlimited precision in cost of space

46625505
put	get
and put into square bracket with a plus to get multiple occurrences

46625507

for-loop	arrays
i want to eventually be able to plot 350000 9046 arrays which for my for-loop will probably take forever

46625687
profiling	benchmarking
i have a tensorflow program designed to help me informally benchmarking a gpu i am using and more importantly understand the profiling tools that come with tensorflow

46625744
width	height
because of svg has default width and height you should give to width in css like this

46625746
splinter	selenium
you will likely have two options use a headless browser and selenium splinter to load your svg data in a real browser and run javascript statements in there or make your python code run in brython and run everything inside the browser

46626074
hex	binary
it worked for large files when i use hex instead of binary as follows in the above code

46626103

46626141
put	get
to get the library put this in your app module build.gradle

46626143
disk	ram
chrome does store most of the data in the virtual memory ram and therefore not stored on your disk but not all off the data is stored in ram some such as sessions are stored in exactly the same place as if not in incognito.you can open the resource monitor tool within chrome go to disk sort the image column under the disk activity section then open and incognito session and go to any website

processors	hyperthreading
the intel sdm says on a processors supporting hyperthreading technology invalidations performed on one logical processors may invalidate entries in the tlbs and paging-structure caches used by other logical processors.

46626314
for-loop	arrays
then depending on how the arrays is filled fill it and then use a nested for-loop to print each row sequentially of a 2d arrays if there is a 0 or -1 however you want to tell the program that that slot is empty print a space

46626315
put	get
i m just not really sure how to get user input and put it into an array using an object class

46626326
width	margin
i know giving axis.text.y a combination of and a negative right margin gag can accomplish this effect but the negative margin has to be manually set to match the width of the longest y-axis tick label

46626335
versioning	upgrade
furthermore if the browser is of a brand that previously supported svg 1.1 then print a message suggesting that the user upgrade back to the older versioning and possibly even consider a different more stable brand of browser one that may have been designed with more consideration of the time required of developers to work around the lack of features that once worked perfectly well and then were removed for the purpose of replacing them with nothing as ktejik has noted

46626350
factors	mean
the examples i have seen that have three factors look just at frequency counts so i m not sure how to incorporate the mean of another variable across all the factors into the plot

46626358
super	self
if you are not ok with b.foo not always calling a.foo immediately regardless of the type of self don t use super

46626358
super	self
otherwise just use a.foo self instead and document the fact that you are not using super

46626364
background-repeat	background-size	background-repeat	background-image	background-image	background-size
use background-image as a property both in the css and in jquery and apply the other properties in css seperately background--position background-size background-repeat etc.

if i publicly submit a get post request to my redirect uri in postman or through chrome i get a request hitting my localhost fine

46626417
post	get
ok lets make this simple the code below decides if i have a sd card if not we use internal storage but it gets the path then passes that path to dbhelper who creates the db i will post the code to get the path first then the dbhelper code

46626459
width	height
what the goal is is to take the variables width and height from args 1 and 2 give them to the simulation file which preforms the calculation integer add firebotwidth + firebotheight

46626517
post	get
use post instead with a bit of jquery magic i would also recommend using ajax so that you don t get redirected to php file and it will just run

46626567
width	height
you had an instance variable and a class variable width and height in your fire class and i think you only meant to have the class variable if you meant to have both just add it back

46626570
post	get
but if i make that post request with jquery i don t get any error it executes as the way it is needed

46626571
swift	objective-c
for one of the new class i am using an existing method of an objective-c class in swift 3.2

46626577
inherited	properties
just had the same issue using class table inherited it was caused by the visibility on the id properties set to private so the child class could not access the id changing this to protected solved it

46626606
swift	objective-c
objective-c methods that return bool and return an nserror by reference are exposed to swift as methods that use the try catch error-handling mechanism and return void

46626606
swift	objective-c
if the objective-c method fails it returns no and populates the error pointer and swift then throws that error

46626616
spaces	delimiter
when i tell applescript to count the words of a string like a b with the text item delimiter set to spaces it returns 2

46626693
hide	show
in essence how to i show or hide elements based on screen size using media queries

46626804
submit	submission
i look at it this way when a user clicks the submit button he she requests a form submission which you can in turn intercept and demand the browser to perform some validation

46626804
submit	submission
on the other hand if you call submit on a form from js you essentially demand the browser to perform the submission

46626804
submit	submission
the same goes for the submit method it s not its responsibility to figure out whether you intend to actually proceed with submission or actually want to perform some validation first

46626804
submit	submission
when you call submit on a form programmatically i think it s fair that the engine may assume you are sure you want to proceed with the for submission

46626831
put	get
i can ping the server from the rpi and if i put the server ip port into a browser on the rpi i get my i m a feathers server use a client page so network connection and setup of ip on server is fine

inherited	subclassing
i ve tried making the class inherited from dict but it raises an error later in the code because of subclassing trying to inherited from dict and type so inheriting from dict isn t a possibility

46626977
width	height
in some cases you may need to set the img height and width to the same value manually

46627002
many-to-many	one-to-many
the relationships between the tables are defined as in a one-to-one one-to-many or many-to-many relationship and then you will be able to query those relationships including chaining the relationships

46627036
versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade your windows 7 computer sp1 or higher to powershell versioning 5.1 the current versioning as of this writing with this download

46627047
solaris	bsd
or if you re bound to a particularly unix-like system such as linux bsd solaris mac os etc you could use mmap to map a region of memory to a file so you could for example treat a 2gb file as though it s your array

46627069
subtraction	addition
one of those expectations is that pointer addition and subtraction are very fast operations specifically o 1

46627069
subtraction	addition
so if a standard library iterator cannot perform addition and subtraction in o 1 then it does not implement those operations and is not classified as a random access iterator

46627133
hash	md5
you know the current one s position by calculating its md5 hash so you just need to find which one comes right after or right before

46627207
iboutlet	ibaction
the objective is a bit unclear however it seems you are trying to connect an iboutlet in code with an exit ibaction in the ide

46627207

for-loop	arrays
i can only think of using a for-loop to iterate over the arrays by intervals of k and appending the min of that interval to a new arrays

46627747
min	max
for each bin compute normalized min and max quantities - the current min and max quantities divided by the weight of that bin

46627747
min	max
at this value the intermediate bins have zero error and the min and max bins are as close to their ideal filling as the constraints will let them

46627747
min	max
alternatively if you sort normalized max and min values into one array i think you can track how the amount distributed increases as you increase q

46627774
int	boolean
in mysql boolean are treated as int with a value of 1 for true and 0 for false

46627794

46629243
cefsharp	awesomium
another popular library is cefsharp which is bsd licensed which will be more palatable compared to awesomium s but as far as i can tell does not distribute an sdk installer which handles visual studio toolbox integration for you - but it looks like you only need to manually add a reference to the cefsharp.wpf.dll assembly and add the elements to your wpf project using the xaml editor not the toolbox - which you should be doing anyway

46632522
int	chars
first of all is holding 2000 signed chars which are indeed signed 8 bit values have a look here - this is a very handy resource when handling data types sizes so you need some value to hold signed 32 bit 4 byte values which depends on your machine architecture assuming it is 32 bit int it is not difficult to find out you could hold you values in

46632552
int	chars
are there no alternative to packages ff and bigmemory because they do not seem to work well for me because my columns are a mix of int and chars and it seems with the two packages i have to specify what type my columns are either chars or int

46634221
integer	unsigned
it is certainly possible to convert the 1 to type t although in general you might need to be cautious about corner cases when t is signed but it is easier to convert the 1 to an unsigned type at least as wide as t by using the maximum-width unsigned integer type defined in cstdint uintmax_t

46649100
put	get
i m loading this scene get the overlay element and put every child of it in main scene of game

46649101
versioning	upgrade
and all design library and v7 versioning was 24.2.1 and all firebase library versioning were 11.0.1 then i added onesignal and its requirement was to upgrade all these versioning to

46649125
cos	sin
i was thinking of using some cyclic structure for instance sin cos or maybe polar coordinates

46649125
cos	sin
use cos or sin on them

46649186
portrait	landscape
if the ipad is in landscape orientation uiscreen.main.bounds.height will return a value equal to the height in portrait orientation and vice versa

46649191
width	height
if i understand correctly we have to call super.onmeasure so that the object can figure out its width and height

46649191
width	height
but when we pass in the setmeasureddimension the width both as height and width to make the image square does the android scale the image

46649206
nexus	artifactory
also when you deploy artifacts these artifacts will be deployed to your nexus or artifactory

46649209
filtering	grouping
however even the subselect doesn t work correctly it returns all opportunities filtering by so i ve probably misunderstood the grouping by clause

46649262
width	text-align
you can add wrapper div and make its width 100 and text-align center like below

46649343
hide	show
i want to show only my custom toolbar and hide the default.

46649382
int	double
1 try nextint will probably throw inputmissmatchexception as you are fetching int value from the input and assigning to the double

46649420
dplyr	tidyr
if dplyr and tidyr is not the most appropriate for this open to other spread-like functions

46649447
disk	ram
available ram is not enough to handle worst case failure scenario so i m looking for easy way to offload data to disk

46649477
post	put
also i would read what you can post here i like to be friendly so i thought i d put an answer

46649504
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu or debian etc and which webserver nginx or apache2 etc

when using matplotlib and seaborn in jupyter with python 2.7.12 i noticed that the edges of the distplot i drew don t fit the plot correctly cf

46649558
hide	show
i m trying to use adapt an existing script to show hide a hierarchical series of radio buttons based on selection

46649577
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to versioning 5.2.8

46649637
rpm	yum
on redhat use rpm -e --nodeps rather than yum remove to avoid uninstalling packages such as postfix and cronie

46649637
redhat	fedora
if you re on redhat centos or fedora run mysql_upgrade

46649653
maven	pom.xml
i also have 1.8 in pom.xml and it works when using maven - update project

46649686
udp	tcp
nodejs works with callbacks by default which means that once you pass a function as a parameter to a function it will release the main loop to the next instruction this is why nodejs apps have this object.method function pattern but to get something similar to this in go you need to wrap up the tcp and udp portion in a separate function with a infinite loop each

46649742
appdata	uninstaller
after the .msi finally uninstaller all meteor files and registries you must remove the folder package cache in appdata local folder

46649745
dplyr	tidyr
a solution with dplyr + tidyr

46649800
strcpy	strcmp
all c string handling functions strcat strcmp strcpy strchr etc. assume the presence of that terminator

46649843
firefox	safari
the problem is only occurring on ios i tested it on safari and firefox

46649854
prop	each
also if this is a list of list as you say maybe keep them in only one state prop where each key maps to a specific list type

46649861
octal	hex
clue #2 per the docs python interprets ooo as the ascii character with octal value ooo and xhh as the ascii character with hex value hh

46649891
width	height
i have been testing with different values for figure height and width for html output

46649891
width	height
i have ensured that the width value is not less than height always

46649961
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade my project to swift3 and updated firebase pod to versioning 4.0.0

46649987
cpu	hyperthreading
as an example totally random access to memory would yield more in terms of hyperthreading performance gains than very fast cpu intensive computation all within the same cache line

46649993
goo.gl	bit.ly
the best option will be to shorten the link using bit.ly or goo.gl to make it user-friendly.

46650031
hide	show
first i would hide all nodes with a lang attribute and show only the default language

46650056
post	get
just learning laravel and found that in laravel s quick start guide they suggest for a delete request you can spoof the method as if it is delete rather than get or post by doing this

46650083
bash	tcsh
in tcsh setenv serves a similar purpose to export in bash so using just set would not reliably change your path

46650117
put	get
my program flow right now is get the build definition get the queue agent from a build that has the right one set the queue in the old version equal to the new one then put the whole thing back in vsts

46650117
put	get
how do i properly configure the put from the get

46650124
lxml	elementtree
i have tried to use elementtree from lxml but i didn t find any information about attributes

46650135
bash	zsh
again from the examples in the examples section one may infer that bin sh is suitable but one would have no reason to think that bin bash or bin zsh is also suitable let alone bin perl or bin python or bin ruby etc.

46650157
qapplication	qcoreapplication
well as far as i ve been able to understand using two or more s qcoreapplication qguiapplication qapplication implies

46650187
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried google-chrome firefox edge ie

46650227
google-chrome	firefox
when i open it in firefox or google-chrome i don t get this problem

46650247
children	parent
you can compute these values for the parent nodes using the values from the children nodes

46650254
min	max
to create a nice axis i want to find the max and min of data in this vector

46650266
int	chars
the problem is when you are assigning count to the str i you are not converting int to chars

46650266
int	chars
just add 0 to the count to covert int into chars

46650293
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you initialise your image view in viewdidappear which is called after viewwillappear

46650319
ubuntu	debian
facing difficulties to download youtube videos in debian ubuntu

46650320
ubuntu	debian
to download youtube video in debian ubuntu

46650320
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu gives you mozilla firefox default browser

46650324
for-loop	loops
for a naive solution you can take advantage of the fact you can access the last variable in a for-loop outside loops

46650325
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you are initializing the image view in viewdidappear which will be called after viewwillappear where the image view is populated

46650335
public	protected
there are a couple ways around this including a child class that implements a public whose setter applies the value to the protected id field

46650342
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade magento 2 to versioning 2.2 we using the smartwave porto theme latest versioning

46650362
apache	nginx
it can be easily done with nginx or apache web servers

46650376
range	max
next instead of shuffling a huge array i chose another approach generate 81 random non repeating numbers in the range of max count of the files array and 0

46650386
ansible	puppet
ansible is an automation tool and puppet is a configuration management tool

46650386
ansible	puppet
on the flip side though configuration management tools such as puppet generally have a daemon running on the nodes which needs to be provisioned bootstrapped maybe with ansible which has it s advantages and disadvantages which i won t debate here it s largely out of scope

46650386
daemons	systemd
it s a push-model and not pull-model nor is it a continuously running daemons that will enforce systemd state

46650386
ansible	puppet
if you have been using puppet for 5 years there s no real motivation to fork-lift replace it with something else when you can use ansible to augment it there s even a puppet module in ansible and allow each to play nicely with each other getting the features you want from both

46650386
ansible	puppet
i think a good example of the hybrid approach is i know of a few companies that use puppet for configuration management and ansible for software lifecycle release process where one of the tasks in their playbooks is literally calling the puppet module to bring all the systems into configuration consistency

46650386
ansible	puppet
the ansible component in this is to automate orchestrate between various systems the basic outline of the process is this start with removing a group of hosts from the load balancer ensure database connections have stopped perform upgrades migrations run puppet for configuration state consistency and then bring things back online in whatever order they ve deemed appropriate

46650407
folder	directory
right click on each new generated folder and select mark directory as - generated sources root so it was marked as follows

46650436
vsto	add-in
tick sign the clickonce manifests which is the requirement you want to meet to be able to install the vsto add-in

46650451
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade to vs 2017 and the latest versioning of xamarian

46650521
children	parent
attach a single event listenet to the componentdidmount of the parent component and force its children to re-render when this event fires

46650527
next	except
this works except that i don t want to have to press two buttons to get to the next question the selected answer and the continue button

46650568
min	max
you can use std min and std max inside of your std min_element and std max_element invocations

46650595
stdout	stderr
-u unbuffered binary stdout and stderr

46650632
width	height
it s working with the width but not height

46650644
put	get
for a couple of days now i m working with packets on c i have successfully created icmp packet to send but i didn t get the way to put it into the socket by myself so i have found multiple codes that should perform similar action

46650678
hide	show
i m quite novice with javascript and can t get a working version of a page that would show hide divs based on the selected menu item

46650684
children	parent
you don t have to deal with the resize inside every child just handle the window resize maybe with a proper debounce to improve the performance in the parent component and set a state consequently the children will be re-rendered without any additional code

46650697
folder	directory
i then built it locally and grabbed the dist folder and threw it into an assets folder that is at the same directory height as my node_modules folder

46650775
addition	multiplication
the problem i am facing is to create another type or data type to recognize if it is an addition or multiplication symbol it is supposed to print out

46650778
button	checkbox	hide	show
i made loop go through all radio button on click and act appropriately if the button is checked it show target element if it is not it clears checks on lower-level button and hide the element this is needed to prevent elements showing even if a user changes mind and change some top-level checkbox

46650780
equals	gethashcode
i ve omitted becuase its not germane to the question at hand implementing and overriding gethashcode and equals but you should most definitely do so

46650821
gradle	ivy	ant	maven
if this abc.jar is a fat jar that has the dependency-classes included in the jar it is not suited for usage in something like gradle maven or ant ivy that is supposed to handle the dependencies

46650836
division	multiplication
also the string result can contain multiplication and division characters

46650866
post	get
laravel utilizes method spoofing because form elements can t use methods other than get and post while other clients like curl can

46650888
serializable	deserialization
but i fear this is not the most time efficient way to do this as converting to rdd would require deserialization and serializable which i believe is not required when working with dataframes datasets

46650903
folder	directory
i have tried using different working directory and tried different file names but every time i check the folder there is nothing there

46650908
hide	show
i mean i need to filter in two distinct criterias to show hide data one per category and other per stack elements

46650978
folder	directory
i had this problem and i realise that i ran the codecept bootstrap but the vendor and the tests folder were in a wrong directory

46651015
int	double
then we can lookup each match converted to an int in the map to obtain the corresponding double value

46651033
width	height
based on some of the above comments i did some tests to find out that the problem was related to the declaration of the css width and height and not in javascript

46651034
filtering	grouping
you look at the inner joins and where conditions grouping bys and order bys to see whether you need any other tables to filtering out rows grouping or order ids from the first table

46651054
width	height
i m trying to create a project where i have a constructor that constructs circles with a x y width height and then draws them using jpanel

46651070
swift	objective-c
i have a relatively large project that has mixed objective-c and swift classes

46651070
swift	objective-c
of late since xcode 8 and continued until the latest xcode 9.1 beta after i finish building the project it picks up some objective-c files and complains about some swift classes as far as i can tell random not being found

46651070
swift	objective-c
note not every objective-c file that references swift produces errors and also not every reference to swift class generates the error

46651070
swift	objective-c
so there is no obvious issue with -swift.h being included properly as well as the swift classes having the objective-c declarations etc and the code also runs as expected

46651070
swift	objective-c
i have tried many things including changing the order of the files by putting all my swift files to be compiled first in build phases - compile section moving the order of the -swift.h file within the objective-c file etc

46651070
swift	objective-c
have also checked numerous so questions like xcode 6 swift + objective-c build issues - unknown types due to import order

46651076
rvm	bundler
i m developing a couple of private gems and i think i don t understand correctly the path gem_path and or bundler rvm installation flow would love if someone could chip in

46651205
switching	screens
my features are draw in the right position i only draw a circle in every lat and lng of geojson but my pointer show me that the object is in a different place very near to the circle but not over it but if i resize the browser page or if i press f11 that switching in full screens mode or if i press f12 to open the developer window the circle and the features object sets one over the other

46651255
int	chars
sure just embed its binary data as an array of whatever fundamental type you want perhaps in a header -- unsigned chars int whatever -- write it to disk on execution of your parent application then call it as a child process

46651291
post	get
for login i get the email and password post through ajax and then use sign_in_with_email email password

subtract	add	min	max
if your incoming min and max values are inclusive parameters then use and and make sure you add or subtract one when you recurse

46651402
multiplying	add
the new average is calculated by multiplying the average again with the number of elements so far add the new single value and divide it by the new number of elements before passing it to the next recursive call

i m using fckeditor as my rich-text-editor in my rails application and i m having trouble uploading images with it

46651409
carrierwave	minimagick
for file upload support i m using carrierwave and minimagick

46651453

46651550
vim	emacs
edit files using our favorite nix command-line text editor vim emacs etc.

46651595
width	height
you are not seeing the relativelayout after changing it s visibility to view.visible because you have set the height and width of both relativelayout to match_parent so the imagenes occupies whole screen and it is on top of registro

46651607
int	chars
an int can be stored in a chars array and chars can be stored in int array

46651673
swift	objective-c
swift code above wasn t working for me so i converted to objective-c for those interested

46651710
nexus	artifactory
one of the benefits of use an artifact repository nexus jfrog artifactory.. with jenkins or another ci tool like bamboo is that you can deploy your artifacts to a repository in nexus or artifactory with their control version include snapshot in maven previously to send these artifacts to each environment integration environment production environment...

46651735
int	chars
saying that â œinteger types can be stored in chars arrays and viceversaâ itâ s obviously true because chars are int even if with less bytes and under some limits chars s and int s are interchangeable

46651740
entities	entitymanager
is there any possibility to update only certain entities for a certain entitymanager

46651761

46651793
gif	bmp
the thing is that i need to refresh this bmp file to make it look like a gif

46651796
int	chars
use a type that can contain all the intended types you mean to store long long can store also long int short and signed chars values

46651805
int	chars
it is rather strange that isdigit takes an int not a chars because thats what it is for from here emphazise mine

46651805
int	chars
anyhow even though it takes an int you should pass a chars

46651820
width	height
height and width of imagenes relativelayout is match parent so it takes whole screen..u need to set appropriate height to see registro relativelayout or put it in scrollview

pop-up	dialog
the open with dialog pop-up appears and allows you to select browser or chrome

46652046
int	chars
the return non-zero value if the chars is a numeric chars zero otherwise. smells like the function was inherited from c but even that does not explain why the parameter type is int not chars while at the same time.

46652046
int	chars
is there any technical reason why isdigits takes an int not a chars

46652068
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to execute this in linux ubuntu 16.04 using terminal

atom-editor	sublimetext	vim	atom-editor	vim	sublimetext
i maintain a repository of ways to install all the extensions i need on any device for my editors -- this is fairly simple for sublimetext atom-editor and vim because they all have package managers which allow me to run a command to install a list of packages

46652320
hide	show
show and hide the component based on the prop that you were passing but not using in your component subcomponent

46652328
range	min	range	max	min	max
to specifically answer #2 you have a new min max float range for your 32-bit accumulated result which you can use to convert back to floats

46652357
packets	pcap
is there a way to get the stream id and packets number for a given pcap - using dpkt

46652357
packets	pcap
also how do i know how many packets are there in the given pcap - is there any len funtion

46652357
packets	pcap
update perhaps len pcap.readpkts gives the total number of packets in a given pcap

46652390
jobs	cron
this will let you generate correct urls when there is no web context like in commands or cron jobs

46652399
width	height
pass in height width and position information to your objects based on your screen size

46652413
pop-up	dialog
possibly you will have to open administrator cmd so after typing cmd in start when you see cmd is on list press ctrl+shift+enter and press ok in pop-up dialog and you will have administrative cmd

46652425
min	max
max min

46652438
width	height
while the css attributes width and height support the auto value the html attributes width and height do not support auto

46652438
width	height
see objects images and applets in html documents width and height together with the definition of length

46652438
width	height
the behaviour you want auto may be best emulated by simple not supplying a width and height attribute

46652438
width	height
if you want to patch html purifier to allow width and height to support the auto value you should patch library htmlpurifier htmlmodule image.php

46652438
width	height
once you have that class you can use the following configuration code to override the default width and height behaviour

46652456
gridview	listviewitem
reading the error message tells me that click is not a valid event in the gridview but its not in the gridview its in the listviewitem

46652518
hide	show
when an answer is selected instead of showing a uialertcontroller set the text of your feedback label s in viewa hide viewq and show viewa

46652518
hide	show
populate the question and answer elements of viewq hide viewa and show viewq

46652528
width	height
finally with this data you may be able to find the width height and location of the desired image which is like creating the rectangle around the image you drew

46652568
dplyr	tidyr
this is made pretty easy with tidyr spread and some dplyr operations

46652610
hide	show
here is an approach using jquery s hide show

46652680
textview	imageview
textview color changes fine but imageview colors doesn t changes to be more accurate color changes to purple and then again to default

46652712
hide	show
if you do that and hide the overflow it should show only what you want

46652716
onchange	onkeydown
also you must add handlenotedata to onchange event otherwise in onkeydown event texarea value wil never change since you are resetting it to e.target.value each time

46652746
post	get
is there any way to get the latest post from multiple post types in one single loop

46652805
tar	gunzip
i also compared a code signed version of the media-file to the non-code signed version and they both can be opened using gunzip and tar or using the gui archive managers

46652814
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
i don t know why but when i run through it on the dubugger it goes into the first for-loop finds the first arrays of players then just skips to the end of the function without running the next loops

46652820
subtract	add
i assume you need to keep the subdomain if it s not www and subtract the remaining characters if there is more than 20 and add the periods

46652913
int	double
when creating an arraylist you need to identify the objecttype whether it be int string double or even custom classes

46652919
mouse	keyboard
scenario a critical computer system is operator-controlled via standard usb keyboard and mouse

46652919
mouse	keyboard
question is there a software solution to detect the loss disconnect failure of usb hid-devices such as the keyboard or mouse and the single dvi-display

46653032
react-router	react-native-router-flux
instead you can use the react-native-router-flux for the react-native app which takes less transition time and all the routes can be listed in the single javascript file similar to react-router

46653043
dictionary	map
i was thinking that i could map over the list of dictionary by checking to see if the name matches n object s name then pop out delete the dictionary modify it and then re-add it

46653125
udp	tcp
sql server tcp udp turned on

46653159
dictionary	map
what i m trying to do is implement hash map object re-usability in java to c# using dictionary

46653193
int	boolean
when you convert an array into an int it only converts it as a boolean value

46653213
post	put
in that case you might try to put the class definition into the local scope of the view function which handles the post request

46653261
width	height
if the whole container width is too small push the legend below and of course adjust the svg height and width accordingly

46653275

how can i achieve this message showing only in portrait mode and not in landscape mode

46653290
temp	tmp
and i get this set of error messages in build tmp work armv7a-vfp-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi python-cffi 1.11.2-r0 temp log.do_fetch

46653290
hash	md5
i assume there is some post fetch step that needs to specify that the real file is called cffi-1.11.2.tar.gz and not the file with the md5 hash hanging on the end

46653310
width	height	portrait	landscape
you will probably want scale with screen size using your reference resolution with match width or height and a full 0 match by width 0.5 match equally by both w and h or a full 1 match by height as that is what works for most games but it depends on your target orientation portrait or landscape and on your game

46653341

from a dialog or a webapp i think you could run a function that puts all of the document id s on a spreadsheet then returns some sort of a token to the dialog which then calls another function which goes and gets the first unchanged document id and makes the appropriate changes and then updates the spreadsheet that the document has been changed and returns a token to the dialog which lets the dialog know to call the function again and again until there are no remaining unchanged documents

subtraction	addition
1 for example a comment mentions an approach of taking the difference of the first and last statics at runtime to estimate the size but in addition to being undefined behavior it isn t likely to work in practice since global variables get spread across various sections in the binary such as .bss .data .rodata and other variants of those so a simply subtraction will almost certainly return the wrong result for many classes

writing getter and setter just in case is in my humble opinion useless

for-loop	arrays
using either a for-loop or .map to iterate through each string in your arrays and apply your method of replacing vowels

46676407
min	max
you could try to use a function expression but that requires a rather unwieldy syntax in the expression string and is probably a stretch of the intended purpose of nsexpression unless you are actually implementing an aggregate type min max function for predicates on a dataset

46677787
post	get
the following code worked when i needed the original httprequestwrapper from my request context to get post body data for example

46677815
sse	avx
other than manual save restore of an xmm register using legacy sse instructions potentially causing sse avx transition stalls on intel cpus if user-space had the upper halves of any ymm zmm registers dirty

46677815
sse	avx
the reason legacy sse works is that some windows drivers were already doing this when intel wanted to introduce avx so they invented that transition-penalty stuff instead of having legacy sse instructions zero the upper 128b of ymm registers

46677815
sse	avx
see this for more detail on that design decision. so basically we can blame windows binary-only drivers for the sse avx transition-penalty mess

46677828

46677958
post	put
my question is now where do i normally put codes loading the hashtable to be used by the billinginfo post api

46677958
post	get
the country and the client info is on aws aurora in the cloud of another system and billinginfo post is writing to a on-premise ms sql database hence i must make calls to client get api

remember we re here because the web worked starting from a media type that supported only get and post

46678274
google-chrome	safari
as close to the top of the page as possible but it doesn t fix the problem in safari it seems to in google-chrome

46678291
versioning	upgrade
so if you re not on the latest versioning as of now you can upgrade the maven versioning to make use of the fix

46678410
erlang	elixir
this is important since utf-8 atoms and strings are the way forward within erlang and also within elixir

46678454
virtualenv	conda
doesn t docker replace virtualenv and conda

46678471

it s interesting that this has worked for many years on all browsers but now just stops working on the latest version of webkit-based browsers google-chrome and opera

46678524
width	height
define a layout with your desired height and width properties and use it inside the cufflinks iplot call

46678535
folder	directory
which creates a wp-content folder in the correct directory but this directory doesn t appear to get filled with any files

google-chrome	firefox
do you 100 have to use google-chrome or firefox

46678568
google-chrome	firefox
so i will describe a solution using google-chrome or firefox

46678568
google-chrome	firefox
it is completely possible to setup a kiosk app in android to only allow google-chrome or firefox to be used and this is easily done if you set the application you load onto the device to do whatever task you need as the device owner

46678568
google-chrome	firefox
as far as locking your app or in your case google-chrome or firefox just find out what the package name is first into kiosk mode after device owner has been set you need to run this snippet or something like it in your application s main activity

46678568
google-chrome	firefox
to do this you need to hide disable applications with the device owner privileges you achieved earlier when you set your custom application to lock down google-chrome or firefox or whatever you want into kiosk mode

46678572
cifs	smb
it is a by design behavior because azure files share requires smb 2 dialect which supported by newer cifs module in rhel 7

46678579
for-loop	loops
run a for-loop and inside of loops inside create a new loops which is what you want

46678606
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval are not precise timing functions they only tell the browser to wait at least the time parameter you passed to it but you don t know how late it was and by nesting this you are adding more and more imprecision

46678606
setinterval	settimeout
at the end you may end up with your last settimeout being called after the next setinterval

46678622
nonetype	iterable

46678712
google-chrome	firefox
it opens a google-chrome browser performs 2 checks closes then repeats in firefox

46678733
pull	push
however is it possible for me to work on two different projects on two different github accounts push and pull in the same rstudio

udp	tcp
as it is widely known transport protocols as tcp and udp multiplex a single ip address at the source of the transmission and demultiplex another ip address at the destination

46679126
udp	tcp
the existence or absence of a connection requires that the identifier format of each socket be different whereas a tcp socket is identified by the quadruple source ip address source port number destination ip address destination port number an udp socket is identified by the tuple destination ip address destination port number

46679126
udp	tcp
remember independently of their respective socket identifier formats both tcp and udp datagrams identify the port number of the sender

46679126
udp	tcp
a final remark on nomenclature here i used the term â œdatagramâ generically denoting the protocol data unit pdu of both tcp and udp protocols

how it is on safari and firefox

46679463

46691030
children	parent
there s a reasonably easy fix that will delay the appearance of the parent until all children are ready

46691030
children	parent
but any management of this order will definitely involve imposing some sort of wait condition above i made the parent display wait for it s children - you cannot achieve it just be reordering the loops

i am creating a maven pom.xml for soapui project

46692414

google-chrome	firefox
again none of this chicanery is mentioned in the network tab of google-chrome or firefox

46692418
stdout	stderr
i know this is an old thread but maybe its still interesting if your workload uses much stdout or stderr surefire will create three times as big arrays as your output is in order to save your unescaped output into them

46692427
hide	show
and depending on the value of this property you change css style to show hide the date-picker-popup

46692509

then translate width and height to its height and width

46692509
portrait	landscape
do not want to make activity portrait and landscape

i am able to rotate the view pager but not able to interchange width and height of the viewpager

46692509
width	height
i am not sure why layoutparams is not affecting to width and height when orientation changes

rotation works fine but after rotation width and height are not interchanging

46692619
dplyr	tidyr
using the dplyr and tidyr package

46692635
folder	directory
also i don t think it is good idea to serve node_modules directory as static folder

46692642
clsid	createobject
if you search your registry for scripting.dictionary under hkey_local_machine software classes clsid you ll eventually find a key named with a progid subkey having a value of scripting.dictionary and an inprocserver32 subkey with a value of c windows system32 scrrun.dll and if the vba runtime succeeds at creating an instance of the type with the specified progid in that type library then the createobject call succeeds and returns the instance

46692724
min	max
so i used the class rectf to keep track of my min and max x y coordinates when drawing the image

46692724
min	max
i created a rectf object in my constructor called mdrawnarearect then i added a method to find the min and max x y values called findminmax

46692790
versioning	upgrade
simply upgrade your library to the newest versioning either through nuget or via github directly

46692845

with firebase real time database we can delete a huge list of items with one single command simply by calling remove on the parent node the node is deleted and all is children too

46692864
subtract	add
i want to add p.l_value and p.i_value and with this result subtract c.con_value subtract one column to another column in different table the function below compiles successfully but the subtract result is not correct

46692865
implements	extends
you could create your own class which extends label and implements cloneable and in that class override the clone method and do that for every other node you wish to deep copy as well this is the most robust solution but it may be more than you need

46692871
integer	unsigned
the timestamp is a single 64-bit unsigned integer that represents the number of units of time that have elapsed since 1970-01-01 00 00 00 utc

versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade this to versioning 1.12.1 due to some new plugins that have been added and require a newer versioning of jquery

46692942
versioning	upgrade
it looks like htmlstring was depreciated in versioning 1.9 and reading the upgrade guide at it states the format for recognising if html is passed into the selector has changed however it also says

46692957
mouse	keyboard
my guess is that for every keyboard or mouse input that message should get printed

46692963
width	height
you can check it with surfacechanged surfaceholder holder int format int width int height the problem is camera orientation does not change

46693021

46693204
client-side	server-side
we need the actual scanning to take place server-side and cannot do the actual scan of the driver s license client-side because of reasons

46693222
getter	setter
if you really want to use getter and setter you can keep get and set but maybe rename getuser and setuser to just user

46693222
getter	setter
and then call or and your setter and getter will be called

46693222
getter	setter
but the idea behind getter and setter is that callers see them as just property accesses whereas you can implement them as methods that do more than just getting and setting properties

46693236
lapply	strsplit
a straightforward way would be to just use strsplit on the entire column and lapply .

46693240
hide	show
then return a boolean which is bound to an ngif to show or hide a combobox

46693240
put	get
i can put a mechanism to at least stop isdropdownneeded to get called all the time but parts of the application get data updates often and this can get expensive.

46693268
portrait	landscape
secondly if the input mp4 does not contain rotation metadata do you know which videos were captured in portrait mode and which ones were captured in landscape mode

46693268
portrait	landscape
the instructions below will help with mp4s where you know for sure they are in portrait mode - the same encoder settings will produce unexpected results if the video is in landscape mode

46693297
puts	gets
normally when i use googlesheets package on my desktop r studio it puts me through a browser based authentication where i select my google account for authentication and it gets approved.i use the gs_ls function for authentication

i know that oauth for google is common but from all of the post and google searches i cannot get anything to work

46693312
fast-forward	merge
then complete the pr with fast-forward merge in the case below

46693326
min	max
the logic is the same as in the previous script below just using a simpler string-only based comparison for ordering values determining min max

46693326
min	max
so on first value read first record we set the initial min max value to the timing read in the 3rd field

46693326
min	max
as we iterate we track the current min val and max val printing them in the end

46693326
min	max
initial values for min and max are taken from the first line

46693388
dictionary	map
i would suggest creating a dictionary and then map the values based on the integer value

46693396
rar	zip
i was working on an ionic2 project where my client is asking for installable mobile app files for 3-4 platforms together i have seen in cordova phonegap if you upload any client-side based project wrapped in zip or rar format and upload it in phonegap build they immediately provide the installable downloadable file for various platform in just one shot as shown in this video link

46693404
ready	each
btw if someone provides you the code working and ready to copy paste take your time in understand each line and even write your own implementation based on the provided one

46693412
post	get
and then thanks to this post i learned that those contents need to be loaded by the page so the website itself makes requests to get that data outgoing requests so what i did was to search for those outgoing requests using firefox developer edition you can use any other system that shows you these requests like tamper data and build the url that gives me the html content i was looking for

46693430
hash	salt
for example if i am saving user s hash passwords to a db is the salt that it used to hash the password the same for every password

46693791
junit	mockito
so in my mockito junit test i do the following

46693813
squash	merge	squash	branch
also note that even if you use a merge and squash etc some git servers like github actually create a shadow branch for prs so while the original commits might be gc-ed on your local machine they might continue to exist on the server

46693815
ubuntu	linux
swift on linux ubuntu in my case will produce the same number every time if you put the srandom call inside my getrandomnum function

46693845
scatter	graphing
i m attempting to link a highcharts graphing with an html table and it appears i can link the two just fine however i am unable to find any documentation or examples on how to define multiple series for a scatter plot - everything i can find is a bar or line graphing which doesn t translate well to scatter

46693858
implements	extends
btw i think it should implements controlvalueaccessor instead of extends defaultvalueaccessor

46693880
bower	npm
i am using angular 1.4.14 bower 1.8.0 and npm 3.6.0

46693929
png	ico	gif	png	gif	ico
as for the ico vs png if you want to support older browsers like internet explorer 10 and lower you will need to define the .ico favicon as these browsers do not support png gif jpeg or svg favicons

46693967
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
for this case i can imagine having gridbaglayout for the panel with buttons and labels which will be centered in the jframe s borderlayout.center alignment and having the buttons at the bottom with boxlayout orientation

i d like to create a third array results that is the result of applying linspace to max and min value

46694207
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
the question was and still is when doing a groupby how can i apply different aggregate-functions to different fields sum of x avg of x min of y max of z etc. and rename the resulting fields all in one go or at least in a possibly pythonic and not-too-cumbersome way

46694212
post	put
i am wondering how to specify certain properties as required for post put for the object

46694246
post	get
all my mvc controllers have a method get on them and a number of them have a post as well

46694246
post	get
problem is if i do so in the current state http post requests will end up posting to api example get

46694246
post	get
it would probably be worth adding some controllers have extra get and post methods on them which are reached at api controller action meaning i need to have a route to specified somewhere

46694246
post	get
however doing so means that my default get and post methods are no longer accessible by just the controller name hence adding as a default action in maproute

46694267
put	get
if i put the include java on either node that works correctly and one node will get java and the other will not but it does not appear to be respecting any of the settings i have in the java.pp

46694298
put	get
however when i put the command java -cp target parser-1.5.7.release.jar com.ef.parser i get error

46694315

nonetype	iterable
i ve attempted to use read_sql in the following way after establishing my connection prod_db and get the error message nonetype object is not iterable

46694377

46694414
changeset	cherry-pick
if the commits you want to see collapsed are non-linear in the brnch branch then you will need to resort to graft which is cherry-pick individual commits - and you can collapse hg fold all grafted changeset subsequently in your release branch provided you keep them initially in phase draft

46694446

awt	swing
you have to execute it via applet tag from html or from some awt swing container

46694549
stdout	stderr
i think the main problem is that http.server somehow is logging the output to stderr here i have an example with asyncio reading the data either from stdout or stderr

46694549
stdout	stderr
it just redirects the stderr to stdout and only stdout is read

46694605
min	max
if all you need is to find earliest min and latest max times you can just convert the times to a character and use min max

min	max
i must print to the terminal details about three different arrays and then i run a selection sort and print out the sorted arrays and their max and min values

46694695

public	protected
keep in mind however that derived class would be free to expose the function in some other way such as calling the protected method from a public one and there is no way to prevent that

46699442
public	protected
in this case one way to implement would be to declare the base class as abstract have a public method serve as the entry point for the algorithm and define specific methods used within the algorithm as protected abstract methods to lay out what the responsibility of derived classes will be

46699442
public	protected
this pattern does a nice job of leaving public only those things that are intended to be consumed by the world but can present some challenges from a unit testing perspective which are sometimes addressed by raising the visibility of the helper methods from protected to internal

46699495

46709234
int	double
now consider the main file where two instances of the templated object array one for int and another for double is created

46709234
int	double
because in the main file array int and array double objects are instantiated compiler instantiates two different definitions of array class one each for double and int and then instantiate the array objects in the main.cpp file

46709234
int	double
note till this point the function definitions for array int getlength and array double getlength is still missing in the main.cpp file but since the source code is well formed the compiler compiles the main.cpp file without any hassle

46709234
int	double
in the meanwhile the code file for array.cpp containing the template function definitions for array t getlength and array t getelement is compiled but by this time the compiler would have forgotten that main.cpp needs array int getlength and array double getlength and would happily compile the code array.cpp without generating any instances for int and double version of the function definition needed by the main.cpp file

46709234
int	double
it is during the linking phase horrible template errors start popping because of the missing function definitions for int and double version of template function definition that are required by the main file

46709234
int	double
but in the case of templates the linker which executes after the compilation phase cannot do a task that a compiler is suppose to do i.e generate a code in this case for int and double type of the template function

i calculate a number of aggregate-functions using groupby and agg because i need different aggregate-functions for different variables not the sum of all but sum and mean of x mean of y etc

46714555
aggregate-functions	sum
however as i said i am not sure how to implement these solutions with an agg and i need agg because i need to apply different aggregate-functions to different columns again not the sum of all but sum and mean of x mean of y etc.

46714733
google-chrome	safari
and a bit about browsers almost all google-chrome users has a error because of redirecting to https safari too btw but in case of mozila users they almost don t have error and site opens under http protocol

46714746
folder	directory
copy the files shapefiles .csv etc. from the individual folder in the directory 2017 to the folder of the same name if it exists it may not and that s okay in the directory 2018

46714746
folder	directory
if folder x exists in both directory 2017 and 2018 copy files y_2017 from folder x in 2017 to folder x in 2018

46714785
int	chars
but the approach would be to map each of these strings to a symbol digit or chars and iterate over the int range as appropriate to your number strings and their lengths

46714785
int	chars
convert each int to its representation in your base and lookup the mapping to extract the chars for that location from the value string stored at that key

46714840
getter	setter
setter getter ids are skipped

46714843
width	height
if so should i change the x y or the width height

46714884
fast-forward	merge
a fast-forward operation which is not actually a merge at all just moves a branch label

46714910
tensorflow	word2vec
using a pre-trained word embedding word2vec or glove in tensorflow

46714925
ssl	https
also when using this method you should use https ssl as this will reduce the risk of people seeing your key by viewing the request on the network

46714944
post	get
the only difference between the two is that one is a get request and one is a post request

46714985
post	get
in one post in express i would like send to another server two requests and i would like to get two responses to client side angular in my case

46714991
d3.js	c3.js
you can use c3.js oninit callback with d3.js attr function

46714993
put	get
so first put the mask into the alpha channel then scale the result to one pixel turn alpha off and get the pixel color

46714996
getter	setter
aaand finally the alarm parcelable excluded getter and setter

46715011
getter	setter
to provide an understanding on why getter and setter are useful given below are some important points obtained from this article

46715029
min	max
i have a reactive from with input text which will validate min date max date and input format mm dd yyyy which is perfectly working as expected when user types

46715029
min	max
in this date picker if user types i m not able to validate min max format as this is not binding value on each type change only if valid date format is typed

46715063
versioning	upgrade
if possible you should upgrade openssl to versioning 1.0.1 or above

46715120
post	put
it s a post can t put them in url and can t put them inner model

46715170
arrayiterator	each
in short words if you want to be able to easily get item from a collection managers in your case you may want doctrine to map your managers in a way where some value of each manager is a key in array arrayiterator actually so you can get it like

46715171
jar	war
if you have a spring boot application you can package your application as jar war and start it with java -jar application.war command

46715176
int	double
i have a class litem that contains strings int and double

46715190
google-chrome	firefox
in my case the webpage works fine in firefox and google-chrome browser but in ie v.11 it shows error as error comes in ie 11 developer tools

46715200
folder	directory
loads various python routines from the templatetags directory of an installed django app in installed_apps in settings.py think of this like import package but you are limitted to packages only available inside the templatetag folder of an installed app

46715211
flask	django
i would start by learning python 2 - 3 months and then a framework like django or flask 2 - 3 months

46715225
for-loop	arrays
however you have yet to create and allocate an object to all the indices of the arrays graphobs when this for-loop executes

46715252
textview	imageview
you want the textview to appear over the imageview

46715252
textview	imageview
to achieve that you actually just need to move the textview xml element below the imageview element

46715252
textview	imageview
because views are layered in top to bottom order in terms of the xml layout this will place the textview on top of the imageview

46715252
textview	imageview
you want the imageview to simply not overlap the textview

46715263
getter	setter
my solution is to put propertyname issent before your getter and setter

46715274
mouseover	mouseenter
also change the event type to mouseover since mouseenter doesn t bubble and so the event.target is always the bound element

46715275
opera	google-chrome
the code is working on google-chrome opera and microsoft edge

46715301
folder	directory
i currently have a directory with folder for departments inside of them

46715301

the category id is assigned to every directory that is a parent with or without children but if that directory is nested inside another directory it has no category id and instead has a parentid

46715306
filtering	grouping
i have to first grouping by the documents based on the name and then apply a filtering on the previouscount and currentcount fields and count the number of occurences for which the conditions satisfy

46715313
scipy	scikit-learn
usually stuff like that is found easily when using github s search-function which i often use for numpy scipy scikit-learn and co. followed by going through the possible candidates where a bit of experience can filter out stuff early

46715332
google-chrome	firefox
please note that with both firefox and google-chrome the result is returned in pixels and might be converted into points if need be

however any attempts to now create an nsurl using a file path nsstring that points to the same file will fail

46715375
textview	imageview
change the order textview - imageview to imageview - textview

46715381
post	get
i ve looked at a few different post on here and i cant seem to get what i m specifically trying to do to work

46715390
width	height
a cgrect itself does not have content it is just an origin width and height

46715391
children	parent
lets suppose that i have a relationship in which a parent can have many children and the parent has properties that are summarized data about the children order.totalquantity

46715398
ksort	asort
so i used ksort as well as asort to get them both to return

46715405
post	get
the validator then works as i expect for a post but the patch rule set doesn t get executed

46715409
seaborn	matplotlib
i would like to set different levels of transparency alpha for the edge line and fill of a distribution plot that i created in matplotlib seaborn

46715478
dplyr	purrr
from there you can use purrr to add two classification columns and then can use dplyr for the rest

46715479
post	get
it maybe a http post or get call

46715493
try-catch	exception-handling
i have try-catch blocks around the service s onstart method and the main method in the service and no exception-handling is ever thrown

46715499
google-chrome	safari
when i load this html in google-chrome safari the cursor works as it should the enitre button is treated as a simple character and i can move right and left and a single delete or back space deletes the button

46715499
google-chrome	safari
the image is treated well with cursor when i press left and right keys i can see the cursor moving as it should but this doesn t happen when i use input type button although that works very well in google-chrome and safari

46715597
express	node.js
now i connect node.js with mongodb and query databse using express

46715609
for-loop	while-loop	for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays	loops	while-loop
nesting a for-loop inside a while-loop when all you need to do is loops through an arrays one time is quite unnecessary

46715617
width	height
the goal is to have the top wrapper container green to take on the height of the vertical black wrapper and the left column wrapper to be no larger than the width of the rotated black wrapper

46715617
width	height
by default the rotation seems to be applied after all the width height for all divs have been calculated

46715617
width	height
the aforementioned question is only asking about the height and does not solve the width problem

46715617
width	height
i tried this option and while i can fix the height issue i can t make it work to fix the width problem.

46715617
width	height
i fixed the problem by writing a small js function that gives me the exact width and height of the div when horizontal and used the values to set the width of the div once rotated by 90 degrees using writing-mode vertical-rl

46715623
mouseover	mouseenter
i debugged jquery on chrome and the jquery mouseenter event is actually using a mouseover event under the hood

46715623
mouseevent	mouseover
if you pause there and inspect arguments you ll find that it s a mouseevent with a type of mouseover

46715623
mouseover	mouseenter
which sort of makes sense since you re using jquery s delegate event handler syntax and jquery is being clever enough to substitute mouseenter which doesn t bubble and doesn t trigger as you move through the event handler s descendents with mouseover which does fire when you move through the listener s children

46715746
chown	chmod
and some cases will need add the php folder to current user permissions using command chown username -r path to php or using chmod 777 -r path to php

46715767
int	chars
adding a short int to a chars results in an int which apparently is 4 bytes on your system

46715767
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer types the operand with the type of lesser

46715767
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has

46715767
integer	unsigned
converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer

46715767
integer	unsigned
integer type then the operand with unsigned integer type is

46715788
unsigned	short	int	chars
when integral types like chars short int bool take less number of bytes than int then these data types are automatically promoted to int or unsigned int when an operation is performed on them

46715788
int	chars	int	boolean
c11 â 6.3.1.1 boolean chars and int

46715804
pull	push
can some one please explain first what the best syntax is and the best way to pull out this information to push it to a list array

46715825
keydown	keyup
should i be emitting custom events that are already natively supported by the child components such as keyup keydown etc

46715825
children	parent
the reason i ask is that i am unsure if the propagation upwards of native events from children to the top level parent is consistent in all cases

46715864
put	get
what i would like to do is to get from this repeated object the key and value only if its the same across all over the objects and put it aside in an new object that contains all the same repeated pairs of key value while also remove it from that repeated object inside of every one of the objects

46715877
put	get
and if you put pointers in templates you get a bit of both behaviors

46715935
post	get
if you are making a generic http service it s acceptable to use post to send a complex query and to get a response

46715939
post	get
the problem i am facing is that this post back does not occur and the server side event of selectedindexchanged does not get raised

46716017

46716189
min	max
i want to assign it a zone if it is greater than the min but less than the max

create an api in your existing php application which your angular app can access via a get post request using angulars http client

46716256
subtract	add
the addhours method allows you to add hours to the datetime but also to subtract

46716325
concave	convex
fillconvexpoly works perfectly on convex shapes only in this case there is a concave corner at point #27 and hence the results are messed up

46716335
button	checkbox
i gather will get the name-value pairs rather succinctly but that s not simple to translate into a collection of elements with only the checked radio button and checkbox

46716341
width	height
and with both small and large size label canvas is consuming me same height and width

46716363
subtract	add	margin	height
instead of trying to figure out where to scroll to using the scrolltooffset method i m still using the scrolltoindex method and use the viewoffset parameter in order to calculate how much offset to add to the method the difference between the expanded and collapsed height of any other currently expanded item if any and subtract the top margin of the clicked item

46716444

46716493
jobs	cron
the only exception to this is cron jobs which i typically always hardcode full paths

46716498
qheaderview	qabstractitemmodel
in some simple cases you can change section colors of qheaderview by using methods of a qabstractitemmodel and roles

46716519
for-loop	loops
you do not return in loops which aborts the for-loop right there

46716519
for-loop	loops
instead create a new list append the lowered elements to it inside the for-loop amd return once loops is done

46716587
post	get
hey guys i am trying to get all post of a specific subcategory no category

46716906
children	parent
i want to check all the children links remove children that have no live links and remove parent that have all their children removed

46716922
post	put
for web this is fixed via an anti-forgery token which is sent back with put and post verbs although you can do it with all verbs

46716922
post	put
a malicious web site could try to send a request and would certainly pickup your session cookie but the absence of the anti-forgery token in the put post causes it to fail

46716926
sqoop	hadoop
sqoop jobs run on hadoop can extract from oracle and write to hive or hbase tables and then your integration would be using hive context on spark which enables you to perform analytics

google-chrome	firefox
the only platform where this is an issue is win10 google-chrome firefox touchscreen

46717252
google-chrome	firefox
the solution which i ve found works is to disable touch on each browser -- firefox dom.w3c_touch_events google-chrome touch events api

46717252
google-chrome	firefox
as mentioned above this is only an issue on touchscreen win 8 10 machines in firefox and google-chrome

you are free to save the ids of every liker of a specific post nested in the post structure but if you feel you don t need to retrieve all this information every time you get a post let s suppose you query a list of post only to show as a summary cards then you won t want to have it nested but flat under a post_likes postid node for example

46717679
post	get
update thanks jim for the response i guess that is something about send the cookie that is saved the first time i make a get request and then send this cookie on a post request with the correct parameters

46717822
getter	setter
i think we can access this because groovy adds getter and setter for all the variables

46717863
accessor	properties
this assignment calls the properties let accessor of the bar properties of the foo object which could look something like this

46717863
accessor	properties
notice there s no properties let accessor so this

46717863
accessor	properties
isn t legal because the text properties doesn t expose a properties let accessor

46717863
accessor	properties
and knows that bar is a read-only properties that only exposes a properties get accessor then the only way for this code to be legal is if bar returns an object that has a default member that can be assigned to take that value

46719572
inline	constexpr
it s also worth noting that you can often in practice get away with static constexpr member variables without definitions when compiling with optimization since they can end up inline in all uses but if you compile without optimization often your program will fail to link

46719572
inline	constexpr
the approach is a bit convoluted though in c++17 static constexpr member variables are implicitly inline

width	height
the best user experience is explicitly setting the height and width before the image is downloaded

46721058
width	height
if you are using a third party api to fetch the image facebook or youtube api the return will include the image url along with the height and width for the image

46721058
width	height
this way you can set the height and width of the cell and then wait for the image to download without any interruption or change in the size of cells

46721058
width	height
by having the height and width set explicitly you don t need to worry as much about the content mode to use for the image view

46721058
width	height
i would only recommend using a self sizing uitableviewcell if you are explicitly setting the height and width of image view within that cell

the heap manager allocates free memory from os in bigger chunks and then it micro-manages it for the user code supporting new delete malloc free which actually don t go directly to os memory manager that s what the internal c runtime will do when it will exhaust its current pool of available memory

46728763
stdout	stderr
if it was some c c++ application with default standard libraries it will further adjust the environment to make the c runtime initialized it will probably straight away allocate some basic heap memory from os and set up the c memory allocator prepare the stdin stdout stderr streams and connect to other os services as needed and finally call the main ... passing the argc argv alongside

min	max
if your numbins also min and max variable can not change your data structure is of fixed size then it should be thread-safe allowing parallel modification of different bins

46729395

as long as tcpclient resources are properly released back to the os by calling dispose a single tcplistener can create a tcpclient for each and every incoming connection

i even tried with 2 recyclerview one on top second on bottom and in center imageview and textview

46731666
subclass	abstract-class
you can define another abstract-class and use it as the subclass without needing to implement those methods however eventually you will find yourself creating a concrete subclass and at that exact point you must implement all the abstract methods as they are a sort of contract that must be fulfilled

46731666
super	implements	super	abstract
as to why well it forces certain design decisions onto you the coder which seem logical for example let s say you re making a game and you have many different types of enemies in mind for the game you ll have a common super-class for all of them class monster and every behavior that is similar you ll put inside that super class and since you don t know how a monster moves for example you will mark that method behavior as abstract and a good reason why would be because you want to force everyone that is working with you on the game to implements that behavior when they are designing their concrete monster hope the example helped illustrate it a bit better

46731676
implements	extends	subclass	abstract-class
if your subclass is also abstract public abstract-class myabstractclass extends theoriginalclass you don t have to implements any of the methods

46731676
implements	extends
if your subclass is concrete public class myclass extends theoriginalclass you ll need to implements all the methods

this still has some repetition in each put call you have to type the variable name twice but it s much better from a maintenance perspective dramatically harder to get the two out of sync

46732252
range	min	range	max	min	max
you cannot access the range min and max values in range min max from c#

46732252

1 .hard-code the min max values from c# in a constant variable

46732252
range	min	range	max	min	max
make sure that they match the values in the range min max function

my question is that in a 2d array there is no way to store both chars and int is there a way to initialize the following matrix in java

46734781
multiplication	modulo
the optimal way to calculate b e is not easy to determine but all the ways involve calculating intermediate powers of b the only practical uncertainty is in what order. when you want the result modulo n do all the successive multiplication modulo n calculate b 2 mod n then square and reduce modulo n to get b 4 mod n etc

46734781
division	multiplication
each time you perform a multiplication take the remainder of the division by n before you do anything else

46734786
hide	show
you should use divid.style.display none to hide and divid.style.display block to show

46734808

the returned pointer must be deallocated with free or realloc

46734808
free	realloc
the returned pointer must be deallocated with free or realloc

46734808
free	malloc
now i know that posix mandates the memory will be free upon program termination so in practice calling malloc and terminating immediately will not do any harm

46734808
free	malloc
the program is ub if a pointer returned by malloc is not free d or does the standard define consequences of failing to meet this requirement

46734824
integer	unsigned
sample.c 7 9 warning large integer implicitly truncated to unsigned type -woverflow

46734835
for-loop	loops
is this a case of using a for-loop when i should be using a while loops on the inside

46734852
width	height
to do that i will have 9 images batch x 9 x height x width at the end of the network

46734852

folder	directory
what i m trying to do is create one over-arching github repository that can house each one of these different sets of directory folder hierarchy and files

46735038
bash	zsh
if process substitution is not available in your shell since it s not defined in posix but is supported in bash zsh and ksh you use named pipes or easier save the intermediate result to files first holding first name last holding last name only

46735038
spaces	delimiter
if you need to also include a spaces between the last and first name you can paste from three sources middle one being a null source like dev null or shorter - null command in a process substitution and reusing delimiter from a list of two comma and spaces

46735046
namedtuple	dictionary
i would like to convert subset of namedtuple into one dictionary

46735077

it s meant more as when the allocated memory is deallocated it must be done with free or realloc because only those functions will do it correctly. there is no such imperative in the actual spec

46735083
min	max
we can add min and max to the group by query

46735093

for-loop	arrays
you declare and initialise the arrays inside the for-loop

46735806
for-loop	arrays
if you did infact intend to keep track of all the results in this arrays then you should move outside of the for-loop as currently it is redeclared and initialised with each iteration

46735806
for-loop	arrays
print the contents of your arrays arr to the console in the for-loop and you ll see what i mean

46735846

46735980
int	chars
is there a way to have the decimal value in int of ascii extended ascii chars in c especially the extended ones

46736020
free	malloc
i ve read that repetitive calls to malloc free can be expensive and for this reason c++ standard library containers use memory pools rather than calling free in their destructors

46736020
free	malloc
most implementations of malloc free do not return free memory to the operating system but merely make it available for future malloc calls within the same program

46736020
free	malloc
this means that essentially the malloc free functions try to do the very same job as the c++ standard library containers they try to optimize repetitive claiming reclaiming memory by keeping memory in a pool and then giving the program pieces of this pool on request

46736040
int	chars
is it only the fixed size contiguous memory corresponding to the its type an int some size_t for the string s length and some pointer to the chars in the string like it would be done in c

filtering	grouping
each time the api is called the search api obtains a grouping of possible matches starting at in the result set and then filtering out the results based on different parameters e.g spam duplicates safesearch setting etc finally leaving a final result set.â if the final result after filtering and optimization is more than the count parameter then the number of results equal to count would be returned

46736197
free	malloc
for example if you re using every node in the list is the same size and having the container maintain a list of unused nodes just two pointer assignments to add or remove a node to from the free list may be faster than releasing unused nodes back to the more general but more complex general-purpose memory manager used by new delete malloc free

implements	extends
because enums cannot extends thought maybe interface might help here but if an enum implements an interface then each of it s instances just implements not the enum itslef

46743867
put	get
so i thought maybe create a class and inside put the enum then i could extend the get best method

46743886

after i add height width constraint image have not show

46744008
free	malloc
modern malloc implementations use multiple arenas to improve concurrent performance and offload large allocations to anonymous mmap ensuring that free returns them to the os

46744008
alloca	malloc
it is possible to imagine a version of alloca that queries this information from the os and returns a proper error condition but then its performance edge would be lost quite possibly even compared to malloc which only occasionally needs to go to the os to grab more memory for the process and usually works in user-space

46744015

46744594
min	max
the problem is you re not setting the default max min before starting to search

46744594
min	max
that means it s going to start at 0 which assuming you have only positive numbers will probably work for max but will fail for min opposite for negatives and fails for both positive and negatives

46760189
free	malloc
while at first glance this looks a bit like cheating the missing free actually looses you time since you did not free your memory the next malloc cannot reuse it

46760189
free	malloc
this may be largely due to the fact that the new delete pair is not as efficient as malloc free on my machine as i d bet on std string to use new delete

46761174
getter	setter	accessor	properties
it has getter and setter accessor which can override the accessor of the properties to override

46761174
getter	setter
in this case override var f int is essentially treated as a computed property with a getter and setter that forwards onto super with an additional call onto the didset implementation in the setter

46761205
fold	combinators
the conduit-combinators package provides combinators that allow streams to be treated much like lists in particular foldlc allows us to perform a strict left fold over a conduit stream instead of a list

46761214
swift	objective-c
in swift 4 you need to use objective-c in front of the printdocument func

46761221

46761822
getter	setter
i was just trying to define a property getter on java class and got told that java doesn t use getter and setter and does not in fact have properties

46761827
getter	setter
provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values

46761827
getter	setter
however declaring the getter and setter that way exposes the variables you declared as private in the first step

46761833
post	get
good morning i m trying to make an update ctrol + f5 than when i take the variable by the get or post method and depending on the variable the page is refreshed but only once

46761898
implements	extends
public class homeactivity extends appcompatactivity implements

46761914
getter	setter
to define a property in a bean class supply public getter and setter methods

46761914
getter	setter
if you introspect it with java s reflection api and manipulate propertydescriptors you will notice that they delegate read write operations to the getter and setter

46762006
for-loop	loops
every time the outer loops runs it creates the inner for-loop

46762006
for-loop	loops
luckily it is in fact being changed inside the for-loop and after running twice and outputting two twice the value of k is now 0 and exits loops

46762214
folder	directory
i need to rename all the files in a given directory to the folder name and keep the extension of the file

46762237
int	chars
the string itself is an iterable so you can iterate over it and convert each chars to an int and then use sum to add them

46762247
division	modulo
the semantics of modulo are linked with the semantics of integer division generally if q is the result of integer division a b and r is the result of a mod b then must always be true so different methods of rounding the result of integer division to an integer will produce different results for modulo

46762247
division	modulo
in languages like c java ocaml and many others integer division rounds towards 0 which causes the result of modulo to always have the same sign as the dividend

46762247
division	modulo
in languages like python ruby and many others integer division always rounds down towards negative infinity which causes the result of modulo to always have the same sign as the divisor

46762264
int	chars
this goes through each chars in the string turns it into an int and adds it to the total

46762275
min	max
as for the min and max you could have two variable that keeps track of these numbers and continue requesting numbers until the stopping condition

46762275
min	max
here the first input is taken as the min and max value

46762275
min	max
note that if the user enters stop for the first value min and max will also be stop

google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this function works well with google-chrome and opera but not in firefox edge

46762341
min	max
as they mentioned you need to keep a track of the list to get the min and max

46762341

free	malloc
perl is no different here - once malloc ed and free d the c library upon which perl depends keeps the memory for future use so that if you need to reuse the memory no expensive kernel calls are required specifically brk and it can simply be reused

46762436
pthreads	fork
other options are to either bite the bullet load pthreads prior to fork off any servers which should leave all of that in shared copy-on-write memory and thus only take up 2mb of memory for 5k servers or fork load pthreads in the child do the dirty work exit the child and continue in the parent

46762486
post	get
when you re making post call set responsetype of request to arraybuffer inside configuration so that response will get transformed to correctly

i don t know if pixel by pixel blending can even be made very efficient but one reason for slow performance might be that i need to get the imagedata and put it back each time a new image is blended into canvas

when saving a password verifier just using a hash function such as md5 is not sufficient and just adding a salt does little to improve the security

powermock does not work with jacoco

46770890

making the containers height and width greater than space available can also work if the flow of webpage is natural.you will have to do this manually by force setting the width of container and allowing parent element to overflow

46775277
width	height
because the image has a width naturalwidth and getboundingclientrect .width and respective properties for height t i m unsure how to accomplish this where i can send to imagick just an x and y for the cropimage arguments

46775296
width	height
this means that you don t have control on width and height

46775296

accessor	properties
looking at beanwrapperimpl which is the most common properties accessor it has a basic feature of auto-registering default properties editors from the spring packages in addition to the jdk s standard propertyeditors so basically it s completely linked to javabeans basically properties and their accessor with special naming convention which means it has no support for any other style like in your case builder pattern

46775835

unsigned	short
i know that when we compare signed with unsigned the compiler converts our signed values to unsigned and when we compare a short with int the compiler converts the smaller type to the larger one

46776297
unsigned	short
but i wrote this code to check if we compared an signed int x 0xdeadbeef and unsigned short y 0xffff then after converting the unsigned short to int we should have 0x0000ffff in y at the comparison which should be smaller than the unsigned value of x

46776299
int	double
all other members are very small like int or double in my case

see xml api versioning 6.3 to 8.0 upgrade

46776538
min	max
i am trying to implement two textinputs to interact with the sliderbar to control the min and max values to be more accurate on the same time

46776594
integer	unsigned
for example if you need to load a unsigned integer from an 8 bit value in ecx s register you can write

46776605
post	get
the issue isn t solely in the post but also on the get as illustrated in the code sample below which results in the same error

46776613
hide	show
however you seem to want your modal buttons to hide one modal and show another so set a function to them manually like so

46776648
integer	unsigned
when you type-cast x from unsigned to signed it results in integer overflow

46776674
put	get
so essentially i have to put in a password 5 times to get to the app to full functionality where i just swipe over to access different pages

46776727
hive	hdfs
seems like namespace is just some hdfs path or some prefix against a hive hbase table to designate it amongst others

46776747
width	height
i need the map to be 100 width and height

46776747
width	height
that doesn t work in my current set up so i m using absolute positioning to make it 100 height and width

46776801
put	get
i am trying to get the variables of the freqs to add and put the total in the geom_bar

46776805
lme4	lsmeans
i am using lmer from the lme4 package and lsmeans from lsmeans package

46776839
postgresql	mysql
i think its better you use a database like mysql or postgresql for this.but if you want to do it using csv i think you can first read the file and store the details in a list list file.readlines .update the required list values and write the list into the file

46776861
hide	show
i have a container and i render objects successfully but when i hide show the container s parents the rendered scene is gone

46776890
min	max
in our case we apply your custom function of abs min z - max z where z is an array that groups all of the third column values belonging to the same id

46776902
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
i am trying to use a for-loop to loops through an arrays and check the first letter of each word in the arrays and check to see if it starts with an m but i can t seem to figure out how to correctly set that up

46776945
junit	mockito
and my junit test case using mockito is

46776945
getter	setter
now for code coverage i have to call 200 setter methods while preparing objects and asserts 200 getter methods for junit test

46776975
post	get
the problem however is when i m entering the page thats calling the plugin equal the team page with the sortcode i need to get post id within my plugin to retrieve get_post_meta

46776979
subtract	add
b add or subtract equal amounts to each one until the sum 1

46776982

46776999
folder	directory
now when sending create a file in public directory tried saving to my app folder - same denial problem

46777016
apache	nginx
i ve been able to set up a reverse proxy using nginx at first and then just now apache and everything has been working fine except that something is causing a consistent 2-minute delay when i try to post a multipart form

46777016
apache	nginx
i m willing to be proven wrong but i m fairly certain that neither my nginx configuration nor my apache configuration is at fault because i tested both of them individually and it happened under both of them pointing to a problem with my tomcat 8 ssl certificate or possibly aws configuration

46777038
post	get
you could do something like the following if you want to keep the same endpoint for a post after login and then a get to the same endpoint

46777071
stdout	stderr
as it was a daemon i closed stdout and stderr at the start of execution

46777103
getter	setter
so finally you test only the getter setter methods

46777157
ready	each
then in your before each using testbed create the component instance and now you are ready to apply mouse events and test them in real situation

46777200
int	chars
i am writing a series of chars on a file generated by random int

46777209

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
as the subject says the form works in google-chrome opera and ie and fails in safari and firefox

46777254
post	get
i can post the post method from my rest api but i m skipping it for now since it works anytime it is hit but obviously cannot do anything if it does not get called

46777254
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
bottom line what can i do to make this form work in firefox an safari without breaking it s behavior in google-chrome opera and ie

46777263
awt	swing
for a deeper understanding in how custom painting works in swing check oracle s lesson performing custom painting and painting in awt and swing tutorials

46777266
serializable	deserialization
gson is an object serializable deserialization library

46777295
puts	fflush	puts	gets	fflush	gets
what is interesting for me is to know what better solution i could use rather than io.popen -- puts fflush gets puts etc.

46777297
ionic	angular
i want to add a new loader into the threejs library the only problem is that i m using ionic 3 angular 4

46777326
swift	objective-c
i m learning ios development and choose to move back and forth between objective-c and swift to notice differences or similarities

46777382
put	get	post	get	post	put
having all of the get post put delete etc

46777423
range	min	range	max	min	max
the trick relies on the fact that input of type range enforce the min max constraints

46777431
ng-show	ng-hide
you can do it with simply thinking about ng-show and ng-hide

46777431
ng-show	ng-hide
you essentially just use ng-show and ng-hide correctly

46777431
hide	show
you just have to remember to show hide things in the correct places

46777453
implements	extends
plus that can t work for scalar types as you can t extends implements a scalar type

46777458
getter	setter
you d create a private instance variable and then you would write the idiomatic getter and setter for that value

46777458
getter	setter
by convention the setter was prefixed with set and the getter had no prefix it was just the property name

46777458
getter	setter
most documentation today will demonstrate property access using dot notation but the getter and setter methods are autogenerated and are still available for direct use

46777466
hide	show
i m displaying all available objects in array via ngfor and i wish to add a toggle button to show hide details per each array element

46777475
strsplit	substr
in javascript strsplit adds all captured substr into the resulting array

46777510
ng-show	ng-hide
1 however i have seen that the ng-show ng-hide does not seem to be evaluated when the form loads and both conflicting items are shown

46777510
ng-show	ng-hide
2 after i do start filling the form and after only one activates if i were to backspace a form input and make it blank the ng-show or ng-hide does not revaluate

46777522
min	max
but i want to plot same image as above but with cluster color intensity transparent min to deep max color based on value

46777535
accessor	properties
you access or set an objectâ s properties via accessor methods

46777535
accessor	properties
by default these accessor methods are synthesized automatically for you by the compiler so you donâ t need to do anything other than declare the properties using properties in the class interface

46777535
accessor	properties
for details see this link use accessor methods to get or set properties values

46777542
subclass	abstract-class
i am looking for a way to implement an abstract-class or effectively abstract that enforces only one instance of each subclass

46777550
apache	nginx
im moving a ips install from one server to another the old one was on nginx and the new server is apache im getting a 404 on every page apart from the homepage

46777552
post	get
i would like to be able to have default routing to get and post for requests without a specified action yet still route to other actions when specified - and to be able to achieve this without having to mark every single controller and method with the same damn thing

46777552
post	get
using maproute in app.addmvc doesn t work because if i specify i can t reach get and post without adding get or post to the end of my request there is no difference with

46777552
post	get
the closest i have got was which routes to get methods by default but breaks the ability to reach default post methods

46777567
leaflet	proj
i am currently busy on a proj where i would take a list of churches within an area and place the location of the churches onto a leaflet map using markers

46777608

ubuntu	linux
not ubuntu amazon linux

46777631
qstring	qdatetime
qdatetime tostring const qstring format returns the datetime as a string

46777656
clearinterval	settimeout	setinterval	settimeout	setinterval	clearinterval
anytime you call settimeout or setinterval it returns a numeric id which you can then pass to cleartimeout or clearinterval to abort it before it runs

46777670
express	node.js
since you re using node.js you ll likely be using express

46777759
for-loop	loops
all i have is the nested for-loop that will loops through the anchor tags under each div tag but i am not sure if its correct

46777835

46777859
keras	cntk
i m running keras 2.0.6 with cntk 2.2 backend

46777899
namedtuple	dictionary
this project started out using namedtuple to translate dictionary -like json structures but it s needing quite a bit of expansion

46777899
metaclass	subclassing
the next step was for me to either create a metaclass that generates immutable objects based on pre-defined structures or to subclassing namedtuples adding several helper methods

46777916
google-chrome	firefox
tested on google-chrome 61.0 and firefox 56.0

46777930
public	protected
pascalcase for classes structs methods properties public | internal | protected fields regardless of static | readonly | const and private const fields

46778009

this will give you urls of for your get and post requests

46778042
awt	swing
start by having a look at performing custom painting and painting in awt and swing for more details

46778045
google-chrome	safari
this is how it appears on ios both safari and google-chrome

46778046
ssl	https
it s not easy setup squid cache or any other cache for https due the security on ssl tls certificates

46778104
goto	break
because your later goto s use these values your code will break if you set them to anything other than 0

46778125
subtraction	addition
carrying out simple operations like addition and subtraction becomes easy

46778148
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is a linux based operating system and its paths are case sensitive make sure you give exact path

46778148
folder	directory
because if you are running your pages as a localhost the relative paths mostly starts from the folder within www or web directory example if file is in

46778161
hide	show
why not just do all of the hide show logic in the ng-if

46778161
ng-show	ng-hide
just some random info about ng-if ng-show and ng-hide that might be helpful as well

46778161
ng-show	ng-hide
ng-show ng-hide on the other hand will still create the html to be displayed in the dom it will just add ng-hide as a class when the element should be hidden

46778161
ng-show	ng-hide
the above was a misunderstanding of the question i will leave it as it may be helpful when dealing with ng-if ng-show and ng-hide

46778173
swift	objective-c
its a common case of having a public header that has read-only properties and private headers with read write definitions as well as swift code unit tests in this case but could simply be a mixed objective-c swift project that needs to access the setters

46778205
width	height
if the footer height varies based on the width of the screen refer to this answer keeping footer at bottom of responsive website

46778260
children	parent
depending on your view on designer files you could also declare the immediately expected parent node of your listview or itself as a partial class to hook in these unmatched children elements in a separate file to avoid it getting wiped by the generator

46778271
mouseup	mousedown
how can i detect a valid mouse click mousedown and mouseup on my grids without having to create multiple callbacks to track if my element was actually clicked and not happened to mouseup while over it

46778310
children	parent
or you can do the same in another parent project and in all children put only specific configurations

46778354
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works fine on firefox safari google-chrome on mobile and it even works fine on other peoples google-chrome but the legend is not working on my google-chrome in development environment running on virtual box or production

46778365
laravel	codeigniter
coming from codeigniter i decided that it s time for something new and went for laravel

46778394
put	get
the probleme here it s probably where you increment your x try to put it at the end you will get 6 results

46778415
int	double
is undefined behaviour because an attempt is made to print an expression which has type int using a format specifier which claims it s a double

46778434
subtract	add
there are functions to add and subtract a number of months days minutes and seconds from a time_t which can be used to calculate the the time_t for a point in the past but it looks quite awkward to find the correct number of units to remove

46778436
h.265	hevc	h.264	h.265	h.264	hevc
here s a project on github that shows the issue - it simultaneously writes frames from the camera to files using the h.264 and h.265 hevc encoders and the resulting file sizes are printed to the console

46778436
h.264	hevc
at the qualities i m recording 720p or 1080p the file size of an hevc-encoded video should be 40-60 of an identical h.264-encoded video and i am seeing this when i use the default camera app on ios but when i use avassetwriter as above or in the project linked above i m seeing file sizes be about three times larger with hevc than with h.264

46778509
post	get
the intended post and get were fired correctly but there was another get inbetween somewhere because of the href tag in the link even though it was empty

46778511
versioning	upgrade
upgrade the sonarqube server to the newest versioning

46778532
put	get
also i had to put curly braces around the -h values to get passed the message forbidden error

46778581
put	get
the docs show that status 303 should make the redirect_to be called as a get but it s still a put

46778615
spaces	delimiter
why not read all the parameters as string using a delimiter of spaces

46778623
children	parent
update_model code should go fetch the children of that parent update the model refresh the tree and expand the parent node

46778623
children	parent
when i try to remove the selected parent node the one with no children and try inserting a new parent item with children it ends up addding the new parent with children above the parent node with no children so i end up with duplicated parent nodes

46778623
children	parent
i think what i am looking for is a way to update an existing node in the model so that the selected parent node can be updated with its children

46778624
g++	gcc
the only difference is that i used gcc and g++ with versions 4.8 and 4.9 instead of 4.3 and 4.4

46778672
width	height
if you run the code snippet below in full screen you ll see on initial load the image is fully surrounded by the pink box but when you resize make the height smaller the image shrinks and the flex container stays at the same width

46778705
dplyr	purrr
i strongly suspect there is a clever way to tackle this via either purrr or dplyr

46778744
google-chrome	firefox
the code works fine on google-chrome and firefox but on ie 11 you must click two times and then start to write something to input

46778749
width	height
i need a lot of control over the format of the pdf and objects in the pdf margins fonts tables column widths cell padding border widths cell background color and alternating table row colors plots width height position on the page and line spacing

46778784
folder	directory
alternatively for a quick test you can use the images the images right01.jpg ... right14.jpg or left01.jpg ... left14.jpg from the samples data directory inside the source folder

46778786
button	checkbox
i ve imported the necessary modules and have already created several button and checkbox

46778920
put	get
i did the if else if because i want to delete when the user want to put the imageview out of the device so i need to control when he tries to at the moment i only got it top left right not down i also get the dimensions of my device just to try if x or y is the same as height or widht just show the toast but it s not doing it correctly

46778933

i heard that nowadays dash and bash do drop privileges and that linking bin sh to bin zsh will help but this didnt help me

46778989
setinterval	settimeout
based on what you told me my interpretation is that you have a settimeout function and a setinterval function

46779021
button	checkbox
imagine a checkbox type survey with one question with a radio button

46779027
ilist	icollection
to fix this error either change the json to a json object name value or change the deserialized type to an array or a type that implements a collection interface icollection ilist like list that can be deserialized from a json array

46779055
translation	localization
this has been a problem for my localization efforts as the people doing my translation aren t able to make edits after i import their translation from the first time

46779055
translation	localization
if not how can i fix this so that my exported xliffs contain all of the translation strings that were there before i added localization

46779059
width	height
i tried minimizing the width and height of the text object to fit perfectly in the image and that made it slightly better

46779115

it is a well maintained package that we ve been able to use as we upgrade django from versioning to versioning

46779116
punctuation	words
only the stop words are removed but the lemmatizing does not work and punctuation and digits also remain

46779138
children	parent
b the pointer from parent to child the children collection inside parent then gets repopulated in a reverse way first looking for the mappedby property xxxxx inside the child class then using the property s joincolumn annotation and looking in that column in the child s database table thus getting the parent s id from it

46779138
children	parent
knowing the exact parent now the child will get added to that parent s children collection

spaces	linefeed
when i place the xslt and xml into online xslt validators i appear to get spaces and linefeed at the start 0a20 of the output i am using onlinetoolz to test but other engines give the same result why am i getting and how do i remove the characters at the start

46779524
spaces	linefeed
output below showing it with spaces at start i would expect and want no linefeed or spaces at the start

46779571
subtract	add
you can add subtract char datatype values as it is basically a 8 bit memory location and char is usually stored as an ascii

46779582
int	chars
in c chars are represented as int from the ascii table

46779883
retrofit	okhttp
manually creating objects in modules should be reserved for objects that require further setup like retrofit or okhttp with their builders

46779909
portrait	landscape
either specify different layout files for portrait landscape or use a single layout file and define different dimensions for portrait landscape

46779909
portrait	landscape
using different layout is really only necessary if you have a significantly different layout in portrait landscape

46779909
portrait	landscape
when the device is in portrait the file in layout-port is used and when in landscape the file in layout-land is used

46779910

46779915
children	parent
the example is simple for the sake of a good answer but in reality i am dealing with 5 children each of those have its specific attributes and methods except one let s call it commonpost which adds nothing to what the parent already provides that why i want to add a discriminator with an enum type as follows xpost ypost .. commonpost

quicksort	mergesort
furthermore you ll have no clue which size it is above which mergesort will perform better on quicksort s worst case arrays as this depends on implementation issues for example one compiler may compile your code in a way that the delete operation in sort4 is very costly in terms of time and so for most reasonably sized arrays sort3 might turn out to be always faster

46799445
swift	objective-c
you need to import this file on the objective-c class that you want to use a swift class and also the swift class name of your swift file

46799445
swift	objective-c
my swift class should have the prefix objective-c and inherit from nsobject

46799445
swift	objective-c
then you can call your swift variable from the objective-c file

getter	setter
in this case you can use deftype to create the bean via dynamic bytecode creation simply create methods for the getter and setter and move the data from-to the map

46799691
client-side	server-side
the way your configure server-side and client-side depends on the technologies you use which i don t know

46799728
superclass	subclassing
extending the object into a subclassing doesn t seem to work because retrieving the contained object will return an object of type superclass not subclassing

46799760
superclass	subclassing
this is a typical case of generalization with employee being the superclass and manager as a subclassing

46799810
uisplitviewcontroller	mmdrawercontroller
in this screenshot i tried to use mmdrawercontroller to see if using something other than uisplitviewcontroller would work but i have the same problem for both

46799810
uisplitviewcontroller	mmdrawercontroller
so far the only difference between the two libraries is i haven t seen uisplitviewcontroller work at all but with mmdrawercontroller if you set opendrawergesturemodemask to mmopendrawergesturemodepanningcenterview and the master view stretches a little bit then the background color renders correctly

46799839
prepare	execute
then prepare and execute

46799872
post	get
i have an api that is expecting the values of the form inputs but i cannot seem to understand how i actually get the component to post to an api endpoint specified by me

46799935

you can clearly see in the result that the left view s border width is the same as the center view s height while the right view s border width is about half the size of the others.

46799956
inherited	properties
class a will receive all of class z s properties as is the nature of inherited

46800094
post	get
the reason get doesn t work is because the function in the sample is only configured to work with post

46800107
hide	show
if i want to show the 3rd push button i want to give it the first buttons coordinates and hide the 1st button

46800191
children	parent
if it is a one-time operation then you can probably get away with doing a simple breadth first search to look for the parent then check to see if its children contain the id you are looking for

46800191
children	parent
if the arrays are sorted once you have the parent instance you can perform a binary search on the children array to further optimize it

46800195
children	parent
some objects may have the delted-property set to the value deletedgroup indicating that this group and is soft deleted and should not occur in children list of its parent group

46800195
filtering	grouping
what can i do to filtering out the grouping marked as deletedgroup

46800209
free	malloc
i was looking into some memory management pool + malloc + free implementations using linked list and i found that in most of them each node is something like this

46800242
filtering	grouping
second attempt subset to rows where we have duplicate tail_no flight_id pairs then filtering to unique arrival_airport within each grouping

46800255
int	chars
edit added some code to handle the case of a - chars and converted digit string to float instead of int to deal with decimal numbers

46800259
int	boolean
in javascript string int and boolean values are immutable but objects and arrays are mutable

46800269
punctuation	words
i created a function in python to count the length of words while ignoring punctuation symbols

46800348

46800439
innodb	myisam
the engines are innodb myisam memory aria and possibly others

46800478
put	get	post	get	post	put
in some cases the method can be subsumed by get put post or delete so you just need the resource identifier data and get put post or delete

46800478
post	put
in other cases or other designs the method is more detailed than can be expressed in just a put or post so you have a method actually in the url in which case you may not need the distinction between put and post as much

46800478
put	get	post	get	post	put
sometimes the objects lends themselves to just get put post and delete and sometimes you want more info in the url as to the specific operation to be carried out on that resource

46800491
post	get
if you want to be rest compliant you can just use post and get

46800491
post	get
this way if you split with your method you can just have a filter to logs how many post requests or get requests

46800517
post	put
what i usually do is use post for creating a new resource and use put for updating an already existing resource

46800605
hide	show

46800717
ubuntu	linux
i rely on my linux ubuntu package manager to make decisions about when to update node and npm

46800794
int	chars	int	double
thatâ s absolutely correct dealing with primitive type such as int double byte chars and so on you must compare them using must because they are not objects so they donâ t implements equals

46800796
width	height
it defines neither width or height attributes nor a viewbox attribute

46800796
width	height
no inherent width and height for the image can therefore be established

46800837
getter	setter
so my problem is i finish to create 3 instance methods and getter setter methods

post	get
also there is some useful libraries such as retrofit and volley that you can use to send get post ..

46801124
width	height
if you re trying to stretch the width to fit then you d use that component and set the aspect mode to width controls height

46801124
width	height
although you d need to work out the aspect ratio you want to preserve width height

46801159
prop	each
my question is is there a way to group these individual fields and get some type of updated prop in order to consider the step valid or can i use a different form name for each step and then merge the different steps forms when submitting the final one

you need to fix your addition code first and then you should reuse that in your multiplication code

46803349
addition	multiplication
in elementary multiplication just like addition we have three components

46803349
multiplying	addition
why would anyone do repeated addition instead of just multiplying

46803349
division	subtraction
you ll likely end up performing long division by repeated subtraction initially too before you decide that s way too slow for your liking and start experimenting with your own home-brewed fft

46803349
multiplying	addition
this is acceptable for addition though when you re multiplying you won t want to mutate either of the operands in an addition as you ll need those operands for the next addition

46803358

46806127
keras	tensorflow
and then have a function or something that will produce the tensorflow code that keras has written to do all these calculations

46806159
children	parent
on the other hand the children nodes can refer to their parent using a non-owning pointer the children don t own their parent the children nodes just observe their parent and a raw pointer works fine as non-owning observing pointer

46806159
children	parent
on the other hand the parent pointing to children via owning unique_ptr s and the children observing their parent via raw observing pointers seems a simpler design to me

46806298
clang	icc
i am trying to use the automatic differentiation library adept and i made it work with gcc 4.9.0 and icc 16.0.2 but failed with vs 2017 and clang 4.0.1

why not use setinterval settimeout

46806903
width	height
the view is showing in mainactivity width is 800dp and height is match_parent

46806928
folder	directory
if using git from vs developer command prompt it helps to change directory to the root of the git repository the folder that contains the .git folder

46806967
int	double
n.b as numberpicker always works with int i think you can modify your calculation method as it will never get double from numberpicker

46807005
terminate	timeout
gitlab terminate the runner and thereby all subprocesses after the timeout

46807065
integer	unsigned
all of the above proposals work correctly for all unsigned integer types on 2 s complement architectures

46807118
for-loop	arrays
for instance lets say you want to get a random set of integers to generate in a for-loop and pull randomly from an arrays the set of integers stay the same every time and pull the same items from the arrays in the exact same order every time you run the for-loop until you change the seed

46807130

we really can t support tablet at the moment so removing the compatible screens declaration is not an option right now we tried adding the require telephony tag but then we d still be supporting 500 tablet

46807231
sorting	filtering
i now wanted to use filtering and maybe sorting and i followed the instructions in the documentation

46807253
google-chrome	firefox
i can confirm your observation looks like ie and firefox are doing some optimized rendering but google-chrome isn t presumably by using the hardware acceleration

46807270
min	max
min or max does not mean min-length or max-length .

google-chrome	firefox
it works properly in firefox and newer versions of google-chrome 61 but unfortunately throws the following exception if i use google-chrome 60 or 59 not tested for any other versions yet

46807606
for-loop	loops
if you are modifying loops counter inside the body i would recommend not using a for-loop because it is more likely to cause reader s confusion than the while loops

46807635
recvfrom	datagram
the recvfrom function receives a datagram and stores the source address

46807635
recvfrom	datagram
if the datagram or message is larger than the buffer specified the buffer is filled with the first part of the datagram and recvfrom generates the error wsaemsgsize

46807798
pyenv	virtualenv
g. it should not be installed into usr local lib python3 site-packages if i use virtualenv pipenv or pyenv

46807851
hide	show
by using .serviceparent .parentofparent you re selecting all of the .parentofparent items and the show hide acts on all of them so the final one show will be the last one it s only skipping 1 because there s only 3 - if there were 4 it would skip 2...

46807851
next	except
without changing too much of the code you can change the selectors to except the first which hides the others to indicate that you want the next one after the current one that s visible

46807851

46808144
bower	npm
github objectivehtml flipclock available via npm and bower not maintained

46808149
backslash	double-quotes
when you encapsulate it in double-quotes it s honoring your backslash and ignoring the following character but since you re wrapping the whole thing in quotes it s making it think that the entire block of text within the quotes should be treated as a single argument

46808182
prop	classname
you could use the classname prop of the grid

46808196
post	put
sorry that i cannot put more images in this post to describe my question

46808250
stopwatch	dispatchertimer
i am trying to move away from dispatchertimer to stopwatch to get a more constant speed of the game as dispatchertimer skips turns if there are too many objects in the game

46808250
stopwatch	dispatchertimer
i can write the code for updating the game correctly using a stopwatch that is my game objects speeds and positions are calculated correctly when i check for ticks or ms passed since last update but when i replace the dispatchertimer s tick events with a simple while-loop and a call to the screen-drawing method the gui will never redraw

46808267
put	get
the get and put methods only support variables with string values but there are also getobject and putobject methods which can be used for arbitrary objects

46808313
pull	push
i am using circleci for my docker builds so from there i use docker login so i can push and pull to the codefresh registry

46808325
folder	directory
so the solution would be to copy the folder into another directory for example in src server-mocks and replace all document types with global in the index.js file and configure webpack.server.config.js by adding the following code

46808373
debian	linux
i get database from server linux debian mnt var lib mysql directorybase the files frm and copy the directorybase in c wamp bin mysql mysql5.6.17 data

46808444
cells	tablecell
i m using this answer to include a toggle that switches between two css classes twotablecell and tablecell which are two different sized table headers cells which are different sizes in css

46808448
fseek	ftell
second since you re using stat to get the file s modification time there s no need to use fseek ftell to get the size of the file as there s an st_size field in struct stat that tells you the file size

46808448
fseek	ftell
third technically fseek ftell to get the size of the file is undefined behavior in c

46808471
margin	height
it seems that the browser decides that there is some content below the floating element and starts to act as if the height was determined by that content forgetting that the bottom border of the floating element is actually below the bottom content edge of the container itself which is at the bottom margin edge of the .child

46808483
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
most browsers treat javascript dates with a pattern xx xx xxxx as mm dd yyyy so 22 09 2017 is seen as either an invalid date safari firefox google-chrome or the 9th day of the 22nd month of 2017 apparently your browser

46808539

46808723
width	height
when you rotate the dataset adjacent points on the x or y-axis may become so close together that geom_raster or geom_tile geom_raster is just a special case end up creating tiles with 0 width height

46808723
width	height
for some angles of rotation geom_tile will return a blank canvas since the width height of each tile get squeezed to 0 while geom_raster will throw an error

in java 9 java.util.date and java.util.calendar are also not deprecated

46809076
xts	lubridate
hence i conclude lubridate to be more practical here also because ggplot does not understand xts objects right away

46809076
xts	lubridate
use xts align.time or lubridate floor_date to shift your times to the next previous full hour day etc

46809086

46836144
post	get
additionally for http request methods that can cause side-effects on server s data in particular for http methods other than get or for post usage with certain mime types the specification mandates that browsers preflight the request soliciting supported methods from the server with an http options request method and then upon approval from the server sending the actual request with the actual http request method

theano	tensorflow
tensorflow and theano use computational graphs to perform tensor computations

46839026
keras	tensorflow
so when you ask if there is a way to print out the equivalent version in tensorflow or produce tensorflow code what you re really asking is how do you export a tensorflow graph from a keras model

46839026
keras	tensorflow
when you are using the tensorflow backend your keras code is actually building a tf graph

46839026
keras	tensorflow
the keras_to_tensorflow repository contains a short example of how to export a model from keras for use in tensorflow in an ipython notebook

46839026
keras	tensorflow
it turns out we can actually get the tensorflow session that keras is using from tensorflow itself using the tf.contrib.keras.backend.get_session function

46839026

hide	show
here is the solution our developer presented by using css to hide and show the button binding to the fileuploaddone event

46839612
primes	modulus
but i think for it to work well the modulus values would have to be product of primes greater than 10 and relatively primes to each other

46839612
range	minimum
and the range from the minimum to the maximum modulus value would have to be as small as possible

46839630
int	chars
can anyone see and explain how i can take in 10 strings with values of 25 chars in each element and take in 10 int in the other 3 arrays with elements of 10

46839642
getter	setter
this way makes more sense than using a getter get_x and a setter set_x value and is more python ic

46839642
getter	setter
if however the getter setter way is preferred key_getx key_setx signatures should be slightly modified i think removing the last argument would do and they should be referenceded in key_methods - that should be specified to keytype as tp_methods also described in the above web page

46839642
dlsym	dlopen
now the module depends is linked to on the external lib not sure how things actually are but that can be changed to dynamic so dll loading via man dlopen 3 man dlsym 3 or msdn loadlibrary function msdn getprocaddress function

46839673
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have an old obj-c project that has a uitabbarcontroller with several uinavigationcontroller as the tabs

46839687
for-loop	arrays
if you are iterating an arrays and making async calls there are some safety things you need to do because the arrays could change while waiting for an async response but it can t change while your synchronous for-loop is running for example

46839701
retrofit	okhttp
for example internally retrofit imports okhttp not logging-interceptor as well

46839792

does the relationship always return the entire user object when i get the post object or does it lazily get the user data

46839863
integer	fractions
that comment pointed me to mixed integer linear fractions programming milfp and on wikipedia

46839879
hash	md5
the get string refers to either an md5 or sha1 hash of the filesize of the resource

46839930
filtering	grouping
you have to grouping by id_product field filtering single results with id_param values and then order by the id_param count

46839998
for-loop	loops
i would say if you don t want to use for-loop then i would go with david but i don t see any problem in using for-loop and you can extract a single date by using the index in loops as follows

46840032
sqoop	hadoop
so when trying to export the files from hadoop using sqoop export i think the imbalance is causing the export to go very slowly for some of the job mappers when checking the hadoop applications web interface

46840051
maven	pom.xml
solution right click on pom.xml of your project and select the option add as maven project

46840109
build.gradle	gradlew
thankfully mikebonnell pointed me to the fabric android crashlytics integration docs which tells you how to exclude crashlytics from minification in your proguard file and that you must have minifyenabled true in your build.gradle file if you re using gradlew

46840112
range	minimum
the difference is that you need to keep track of the start index of the range whose values fall within k but also of the minimum and maximum value within this range so that we know when the current value goes out of range the value at the start index isn t necessarily the minimum or maximum

46840112
range	minimum
another thing to note is that when the current value goes out of range the new start index isn t necessarily indicated by the minimum or maximum value but has to be searched by iterating backwards starting from the current index

46840112
min	max
set the start index to 0 and min and max to s 0

46840112
min	max
then iterate over the input and for each value s i adjust min or max to s i if necessary

46840112
min	max
when you come to a value s i that is greater than or equal to min+k set min and max to s i and then iterate backwards from i while adjusting min until you find a value s j that is less than or equal to max-k

46840112
min	max
so we set the current value s i as the new min and max and iterate backwards while updating min until we find the first value that is less than or equal to max-k which is s 2 -1

46840112
min	max
so we set min and max to 0 and iterate backwards while updating max until we reach s 6 which is greater than or equal to min+k so 7 becomes the new start index

46840121
mouse	keyboard
this just reacts to mouse events so perhaps not ideal if you want to account for keyboard events or changing toggles in code

46840141
min	max
starting with i j 0 we could iterate j keeping track of min and max

46840141
range	min	range	max	min	max
when the range becomes k via raising max we need to find a new i where min s i..j max - k analog for the other case

46840141
min	max
while searching a new i with a value that is sufficiently close to the new min max in the inner loop we remove the visited elements from the front of the lists

46840176
resque	eventmachine
there are other ways to manage cpu consumption of background processes other than putting arbitrary sleep numbers in there for example eventmachine resque or sidekiq

46843321
getter	setter
it may not pick that getter setter were generated

46843348

setinterval	settimeout
remember this is setinterval not settimeout so the timer doesn t stop after it has fired the first time

46843700

width	height
if width is greater then height then it is landscape orientation and it converts all the values under landscape column into json

46844649
portrait	landscape
when the orientation is changed to portrait the ajax works and fetches the portrait images example 5 images and adds to the existing landscape images resulting in 10 images

46844649
portrait	landscape
how to get this without refreshing the page when the orientation is changed from landscape to portrait all landscape images should be removed and portrait images should be added without refreshing the page

46844660
serializable	deserialization
why always data needs to be converted into bytes for serializable deserialization

at a high-level you can think of a hadoop namenode as a tracker for where blocks composing files stored in hdfs are located

46861365
namenode	hdfs
when you have lots of small files stored in hdfs there are also lots of blocks and the namenode must keep track of all of those files and blocks in memory

46861365
namenode	hdfs
first let s discuss how file size hdfs blocks and namenode memory relate

46861365
namenode	hdfs
our hdfs namenode s block size for this example is 100 mb

46861365
namenode	hdfs
each block stored in hdfs requires about 150 bytes of namenode memory which is about 150 kb of memory for those 1 000 blocks representing 1 000 1 mb files

46861365
namenode	hdfs
each block stored in hdfs requires about 150 bytes of namenode memory which is about 1.5 kb of memory for those 10 blocks representing the 1 1 000 mb file

with the larger file we have the same data stored in the hdfs cluster but use 1 of the namenode memory compared to the situation with many small files

i have seen that packer has build capabilities but even some type of deploy ones and i don t understand if these overlaps terraform

for-loop	loops
your loops is actually equivalent to the following for-loop

46868099

furthermore if the name of the student is private or protected and there is no way to access it from public context then you also have to add a friend declaration to your student definition

46868214
jasmine	mocha
my guess is that the karma test runner does not hook in mocha and jasmine rather the reverse

46868214
jasmine	mocha
so i assume mocha and jasmine call something like this

46868214
jasmine	mocha
when i look through the mocha and jasmine codebase however i am not seeing the evidence i am looking for

46868222
ord	chr
ord function converts the character to its unicode code point and chr function does the opposite

46868273
accessor	properties
series has an accessor to succinctly return datetime like properties for the values of the series if it is a datetime period like series

46868273
accessor	properties
the .dt accessor is defined as an accessorproperty object which calls maybe_to_datetimelike to return one of a number of properties objects datetimeproperties timedeltaproperties etc.

46868273
inherited	properties
properties objects inherited from the pandasdelegate abstract class

46868273
accessor	properties
but the key class method for our purposes seems to be _add_delegate_accessors which allows the properties class variants to attach the correct properties to the .dt accessor

getter	setter
a isolating it from other class by making it private and giving the functionality in the getter and setter method

put	get
if it is a stream it has to contain where that particular piece of data is located in the stream and when your application receives it it will know if the given piece of data can be handled it is obsolete arrived too late or arrived already it should be put aside and hope that some preceding parts would arrive perhaps so unusable in itself that the application should send a direct request to the sender in order to get things synchonized again

if you are having problems with cron jobs not working check out this troubleshooting guide

46868659
min	max
the max value of the dataset would take on a value of 1 and the min value would take on a value of 0

46868660
folder	directory
however if you need to import them into all projects say you got a few .dll files from a 3rd party you can create a directory.build.targets in the solution folder to add them to all projects in your solution technically this file is automatically imported into all projects in the directory hierarchy

46868684
min	max
define a max and an optional min value for each enum you have

46868684
min	max
the use of enumtype min and enumtype max as default values will protect from invocations of this method for enum types that are not defined properly

46868691
explode	implode
for the position the assumption is that the sentence has only single spaces because spaces are used in the explode and implode functions

46868691
explode	implode
otherwise a case of double or larger spaces would require modifications possibly by replacing spaces with a unique character or set of characters such as which would be used as the first argument of the explode and implode functions

46868695
jasmine	mocha
you won t find anything in the code of mocha or jasmine themselves as they don t know anything about karma

46868695
karma-mocha	karma-jasmine	jasmine	mocha
when you use mocha and jasmine in karma you have to use karma-mocha and karma-jasmine

46868695
jasmine	mocha
these are the packages that bridge mocha and jasmine on the one hand and karma on the other

46868695
karma-mocha	karma-jasmine
if it were me i d look at the code of karma-mocha and karma-jasmine to have a better idea of how to use it

i am trying to plot a heatmap in julia using gr and i get the following error message

46868797
plot	heatmap
i tried plotting just a heatmap using rand using this example from the plot documentation

46868803
width	height
my constraints are montage is built up from picture rows every row in the montage should have nearly equal height and the whole montage should be taller than wide - the width height aspect ratio of the montage should be in an interval of 0.8-1.0 1.0 width height 0.8

46868803

one more complication in my real life situation the graph was visual tree of wpf windows where children are not directly accessible as properties of the parent

46868855
dictionary	map
if the map didn t contain negative values -1 like in the example i would just create a list or an array from the dictionary once where the keys are the array indices and then use that for an efficient numpy fancy indexing routine

46868873
squash	merge	squash	branch
let s say i have development branch and fixbullshit branch and i have 5 commits in fixbullshit i do a pull request but merge development with fixbullshit with merge + squash to keep it in development as 1 commit to keep it clearer is it the best option by the way

46868902
range	minimum
i am asked to write a new mapreduce program that for each company provides the range of years it has been present in the stock market and the maximum and minimum closing value obtained by the stock

46868996
min	max
here s one way provided you have a small dictionary min and max values this may be more efficient you work around the negative index by adding the array min

46868996
for-loop	arrays
note this moves the for-loop to the lookup table but if this is significantly smaller than the actual arrays this could be a lot faster

46869005
int	double
tinyint smallint int bigint float double and decimal

46869019
pull	push
pull requests are more complicated because in order to make a pull request you must either open your repository to someone else who can run git pull 2 â this is where the term comes from and is the original meaning of pull request â or else find or create a shared repository push some of your commits to this shared location and then ask the other person to obtain your commits from the shared location

46869019
pull	push
nonetheless this slight historical error is fully baked into git today not only in terms of git pull being the obvious but incorrect opposite of git push but also in the very name pull request

46869019
pull	push
a provider pull request starts with git push

46869019
pull	push
we want to compare their branch tip commit from on the branch name you picked out when you made the pull request to the tip commit in your upstream branch that you set when you ran git push

46869048
width	height
only the button doesn t have trailing constraint instead it has height and width

46869071
box-sizing	border-box
you can apply box-sizing border-box

46869093
width	height
it doesn t seem to work with just flex 1 so i am trying to explicitly declare the height and width of the scrollview but that is also yielding unpredictable results

46869112
min	max
i want to sum each value leading up to max and each value leading up to min and append these results to two separate lists

46869112
min	max
i am only trying to add the first item in each tuple based on min and max as indicated in the output above

46869136
width	height
if the button has height width top bottom and leading constraints then the height and top + bottom constraints are redundant

46869141
folder	dir
those services are either hashed in my usr bin dir or have a folder within usr bin

46869171
squash	merge
this is probably why github squash merge as described above instead of like this

box-sizing	border-box
consider removing padding or use box-sizing border-box

46869216
cout	cin
so flush -ing your cin cout before dup -ing them should be enough since they should be in a consistent state

46869216
cout	cin
option 2 set cin s cout s rdbuf

46869216
cout	cin
the other way around just like some comments proposed is replacing cin s and cout s underlying buffer using rdbuf

46869231
folder	directory
we were given a verilog folder with 250+ .v files and taught to look at the synthesized design and copy all needed verilog files into our modelsim project directory

46869259
min	max
it does a bit more validation and you could pretty easily add other kinds besides min and max

46869313
rbac	acl
it will use some kind of acl which i want to be interchangeable rbac for example and finally it will have an interface

viewdidload	viewwillappear
it is fair to say viewwillappear and viewdidlayoutsubviews and viewdidload are only for professional use

46869398
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i d almost say apple shouldn t have exposed so prominently viewdidlayoutsubviews and viewwillappear and viewdidload to the general public

46869398
viewdidload	viewwillappear
similarly there is really just zero need to ever use viewdidlayoutsubviews or viewwillappear or viewdidload

46869400
erlang	scheme
garbage collection occurs per process which is why erlang appears to have a magically advanced incremental gc scheme but actually has quite boring generational heap collection underneath in the general case that is

46869400
erlang	elixir
with this in mind erlang runtime core compiler lfe project elixir project etc

46869400
erlang	elixir
that is dramatically more efficient than having an erlang or lfe or elixir dev team flip between writing some erlang then some langx then some erlang again context switching as a matter of course or worse context switching between one language in which they are expert and one in which they are inexperienced and naive

46869410

children	parent
assuming you want to copy cli-tmp parent children grandchildren to cli-tmp parent children nephews and they both exist then you can just cp using the full path or

46874184

alexa	amazon
i m building an amazon alexa skill and it s all working out quite well so far

46874309
int	chars
any ideas on a work around all i can see is that because the q or q is a chars the int vector is taking this as an input when the while loop runs at which point it endless loops

46874314
post	get
from an analysis of the post request you notice that by sending the first cookie obtained from the website asp.net_sessionid you immediately get an additional authentication cookie ssoauth

46874332
ienumerable	ienumerator
is it possible to visualize the helper class in which the ienumerator interface is implemented so that the getenumerator from ienumerable interface is able to return an instance of this class and the foreach functionality becomes available

46874414
for-loop	loops
additionally there are multiple pages in successive order that i want to scrape similar content so i have built a for-loop to loops through the pages

46874471

my idea consists of having a window which has a set height and width as any other window does at the beginning however the user might find it necessary to resize this window for his or her comfort

46874500
width	height
i have div with absolute width 500px and auto height

46874515

just define the message and then in a loop get a single character from it and put it on the screen

46874859
fileoutputstream	filewriter	fileinputstream	fileoutputstream	fileinputstream	filewriter
one of main differences between fileinputstream fileoutputstream and filereader filewriter is that the first provides methods to manipulate bytes while the latter provides methods to manipulate characters

46874859
bufferedreader	filewriter	bufferedreader	bufferedwriter	filewriter	bufferedwriter
besides you could also wrap filereader filewriter into a bufferedreader bufferedwriter and benefit from efficient reading writting of characters arrays and lines

46874872
children	parent
to do so i must explain a bit deeper the structure of my project it s a parent project mavenized like all projects inside it which contains a pom.xml and folders for its children

46875057
stdout	fflush
you also have to do a fflush stdout

46875062
int	chars
since scanf return value is the number of items written in your case 1 since only 1 int was scanned not the int value of the scanned chars

46875098
folder	directory
that way at build the folder containing my images and my images are copied to the build directory

46875155
for-loop	loops
so far i have a for-loop that loops through all the fields and checks if they are empty

46875220
children	parent	superclass	subclassing
in your case a forms the parent superclass while b c form the children subclassing

46875220
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
the syntax class x y specifies x to be a subclassing of y and automatically inherited its attributes and methods allowing you to call superclass methods through subclassing objects

46875267
post	get
i have a function to get the time depending on the time in the database for the post and the current time

how can i initialize a variable in a generic function with the min max possible value of underlying generic type

46875489
min	max
the general pattern is to use low t or high t to get the min max possible value of type t

46875492
for-loop	loops
basically my idea here is that i set a for-loop for the parent process to produce 7 child processes with fork and set them into a while loops that force them to compete for the usage of cpu within a time period

46875492
for-loop	loops
then after all the 7 processes break the while loops i set another for-loop for each child processes to print out their logged result

46875492
for-loop	loops
firstly i set loops for printing outside the major for-loop as you can see in my code and i run . task05_3 directly in the bash and here is the result

46875542
width	height
well you can check for the width and height of the image

46875543
versioning	upgrade
also it may be good idea to remind customer that php 5.3 is not supported anymore so it may be good idea to upgrade php versioning instead of downgrading site

46875545
free	malloc
i ve indeed made some researchs before asking on the forum but i never got a good solution mostly because of the conditions i have i can only use write and not printf i code in c pretty logical i guess and i cannot use any command except for malloc free or sizeof i need an hand-made function

46875881
getter	setter
in general i prefer to access an instance variable directly if iâ m in that instance variableâ s setter getter to avoid confusion and possible infinite recursion but your code as written is okay

46875885
width	text-align
so text-align is not working bacause it s not taking full width of container

46875938
width	height
cv size takes int width int height as parameters

46875938

by the way is a security rick execute a query directly from a variable php provides prepare statements for sanitize all data you pass to query

46876383
min	max
for the example 51 and 197 are just the min max values found in the png file

46876388
put	get
my strategy is that i get the surf features of the database of images and then i put it into the k-nn model so that whenever i query an image by using the surf features and look for the similar set of items i can just use k-nn to get the nearest neighbors

geocoding	geocode
i have 100 000+ addresses that need to be geocode but most geocoding services seem to cost money after the first couple thousand entries

46876481
yacc	bison
since bison yacc parsers always resolve shift reduce conflicts by shifting the reduction will never happen

46876481
yacc	bison
even though the mras are identical bison yacc inserts a different marker for the two rules which would create a reduce reduce conflict

the expected result would be that my stack contains add add subtract 3 but instead it contains add subtract 3

46876937
versioning	upgrade
i cant upgrade my php versioning because my application does not support higher versioning of php

46876996
width	height
the main difference with what you re doing now is that when you find the top corner of a rectangle you shouldn t immediately find the width and height and store the rectangle but instead keep it in a list of unfinished rectangles temporarily until you come across its bottom corner

46877014
folder	directory
open src main res directory of your project in the explorer finder you will see the folder value-zh if you added chinese in android studio

46877051
children	parent
given a parent component with many children components i m trying to inject the services that retrieve data from the api only to the parent component

46877051
children	parent
instead i let the parent component query the data and send it to the children components as input parameters

46877051
children	parent
when the children components need to modify the data i will bubble up events output parameters to the parent component and i will let it use the injected service to modify the data

getter	setter
you could use jvmfield for instructs the compiler not generate getter setter and you can implement your setter and getter

46877262
getter	setter
with this your code work well in java as attribute getter setter and kotlin as property

46877299
identifier	ambiguous
just name them id - which the the rails convention - and i would say that in general prefixing is a superflous and a solution to the non-problem of writing crappy sql with ambiguous identifier

46877311
postgresql	mysql
in world nosql mongo world perhaps the schema is a little more flexible than mysql postgresql and thus changing the schema is more common practice

loss of precision during base conversion here is not a problem because conversion of int to floats c double in this range is exact and the quotients are exactly representable in binary floating point

46877547
arc4random	srand
there is no analogue to srand with the arc4random family of functions

46877604
children	parent
i suppose that once we start adding elements from h2 as children to elements of h2 then we will have to start checking whether that child is less than the parent and if not we swap them

46877705
post	get
so far it looks like i m mistaken on the javascript side as for chrome developer tools console i get post 500 internal server error

interpolation	splines
now the interpolation function will return a list of all the splines which is what i suspect is your intent with your example code

46878285
width	height
i am not sure how your auto layout is controlling your labels height but perhaps you can rely on determining the height of the label based on the text it will display and known constraints you have already been using such as the 373 width

46878306
width	height
you must define the dimensions of the dragged element beforehand and then limit the the x and y based on the window s width height

46878313
move	drag
for example here is one javascript use drag to move element

cassini	iis
so to develop a web app you use cassini and to deploy you use iis

46878663

46884883
16-bit	64bit
basically it s trying to do all the reads of offset up front and just runs out of registers so it starts spilling a few and then goes on an orgy of spilling where it s just reading most of the 16-bit elements of offset and then immediately storing them as 64bit zero-extended values immediately on to the stack

46884883
clang	icc
neither icc nor clang have any such issues - they both generate almost identical quite reasonable code that just reads once from every offset position using movzx and then inserts the byte using vpinsrb with a memory source operand based on the offset just read

46884883
clang	icc
for example you could just write out long hand in intrinsics the vpinsrb approach that clang and icc use

46884883
sse	avx
1 this is one of a handful of sse avx instructions where the memory source form of the instruction is quite a bit more efficient than the reg-reg form the reg-reg form needs 2 uops on port 5 which limits it to a throughput of 0.5 per cycle and gives it a latency of 2
