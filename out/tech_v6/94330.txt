rss	feed
i ve been playing with rss feed this week and for my next trick i want to build one for our internal application log

60009
rss	feed
i want to create an rss feed off of this table but i m not sure how to handle the volume- there could be hundreds of entries per day even on a normal day

60061
rss	feed
you can then have multiple rss feed for the various categories and severities

60137
ubuntu	debian
i haven t decided which one yet but my understanding is that they ll give me a base os install i d prefer debian or ubuntu an ip address a root account ssh and that s about it

60154
disk	ram
first you measure the number of visitors the site currently receives and how much demand each user places on the server and then you calculate the computing resources cpu ram disk space and network bandwidth that are necessary to support current and future usage levels

60155
ubuntu	debian
slicehost referral link if you so choose offers reverse dns multiple ips 2 month ip ubuntu debian along with others

60203
memcached	apc
i also use apc and memcached for different things but the other answers i ve seen so far are more for more complete and complex systems

60227
fflush	gets
also the fflush is necessary because by default sys.stdout only fflush its output after a newline or after its buffer gets full

60271
firefox	safari
i ve written a couple xul extensions for firefox and now i d like to write versions of them for safari

60302
outputstream	inputstream
if i start a process via java s processbuilder class i have full access to that process s standard in standard out and standard error streams as java inputstream and outputstream

60302
system.in	system.out
however i can t find a way to seamlessly connect those streams to system.in system.out and system.err

60316
background-image	background-position
you don t use an img tag but an element with a background-image css attribute and set the background-position on hover

60338
post	get
by selecting questions that are tagged with stackoverflow you get only those post that people have explicitly identified as being about stackoverflow

60382
globalization	localization
globalization and localization demystified in asp.net 2.0

60443
consistency	acid
use the properties defined by acid atomicity consistency isolation and durability to help decide when this might be the case

60482
folder	directory
when you start emacs using an ms windows shortcut the default-directory is initially the folder directory specified in the start in field of the shortcut properties

60485
post	put
design the representations s accepted from the client the xml format you can put or post

60490
textarea	pre
try to add the following style on textarea style white-space pre

60496
postgresql	mysql
if you re connecting to a database other than mysql there is a driver-specific second option that you can refer to pg_prepare and pg_execute for postgresql

60496
prepare	execute
then when you call execute the prepare statement is combined with the parameter values you specify

60496
prepare	execute
another benefit with using prepare statements is that if you execute the same statement many times in the same session it will only be parsed and compiled once giving you some speed gains

60504
super	implements
it seems like most of your objectives would be meet by some sort of super source control system which could be implements with cruisecontrol

60564
width	height
the font is fixed width and height so making a background bitmap dynamically isn t difficult and is probably the quickest and easiest solution

60609
google-chrome	safari
whilst i ve not yet found a way to automate safari i have found a way to automate webkit inside of google-chrome

60628
expression-blend	silverlight
this is a preview version of expression-blend for designing silverlight 2 experiences

60662
haskell	ocaml	erlang	ocaml
it combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between c++ java python php ruby erlang perl haskell c# cocoa smalltalk and ocaml

60672
isapi	httpmodule
i want to implement an isapi filter like feature using httpmodule in iis7 running under iis integrated request processing pipeline mode

60728
httpcontext	httpmodule
i would suggest storing your custom data in httpcontext or global application object or your database from your httpmodule and then reading that shared value in the aspx page

60758
hash	salt
you could store the salt for the hash password in another table of course each user would have their own salt

60815
postgresql	mysql
i know that postgresql and mysql have the ability to order by a random function so you can use this in sqlalchemy

60836
inline	inlining
excessive inlining of functions can increase size of compiled executable which can have negative impact on cache performance but nowadays compiler decide about function inlining on their own depending on many criterias and ignore inline keyword

60864
hash	md5
it is important to use a well known hash function such as md5 or sha-1 implemented in a library

60864
hash	salt
bondy the reason you use salt is to make dictionary attaks harder the attacker can t hash a dictionary and try against all the passwords instead she have to take the salt + the dictionary and hash it which makes the storage requierments expode

60893
formview	linqdatasource
in my application i have textbox in a formview bound to a linqdatasource like so

60910
emacs	aquamacs
however i m not really much of an emacs user and the preferences menu in aquamacs is less than clear on where and how one might make such a change

60940
hide	show
show hide Ã¢ font panel

60955
bash	zsh
- is a process substitution that is a nonstandard shell feature of some posix-compatible shells bash ksh zsh

60958
bazaar	git
git mercurial of bazaar are examples of source code control tools that are not intrusive because you do not need to set up a master server

60983
listview	gridview	gridview	detailsview	gridview	formview	formview	detailsview
it also adds great flexibility and functionality to the detailsview formview gridview and listview controls in the form of smart validation and the ability to easily change the display of these controls using templates

61029
hide	show
as select elements are displayed inline by default an alternative to the last step is to remove the #make and #model divs and and apply the show and hide classes to the model select element directly

61061
persistent	transient
in effect you want a transient heap and a persistent heap or heaps that group things of similar lifetimes

61104
width	height
while you can use the height and width attributes in the img tag this does not change the size of the images that is downloaded to the browser

61196
inherited	properties
you can also extend inherited classes and override properties methods using the prototype chain spoon16 alluded to

61218
bazaar	git
if you want to be super-modern consider a distributed versioning system such as git bazaar or mercurial

61218
trac	bugzilla	trac	mantis	mantis	bugzilla
trac mantis and bugzilla are widespread open-source choices

61229
int	chars
the key point here is that the comparison is done with int types instead of signed chars types

61230
int	chars
it casts to an int for the first comparison since 0xff is still considered an int meaning your chars is -128 to 127 but the 0xff is still 255

61230
int	chars
in the second case your telling it that 0xff is really an signed chars not an int

61232
int	chars
when p is -1 which is then converted from a signed chars to a signed int it is still -1 which has a representation of 0xffffffff which is not equal to 0xff

61237
public	protected
i use explicit checks that throw exceptions on public and protected methods and assertions on private methods

61258
irix	linux
the closest to cross-platform i ve seen is fam which seems to work for linux bsd and irix but i m not how easy it would be to port it to windows and macos

61277
windbg	mdbg
like mdbg or even windbg

61303
profiling	debugging
don t forget to add a check to skip profiling if you are in debugging mode

61372
submit	submission
i want to write an onclick event which submit a form several times iterating through selected items in a multi-select field submission once for each

61438
children	parent
normal flow is how elements and their children will layout top to bottom for block elements and left to right for inline elements inside their containing block usually the parent

61438
width	margin
you will tend to rely on width margin and padding to define the spacing and layout of the elements to the other elements around it be they or otherwise html is mostly semantic at this point

61447
emacs	textmate
textmate s snippets are the most closest match but it is not a cross-platform solution and not for emacs

61494
getter	setter
just go private int _age and normal getter setter as you normally would

61535
rss	feed
a is the url a valid rss feed

61535
rss	feed
fails a but b would return their rss feed

61537
rss	feed
if so run it through an html parser and look for elements with rss feed relations

61538
rss	feed
this type of link is the one used by most browsers to auto-discover feed causing the rss icon to appear in your address bar

61546
rss	feed
b lookup feed provides the rss feed for a given url

61546
rss	feed
theres also a find feed function that searches for rss feed based on a keyword

61706
rss	feed
the .net framework 3.5 has added a syndicationfeed class which allows you to create and or consume feed in atom 1.0 and rss 2.0 formats

61775
macbook	bootcamp
i currently run bootcamp on a macbook pro and do all my development on a series of virtual pc vms for many different environments

61795
websphere	ibm
i m looking for a java profiler that works well with the jvm coming with websphere 6.0.2 ibm jvm 1.4.2

61804
postgresql	mysql
i haven t tried it myself but i ve been interested in playing with postgresql as an alternative to mysql

61868
getter	setter
don t go about testing getter and setter

61873
stdout	stderr
here the redirection 2 1 which sets file descriptor 2 stderr to point to the same stream as file descriptor 1 stdout gets evaluated before the redirection dev null which sets file descriptor 1 to point to dev null

61873
stdout	stderr
the effect is that what you write to stderr gets sent to stdout and what you write to stdout gets thrown away

61881
jquery	scriptaculous
all of this means that you could use yui jquery prototype scriptaculous in your application but you may find that using a single library makes it a lot easier to maintain things

61891
put	get
the thing that would put me off that idea is that for general use any binary data would get copied over anytime it changed whereas the text content scm systems are based around can easily be updated in the form of diffs

61906
javassist	cglib
the bar member of foo is a proxy object in our case javassist proxy but it can be cglib one depending on the bytecode provider you use that is not initialized

61971
switching	screens
for example only switching bluetooth on when you need it similarly the phone capabilities turn the screens brightness down when it isn t needed turn the volume down etc

61974
nant	cruisecontrol
our company uses the cruisecontrol svn nant jira combination with great success

62017
asterisk	pbx
i m interested in learning more about asterisk open source pbx so i thought i would try building a hobby system for my home

62045
getter	setter
use getter setter all the time if you started using them from the getgo and or are used to working with them

62045
getter	setter
as an aside i personally find that using getter setter makes the code easier to read and to debug later on

62102
getter	setter
i want to know what exactly is the sequence of calls that occurs when a getter setter created through class methodmaker is called

62102
getter	setter
how much costlier are getter setter defined by methodmaker than the native ones overwritten in the module

62207
testdriven.net	ndepend
i m always amazed that more people don t know about use ndepend - it shows all dependencies at every level of your code and will even draw pretty box and arrow pictures showing how confused your architecture really is together with testdriven.net i can t imagine working without it any more

62220
postgresql	mysql
however the observation of database-locking stands - if you have particularly onerous updates sqlite performance won t match mysql or postgresql

62336
vbscript	jscript
the short version is to place a vbscript stop statement or jscript debugger at the beginning of the procedure before any statements that you will want to step through

62362
width	height
it means a layout which adjusts dynamically to the browser or whatever client width and height to make efficient use of all available screen space as opposed to mostly fixed width layouts which are made to fit a common denominator resolution at that particular time 800x600 used to be the norm for websites for many years

62381
post	get
the most obvious way to me would be to make an http request and call the webservice using an actual http get or post

62410
int	boolean
so you could have name string age int active boolean etc

62512
allocator	stl
i would like to find out safe ways of implementing three dimensional arrays of integers in c++ using pointer arithmetic dynamic memory allocator or alternatively using stl techniques such as vectors

62513
post	get	post	put	put	get
having created a typical api using specific calls for specific functions i am considering simplifying the api by using a rest type api get put post delete or crud type create read update delete interface

62625
getter	setter
and do i even need to worry about testing the properties since they are .net s getter and setter

62649
16-bit	64bit
however we thankfully don t see much 16-bit any more and when 64bit started to get popular people were more concerned with making it compatible with older software and 32-bit had been around so long that for most compilers an int is just assumed to be 32 bits

62659
boost	stl	boost	allocator	allocator	stl
using the stl or boost are quite good approaches if you don t know beforehand how many entries you will have in each dimension of the array because they will give you dynamic memory allocator and i recommend either of these approaches if your data set is to remain largely static or if it to mostly only receive new entries and not many deletions

62669
getter	setter
if you implemented some specific functionality in the getter and setter i think they are worth testing

62671
getter	setter
as i understand unit tests in the context of agile development mike yes you need to test the getter and setter assuming they re publicly visible

62671
getter	setter
since the getter and setter are externally visible you need to test them along with authenticate and save

62672
getter	setter
it doesn t hurt to write unit tests for your getter and setter

62680
getattr	setattr
then your class is already a dictionary and if you want you can override getattr and or setattr to call through and set the dict

62684
getter	setter
i would test your getter and setter

62684
getter	setter
depending on who s writing the code some people change the meaning of the getter setter methods

62689
int	chars
looking through the o reilly cow books on c i realize that i can t simply index the bits of a simple chars or int type variable as i d like to to do bitwise comparisons and operators

62696
getter	setter
this includes getter and setter especially in case the members properties are complex classes which requires large memory allocation during their initialization

62698
getter	setter
if on the other hand you are doing something clever like encrypting and decrypting the password in the getter setter then give it a test

62700
getter	setter
of course if the getter and setter have no special logic then the tests of the authenticate andsave methods should cover them but otherwise an explict test should be written

62715
getter	setter
testing boilerplate code is a waste of time but as slavo says if you add a side effect to your getter setter then you should write a test to accompany that functionality

62727
getter	setter
so if your setter and getter are just propertyvalue value and return propertyvalue it makes no sense to test it

62737
activemq	rabbitmq
beside activemq which should work for your demands you could also take a look at rabbitmq or openamq

62749
getter	setter
really trivial code like getter and setter that have no extra behaviour than setting a private field are overkill to test

62750
getter	setter
testing default getter and setter doesn t seem very useful to me unless you re planning to do some validation later on

62760
getter	setter
i believe it s silly to test getter setter when they only make a simple operation

62770
jquery	scriptaculous
so far i see a very large difference the approach using something like ext and others like jquery ui scriptaculous mochikit etc

62779
getter	setter
i hope this means we can move on from getter and setter

62797
int	chars
chars whose int representations are in the range from zero through 31 are not allowed

62837
post	get
the httpconnection class and the get and post methods are always supported

62884
g++	gcc
ubuntu includes a package called build-essential which installs gcc g++ make etc

62888
int	chars
chars whose int representations are 0-31 less than ascii space

62951
versioning	upgrade
some of our developers have already upgrade to versioning 2.4.7 though and they get project creation errors when compiling

62972
daemons	systemd
systemd administration commands and daemons

63039
setinterval	settimeout
try setinterval or settimeout

63044
getter	setter
i usually don t test setter getter but lets says you make one for user.name which concatenate first and last name i would write a test so if someone change the order for last and first name at least he would know he changed something that was tested

63084
puts	gets
the multiple gets must be replaced by an equal number of puts before another thread will be allowed to get the mutex

63084
puts	gets
even if the thread gets the mutex and then calls a function that further modifies the object and gets puts the protector mutex around its own operations the operations should still be safe because they re all happening under a single thread

63084
rtos	threadx
for an example of this kind of mutex see the threadx rtos

63126
firefox	safari
firefox would work but i don t think i can uninstall safari from a mac

63128
16-bit	64bit
long as you probably know in c# is 64bit but in native c++ it ends up as 32-bits or char is unicode 16-bit while in c++ it is 8-bits

63131
getter	setter
right now you have getter and setter but one day you might change them somewhat maybe to do validation or something else

63213
getter	setter
as others have stated unit tests for getter and setter are overkill unless there s conditional logic in your getter and setter

63222
getter	setter
for simple modules that may end up in a toolkit or in an open source type of project you should test as much as possible including the trivial getter and setter

63222
getter	setter
adding getter and setter is minimal code and can be handled without much thought

63224
lisp	scheme
then find an interpreter in plain c for the iphone and one in java for android. scheme lisp and javascript could fit the bill

63248
svg	vml
raphael is a javascript framework for manipulating vector graphics either with svg or vml depending on what the browser supports

63387
dictionary	map
you could create a dictionary to map from textinput - node or you could stash the node in the textinput s data property

63469
range	min	range	max	min	max
if you need to store an integer in memory in your application and you are concerned about the amount of memory used then you could go with int16 since it uses less memeory and has a smaller min max range than int32 which is what int is.

63480
int	boolean
you only need to do the cast if you want the result as a boolean value if you are happy with an int this works

63511
cvs	rcs	cvs	svn
version control - there are lots of emacs bindings for various vcs backends cvs sccs rcs svn git all come to mind

63560
vb6	vba
the c# way gives you the right information but the vb way is what users of vba or vb6 will expect

63599
apache	lighttpd
we support apache microsoft iis lighttpd and zeus using php 4.3 or later including php5

63606
rss	feed
you can set up rss feed and see all the revisions et cetera

63679
websphere	ibm
there are 2 jvms for winmo mysaifu for j2se and ibm websphere everyplace micro environment for j2me

63682
folder	directory
but subversion s multitude of .svn directory can get in the way for that not just when searching but in some cases like .d folder poorly designed systems might interpret the .svn folder themselves as containing configuration data

63694
int	double
the fraction can be represented by two int or two double or whatnot

63719
openbsd	freebsd
i am using the out of the box dhcp client on freebsd which is derived from openbsd s and based on the isc s dhclient and this is the out of the box behavior

63720
vmware	esx
we recently migrated the back-end server in our largest office -- new york -- from a msc cluster to a new virtual machine hosted on vmware s esx technology

63782
profiler	aqtime
we do unit testing of all logic code using dunit and use the code coverage profiler included in aqtime to check that all paths through the code are executed by the tests

63812
alloca	malloc
it s also not portable it crashes on solaris but some alloca implementations might return an error here or call malloc

63834
pull	push
guide a friend by phone through installing mercurial tortoisehg creating a repository and setting it up for working together using seperate push his and pull mine repositories - after installing it only once on a windows machine i only run gnu linux

63877
ubuntu	debian
there s also the pv command - available in debian ubuntu repostitories which shows you the throughput of your pipes

63906
dmz	was
the issue i had was that the window.open call would only work within the client network and not on a new web server located in their dmz

63916
rss	feed
in particular i m looking for a relatively easy-to-deploy out-of-the-box solution and would prefer not to hack rss feed together or write too much custom code

63951
post	get	rss	feed
get the users to post there and then use the rss feed from it or the xml rpc blogging api to update the joomla installation

63964
hash	md5
even with really really big spaces like md5 128 bits there are still two strings that can generate the same resulting hash

63967
128bit	64bit
moving to 64bit hashes or even 128bit hashes isn t really the solution though it reduces the probability of a collision

63984
hash	md5
the system.security.cryptography namespace contains multiple classes which can do hashing for you such as md5 which will probably hash them better than you could yourself and will take much less effort

64000
stdout	stderr
when launching a process from java both stderr and stdout can block on output if i don t read from the pipes

64085
getter	setter
the global class simply consists of static getter and setter like so

64097
setlocale	strftime
if so you have to use setlocale and strftime

64118
hash	salt
for example if the only time the cc# will be used is when the user is logged in thin online store type scenario then you can encrypt the cc# with the a hash of the user s plain-text password a per-user salt and a dedicated cc# salt

64142
subtract	add
edit fixed definitions of add and subtract for

64145
stdout	stderr
just have two threads one reading from stdout one from stderr

64182
hide	show
have a different control for each data set and show hide the controls

64183
stdout	stderr
set the redirecterrorstream property on processbuilder to send stderr output to stdout

64214
hide	show
now the form show to the user in the case of basic operations is simplified to hide away the entries details the accounts are selected among 5 default by the kind of operation requested by the user intialise account - equity to accout spend assets- expenses earn revenues- assets borrow liabilities- assets pay debt assets- liabilities ... i want the entries created from default values

64218
versioning	upgrade
then upgrade to the newest production versioning of rails and view the latest railscasts.com videos

64253
ant	maven
make ant maven or any other build

64360
kde	kubuntu
when i cut kill text in emacs 22.1.1 in its own window on x in kde on kubuntu i can t paste yank it in any other application

64371
accessor	ivar
if you write your own accessor then you just use the underbar ivar in your implementation and keep the non-underbar method name

64376
getter	setter
so from an api evolution point of view it s usually a good idea to bite the bullet and use getter setter

64378
unix	solaris
bouml runs under unix linux solaris macos x power pc and intel and windows

64412
emacs	kate
from the reference to kate i take it you re on linux or similar and probably using emacs in x one way or another.

64421
disk	ram
if you really want to do server side rendering you may want to separate the web server part and the rendering part onto two computers with each configured optimally for their task renderer has opengl card minimal hd and just enough ram server has lots of fast disk lots of ram backups and no opengl

64422
cpu	processors
next you need to know that the fourth number in these lines is a measure of idle time and thus the fourth number on the cpu line is the total idle time for all processors since boot time

64422
cpu	processors
edit remember that when you calculate your process s cpu utilization you have to take into account 1 the number of threads in your process and 2 the number of processors in the system

64446
hash	md5
if you get a positive you could compare the actual data to make sure it s not a false positive - though this would be extremely rare you could go with a quicker hash algorithm like md5 or crc instead of something like sha which is slower but less likely to collide just so it s quick and then compare the actual data when you get a hit

64469
vb.net	vb6
i have a vb6 program that someone recently helped me convert to vb.net

64504
post	get
it should be enough to get you started but if you wish to start getting into processing binary post you re probably going to have to deal with some mime-type content too

64518
inherited	properties
now glade has automatically set the events properties inherited from gtkwidget of that treeview to some value gdk_pointer_motion_mask | gdk_pointer_motion_hint_mask | gdk_button_press_mask | gdk_button_release_mask

64529
versioning	upgrade
everyone should upgrade to the same versioning of nunit

64570
explode	substr
php s explode function returns an array of strings split on some provided substr

64574
posix	getcwd
php is grounded around the standard c library and posix standard and uses many of the same function names strstr getcwd ldap_open etc

64590
ant	maven
do however use maven or ivy for ant builds to keep track of what versions of external libraries your project uses

64596
subtract	add
subtract the height of the old content node from the current scroll position reseting the browser s scroll to the content node s 0 change the node content then add the new node s height to the scroll position

64600
vb.net	vb6
if you re porting vb to vb.net you should probably go ahead and use the datetime.today property rather than the vb6 compatability code

64604
boost	stl
there is also boost while not a gui library boost is a really great complement to c++ s stl

64605
vbscript	jscript
is it possible to use both jscript and vbscript in the same hta

64605
vbscript	jscript
can i call vbscript functions from jscript and vice-versa

64605
vbscript	jscript
are there any gotchas like the jscript running first and the vbscript running second classic asp pages have this issue

64638
vbscript	jscript
edit the specific gotcha of all jscript being executed first then vbscript is related to how asp processes scripts

64643
cas	opensso	cas	shibboleth	shibboleth	opensso
there are a number of open source cross-domain sso packages such as josso opensso cas shibboleth and others

64644
vim	emacs
i don t think you would want to wait 10 seconds for your text editor to become ready ...if you are going to spend some serious time coding then spend some time and learn to use vim emacs too but i recommend vim

64727
int	double
for value types int double etc. the function receives a copy of the value

64759
tiff	png
ideally i d like to be able to place it like the png tiff or jpg objects with the zend_pdf_image object

64771
innodb	myisam
if it s a myisam table actually this may work with innodb too try issuing a lock table before the delete

64836
punctuation	words
to reduce the chances of inappropriate or offensive words from being generated in english or in the recipientsÃ¢ languages i limited runs of consecutive alpha characters to two with numerals or punctuation characters betwee

64836
punctuation	words
using the just the rules above some offensive words are possible now that some numerals and punctuation are substituted for letters

64844
innodb	myisam
myisam innodb and memory are the main ones

64844
innodb	myisam
at the least the candidate should mention that myisam issues a table-level lock whereas innodb uses row-level locking

64851
integer	unsigned
how would you write in c c++ a macro which tests if an integer type given as a parameter is signed or unsigned

64876
versioning	upgrade
it is worth the upgrade for me for the main reason that i can target different .net versioning 2 3 3.5 from the same ide whereas in the past one versioning of visual studio supported one versioning of .net

i have good experiences with both phpthumb and wideimage

65079
wideimage	phpthumb
wideimage is the more modern php5 approach while phpthumb has much more features

65117
apache	lighttpd
if you require authorization for download of the music files and assuming that you run lighttpd or apache in front of your zope looking at a solution based on x-sendfile is probably the best option

65130
versioning	upgrade
remember that the ssl level is auto negotiated between the server and the client best encryption used first so you don t necessarily need to disable older versioning but you could pop up a message to the user encouraging them to upgrade

65136

if you extends arrayobject or implements arrayaccess then you can do what you want

65212
mouse	keyboard
this applies to keyboard as well as mouse events onclick etc

65423
icomparable	compareto
and then use the compareto method defined by the icomparable interface

65472
bazaar	git
any dvcs bitkeeper git bazaar mercurial etc because being distributed will cut down the load on the central canonical scm server

65510
mouse	keyboard
seems a bit longer than some other methods suggested but i like to do things with the keyboard instead of the mouse

65562
perforce	cvs
- and they ve said that this is the same for all of the companies - when they made the decision to go with perforce it was either that or sourcesafe or cvs - and honestly given those three choices i d go with perforce too

65589
16-bit	64bit
a simple solution is to use a 64bit integer where the lower 16-bit is the first vertex coordinate next 16-bit is the second and so on

65603
public	protected
fxcop will detect public protected methods with no upstream callers

65627
min	max	children	parent
most of the columns are the same for the parent and for the children so i d like to show the first value of the group as the summary rather than the max min or avg

65747
client-side	server-side
admittedly this seems to be a client-side approach to a server-side problem but since it s a nice command line program you should be able to capture its output for use fairly easily

65847
perforce	cvs
what i like about perforce say compared to cvs is that the branch management is must more sophisticated but still reasonably easy and you don t need to bug a central bureaucracy to create branches labels and the like

65856
vmware	esx
vmware esx esxi and virtualcenter are supposed to be able to support http put uploads since version 3.5

65869

i m using the vbo extension for storing vertex normals and color buffers glbindbufferarb

65912
firefox	safari
tested in the latest firefox beta and latest safari

65925
ethernet	wireless
configuring them through scutil is no help because it seems that if the wireless or the buildin ethernet interface is inactive basic network functions don t seem to work

65925
ubuntu	linux
in linux for example ubuntu it is possible to turn off the wireless adapter without turning of the network capabilities

65938
imagemagick	magick++	imagemagick	graphicsmagick	magick++	graphicsmagick
using graphicsmagick or imagemagick along with magick++ you can then use imagick

65962
avr	microcontroller
i m using it to unit test c microcontroller code for avr

66017
client-side	server-side
you can generate the xslt server-side even if the transformation is client-side

66042
many-to-many	one-to-many
my company has lots of schemas which operate on exactly this basis - indeed our object-relational framework creates them automatically to manage many-to-many relationships and sometimes even for one-to-many relationships depending on how we model them

66122
division	modulo
division and modulo are your friends

66147
floating	right-align
for instance how would you detect and show that a left-aligned image floating left of a paragraph of text has suddenly become right-align

66221
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
modern browsers either don t appear to support sslv2 at all google-chrome opera 9.52 firefox or have it disabled by default ie7 ie8

66228
public	protected
if you have constants that are only valid to a particular class or one of its subclasses declare them as either protected or public and place them on the top class in the hierarchy

here s what i do use a strong checksum cryptographic hash or hmac and prepend it to your plaintext before encrypting

66307
int	double
such as int and double export

66356
punctuation	words
there seems to be a catch-22 in that you must tokenize a field with an analyzer in order to strip punctuation and stop words but you can t sort on tokenized fields

66438
switching	screens
i ve noticed that on some devices when i switching from one canvas to another e.g from the main menu to the game the screens momentarily flickers

66455
jtextfield	jpasswordfield
even more important i d like to change it globally so the new behavior applies to jtextfield jpasswordfield jformattedtextfield jtextarea jcombobox jspinner and so on

66494
division	modulo
at a basic level what you want to do is define an array of image names then take the number of days from a given point in time then modulo remainder after division by the number of images and access that index in the array and set the image untested code

66525
yacc	bison
can antlr output c# using stringtemplate or any text i want it to like yacc bison or does it only output to java

66535
awt	swing
keep in mind that the opengl paradigm is quite different from swing awt or the java 2d api

66546
accessor	properties
the exact same properties accessor code pasted into every one of my implementations

66574
imagemagick	mogrify
if you can guarantee the presence of imagemagick you can use their mogrify -flop command

66577
awt	swing
jogl provides full access to the apis in the opengl 2.0 specification as well as nearly all vendor extensions and integrates with the awt and swing widget sets

66602
subclass	abstract-class
obs. do not use a field in an abstract-class that should be initiated in a subclass like david b suggestion

66605
mouse	keyboard	mouse	trackpad
set system preferences keyboard mouse trackpad to use two finger secondary click

66605
mouse	keyboard	mouse	trackpad
set system preferences keyboard mouse trackpad to use two finger screen zoom for magnifying an area in the screen by holding the control key and scrolling up or down

66647
swt	swing
just keep in mind that swing swt and opengl are generally used for entirely different things

66654
qtkit	quicktime
i m trying to convert old quicktime framework code to the 64-bit cocoa-based qtkit on os x which means that i can t drop down to the straight c function calls at any time

66654
qtkit	quicktime
specifically i m trying to find a way to write quicktime vr movies with qtkit as they require some special metadata to set the display controller

66678
decimal	ieee
floats were according to ieee 754 always binary only the new standard ieee 754r defined decimal formats

66680
ilist	ienumerator
alternatively you could write your own implementation of ilist and ienumerator that allows the kind of parallel access you need

66719
post	get
if you can t get it to clip with html or move with the javascript post the simplest demonstration of the problem here for us to debug

66728
collabnet	svn
the svn 1.5 packages available for etch are 1.4 and i really need the cool new merge tracking feature in svn1.5 according to collabnet its as good as clearcase...an interesting statement in oh so many ways

66728
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a test versioning of lenny

66741
folder	directory
it s the same basic concept but supports transactional backups if the update goes wrong in the middle by storing each checkout in a separate folder and symlinking the latest to your www directory

66745
jar	war
each module is packageable as a jar or a war in the case of the web module and thus allows for easier code reuse we could install the module in the maven repository and reuse it in another project

66771
capitalize	capitalization
you may not want to change the capitalization -- different cultures capitalize different words for example in german you capitalize every noun not just proper nouns

66799
put	get
using this method could get painful though you could put it all into a shell script and it doesn t allow you to pass variables in the same way eg won t work

66852
dlsym	dlopen
a standard-ish api is the dlopen dlsym api

66861
post	get
my guess is that one is a straight http get post request the other soap over http s

66873
cvs	rcs	perforce	cvs	perforce	accurev	accurev	rcs	accurev	cvs
i ve used bitkeeper clearcase accurev perforce subversion cvs sccs and rcs and out of all of those bitkeeper was far and above the best

66876
maven	buildr
if you want dependency management for java-like libraries maven is the canonical choice but i personally like buildr a lot better

66930
accessor	properties
one nice thing about this approach is because managed c++ is a .net language you get to expose accessor as properties __property

66937
chown	chmod
another option is that she will do chown nobody and chmod +s on your binary executable and you ll be able to execute it directly

66963
solaris	bsd
chartdirector is available for lots of platforms win linux solaris bsd osx and has an api for lots of languages too perl asp .net java php python ruby c++

66982
post	get
in order to get a good answer for this you ll have to post the code

67048
post	put
it uses a post not a put but the technique is practically identical

67063
getter	setter
but when there s complex calculations or database involved we should use a getter setter

67085
getter	setter
when it gets compiled it turns out to be getter setter functions either way

67093
innodb	myisam
this needs to work with innodb which stores things very differently than myisam

67110
cvs	svn
so all files that aren t checked out would be marked as read only if you are using vss not sure about svn cvs etc

67215
getter	setter
also my instinct like yours is to use getter and setter as a signal that a process may be long-running spawn threads or do some other non-trivial work

67215
getter	setter
also if a setter has non-obvious prerequisites in the class i might use a getter or setter instead since people rarely read documentation on properties and properties are expected to be accessable at all times

67217
getter	setter
forget the getter and setter methods

67217
getter	setter
an interesting thing to mention is that properties are ending up as setter and or getter method s in the assembly

67217
getter	setter
setter and or getter become a property just by a little bit of metadata

67217
getter	setter
so in fact properties setter getter methods

67227
folder	directory
you have the files in your local directory the so called working copy and one in the repository which can be located in another local folder or on another machine usually accessed over the network

67259
pyopengl	pyglet
i mention pyglet instead of pure pyopengl because pyglet handles a lot of ugly opengl stuff transparently with no effort on your part

67275
outputstream	zipinputstream	outputstream	inputstream
if i don t try copying the file into another inputstream via the outputstream mentioned above and just pass the zipinputstream to my 3rd party library the library closes the stream and i can t do anything more like dealing with the remaining files in the stream

67308
division	modulo
you don t do division modulo to get the digits in production code firstly because it s suboptimal your cpu is designed for binary arithmetics not decimal and secondly because it s unintuitive

67312
addition	multiplication
transcendental functions are always much more slower than addition or multiplication and a well-known bottleneck

67378
free	malloc
what i have done to solve this is to override the malloc new free delete operators such that they keep track in a data structure as much as possible about the operation you are performing

67483
jobs	cron
i also have several page watcher scripts running on cron jobs that use regular expressions to check that the website is rendering key pages properly

67547
extjs	mootools
performance-wise they are all pretty close however mootools dojo extjs and prototype all run faster in my environment

67612
width	height
how does one find the coordinates x y height width of every link in a webpage

67622
switching	screens
the flicker is probably caused by the app attempting to draw to the screens while the switching of the canvas is still ongoing

67626
opera	google-chrome
works better with opera and google-chrome though

67640
vim	emacs	vim	bbedit
i m not looking for solutions with vim or emacs nor editors like bbedit that support syntax highlighting but a full fledged ide with

67659
inherited	properties
i think that if within my dbml file i set the isdiscriminator properties of the isroot column then my rootpage class will inherited the page class

67682
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
target browsers ie6 7 8 firefox 2 3 opera safari

67687
textmate	bbedit
textmate is an editor like bbedit but it has the ability to run commands such as compilation debugging refactoring though it will do so via xcode

67700
mp3	flv
most flv audio is encoded in the mp3 format meaning you can extract it directly from the flv container

67700
mp3	flv
i d check out libavcodec which handles flv mp3 nellymoser natively and should let you get to the audio

67714
ssl	https
an https or secure sockets layer ssl certificate is served for a site and is typically signed by a certificate authority ca which is effectively a trusted 3rd party that verifies some basic details about your site and certifies it for use in browsers

67714
submit	submission
strictly speaking if you are submission a form it doesn t matter if the form page itself is not encrypted as long as the submit url goes to an https url

67751
calloc	malloc
if you want to allocate a block and initialize it to 0 use calloc which is like malloc only with initialization an an element size parameter which you set to 1 if you want to emulate malloc

67764
mp3	wav
i ve got a project converting wav files actually asterisk voice mails into mp3 s

67764
mp3	wav
i have a web process written in php to actually convert the files from wav to mp3 on the web server s local file system actually php is just supervising the command-line sox tool via exec

67878
google-chrome	safari
your example works as expected in google-chrome safari windows and ie8

67878
opera	firefox
the text breaks out of the 150px box in firefox 3 and opera 9.5

67937
rss	feed
does anyone know an easy way to import a raw xml rss feed into c#

67952
rss	feed
if you re on .net 3.5 you now got built-in support for syndication feed rss and atom

67995
rss	feed
the best way to grab an rss feed as the requested string would be to use the system.net.httpwebrequest class

68078
textview	imageview
each of these tabs is also a view and in the case of a tab with a graphical indicator and a text label it s almost certainly some other viewgroup maybe a linearlayout but it doesn t matter that contains an imageview and a textview

68186
folder	directory
i usually name the copied directory v1.0 or whatever is appropriate and keep them all in a folder that is the main project name

68199
client-side	server-side
this is generally not a problem for long-running server-side applications but is a serious problem for client-side software and applications run on smaller devices with limited capabilities

68208
postgresql	mysql
i m assuming you re referring to indexing tables on a relational dbms like mysql oracle or postgresql

68225
getter	setter
private variables that are exposed as public getter setter properties and do get serialized deserialized as such through those properties

68253
cvs	rcs
sccs rcs cvs subversion teamware

68253
bazaar	perforce
clearcase perforce and bazaar

68314
pascal	delphi
why because in previous versions of delphi the typed constants were assignable by default to preserve compatibility with older versions where they were always writable delphi 1 up to early pascal

68362
yacc	bison
don t try to use yacc or bison with a context-sensitive grammar they are far to strict to express such concepts easily

68367
vim	emacs
i believe that cscope can be configured to work with vim and emacs although i ve seen people use other editors also

68369
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	svn	cvs	svn
i would recommend a distributed version control system mercurial git bazaar darcs rather than a centralized version control system cvs svn

68387
vim	geany
i usually just use vim but i ve actually found the ide geany quite intuitive with a lot of good features but not really overblown

68400
udp	tcp
dev tcp and dev udp

68511
metaphone	soundex
sounds like you re looking for a phonetic-based algorithms such as soundex nysiis or double metaphone

68548
put	get
this is not as big as what is being done in the real world but it a fun project and i am having a lot of fun doing it and if i can get it quite advance in the next month i will probably put in on sourceforge

68610
firefox	safari
in firefox 2 3 and safari everything work fine but for some reason the text doesn t appear centered in ie 6 or 7

68652
ienumerable	ilist
this is certainly doable by creating a custom ienumerable object with perhaps an integer index but only if you can control all access to your ilist object for locking and maintaining the state of your enumeration

68673
qtkit	quicktime
here s hoping that quicktime x will have a more fully featured qtkit set of apis

68674
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is getting closer but there are still numerous things with linux that will keep the grandmothers of the world from using it

68679
bazaar	git
for the second question well try some good dvcs git mercurial bazaar and see if any can help you

68694
dns	spf
if your email is business critical then you need to get a dedicated server with a white-hat hosting company control over dns to set up your spf senderid record and to register with the hotmail aol and yahoo postmasters for whitelisting and feedback loops

68725
stdout	stderr
it allows to easily verify the stdout and stderr and the exit value of programs

68807
ubuntu	linux
but i teach a first semester linux admin course in which we install configure several distributions and i usually start with ubuntu since it s generally the smoothest and requires minimal tweaking after the install

68821
hide	show
i want to dynamically hide show some of the columns in a nstableview based on the data that is going to be displayed - basically if a column is empty i d like the column to be hidden

68831
post	get
this instructs iis to pass all requests for example_link_list.axd via post and get to the processrequest method of myproject.mytinymce class in myassembly assembly the name of your .dll

68871
mouse	keyboard
you ll also want to get rid of all your built-in events such as onenterframe and you ll want to take a close look at nontrivial mouse interaction such as dragging and keyboard interaction such as detecting whether a key is pressed

68928
x86	mips
depending on the cpu architecture arguments can be passed in registers for example a0 through a3 on mips or by pushing them onto the stack as in the original x86 calling convention

69040
actionscript	mxml
mxmlc an actionscript and mxml compiler to output the final swf file for deployment to flash player

69040
actionscript	mxml
mxml is actually converted to actionscript during the compilation process

69045
django	web2py
i m really new on python but i tried quiet a few specially django and web2py

69080
cpu	processors
it seems that you are referring to x86 processors family that is not built with real-time systems in mind so there is no real guarantee for constant time execution cpu may reorder micro-instructions than there is branch prediction and instruction prefetch queue which is flushed each time when cpu wrongly predicts conditional jumps...

69104
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

69104
cassini	iis
does anyone know how to enable chunked encoding on iis and asp.net development server cassini

69156
min	max
the built-in summary functions for sum min max avg and count all return a number containing the summary data

69304
decoder	encoder
the biggest area i ve run into problems with the xmlencoder decoder solution is if you have a bean that returns an immutable list for one of it s properties - the encoder doesn t handle that situation very well

69335
typedef	struct
the c++ open type dialog not only allows incremental filtering by type but also selecting of definition .h or declaration .cpp and even filtering by element type typedef struct class etc

69474
width	height
note after a bit more thought - you d need to have these covers be linked so clicking on them would take you to where the tab was supposed to which means you could should do this with the anchor element set to display box width and height set as well as the transparent background image

69482
yacc	bison
contrary to other contributors i say you should play with simpler parser generators like yacc and bison first and only when you get burned because you can t do something with that tool should you go on to try to build something with an ll parser like antlr

69516
bazaar	git
git mercurial bazaar darcs

69545
richfaces	icefaces
there is icefaces which provides more semantic support than richfaces .also you can try nitobi suite which also provides similar kinda solution.if you are not satisfied with any of these i suggest try to write your own part extending the sun faces

69581
cvs	svn
this is framed in terms of alternatives to cvs rather than to svn but no matter - it lists several alternatives including other non-distributed ones

69603
vb.net	vb6
we re currently making pdfs this way vb6 app drops a record into sql with filename create date user and final destination and the xls or doc gets moved into a server directory share and the server has a vb.net service that has a filewatcher monitoring that directory

69616
imperative	declarative
for the second and third persons will is declarative while shall is imperative while the first person is the reverse

69714
put	get
i personally use emacs for editing xml but i m willing to put up with the learning curve of the editor for the sheer power it gives me - editing xml is now rather easy and painless for me but it took me a bit to get it to that point

69718
getter	setter
generate getter and setter

69817
redmine	trac
other options here are trac or redmine

69825
put	get	super	extends
the get and put principle use an extends wildcard when you only get values our of a structure use a super wildcard when you only put values into a structure and don t use a wildcard you both get and put

69854
x86	64bit
you can t convert adobe s activex control to 64bit yourself but you can force your application to run in 32bit mode by setting the platform target to x86

69890
google-chrome	firefox
are there any noted differences in appearance rendering of html and xhtml in google-chrome from firefox

69898
google-chrome	safari
google s google-chrome uses the webkit rendering engine which is what safari uses

69935
next	except
the next byte would be similarly processed except the offsets would be 16 and 20 respectively since that byte is 8 bits down

69948
swt	swing
to expand slightly on my answer we were using swt not swing so ymmv

69989
post	get
you d have to add ssl as all methods post get and http auth well except digest hhtp authentication send plaintext

69989
post	get
get is basically just like post it just has a limit on the amount of data you can send which is usually a lot smaller than post and a semantic difference which makes get not a good candidate from that point of view even if technically they both can do it

69995
post	get
in some senses there s no real security difference between get and post requests as they both go across in plaintext in other senses and in practice.

69995
kerberos	ldap
or as suggested by the other posters use a different method entirely like http auth digest auth or some higher level authentication scheme like ad ldap kerberos or shib
